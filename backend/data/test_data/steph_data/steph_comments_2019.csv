Stephen Curry is a good basketball player
This Stephen Curry guy seems like he'll become a superstar in this league someday 
The Warriors lost Stephen Curry and they didn't fall off the earth. The Lakers are basically just Lebron. 
0-7 doesn't mean shit.  it's stephen curry they're gonna close out hard on him
"Bruh, there are 10 seasons in **NBA history** where a guy has averaged 40 points / 100 possessions on &gt; 60% TS with at least a 30% Usage Rate.

Hopefully people not named Stephen Curry remember how to ball again tonight. But if not he has a history with games on February 2nd. 
Steph Curry broke his ankle and Joe Lacob hired a Pastor to bless it. Light Years Ahead.   https://www.si.com/nba/2017/04/10/stephen-curry-book-excerpt-ankle-injury-mark-jackson
I am 30 years younger than Stephen Curry.
"uh this isn’t a rewrite, this is wel noted https://bballbreakdown.com/2017/09/20/whos-more-valuable-stephen-curry-or-kevin-durant/"
Stephen Curry with a 90-inch vertical
"Why would KD do that though?  He currently has Cousins (for one season) along with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. I mean... what is the point for him in this scenario?"
"Hmm, so we were perennial losers until the Lacob &amp; Guber ownership took over. That turnaround couldn't have been due to management doing their due diligence, but really was luck... I guess they found a garden of four-leaf clovers somewhere and never looked back.        6 teams passed on Curry, 10 teams passed on Klay, and 34 teams passed on Draymond (including us), so making the right choice and building the right way is attributed to luck? We could have easily passed on them as well. Where do you draw the line between a matter of chance and actually competent people running a franchise. I could be wrong, but the cap spike benefited all 30 teams and not just us. Why did Kevin Durant choose to sign here? Could it be that we created an organizational culture that aligned with his goals? Nah, it was because of luck that the other teams didn't build their organization to be attractive to free agents, right? We built it all without a top-4 pick which some other teams were able to acquire through *luck* and then squandered the opportunity. Your definition of luck in this case is like saying every time Stephen Curry makes a 3-point shot, it's because of luck. "
" Rudy Gobert is the reigning Defensive Player of the Year and leads the  NBA in win shares (8.9) and FG% while averaging 15 points and 12.8  rebounds. The Jazz have the best record in the league among teams with  no All-Stars.    The Jazz’s defensive rating (points per 100 possessions) is 101.8 with  Rudy Gobert on the floor, 7.7 points under the league average. The only  players in the NBA with an offensive rating that high above the league  average are Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.    There have  been 12 times in the history of the league where a player averaged &gt;14 pts, &gt;12 rebs, &gt;2 blks, and &gt;60 TS%. 10 of those were all stars and the other 2 are Gobert.   Since 1996, only MJ, Mailman, Shaq, Duncan, KG, Dirk, LeBron, CP3, KD,  Steph and Harden have led the league in Win Shares for a season, and all were All Stars.   Gobert leads the league this year .  Some league wide statistical rankings:  Screen Assist points: 1  Def RPM: 1  Def win shares: 1  Def +/-: 1  True shooting%: 1  FG%: 1  Effective FG%: 1  Win Shares: 1  Off Rating: 2  Total Rebounds: 3  Blocks: 3  Def. Rating: 3  Rebounds per game: 5  Rebound %: 5  Off. Win shares: 6  RPM wins: 7  Block %: 7  Box +/-: 7  Total RPM: 11  PER: 14"
Just replace two of the words and one letter and you get Stephen Curry GG
"Reading on how things went down back then, it becomes clear what a catastrophe the NBA would be if agents were allowed to run things:  https://sports.yahoo.com/news/the-story-of-how-stephen-curry-s-agent-and-dad-didn-t-want-the-warriors-to-draft-him-023517645.html    &gt; Somehow, the rebuilding Sacramento Kings were able to convince Austin to let Curry work out. Sacramento owned the fourth pick and worked out Curry, Jonny Flynn, Tyreke Evans, Toney Douglas, Nick Calathes and Patty Mills on June 21, 2009. Austin said he doesn't remember why he let Curry work out for Sacramento."

Daily reminder that Stephen Curry averaged 21 points in the 2016 finals and choked a 3-1 lead. This was the season where he was the unanimous MVP.

stephen curry.
In order:   Lebron James  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo
"Alfonso ""Klay ""Stephen ""Kevin ""Boogie Cousins"" Durant"" Curry"" Thompson"" McKinnie"""
"He is a good rim protector, sure that is more impactful from a team standpoint but Klay literally broke two three point records this season and had a 52 point game. 22/4/2 with all time shooting vs 15/12/2 with DPOY defense is not a landslide either way, you can choose either player and be fine.    I can't say Gobert is better because he is good at blocking shots and getting rebounds.   And lol at Rudy Gobert being top 12. Here are 12 better players, not necessarily in order  1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Wardell Stephen Curry 4. James Harden 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Giannis A. 7. Anthony Davis  8. Paul George 9. Russell Westbrook 10. Joel Embiid  11. Nikola Jokic 12. Kyrie Irving  And I can keep going "
"Not in any particular order, but I’d say: Paul George Lebron James Kevin Durant Stephen Curry  Giannis Antetenkounmpo"
"A star? Can they def can’t get an All Star starter  LeBron James (captain)  Kevin Durant (UFA)  Paul George  Stephen Curry  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo   Kawhi Leonard (UFA)  Joel Embiid  Kyrie Irving (UFA)  Kemba Walker (UFA)  Reserves?   They could get Aldridge, Beal (maybe), Lowry, or an expiring Vucci mane.   Davis isn’t getting equal value at fucking all especially from someone actually playing right now. Their best shot is whatever picks and players Danny decides to acquiesce to. "
"can i do young teams? if so, last years lakers. prime it, lopez , kuzma, and stephen curry with a 40 in vertical."
"[Curry 2016 injury](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/4/25/11502176/stephen-curry-injury-warriors-rockets-game-5-sprained-mcl) right but y'all are the fake doctors exaggerating his injury. It was reported as a grade 1, and that he'd be out a couple weeks. Well this was in the 1st round (game 1 at that) and the finals was 2 months later.  "
The brilliant shooting of Stephen Curry continues!
"Yeah kind weird, but then again Stephen Curry is kind've a Carly Rae Jepsen stan himself."
IMO the most valuable assets considering age and contract right now are:  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. James Harden 3. Stephen Curry 4. LeBron James 5. Joel Embiid 6. Anthony Davis 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Ben Simmons 9. Luka Doncic 10. Karl Anthony-Towns
"I'm from the Kobe generation and when the PS4 launched, I got whatever new NBA game launched around the system launch from redbox (not a big sports/game fan) and my friend picked Golden State and I picked Lakers or some basic shit and I got fuckin stomped on by consistent run up threes. I was like who the fuck this Stephen Curry dude? I had no idea at the time. "
Totally dude. You caught me. I don’t even know what a basketball is man. Like the late mayor lee rip I’m not sure the difference between Stephen Kerr and Steve curry. Are they the same person?
Where does Kobe fit into that though?   * 1960's - Bill Russell &amp; Wilt Chamberlain * 1970's - Kareem Abdul-Jabaar &amp; Kareem * 1980s - Larry &amp; Magic * 1990s - Michael Jordan &amp; Hakeem * 2000s - Tim Duncan &amp; Shaq * 2010s - Lebron James &amp; Stephen Curry 
"Nope, Bucks asked for Monta over Steph because of ankle concerns: https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2815838-stephen-curry-andrew-bogut-trade-killed-by-bucks-in-2012-over-ankle-concerns.amp.html"
Glad to hear that Stephen Curry was able to bring joy to your life. 
"Because he has the best release valves of any superstar in the league.  Steph has a history of [becoming a pure distributor when the flow of the game essentially forces his hand](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/wizards/the-time-stephen-curry-was-held-scoreless/2015/05/29/5ebb8fd2-061e-11e5-93f4-f24d4af7f97d_story.html).  It's true that Steph is smaller, less physical, and therefore more ""stoppable"" than other NBA superstars. But he's also the most willing deferrer of all superstars in the NBA. And his gravity and stamina are so elite that even playing passively he shifts defenses significantly, and his team wins.  Perfect example was the 2015 finals... Cavs essentially doubled Steph on every P&amp;R, and he dished to Andre Iguodala for dozens of open corner 3's. Iguodala plays some stellar defense, puts up a ridiculous differential between regular season &amp; finals output, and the narrative shifts to him becoming finals MVP.  In 2016, same story: Cavs double Steph hard, and this time Harrison Barnes in the corner misses every spoon-fed open 3. Warriors choke the series.  Since KD joined every Steph Curry double team basically turns into an open shot for one of Klay, KD, Durant, or role player X. Steph doesn't overcome good defenses that double team him because... he doesn't have to."
You must actually be dumb if you think former NBA players forget how to shoot.   https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2018/08/08/dell-curry-stephen-curry-three-point-shooting-contest-sc30-select-camp-video/
"Stephen Curry has shot 67 more 3s than Buddy Hield in the last 15 games, only made 20 more than him"
wardell curry is already in the contest  (fun fact: both guys middle names are stephen too)
"Stephen Curry in the last 15 games has played with 4 all star players on his team, making that only 4 more than James Harden has. "
"Yeah dude, a locked in Stephen Curry limited to just 3 shots in the second half because his coach allowed Durant to jack up shots to extend his dumb 20pt streak is not the definition of being held back. You better pray this doesn't happen in the playoffs."
"Heads up, Stephen and Steph Curry are listed separately. Combined, he's at 10.  I looked for him, but that could  be true for other names as well."
1. Stephen Curry 2. Buddy Hield 3. Davis Bertans 4. Joe Harris 5. Danny Green 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Danilo Gallinari 8. Paul George 9. Tobias Harris 10. Klay Thompson 11. Seth Curry 12. Bojan Bogdanovic 13. Bryn Forbes 14. Kyle Korver 15. Marcus Morris  &amp;#x200B;
Daily reminder that Stephen Curry averaged 21 points in the 2016 finals and blew a 3-1 lead. 
You forgot bearded Stephen Curry

We'll have to see what Griffin will bring, but I think he will be an all-star as long as he doesn't get injured again.

Steve Kerr and Stephen Curry are among the luckiest people in NBA history.  Downvote all you want. Tell me players/coaches that were luckier.
"&gt; he took a discount to prove his injury reliability  He didn't though, if he wanted to prove his injury reliability he would have not taken the extension offer and bet on himself to get the max (4year/$58m) that off season vs his actual 4/$44m. If anything he did it because he wanted a safety net. A lot of people though GSW made a risky offer at the time.

"What are the most underrated and the most overrated players of this century? My view:  **Most underrated: Monta Ellis**  He has been under the radar ever since he was drafted in the second round back in the 2005 draft class. Being a guard and coming out of the same draft as players such as Paul, Williams and Felton can be tough when you’re already a lesser known prospect. Starting off his career coming off the bench, Ellis was instantly a crowd favorite. Diving for loose balls, doing all the hustle plays just to get off the bench and show what he can do, Ellis had to play with a chip on his shoulder.  It’s not often that combo guard becomes a successful player in the league. Coaches have a tough time placing them in the lineup. Monta would constantly have to either play point guard or the 2-guard, having to adjust to many guards in different sizes, speeds and defensive abilities. Ellis and coaches finally realized it was best for him to play shooting guard. At 6’3"", Monta has always had to defend bigger guards. While many critics claim he’s a liability on defense, he has proved that he can hang with some of the best guards in the league in by the end of the 00's.  When Ellis was not gambling for steals, he was a good perimeter defender. Holding players like Brandon Roy and Kobe Bryant to bad shooting percentages had earned him recognition from Bryant and arguably the greatest coach of all time, Phil Jackson. Defense could be tough for Ellis because he played numerous amount of minutes. He has been among the league leaders in minutes for most of his career, and he was doing it while running in the fast pace tempo of the Warriors offense. Many people do not see that when they claim Ellis can’t defend.  When Coach Mark Jackson running the Warriors with his committed defensive scheme, Ellis had even more of a chance to showcase that he can play well on both sides of the court. Everyone should already know Ellis’ offensive game was nasty. He is arguably the fastest and quickest player in the league, ball in his hands or not. There is a reason he was once nicknamed “the one man fast break.” Not only did Monta score in transition, but he could score in the low post. Yes, Ellis the undersized shooting guard had developed a post game. He had a few moves and an amazing turnaround jumper that caught defenders off guard. Coach Jackson had utilized Ellis to the best of his abilities and his offensive game was complete.  The playmaking abilities of Ellis vastly improved over the years. When Stephen Curry was out with an ankle injury, Ellis has had to play a lot of point guard position. His vision has gotten much better as a result. A surprising stat is that Ellis is one of the only three players in the league that averaged 20 points and seven assists per game in the 2011-12 season. The other two players? LeBron James and Derrick Rose. Not a bad category of players to be in, and you would think that would get Ellis’ name bigger.  When Ellis now played in more of a half-court offense, he was still one of the best scorers in the league and even made a case for being one of the best passers. Monta Ellis was always underestimated, unrecognized and underrated by the national media. Ellis was a top three shooting guard in the league behind Bryant and Wade for a number of years. It’s time he stops being under the radar and seen as one of the better players in the NBA of this century.  **Most overrated: Ben Wallace**  This guy had no offensive game and his rebounding stats were padded by playing with the worst rebounding teammates in NBA history at times. Put Wallace on the Pacers or Spurs of that time and he'd be lucky to average 8 a game, combine that with his horrible O and you'd have yourself a poor mans P.J Brown. And the Pistons were a big time overachieving team to add to that.   Wallace is overrated. He's not the Rodman-like rebounder his numbers lead you to believe. People, the Pistons were consistently last in the NBA in rebounding, even with Ben. That tells me the rest of the Pistons were God-awful rebounders.  His teammates are such horrible rebounders he has to get all of the boards himself. If there's a loose ball, either he or the other team will get it, not someone like like Jon Barry or Mehmet Okur. Jermaine O'Neal for example had other capable rebounders around him, Brad Miller, Artest, Foster etc., Wallace had nobody, and he had to pick up all of the easy rebounds. If those Pistons had a real center who could rebound, and Wallace was switched to the 4, his numbers would drop dramatically because he would finally have someone else to stay back and get the easy boards.  And yes defense is as important as offense, however other MVP candidates brought it on both ends and Wallace couldn't. Why would Wallace get the MVP nod over someone like Jermaine O'Neal who had MVP-type game at both ends? Sure Wallace was a slightly better rebounder (I guess) and slightly better defender, but O'Neal was unstoppable on offense whereas Wallace was the complete opposite. Pistons simply played hard every night, they had to because of lack of talent on paper, to they catch the other more talented teams, who cruised through the regular season, off guard. I give the Pistons credit for their hard play during the Billups/Hamilton/Prince era, but all of these three were better players than Wallace was in the end.  Wallace was overrated when you look past rebounding. Teams could play 5 vs 4 on defense when he was in, and that's a killer weakness (it was a major reason why Detroit couldn't score in the times when they needed to, and Yugoslavia really exploited it in the WC 2002 when they 'shockingly' knocked USA out 81-78). Also, for all his prowess blocking shots and defending on the interior, he had problems dealing with 4's that could shoot from outside and put the ball on the floor (to the point that Carlisle has been using Cliff Robinson on these types of players in 2002/03 season) - Antoine Walker embarrased him in the playoffs, Shareef dropped 50 on him, and Webber got 30 on 10-15 shooting on him in 2001/02. At best he was a decently valuable player defensively at times, but the MVP talk was always completely insane.  His defense was good in the East. In the West, he got smoked, From the 2002/03 season:  1/25 vs. Spurs Duncan 10/18 22pts 11 boards Wallace 8pts 5 boards  2/27 vs. Lakers Shaq 14/24 35 and 14 Wallace 10 and 8  3/4 vs. rockets Ming 6/10 20 and 8 Wallace 3 and 13  3/12 vs Lakers Shaq 10/18 24 and 13 Wallace 10 and 21  2/21 vs. T'Wolves KG 13/23 34 and 16 Wallace 16 and 12  2/25 vs. Kings C Webb 9/24 19 and 13 Wallace 6 and 19   He was a good defender but his defense is greatly enhanced by being in the East. He got roasted by the elite post players. And he wasn't overrated just because he was a low scorer, a low scorer like Jason Kidd for example greatly improved his team. He took a team, which the year before stunk, and the next year improved the team. He also made the players around him better. I don't know how you could say Wallace did that. He got them second shots, but he wasn't finding people for wide open dunks. I remember the criticism Shaq use to get (and sometimes still does) about only being able to dunk. Well that is all Wallace can do and he can only manage to do it about 3 times a game. And defensively, how did Wallace do against the big men of teams such as Argentina, Yugoslavia or Spain at the 2002 World Championships in Indianapolis? He did not shut anybody up. He did get rebounds, but I he was really overrated as a defender. Don't recall his performance as brilliant on the defensive end.  I think we should distinguish. Being a good rebounder plus being even a good shot blocker does not mean you are a great defender. I would say Nate Thurmond was a great one on one defender long time ago (talking about big guys). Rodman could shut someone up (and he could rebound too, though not much of a shot blocker). Wallace? Not a bad guy to have around on your average team, but, to me, he was an overrated defender. People were touting him as the MVP, and he wasn't at that level in reality. Then wouldn't he be overrated? Clearly yes.   My belief is based on respect for an all around sort of game, and the belief that Wallace is one sided makes him not one of the game great. Seriously, consider what Tim Duncan did until the end of his career. He was putting up near as many boards a night as Wallace, and scoring 15 points more. How could have Wallace been considered MVP material over a guy like this? Besides, at times he didn't even get to guard the best players defensively. In order to be the master of D you must be stellar at helpside defense and on the ball defense! What's a better asset? Slowing down Duncan or Shaq or swatting a couple of their shots? IMO you are not an MVP canidate or all-NBA type if the other team does not have to check you. You are not a super defender if you can not defend the best at your position. Wallace was ok but still not MVP material. Since when did 15 RBG get you MVP talk? I don't recall Dennis Rodman or Jayson Williams ever getting any MVP hype. Is it because of Ben's 3 BPG? Does a couple more blocks really turn a guy from a solid role player (Rodman and Williams) into an MVP? And Jayson had much better O than Ben, and as sad as it is to say, Rodman probably had a better offensive game, too. Also, what about Dikembe Mutumbo during his Nuggets days? I recall a few 12 rebound, 4 block, 13+ point seasons for him, he never got any MVP hype, just a lot of DPotY awards.  Why do you people like Ben Wallace? Do you not see how evil this man is? He goes around acting like he is above the Lord. He uses experimental gases on his own people. I've seen pictures of young children and women lying in the streets dead, hideous marks covering their bodies, all where Ben Wallace had these toxic chemicals used on them. This man is evil and he MUST be stopped. Please, stop him now before it is too late. Please."

"Absolutely, Exum is going to be the next Penny Hardaway. Thabo will win DPOY. Ricky is basically Spanish Stephen Curry.      Tatum is only 12 years old, Browns only notable feature is his flat top. Lonzo is just trash and Kuzma wears fur coats."
"I hope one day we get a realistic enough simulation that allows us to set up a season any way we want with any players from history and watch an 82 game season in graphics indiscernible from real life. I'd cream my pants to the highlights from a...  - LeBron James - Dwyane Wade - Michael Jordan - Blake Griffin - DeAndre Jordan   line up.. the highlights, especially transition would be ridiculous.   i'd also make this a team  - Ben Simmons - Kevin Durant  - Giannis Antetokounmpo - Anthony Davis - Rudy Gobert  just for the crazy height and wingspan.  then this lineup for the shooting  - Steve Nash - Stephen Curry - Klay Thompson - Larry Bird - Dirk Nowitzki  the defense would be shit but they'd be shooting the shit out of the ball."
"There are 9 players in the league who have put up at least 20/5/5 with 1 steal.  The other 8 are James Harden, Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, DeMar DeRozan, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Nikola Jokic.  Luka not only puts up those numbers, but he has done it in less minutes per game than everyone on that list except for Jokic. Plus, I would argue that every single one of these players is on what is most likely going to be a playoff team except for Doncic.

Why isn’t Stephen Curry in the Hall of Fame? I heard he was good.
"Curry, Wardell Stephen"
"Let's see. You can't stop curry from hitting 3's, thats domination. You can't stop harden from hitting step-backs, that's domination. You can't stop Lebron from hitting and-one's, that's domination.   I could say Anthony Davis is the most unstoppable player in the world because you can't shoot a soft layup without him sending it into the seats, and you can't stop him from scoring basically anywhere on the court.   However, i could simultaneously agree that Stephen curry's 3-point shooting is more conducive to winning. He draws so much attention off ball that it makes his teammates better. That's not necessarily MORE domination, but it would lead me to believe he's the better player."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/celtics-kyrie-irving-says-warriors-got-lucky-in-win-over-boston-stephen-curry-disagrees/amp/
"If you were to have an all time draft of players in their prime, Michael Jordan shouldn’t be your first pick because the difference between him and second best shooting guard of all time (Kobe) is marginal. They are pretty much carbon copies of each other with Jordan getting a slight edge.   Using this logic, you should pick a player who is above and beyond better than the next best option. I believe that at the SG, PF and SF position from 1-5 you could interchange players and wouldn’t see that much of a difference in talent/ production.   At PG and C is where you see a gap between the best players and THE BEST player.   A few come to mind:  Stephen Curry: there has never been a point guard whose been as lethal as him. He’s a threat the moment he crosses the half court. And the value of hitting threes surpasses any player who can score layups, dunks, free throws and mid range. You can score as many points as you want on him but 3&gt;2 and that will add up to a 25+ point differential.   Tho, you could argue Magic here because versatility is so important. In Magic you got a 6’9 point guard who can defend and PLAY every position. No other PG can really make that claim IMO. Plus his name is freakin Magic Johnson. MAGIC. JOHNSON.   Wilt Chamberlain: if you don’t see why he could dominate now and then, you don’t understand how incredible Wilt was. The guy was a track and field star at Kentucky and a Harlem Globetrotter. He AVERAGED 50 points a game. And yah “the talent wasn’t great, he was the tallest player” argument is valid but if you believe that Wilt didn’t have the athleticism and guile to make it in the faster league, you need to watch some archive video of him. Dude was a gazelle at 7 feet.   Hakeem also gets a nod here because he’s quick enough to guard the perimeter and the Dream Shake was a work of art. "

"Um no.   http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23526364/houston-rockets-target-stephen-curry-defense-evening-western-conference-finals  This was games 1 and 2. They were targeting him even more after Andre iguadala went down.   Also I wouldn’t necessarily say curry struggled, the rockets switching everything took a lot out of themselves as well, and ultimately is why curry had better splits than any of the rockets shooters. "
Top 10 scorers are elite. I'm saying his efficiency was above average for the average nba possession.  Also of course Curry's TS% is higher than hardens eFG? Harden is leading the league in free throws while shatter an nba record in unassisted threes. He has do do everything for the rockets.  News flash Stephen Curry is more efficient than Harden when you take away a third of his game and force him to average 44 for the year.

I think than Stephen Wardell will let Seth Curry win to get his first accolade in nba
it's almost as if Stephen Curry has 10 more years of experience as well as his prime...
but people told me trae was curry 2.0..  they also told me lonzo was STEPHEN CURRY WITH A 40 INCH VERTICAL!!!!!!!!
Reminder that Stephen Curry averaged 21 points in 2015-16 Finals. Probably the worst choke job from a star player in NBA history?   
"Relax guy, I’m well aware of the KD hate, I’m a Warriors fan and even I catch myself hating sometimes. I asked the question with regard to Stephen Curry.   This post was simply to inquire if there were things about Curry that I might overlook as a Warriors fan.  I’m aware of how much praise he gets. ESPN and their formulaic sports reporting can be thanked for that. "

Brook Lopez  DeMarcus Cousins  Klay Thompson  Stephen Curry  3 pt contest? No. Splash off.
Even Steph had to joke when his son was born that all he could be thinking is that God bless him with a hairline better than his dad's.  I love Stephen Curry.
"There was a similar thread just yesterday about this while led me to rabbit hole of a research and I'll repost my finding about it on here.  You can condense the entire history of the NBA Finals into 16 players, with Curry instead of LeBron for a chance to expand it into the future:  Max Zaslofsky, Chick Reiser, George Mikan, Bill Russell, Rick Barry, Jerry West, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Paul Silas, Mike Dunleavy Sr., Hakeem Olajuwon, Dennis Rodman, Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Udonis Haslem, Stephen Curry.  I could see it reducing it to 15 if I make Rodman more useful by finding a way to eliminate Jordan. Aside from that, Chick Reiser is the least important factor here with only one game, chose his name over other gems of that year such as Jack Rocker and Dick Schulz. Overall I think it could be shortened down to even 14 or fewer if we got down to analyzing every player to ever be in the Finals."

"So do I. Whatever a player thinks or feels,I would love to hear instead of the generic media interview. Just let it out as long as you don't throw your teammates under the bus.  This sub is amazing though. When Curry got mic'd up talking to Budenholzer at the all-star game people were saying ''they should have stopped airing this'' since he was talking freely and actually telling inside stories. But people love the gossip but when it comes from an actual source (Stephen Curry for crying out loud) they don't want to hear it. But when it's some memeable quote from some twitter journalist we're all on it and spreading rumors. "
Wardell Stephen Curry II 
Tim Duncan? Stephen Curry? Kevin Durant?
"No you’re right, brogdan is clearly a superior shooter than Stephen curry. when you’re down 2 you want him taking the contested go ahead 3 over Steph!"
Nike is making a ton of money so they know what their doing but they also make mistakes. [Just ask Steph](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15047018/how-nike-lost-stephen-curry-armour)
"I feel like one day 4 years from now, someone will make a post here like:  *[Serious] Why the fuck do NBA fans appreciate Brian Scalabrine?*  *For reference, I first got into the NBA because of Stephen Curry. I see so many posts sharing the advanced stats of Brian Scalabrine. My question is: why? Literally nothing is impressive about his stats. Can someone share? Is he one of those ""stats don't tell the whole story"" players? Thanks.*"
Stephen Curry is better than your favorite player.  Kobe got carried by Pau Gasol and then took all the credit 
"Always a fun discussion, i always enjoy listening to their reasoning and inputs. Above all i recommend listening since they go into the major awards and go over the several players considered and why they chose a specific one. (The MVP discussion, top 3 in that award, why they chose certain players over others in the All NBA teams and who was cut, DPOY, COTY, 6MOTY, ROTY... with the many considerations for those.)  But here's something to get going if you don't want listen to it:  1st Team All NBA:  * Stephen Curry * James Harden * Paul George (Danny) / Kevin Durant (Nate) [Danny's MVP Pick] * Giannis Antetokounmpo [Nate's MVP pick] * Joel Embiid  2nd:  * Damian Lillard * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Durant (Nate) / Paul George (Danny) * Kawhi Leonard * Nikola Jokic  3rd:  * Kemba Walker  * Jrue Holiday * Lebron James  * Blake Griffin * Anthony Davis"
"So here’s a reworked suggested best possible working cohesive team of all time. If you’ve got a team that could beat them feel free to add your reasoning.  PG: 06/07 Steve Nash - ideal game: 10+ pts, 10+ ast, 2+ 3pt SG: 15/16 Stephen Curry - ideal game: 20+ pts, 5+ ast, 3+ 3pt SF: 89/90 Michael Jordan - ideal game: 20+ pts. 5+ast, 5+ rebs PF: 02/03 Dirk Nowitzki - ideal game: 15+ pts, 10+ rebs, 1+ 3pt C: 61/62 Wilt Chamberlain - ideal game: 25+ pts, 15+ rebs, 3+ blk  For PG - Steve Nash over Stockton because Nash was the most precise PG shooter you’ll ever see. Deadly at FTs, 3pts, while still being a killer assister. Was not as willing of a scorer like Magic or Big O, and can let you build the team around someone else.  For SG - Steph Curry, because it feels safe posting a combo guard who is a killer shooter out there. In my view even a better pick than The Logo Jerry West whose true 3pt shooting prowess will sadly never be known. In my view his peak season was more efficient than Kobe’s 05/06, but we’ll have yet to see if James Harden can surpass him as an even more killer of a scorer this season. As a primarily more of a PG he’s not a selfish player, and obviously notches above Klay Thompson either way.  For SF - Michael Jordan, I mean you gotta get him in there and build the team around him. At SF, like he played for Wizards, because it feels better to build the team around the SF with a supporting SG rather than an SF whose role is not as specified in general. But obviously the Chicago Mike. 89/90 MJ was a better assister/rebounder, but he was draining them threes a season later. A pick over LeBron James, Durant, Bird, Baylor because of fucking course you wouldn’t miss a chance to build around the GOAT winger rather than just the generational best players.  For PF - Dirk Nowitzki, when it comes to pure PFs I’d take him over Duncan, Barkley, Hayes, Rodman and Garnett, simply because having your PF draining those threes while still having similar stats to all of them is priceless. Now compared to other PF-eligible players like LeBron, Moses Malone, Bird and Durant, the conversation gets tougher, but those would be too much scoring and star power for this team to ideally smoothly work.  For C - Gimme Wilt, with Kareem in the closest second place of this entire team. Don’t know which would work better in real life, both killer scorers, rebounders, with Wilt was great assister later in the career, but honestly I’m okay with either of the two. For personal reasons I wish to be on team Kareem, but I gotta be objective. Honorable mentions to Moses Malone and Bill Russell, but they obviously ain’t topping those two. Can’t see either of them playing as PFs so I guess you’d have to choose between them.  Bench: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, John Stockton, LeBron James, Moses Malone, Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant, James Harden.  Feel free to completely shatter any of my theories if you’ve got points to disagree with. "
Stephen Jackson was always a dumbass. https://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/310120/news_lebron-james-check-my-stats-1.jpg  Kawhi or Giannis would def be most humble. I'd put Curry up there as well but he grew up rich and can be a little cocky on the court.

"&gt;Btw - Hawks 22-43. Thats all I need to say.   That's all you need to say? Because... a rebuilding team's record reflects on the future potential of their rookie star?  You know about ten years ago there was another team that drafted a small guard in the top 10. There were real doubts about his ability to compete at the NBA level, would he be fast enough, strong enough, big enough. That team went 32-50 that season. Maybe someone talking about that rookie would have said, ""that's all I need to say.""   That team was the Warriors of course and that small guard was Stephen Curry.   Let's be real, you're take on Young might have flown a couple months ago but the dude is legit and you've got to change your take. He's been cooking on the floor, back to back 36 point nights against Houston and Minnesota, then 49 against Chicago.   He's a future star player. "

"[Marcus Thompson's book had some tidbits about it](https://www.eurweb.com/2017/04/new-book-claims-lebron-james-other-nba-stars-hate-stephen-curry/).  &gt; “There’s a thing with he and LeBron that’s a little weird. There was a time when LeBron and Steph were big brother and little brother and LeBron was like a mentor.  &gt; “He was a big fan of Steph, went to games at Davison, and even when [Curry] got to the NBA, they had moments where LeBron was looking at him like, ‘wow’ and then Steph kind of challenged LeBron’s status. The part that’s odd for Steph – why does that mean there has to be beef between us? He loves LeBron and respects LeBron, and he’s like, ‘because the outside world is pitting us together, why do you and I have to now have this disdain between us, I thought we were cool? … that’s the question that’s in Curry’s mind and Curry’s camp. Why do you not like me when all I did was basically respect everything you did, and follow the model you carried out? … it’s not just with LeBron … Steph wants to be accepted by all these guys. this is what he worked for. For [them] to say, ‘you’re one of us.’ It seems like they don’t want to give that to him.”  &gt; “Everybody on the Clippers … Chris Paul was one of those guys. Chris Paul was somebody [Curry] looked up to. Chris Paul used to dominate that matchup. Chris Paul was supposed to be next in line to win a championship. Then, suddenly, it was Steph … that’s another relationship where [Curry] was like, ‘oh, I look up to you,’ and suddenly there is this disdain vs Steph. There’s a lot of those …”"
Umm did Stephen Curry just die?
"Yes I have. Its just for me its hard to value smaller guards when compared to wing players. Kerr also mentioned this when he said players like kd lebron and kawhi are more impactful.  Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins.""  Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer.  ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game.""  The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible.  ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said.  ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill.  ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league.  ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."""

Stephen Curry is the Warriors  I hope to see [geriatric](https://i.redd.it/hmlcz07femj21.jpg) Stephen Curry rocking the Warriors jersey until he retires. 
"That is revisionist history lol. [Read this article.](http://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/stephen-curry-scouting-report-davidson-2009-nba-draft-warriors/odgsfr1n0zs517flvxfb3lg5m) And if you don't want to read it I will quote the best part:   &gt;That complicated matters when it came to the draft. Ricky Rubio was more of an unknown, but he was regarded as one of the purest point guards in recent memory from NBADraft.net. Jonny Flynn had his own faults, too, but he was an explosive guard with the ability to get to the basket at will. Together, ESPN's Chad Ford said Rubio and Flynn were the best point guards in the class.   Obviously the next line is:   &gt;although the Timberwolves drafting them both was a head-scratcher from the start.   And I won't ignore that. But it wasn't really a head scratcher. Rubio was still under contract in Spain, and wasn't going to come over for 2 years. So Flynn was the next best point guard available, so we took him for the meantime. "
They didn't have any personnel to stop Stephen Curry either. If you had told anyone JR Smith will be the Cavs best wing defender and help negate some of Curry's insane offensive ability then you'd have been laughed out the room.   The facts are that the Warriors were a better offense and defense than either of these teams *and* more experienced at that level.   
You're forgetting passing up on a certain PG named  Stephen Curry ....... Twice !!!

"&gt; Notice how the Bucks were leaving Rondo wide open? Any other coach makes a line-up change after the 3rd brick.  [Rondo is shooting .373](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rondora01.html) this season from 3. If he's getting wide-open looks, that's a good thing.  Stephen Curry miss 3 3-pointers in a row all the time. Changing your gameplan because of 3 bricks would be bad coaching.  Leaving sacrificing 3-pt defense for paint defense is part of the Bucks' defensive gameplan in general: Since they have great fast-break players, the rebounds off of 3s are more likely to result in high-percentage possessions for them.  That makes the Bucks a crappy matchup for the Lakers, who have virtually no 3-pt shooters to take advantage.  Rondo, who's one of the least-shitty 3-pt shooters on the Lakers (lol), getting those shots is a good things for the Lakers."

Not sure why you're saying we would have made multiple WCF... if you're saying he would have picked someone besides Thabeet had he known Marc would be good, that's somewhat irrelevant.  It's basically considered a fact in Memphis that Wallace *wanted very badly to draft Stephen Curry* with the no.2 pick, a minor, but he was overruled by the owner, who was enamored with Thabeet.

Paul George Kyrie Irving Zach Lavine Stephen Curry Domantas Sabonis 
"Yes, so would Stephen Curry with a 40 inch vertical"
"&gt;Cmon guys what happened to evaluating players based on watching games and then making a personal decision on who was the better player based off eye test  Because like 90% of this sub has trash eyetest, and that's a pretty generous estimate. Shitton of GMs keep drafting busts, making dumb trades and overpaying wrong guys, and tons of coaches have terrible rotations and keep giving bare minimum minutes to some guys who later proceed to turn into really solid guys when they switch teams... Those are people that have been involved in basketball their whole life and are paid big-ass $$$ to watch and analyze games, yet they often fail miserably... What makes you think that /r/nba's flawed eyetest that's heavily biased toward highlight plays and athleticism (especially athletic young players) is any better?  I think that advanced stats generally do a good job at taking the bias away (even if some have a flavor to them) as long as you have at least a rough idea of how they're calculated. Like sure, having high OWS/48 means you're pretty good on offense, but do you think Rudy Gobert has been a better offensive player this season than say Nikola Jokic, Paul George or Kyrie Irving, and just slightly worse than Stephen Curry? Big part of it is that (even if it actually has a multiplier that can favor volume over efficiency), it still loves players that have great PPP numbers. This is a great example of why you should always be aware of context and the math behind the stat.  That of course doesn't mean that OWS is a flawed stat because it 'likes' Rudy. This is the most efficient player in the league, so even if he ain't the guy that will run your offense and give you 20+ PPG consistently, he'll give you the most efficient 15PPG in the league and that has to count for something.  Ideally you'd wanna use advanced stats to check your eyetest, and if they are telling you that you're wrong, than you might wanna try and look for flaws or strengths in player's game that you haven't noticed til that point... Or to look for certain trends in player development, or to find some interesting 2/3 man lineups and shit like that... the issue is that people keep misinterpreting them intentionally (or refusing to learn more about them) in order to support their biases by nitpicking... and when they can't do it, then they just say that numbers are lying because they watched Space Jam so they know their shit."
"Also, since I know this will be brought up, **Stephen Curry is 114th All-Time with 15,851 points.** Surprised me to that he wasn't up here given he is 30 years old. "
"He played good defense. Not great but good. Also, he averaged 11 assists per game. People forget that he was in contention for an all-defense team that year.   He got more all-NBA defensive votes than Tim Duncan, San Antonio, 33 (5); Ricky Rubio, Minnesota, 30 (6); Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Detroit, 27 (3); Anthony Davis, New Orleans, 24 (3); Andre Drummond, Detroit, 14 (5); Serge Ibaka, Oklahoma City, 14 (1); Stephen Curry, Golden State, 13 (3); Andre Iguodala, Golden State, 13 (3); Patrick Beverley, Houston, 11 (1); Al Horford, Atlanta, 7 (1); Marcus Smart, Boston, 7 (2); John Wall, Washington, 6; Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee, 3; Trevor Ariza, Houston, 3; Kent Bazemore, Atlanta, 3; Andrew Bogut, Golden State, 3 (1); DeMarcus Cousins, Sacramento, 3 (1); Nicolas Batum, Charlotte, 2; Victor Oladipo, Orlando, 2 (1); LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio, 1; Harrison Barnes, Golden State, 1; Bismack Biyombo, Toronto, 1; Mike Conley, Memphis, 1; Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City, 1; Derrick Favors, Utah, 1; George Hill, Indiana, 1; Wesley Matthews, Dallas, 1; Luc Mbah a Moute, Los Angeles Clippers; Kristaps Porzingis, New York, 1; Andre Roberson, Oklahoma City, 1; Mike Scott, Atlanta, 1; Dwyane Wade, Miami, 1.  Those are some pretty great defenders on this list.  The only players that got more votes than him and that didn't make the list were Rudy Gobert, Utah, 64 (17); Klay Thompson, Golden State, 49 (16); Jae Crowder, Boston, 47 (3); LeBron James, Cleveland, 43 (5); Kyle Lowry, Toronto, 43 (9); Danny Green, San Antonio, 39 (9).  I'm comparing Lonzo and Westbrook. I'm merely saying that you'd switch sides the second we're talking about Lonzo. Your stance on the topic would immediately fall in line with mine."

"Great post. I'm sure you could have worded the title differently and people wouldn't have taken it so personally. They seem to be assuming that the title is asking, ""Is Stephen Curry the _Best_ 3PT Shooter of All-Time?"""
One day someone will have to explain the Jamal Murray thing to me . Is it because Zach Lowe compared him to Stephen Curry that one time
1. Stephen Curry  2. Russell Westbrook  3. Damian Lillard  4. Kyrie Irving  5. Kemba Walker
Not sure how is argument for number 2 actually will stack up when we’re removed from this era.  Against his contemporaries:  * 1-2 against Tim Duncan * 1-2 against Kevin Durant * 1-3 against Stephen Curry * 0-1 against Dirk Nowitzki   Less championships than Duncan and most likely Curry. 
"&gt; Harden's game is more versatile and he would be just as deadly 20 years ago.  I disagree, he would get less whistles. A lot of his efficiency is going to the line a ton, and a lot of those trips are, or at least have been, throwing himself/his arms into defenders. Those calls didn't exist 20 years ago to the extent they do now with the changes to the rules to encourage a more free-flowing game. Harden's game is just as much a product of the era as Stephen Curry.  Reggie Miller is an all time great and Dell Curry a formidable player in his own right, it's not like there were no pure shooters in the league before Steph. He just took it to another level."

"It's now where you draft at,  it is how you develop your talent.    Examples:  Kawaii Leonard was projected as a end-of-rotation Bruce Bowen 2.0 type, but the Spurs paired him with a great shooting coach in Chip Engellund and a regiment designed to expand his game over a few years, and he wound up being a top 5 player  Stephen Curry was an undersized shooting guard, that was thought to be not athletic enough to be an all star.  Bruce Fraser worked with him on a set of innovative drills and technologies that helped make him a 2x MVP  &amp;#x200B;  Giannis Antetokoumpo was a 6'9"" pixie stick with citizenship issues that few had heard of noone projected as an MVP candidate.  Jason Kidd was integral to developing both his skillset and mentality .  &amp;#x200B;  Conversely,  Teams like the Suns, Knicks, and the Magic have drafted at or  near the top of the draft  for years, and relevancy isn't on the horizon for any of them.  &amp;#x200B;"

"That's a big hit on LeBron, IMO. He's developed the ""clutch gene"" very well, but since his Miami days there's been too much discontent from his teammates about his self-centred playstyle, drama, and lack of defense.   I think the best example of inconsistent leadership from LeBron would be forcing Cavs to pay JR heavy money, and then abandoning JR after his Finals blunder. Either you back yoyr brother 100% of the way, or you don't. LeBron probably wants to appear as the big brother figure, but doesn't care/have the personality to carry it out.  In a strange sense, he's the antithesis of the two guys who've beat him several times in the Finals: Stephen Curry and Tim Duncan. Curry and Duncan inspire dying loyalty from their teammates, but LeBron only seems to have loyalty from select friends, like DWade. Maybe it's a sign that part of the reason Duncan and Curry were able to defeat LeBron was that their teams have a better sense of togetherness which stems from their leader.  This is excluding the 2018 and 2007 Finals, in which case there was a noticeable talent disparity between the two teams."

You mean Stephen curry with a 40’ vertical 
"not really. as an example, if you had 1 guy who scored 100% of the time, why have 4 other guys who can score 100% of the time as well, rather than 4 who dominate on defense and can play a nice role on offense. i know that’s an exaggeration, but it’s the main point i’m making.  In essence, i’d rather have demarcus cousins shoot a 3 than stephen curry, id rather have demarcus cousins score a 2 than thompson score a 3.."
Kevin Durant Stephen Curry Klay Thompson Demarcus cousins Draymond green  Just in case you forgot.  You said someone would be a tough out for that team?
Stephen Curry airballed a 3 and they don't show the replay. Weird.
I don't think anybody forgot about fucking Stephen curry my dude
it does not. i repeat. it does not hurt the Warriors in ANY way signing draymond to a max. saving money on him doesnt make them able to sign anyone with that money. might as well give him the max. he is as integral to this dynasty as stephen curry is. 
"Paul George- My MVP  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Second for MVP imo, but Paul is the clear favorite  Kevin Durant- even though I hate his guts, he’s been pretty good this year  James Harden- dudes been lighting it up offensively, while it’s impressive there’s more to basketball than the PPG stat  Stephen Curry- same old Steph  LeBron James- would be higher if he didn’t get hurt for a month or so, and the Lakers were in a better position to make playoffs (even though they’re just a few games out)  Kawhi Leonard- even though him and the Raptors seem to be on the same page, and letting him sit every few games, he’s had an incredible impact on the court, and even with the possibility of him leaving in the offseason it doesn’t seem to effect the Raptors. (I’m also a Raptors fan so might be a little biased)  Nikola Jokic- the man is winning games and has (shockingly imo) led them to the 2nd SEED in the WEST. That’s impressive  Joel Embiid- even though this year he’s been a little banged up, and has missed some time this year, averaging 27 PPG and 13 RPG is pretty good.  Damian Lillard- even with CJ McCollum seemingly regressing this year, Lillard has somehow managed to get them to the 4th SEED in the WEST. Pretty much all my himself. That’s pretty good, imo he is top 5 in MVP, but won’t get it.  What y’all think?"

"According to Game of Zones we’re actually the Targaryens, led by Wardell Stephen Curry of House Golden State, Fucker of the Great Blue Sky, Baby Faced Assassin, Sinker of 3s and Brother of Splashes."
"But they do often win.   Michael Jordan*   Karl Malone   Shaquille O'Neal*   Allen Iverson*   Tim Duncan x2   Kevin Garnett   Steve Nash* x2   Dirk Nowitzki*   Kobe Bryant*   LeBron James* x4   Derrick Rose*   Kevin Durant*   Stephen Curry* x2   Russell Westbrook*   James Harden*    Those are the winners of MVP in the last 20 years. Out of all of those, only 3 (karl malone, kevin garnett, and tim duncan) defense was a significant contribution to their argument. The idea that MVP is not about offensive production is just wrong, when you look at the asterisked seasons."

"No, you simply don't understand what you are actually asking for. You are thinking ""ah, this side is physically larger than the other one, so it isn't fair"", but there is a sneaky problem with that:   Lets say you are making a map of a square state. The map should be square as well to make it 1:1, right?  e.g. 0-100 miles on the x, 0-100 miles on the y axis.   It's simple to see what the correct ratios for producing those plots are because we are comparing distance with distance, but that goes away once we use other units.  Well now lets say you make a physically square chart with ""TS%"" and ""points scored"". What should the range be here for it to be ""accurate"" 50-70 TS% to 20-40 points? 0-70 TS% to 30-40 points? 40-55 TS% to 10-150 points?   All of those can be fit into a physically square chart, but none are more correct than the other because there is no 1:1 conversion between TS% and points. They aren't the same units. So that means I can stretch and pull the chart in any way to make Harden or Curry look more like an outlier and still make the chart physically square. Physically making the chart square as we see it on the monitor is just covering up the real issue that 1 TS% != 1 point.    You see what I mean?  There are some potential solutions however. One fairish and simple way to do it is to rescale each value by the mean and standard deviation of the data. I did that here if you want. Then since each axis is ""Standard deviations away from the norm"" we can compare them 1:1 like people want to:  if you absolutely must compare Harden and Curry we can make up some metric that at least makes some semblance of sense by normalizing the values to the mean and std of the distributions:  Points per 70 possessions has a mean of 14.3 and a standard deviation of 4.1.   Adjusted TS% has a mean of 53.28% and a standard deviation of 4.86%  ---  Harden in 2019 has a pp70 of 34.1 and an adjTS% of 62.4%. So that means Hardens ppg is 4.83 standard deviations above the mean and his adjustedTS% is 1.88 stddev above the mean.     Curry in 2019 has a pp70 of 29.2 and a adjTS% of 67.6%. So that means Curry's ppg is 3.63 standard deviations above the mean and his adjustedTS% is 2.95 stddev above the mean.    Doing that for every player we get this plot which can be considered ""square"".

"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Giannis, Anthony Davis....  Which one of these players was Westbrook supposed to be better than that season?  Just because u put more numbers on a box score doesn't make u a Top 5 player."
are you fucking kidding me? midair switch into a reverse layup? Good lord stephen curry. 
"I’m not sure if I’m interpreting your second paragraph correctly so correct me if I’m wrong. But I’m not arguing Durant is more important or valuable to the team. In fact I’m arguing the opposite. Curry is the biggest determinant on whether the Warriors do well. Durant having a great game (which I hope we can agree means him scoring and helping on defense) is helpful, but he can still have a bad game and the Warriors can compensate easily. Curry having a bad game (not getting everyone involved, spacing the court etc) has a more negative effect on the Warriors’ success, just as him having a good game has a more positive effect on their success. But that is all in the conversation about value, not necessarily to talent.   MVP‘s are accolades of value. The most valuable player gets the MVP.   Titles are team awards. I’m sure we can agree that in 2015, LeBron was the best player in the NBA. But he lost to Golden State. That doesn’t mean that in 2015, the best player wasn’t LeBron. It means that even though LeBron was that good, the Cavaliers weren’t as good as the Warriors. The same goes for the 2016 WCF: the better team won. And again with teams being better when a player is on court, I attribute that more to their value than their talent.   I’m gonna switch sports for a second and I apologize if football isn’t a sport you follow so the reference is lost on you. Tom Brady was not the best quarterback in 2019. There were many QBs that were more talented than he. But Tom Brady had a role in the Patriots system. And he filled that role very well, and the Patriots won the Super Bowl. Not because Brady was the best, but because he filled the most important role on the team and performed in a way that let the system do it’s job.   In my view, talking about who is the better player is looking at the player as an individual. That doesn’t mean ignore things that have to do with other players, like passing and screen-setting, it just means that you deal with the product of a player rather than the result that comes when that player is in a system. When I’m talking about a player’s value, I’m talking about their relevance in a system that is built for them. I’m sure we agree that Golden State is Stephen Curry’s team. The Warriors run through Steph. That’s because the system was built around Steph and Steph fills the role perfectly.   But removing systems and teammates and all the other outside stuff and looking at the individual player, I see Durant as the more talented player. He can do more.   And I 100% agree with you that Curry is greater than Durant. Curry’s legacy is way above Durant’s and it’s not even close. "

"Don't know why you're being downvoted. He did.   [He flat out said he wasn't going to play with Steph before Steph even played a single game, and even more damning](http://blogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami/2009/09/28/monta-ellis-on-pairing-with-stephen-curry-we-cant-not-going-to-win-that-way/), as chronicled in ""Golden: The Miraculous Rise of Steph Curry"" (great read by the way), Steph would reach out for a high five when he replaced Monta off the bench but Monta would just shrug it off and ignore him. He was really hostile to Steph."
"This is extremely classy of Curry. In case you don't know, Monta pretty much shitted on him before he even made his debut, criticized the FA for drafting him and said that he can't play in a backcourt with Steph.   http://blogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami/2009/09/28/monta-ellis-on-pairing-with-stephen-curry-we-cant-not-going-to-win-that-way/  Steph didn't exactly have the easiest start in the league. Not only was he on a shit team, but the team's then franchise player shunned him before they even played a single game together."

"Well I'm a nobody and my theory is probably trash but here it is.  I think especially back then, Curry was considered a fluke. If you look at the league's history, people under 6'3 who aren't absurdly athletic don't dominate (look at any top 20 list of NBA players and the only short player you might see is Curry himself).  So in 2015, people approached those Finals skeptically, and when Curry played so poorly right away in Game 2, it confirmed that skepticism and there wasn't much he could do to recover the rest of that series.  Obviously, we've become accustomed to Curry's dominance since then so it hasn't been like that for awhile, but I don't think non-Warriors fans remember all the comments made that summer and following season by players and ex-players. Like new Rocket signing Ty Lawson talking in the following October about how he knew how to expose Curry, Doc Rivers claiming the Warriors were lucky not to face his Clippers, and every ex-player from Cedric Ceballos to ex-Warrior Stephen Jackson claiming their teams would have beaten the 2016 Warriors.  I mean Charles Barkley basically voiced it when he talked about the Warriors being a ""jump shooting team"" or ""too small"", or when Phil Jackson gloated in May 2015 when the Warriors were down 2-1 to the Grizzlies about three point shooting teams falling apart in the playoffs. I think it especially made sense that there were so many ex-players/coaches saying this because a guy like Curry was completely incompatible with their understanding of what wins championships in the NBA.  Also a theory about how LeBron influenced perception but I've written enough."
"Steph has a slightly higher TS%, KD has a slightly higher PPG. WS/48 is basically a wash. They're both very good in the playoffs, but I wouldn't say KD has definitively been better than Curry. [Head to head playoff stats] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players)"

"Wow everyone saying Stephen is a great player and the best shooter ever. I’ve watched the Warriors since ‘89. Watched every game in Curry rookie season and counting championship now is normal thing where I’m from 20 minuets from the Oakland coliseum. Been to 100 plus games. And I know for a fact Curry’s game doesn’t translate to physical basketball of the 70,80,90’s,not even the early 2000’s when a physical Gary Payton would have locked Curry down.   Curry is the greatest player since 2010 period "

"Stephen Curry hands down. Not because of overall skill but because hes already so popular. Any overseas basketball fans that know only the slightest about the nba can usually name Lebron or Steph. Even kids know who Curry is. Everyone is so much more motivated to shoot 3's, its ridiculous. Any bandwagon would never follow Greek Freak simply because he hasnt accomplished anything (aside from MIP, but what bandwagon would know that). I dont even think Giannis has a million followers on twitter, instagram, snapchat or facebook.  Maybe in a few years if Giannis can win a ring or 2 but for now, its Curry."
"Yes, he is the better 2 way player. Size really matters in the nba. To quote Steve kerr.Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."""
I don’t see what puts Giannis in the discussion but not Stephen Curry

"Oooh, I love this game. Not only has he posted these on this sub, but I love with him so I have to hear these takes in real life. I present to you, my little brother.  1) The Lakers will win the championship.  2) The Lakers will sweep the playoffs because everyone is scared of LeBron.  3) The Utah Jazz are a bottom tier team because they only best the Atlanta Hawks by like 15. (The Lakers, who are going to win the championship, beat the Hawks by one and lost to them in the month before he told me this.)  4) Wilt Chamberlain, if he were born and raised in a modern basketball world, wouldn't be a top 10 center in today's NBA. Not all time list, he thinks there are ten centers better than Wilt playing right now.  5) The Knick's young core (post-Porzingas) can be a championship team next year without adding any free agents.  6) The Bucks are a terrible team and Giannis will never play on a good team because Milwaukee's front office sucks.  7a) Steph Curry only looks good because KD is there. 7b) KD only looks good because Steph Curry is there.  8) No one watches basketball before the ASB because the NFL is on and everyone who watches basketball thinks football is more important. (I do not watch football.)  9) LeBron should be a 9(?)x MVP who has won every year since he went to Miami.  10) Kyle Korver is the best defender in the NBA. (When we asked him why he thought that he tried to show us a Stephen A Smith segment that was completely unrelated because it would prove us wrong.)   I could go on, but I'll stick with just ten. I should mention that he does absolutely and with conviction beleive every single one of these stupid, stupid takes. He swears by them and thinks you're an idiot if you disagree."
"Makes sense, it's easier to hit the basket when you can actually see it.  Everyone thought Curry has peaked, but he's been playing on hard mode this entire time. Jordan thought he was cool when he made a FT with eyes closed, welcome to next level - blind Stephen Curry hitting threes!"

STEPHEN CURRY WTF
"They used to be, but then Stephen Curry made an enemy out of OP"
I don’t think what he has is the same as straight up not being able to see without some sort of eyewear. Stephen Curry definitely was not out there his whole life seeing the world as one big blur
Stephen Curry was the prince that was promised.
You're then one making the huge exaggeration.     Player| Uncontested REB per game| Uncontested REB % ---|---|---- Russell Westbrook| 9.0| 83.9 Giannis Antetokounmpo| 8.6| 68.5 Deandre Jordan| 8.6| 65.6 Ben Simmons| 6.4| 72.2 LeBron James| 6.3| 75.3 Luka Doncic| 5.7| 73.5 James Harden| 5.0| 78.7 DeMar DeRozan| 4.9| 81.9 Victor Oladipo| 4.5| 79.8 Jimmy Butler| 3.3| 62.2 Stephen Curry| 4.2| 79.2  Do you see a pattern here? Russell Westbrook is one of the best guard rebounders in the league but his double digit rebounds are clearly inflated by the far higher than average number of uncontested rebounds he is gobbling up. It's OKC's strategy for him to do that. That doesn't make him some rebounding god. Plenty of guards could average high numbers of rebounds if their teams told them to do the same.  
Looks like we got the spider verse stephen curry.

"Stephen A. Smith is largely a moron. But, this isn't a completely ridiculous hot take. Shaq was drafted in 1992. Here is a list of players that I think could be argued were considered the ""best"" those years.  1992 - 1993: Jordan (Duh)  1993 - 1995: Hakeem, Barkley, Robinson, Malone (my pick is Hakeem or Robinson)  1996 - 1998: Jordan (Double Duh)  1998 - 2005: Duncan, Garnett, Shaq  2005 - 2006: Kobe, Duncan, Garnett, LeBron  2007 - Current: LeBron (honorable mention to Curry, Durant, Harden in recent years - but .... yea LeBron is still the best).  I would say Shaq was the ""best player"" at some point between Jordan and LeBron's eras, but it's not so outlandish to say he wasn't, in my opinion. Garnett, particularly, had a few monster years in the early 2000s. Oh, and Duncan was still around .... quietly dominating. See below the list of top VORP leaders every year.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/vorp_top_10.html  Personally I think Shaq was the best player in 2 of those years: 1999 and 2000. Honestly, Shaq never really tried that hard in the regular season .... it's why he only has 1 MVP. If Shaq had 50% of Kobe's work ethic and longevity, he'd have finished as a top 3 player in NBA history.   Shaq in the playoffs though? Totally different beast. "
"The question was: which rookies have caught your attention this year?  *""None,"" Simmons told ESPN. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like (Kevin Durant), (LeBron James), (Stephen) Curry, Russell (Westbrook). Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""*"
Yes. You would be proud that you are Stephen Curry. 
"No, they weren’t xenophobic because he won the award, just like doncic is going to this year. Doncic finished 2nd in the West in all star voting and 3rd overall over Stephen curry and James Harden as well, and Giannis finished 2nd overall below only Lebron. Giannis is 1st or 2nd in the mvp race and in 3rd/4th is Jokic. Embiid finished 3rd in frontcourt all star voting below only 1 American player. The league definitely doesn’t underrate it’s foreign players"
After five years in the NBA? Maybe. But at the same point in their development Zion may as well be Stephen Curry compared to him.
"No but I'm talking about a literal fact, I believe that's the point of the post.  ""The Warriors have won 3 of the past 4 championships"" is a fact  ""Stephen Curry has as many NBA finals win as LeBron James"" would also be a fact  But "" the Warriors are have been the best team since 2015"" is not a literal fact. Key word **literal** here. "

"Comparing Lonzo Ball and Stephen Curry is like comparing Jason Tatum and Brandon Ingram...it's apples and oranges, don't worry about it, you're going to get top results from both baby!"
"And it's BS.  Funniest game I ever went to was final game of the season, Portland vs GSW.  The person I was supposed to go with bailed.  So at the last 2nd I traded by 2 tickets for 1 better ticket with a scalper.  At the time it was the best seats I've ever had.  (Fun fact, scalpers like the 2:1 trade because it's easier to sell 2 tickets than 1.)  Anyway.  I go to the game and it's totally meaningless.  Portland had locked up the 6 seed and the Warriors were nothing.  The Warriors cared so little they only suited up 8 players.  So then the funny shit happens.  Warriors have 2 suited up played who are actually hurt.  Then they have another played get hurt and another foul out.  So they throw Morrow and Turiaf in for under 10 seconds each, then have both leave with injury.  But now they have 4 players... luckily the NBA has a rule for this.  Every foul is now a technical foul (or something like this, too drunk to look it up) because they bring a fouled out player back into the game.   At this points us fans, the arena announcers, and apparently the refs were all lost.  In the end the 50 win Blazers lose to the 26 win Warriors.  Some rookie who was clearly worse than Tyreke Evans named ""Stephen Curry"" goes for 42/9/8 on 52/67/100 shooting splits.  I've never left a loss in such a good mood.  On a darker note... I've never left a win a worse mood than last Monday..."
Lol what ? Chris Paul and Stephen Curry are easily better. 
unless your name is stephen curry or maybe kevin durant you don’t really have any business taking such a deep shot in such a situation
"Isn't most pick up 2/3 already? I know street ball is still heavily played 1/2, but that's even quickly changing thanks to Stephen Curry. "
"I was watching last night's game and I was surprised how much Reggie struggles creating his own shot, and then he became Stephen Curry from 3 in the second half"
Don’t forget drafting two point guards back to back not named Stephen Curry!
-Stephen Curry
Jimmer was Stephen Curry at Duke
Eh I think wb definitely had a better case than curry in 15/16.  Most Valuable Player: Stephen Curry (23.8/7.7/4.3) 1st Seed Players MVP: James Harden (27.4/7.0/5.7) 2nd Seed
"&gt; This Lakers team isn't historically bad, they have some decent players, but Lebron is simply not the best in the league. You put KD there and they make the playoffs.  Most of those decent players have been injured even more than LeBron.   I just don't see how a Durant who is significantly worse than Lebron in running an offense would be able to conjure up 16 to 20 wins out of thin air while missing almost a quarter of the season.  That's a ridiculous standard.   Since LeBron came back from injury his On/Off net rating differential is something like +18.  Stephen Curry had a an On/Off net rating of +22 or so during his god-mode MVP year. You'd literally need that type of impact to even be in contention of winning games.  The Lakers have simply been bottom of the barrel bad when he is not playing and ever so slightly positive when he is. Paints a pretty good picture about how the team is ""decent"""
So a dirty play is not a foul if the victim is Stephen Curry? Cool to know.
These guys are supposed to be role models for the youth of today. We would have gotten bitch slapped by the coach for doing this. I bet every single one of those refs could win a fight against Stephen Curry. A few more years and it’ll all be over.

Understanding something doesn’t excuse it.  It helps us better recognize what’s fully going on rather than slinging labels and judgements in a reactionary manner.  Stephen Curry who is a humam being with emotions and reacts to stress/frustrations in many different ways just like you and me.  I agree Curry’s behavior is a bad look.  What’s also a bad look is how quick to judgement we can be as critics looking in from the outside.
you’re just being reactionary to someone in one moment. It’s easy to reduce peoples’ entire existences to a single instance.  It’s like saying Stephen Curry is the devil incarnate because he didn’t sign someone’s shoes once  sOoO fAkE AnD jUvEniLe

"Wardell Stephen ""↑↑↓↓←→←→BA"" Curry II"
"Maybe the Celtics didn't meet the expectations for the amount of talent they had, but Terry (and the rest of the C's players) were professional all year. Sure they didn't click, sacrifice for each other, and play VERY unselfish Bball like GSW. But then again there is only 1 GSW and only 1 Stephen Curry. I felt most of the Celtics players did give their best effort and acted as professional as possible until the season was over.  IMO one problem seems that everyone in the organization is out for their own interest. Secondly is the lack of clear on-court leadership. In the first case, I sort of blame Ainge setting up Boston to be a place where you can give your heart to the city and Ainge will deal you without mercy. This trickles down. Brad mostly immune to it, but it trickles down to the players regardless. Kyrie's a weird introverted dude who's messages get mixed up or have the opposite impact he wants. Brown/Tatum feeling they are diminished from last year. Hayward trying get himself back in, but probably feels Tatum/Brown breathing down his neck for starter/minutes. Terry/Smart have to fight for their minutes. etc etc etc. Every one has their their own agendas even if they try to act professional for the team. Secondly is Brad hadn't (or couldn't) establish a clear pecking order with a good leader at helm. Kyrie is very very talented, but being a GOAT dribbler doesn't mean you're a good leader. I think Boston would be wiser to make Horford the team captain or moral/emotional leader of the team. He's a vet, unselfish, sets a good example for working hard, able to be vocal yet knows when and how much to push teammates, etc etc. Most of the things you need in a leader.  &gt;~~I couldn't care less.~~ ""Who cares?"""
"How many aspects are there? Curry is better at shooting, passing, playing passing lanes, rebounding for his position. Durant is better at rim protection, getting his own midrange shot, and guarding bigger players. But you’re acting like these skills are one to one. Just because one player is better in more aspects doesn’t make them a superior player. Some skills are much more important than others.   For example: Ben Simmons is better than Stephen Curry at rebounding, passing, defending, and athleticism, but Curry is the far superior player.   Durant has succeeded in Golden State at a team level because of Curry. Teams place a big defender on Durant and let him iso and shoot 50-55% from midrange on 20 attempts a game. Curry is always active off ball and causes havoc and confusion. Curry gets double teamed coming off screens both with and without the ball. Durant can get these one on one matchups because no one can leave Curry for a second.   Durant obviously has more physical tools, but that doesn’t stop Curry from being more active on defense and on the boards."
Stephen Curry.
"""What Coach has gone through this year has been unlike anything I've seen -- just the amount of distractions, the circus that has been around him and the decisions he has had to make,"" Curry said. ""I love Coach more than anybody. For him to be in a position where his job is under scrutiny and under questions is totally unfair""  ""It would definitely be a shock to me if anything like [a firing] would happen,"" Curry said. ""I'm definitely going to voice my support for Coach to anybody that asks me all summer""  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/10884676/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-coach-mark-jackson-scrutiny-unfair  I thought jackson was surely going to stay."
"I already mentioned that the 2017 had the best offense in NBA history. It's literally better than all those unreal teams, 86 Celtics, 96 Bulls, even the 2017 Warriors couldn't handle their offensive output and the only reason this series was over so quickly because that team is the greatest team ever assembled. The Cavs were a little too offense oriented so they couldn't defend those Warriors. No other team you mentioned has the insane offensive highs that Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant at their peak bring.   And I don't really have to mention how fantastic the 2016 Cavs were.   You're saying CP3 + DeAndre is a dangerous combo when Kyrie and LeBron is so very obviously far better. Plus all the role players were on point in 2016. Great defensive and offensive contributions from pretty much every rotation player.  Also claiming LeBrons defense would be exposed when it was a huge reason why the Cavs dominated the Warriors in 16 shows you how much you live in your own reality."

"Nah, Curry === Curry would require Stephen Curry to be the exact same person as Seth Curry. It's OK to typecast in this instance."
Damian Lillard is going to point at his wrist soon and then Seth Cuirry vs. Stephen Curry WCF!!
"I'll give reddit the pass on this. But even sports personalities flip flop on Stephen Curry, as well as Twitter. The same people on Twitter will say the warriors are unfair because they have two mvps and that steph sucks in the playoffs."
"He heard what Stephen Wardell Curry did and is trying to top him. Just watch, Dame Time in the last 2 minutes."
"No, it's not more helpful. Basketball isn't played on a one to one scale. We can't just ignore factors.  Stotts is clearly the better coach. Portland has way more shooting than OKC. Portland has the better role players. They've been more healthy these past 3 years. These factors matter.   Let's make even comparisons for Stephen Curry then. Let's create a scenario where both players had 0 all-star help.  Without another all-star on his team, he hasn't accomplished anything. Dame has accomplished more than Curry when they had 0 all-stars on their team therefore Dame is better than Curry. See how faulty this method of reasoning is?   Harden has accomplished more than Curry too if you only count the seasons where they had 0 all-stars. Curry was on a lottery team without another all-star and Harden led a team to 65 wins last season. Harden is better than Curry.  This method of reasoning is dumb."
"a) I don't know if you think I should have ranked him higher or lower. I have him winning MVP. He was the third best player in the league this season IMO.  b) KD will be remembered as a dude who was very good at basketball. He's definitely a top 25 all-time player. Stephen Curry changed the league. He is the undisputed greatest shooter of all time. He spearheaded the three-point revolution. He was the figurehead, the leader, of the best regular season team in NBA history. He was the league's first and so far only unanimous MVP. Steph is top 10 all-time once he's done.  You look at most top 10 rankings and all of these guys have a ""thing"". MJ is the GOAT, dunk contest legend and the best scorer in NBA history. Kareem is the highest scorer in NBA history. Kobe is the most relentless worker the league has seen. LeBron is the King, a small forward with too much size for his speed and too much speed for his size with generational passing abilities and willpower that dragged Kevin Love and the corpse of Tristan Thompson to the finals. Russell is the best winner we've seen. Magic was arguably the best passer of all time and led the most famous fast break offense ever. Wilt was Wilt. Duncan is the greatest PF and the greatest teammate of all time. Shaq is the most dominant player in modern NBA history. Steph fits here. He's the greatest shooter of all time. He leads the best team we've ever seen. He had the best offensive season we've ever seen while also leading the league in steals. KD is just very good at basketball. You can claim the whole ""size but with a jumper"" thing, but there's a lot of players that have that, KD is just a more efficient scorer. He hasn't changed the league, the way the league is marketed, or the league's popularity the way the top 10 have."

Why is Stephen Curry black? His father is half black and his mother is white.

"The killer mentality exists at the top. You can't look at the Lakers young players to try to find killer mentality just like you couldn't look at the Clippers young players back when Jordan was winning championships.  If you want to see killer mentality you have to first look at the high level players, and then look at veterans. Young guys generally need to develop it. Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid are examples of guys that you sometimes see them with a killer mentality, and then other times they don't have it, just because they're not focused in yet because they lack maturity.  Guys I would say I've seen with the killer mentality: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, James Harden, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antekoumpo, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Lebron James, and probably a few more."

When we saw him out there, I contacted our equipment manager (Tony Nila) because they’re the ones that coordinate shooting times. He told me ‘we gave him the court at 6:45.’ We asked him how long they had the court for.  “When we finally went out there, Stephen cracked a joked with Chris. Chris said ‘let him shoot.’ It wasn’t like it was a confrontation. “Let him shoot. Let him finish what he’s doing.’ We didn’t kick him off the court. We didn’t even say anything.""  https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/texas-sports-nation/rockets/article/Real-story-Chris-Paul-Stephen-Curry-controversy-13838150.php"

Just like Stephen A said James harden didnt lose to golden state but lose to curry or kd. Just like Charles Barkley and karl malone to MJ. Harden just doesnt bave those clutch genes in him.
"I will not post anymore about my lord and savior, Wardell Stephen Curry"
"I agree, and the fluke thing was definitely retired once they got KD. But I think it resurfaced last night with him being out to the point where people are calling this a massive Rockets choke and not two great teams going at it and one barely pulling out a close game.  But there's a reason every retired player and their mother was coming out in the 2015-2016 season and talking about how they would have crushed the 73 win Warriors, from Cedric Ceballos's Suns to Stephen Jackson's Warriors. Same reason why Doc called them lucky and Ty Lawson was going into that season talking about how he knew the key to slowing the Warriors down.  People have had a hard time accepting Curry and Draymond's greatness, although I think people have come around to a large extent on Curry. But when you look at the top 20 all-time players, how many 6'3 guys do you see? Curry's dominance doesn't really make sense to a lot of people who are used to basketball a certain way. Neither does Draymond's. Klay is more conventional and KD is obviously extremely easy to fit in with ""how it's always been""."
"I know it's easy to pile on CP3 right after his defeat, but let's be real here. Person getting off the banana boat isn't CP3. [Stephen saw CP3 as a mentor](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/stephen-curry-reflects-on-relationship-with-chris-paul/ar-AAxafCe). CP3/Wade/Bron/Curry are all classy dudes who get their fair share of FTs, have rings, are family men, have been franchise guys, and unselfish players who are generally considered have ""championship qualities"".  TL;DR Ayyy P, they said I gotta come off the banana boat."
"That's a convenient way to circumvent the whole argument to get to the point you wanted to. Also, I disagree with that point on a few levels: Kawhi Leonard and Giannis are great two way players, but do not have the impact on a team that Steph has. Here's a list of things wrong with your point:  1. The MVP vote isn't about who's the better player. It never has been and never will be. Otherwise Lebron James has been fucked out of 10 years worth of MVPs.  The award is given for the most impactful player on a top team. Harden has had the highest impact this season because his team has experienced tons of injuries and he's absolutely carried them through the regular season. He performed well in the playoffs, but definitely not the astronomical James Harden from the regular season. That's fine in and of itself because he played at or above what was expected of him. 2. To make your list, come up with a single metric by which you want to evaluate all the players. Spoiler: there are no practical metrics that Stephen Curry does not come up in those top 5. 3. If you want a more holistic approach, which you probably should seeing as we're evaluating how good a player is, then look at the total impact a player has on their current team. Try to extrapolate how this impact changes outside of their current circumstances. Lebron James is a great example here; he's undoubtedly a top 5 player on skill, but his team situation is shit so his total wins are going to be lower than a player like Kawhi Leonard.    Overall, from a holistic perspective Steph Curry is a top 5 player no matter what conclusion you try to draw from this series. You keep saying that 1 quarter shouldn't dictate who's better, but it seems like your only contention to place Curry out of the top 5 is predicated on this last playoff series."
"HOUSTON — Draymond Green stood outside the visiting locker room at the Toyota Center, greeting teammates as they came in. When Stephen Curry made his way through the crowd, he looked straight at Green — before they slapped hands and bumped chests — and screamed, “Kick me off the court again, boy!”  There is a story behind that.  On the eve of Friday’s Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals, Curry wanted to get some shots up at the Toyota Center. The Warriors’ do-it-all manager, Eric Housen, booked the court from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. so Curry could work on his shot. Somehow, Rockets guard Chris Paul got wind. He decided to go to the Toyota Center to get shots up, nixing Curry’s reservations. The Warriors’ point guard offered to stick to half a court, but Paul wasn’t having it. Curry was kicked off the Toyota Center court.  Hence: “Kick me off the court again, boy!” And Green replied to Curry’s taunt by screaming, “Kick him off! Kick him off!”  The lesson from the Warriors’ 118-113 win to eliminate the Rockets and advance to the Western Conference finals was loud and clear. It’s going to take more than gamesmanship to beat the Warriors. Talent alone isn’t even enough.  Game 6 of this second-round series was a flex by the Warriors. It was a performance that illustrated the gulf between good teams and great ones, and another gulf between great teams and champions. On the road, with Kevin Durant back in the Bay Area watching on television, and with starting center DeMarcus Cousins on the bench in street clothes, they leaned on their championship mettle and revealed Houston to be unworthy of their crown.  And that isn’t necessarily a slight to the Rockets, one of the few teams that dared to dethrone the super team. Houston was indeed a valiant foe that pushed the Warriors unlike any other team without LeBron James.  The present day will take a chunk from the Rockets, from James Harden and Paul, especially. But history should remember them as great. When the final story is written about this era of the Warriors, they might only be looking up to Michael Jordan’s Bulls. And the Rockets, they are this era’s Utah Jazz: incredibly dynamic, led by Hall of Fame players, but just fashioned at the wrong time, in the same space-time continuum as a transcendent team.  “That team was one of the best teams we played during this five-year run,” coach Steve Kerr said of the Rockets. “They put so much pressure on you at both ends of the floor. It’s a tremendous two-way basketball team. We had to scrap and fight for everything the last two years against them. … Obviously, it speaks to our group and their toughness and talent. But I can’t speak any more highly of Houston and their grit and their competitiveness and their talent. That was an absolute grind.”  But there are levels to this. The Warriors are just a class above.  This was the Rockets’ best chance to show they belonged in the same ilk. The Warriors didn’t have more talent in Game 6. They didn’t have a loaded bench. They were down two starters, and their best players had logged heavy minutes. But in the end, the Warriors had too much of something else — championship swag. And they used it to come up with one of their biggest wins of this era, against a team most thought could end their reign.  “It’s all-time greats in here,” Quinn Cook screamed. “We got champions in this, motherfucka.”  This is what Green knew before the game when he predicted the Warriors were going to handle business. He knew it when they walked through shootaround and everyone was quiet. When they huddled, he tried to clap it up, get the energy up, and no one clapped with him.  He surveyed his teammates, looked into their eyes, examined their body language, searching for nervousness. Instead, he found focus.  “Oh, everybody’s ready to go,” Green said. “And I could feel it. Everybody was locked in. Even I got quiet. I knew I didn’t really feel like talking. And I know we’re locked in like that — I know what we’re made of, so I just knew guys were going to come out and bring it. When you talk about heart, you’re talking about just the willingness to do whatever. The willingness to do what it takes. The willingness to step up in a big moment. You can’t buy it. You can’t give it to someone. Either you got it or you don’t. I think we showed that in a major way.”  Klay Thompson was a prime example. He came into Game 6 averaging 17.6 points on 42.7 percent shooting. He’d made just over a third of his 3-pointers, 13-of-36, which is good but beneath his standards. But he came out shooting like he had the hottest stroke in Houston. He made 5 of his 9 3-point attempts and scored a game-high 21 points in the first half. The Warriors needed every basket. But he gave them more than the points. He gave them confidence. He fired the first shots in the mental war that games of this magnitude become.  Thompson famously destroyed Oklahoma City in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals in 2016. In 2018, he burned these same Rockets in Game 6. He came out reminding them what kind of night they were in for, what it was going to take to beat them. Thompson signaled how the Warriors were bringing it.  “His personality, his perspective on life, really makes him different in these moments,” Curry said. “I don’t even know if he really even feels pressure. He’s just out there hooping. The shots he was taking in the first half — understanding the situation, the confidence to knock them down — that was huge for us. We don’t win this game tonight without everybody on the court, but especially Klay that first half to give us life and to give us a reason to be in it in the second half.”  At the 9:57 mark of the fourth quarter, Andre Iguodala checked out of the game. At that point, he had logged 29 minutes, 45 seconds after closing the third quarter and starting the fourth. But at the 8:15 mark, Kerr put him right back in.  Iguodala was stunned. He was spent. He needed a longer breather. He said one moment he was so tired, he felt lightheaded and a little dizzy. He said it was probably the most mentally exhausted he’s ever been.  But experience has taught him some things that come into play in the most intense moments of playoff basketball. He’s learned how to override the fatigue and conquer the thoughts that lead to defeat. Friday, he leaned on meditation principles. He embraces those moments, those thoughts. He lives in those moments — feels them, examines them and then discards them with a breath. It’s his championship pedigree serving as an antivirus for exhaustion, doubt, frustration, weakness.  It was a lesson he learned in the Warriors’ first championship back in 2015, when he first felt what it took to be a champion. It was late in Game 6 of those NBA Finals, and a couple of calls went Cleveland’s way. He remembers complaining to himself about how hard it was, about how the referees weren’t giving them calls, how the mountain seemed so steep.  “The referees were (officiating) like, ‘You have to win.’ That’s the thought I had,” Iguodala said. “We have to win. You’re not just going to win the championship. You have to go get it.  “If I’m ever in a game,” he continued, “and I’m like, ‘Yo, this is hard,’ then I tell myself, ‘That means you’re doing something right.’ … When you know something is hard and you’re doing it the right way — that’s really a championship moment, when you overcome the mind, overcome the body being tired, the mind being dead.”  Iguodala overcame in a big way. His 17 points and five steals, his calming presence on the court. When he checked back in after 102 seconds of rest, his defense helped hold Harden to 1-of-4 shooting with a turnover in the defining stretch of the game that saw the Warriors go from a four-point deficit to a five-point lead.  Behind Iguodala was Green, holding down the back line. He filled the stats as usual — eight points, 10 rebounds, seven assists, a steal, a block, four turnovers, four fouls — but he anchored a defense that held the Rockets scoreless on eight shots over a span of 3:56 that saw the Warriors take control of the game.  “Draymond,” Shaun Livingston said, “we wouldn’t have championships without him. Heart of steel. Steph playing through what he’s playing through — all the expectations, people talking. The character behind those guys. Them two. Klay. Andre. The character behind those guys is unmatched. We stay in the trenches. You’ve got to put us down. We’re like that dog that’s going to keep biting if he’s got one tooth left, but you know he’s going to bite you with it. We all have that mentality. I’ve seen it. That mentality of staying locked in. ‘We can’t give this game up. We can’t celebrate early. We can’t think we got it in the bag.’ That’s what champs do. We’ve just got guys.”  So when it was winning time and the Rockets had to dig deeper to beat the champions and stave off elimination, they couldn’t do it. The Warriors came alive in that moment and the Rockets couldn’t.  Curry seized the moment and carried the Warriors home. He hit the shot of the night, hitting the Rockets’ best defender in P.J. Tucker with a series of crossovers and drilling a fadeaway 3. That’s when they knew, the Warriors and the Rockets, that the gulf between these teams would not be conquered.  Of course, Thompson hit the dagger 3-pointer, the one that punctuated the reality of this most riveting rivalry: The Rockets are great. But the Warriors are champions.  “I can’t remember a situation where we’ve had must-win games and my guys folded,” Green said. “I can’t remember. I’ve seen guys have bad games. But I’ve never seen us in any situation where there was a big-pressure moment and they fold. But yet they’re light-skinned and they’re soft. Fuck outta here. They ain’t never folded in a big moment. But they don’t get credit for that because their jump shots are pretty. Fuck them jump shots. They show up in big moments. They got heart.”  (Photo: Andrew D. Bernstein / Getty Images)"

And Stephen Wardell Curry denied Chris Paul a championship opportunity.

"HOUSTON — Draymond Green stood outside the visiting locker room at the Toyota Center, greeting teammates as they came in. When Stephen Curry made his way through the crowd, he looked straight at Green — before they slapped hands and bumped chests — and screamed, “Kick me off the court again, boy!”  There is a story behind that.  On the eve of Friday’s Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals, Curry wanted to get some shots up at the Toyota Center. The Warriors’ do-it-all manager, Eric Housen, booked the court from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. so Curry could work on his shot. Somehow, Rockets guard Chris Paul got wind. He decided to go to the Toyota Center to get shots up, nixing Curry’s reservations. The Warriors’ point guard offered to stick to half a court, but Paul wasn’t having it. Curry was kicked off the Toyota Center court.  Hence: “Kick me off the court again, boy!” And Green replied to Curry’s taunt by screaming, “Kick him off! Kick him off!”  The lesson from the Warriors’ 118-113 win to eliminate the Rockets and advance to the Western Conference finals was loud and clear. It’s going to take more than gamesmanship to beat the Warriors. Talent alone isn’t even enough.  Game 6 of this second-round series was a flex by the Warriors. It was a performance that illustrated the gulf between good teams and great ones, and another gulf between great teams and champions. On the road, with Kevin Durant back in the Bay Area watching on television, and with starting center DeMarcus Cousins on the bench in street clothes, they leaned on their championship mettle and revealed Houston to be unworthy of their crown.  And that isn’t necessarily a slight to the Rockets, one of the few teams that dared to dethrone the super team. Houston was indeed a valiant foe that pushed the Warriors unlike any other team without LeBron James.  The present day will take a chunk from the Rockets, from James Harden and Paul, especially. But history should remember them as great. When the final story is written about this era of the Warriors, they might only be looking up to Michael Jordan’s Bulls. And the Rockets, they are this era’s Utah Jazz: incredibly dynamic, led by Hall of Fame players, but just fashioned at the wrong time, in the same space-time continuum as a transcendent team.  “That team was one of the best teams we played during this five-year run,” coach Steve Kerr said of the Rockets. “They put so much pressure on you at both ends of the floor. It’s a tremendous two-way basketball team. We had to scrap and fight for everything the last two years against them. … Obviously, it speaks to our group and their toughness and talent. But I can’t speak any more highly of Houston and their grit and their competitiveness and their talent. That was an absolute grind.”  But there are levels to this. The Warriors are just a class above.  This was the Rockets’ best chance to show they belonged in the same ilk. The Warriors didn’t have more talent in Game 6. They didn’t have a loaded bench. They were down two starters, and their best players had logged heavy minutes. But in the end, the Warriors had too much of something else — championship swag. And they used it to come up with one of their biggest wins of this era, against a team most thought could end their reign.  “It’s all-time greats in here,” Quinn Cook screamed. “We got champions in this, motherfucka.”  This is what Green knew before the game when he predicted the Warriors were going to handle business. He knew it when they walked through shootaround and everyone was quiet. When they huddled, he tried to clap it up, get the energy up, and no one clapped with him.  He surveyed his teammates, looked into their eyes, examined their body language, searching for nervousness. Instead, he found focus.  “Oh, everybody’s ready to go,” Green said. “And I could feel it. Everybody was locked in. Even I got quiet. I knew I didn’t really feel like talking. And I know we’re locked in like that — I know what we’re made of, so I just knew guys were going to come out and bring it. When you talk about heart, you’re talking about just the willingness to do whatever. The willingness to do what it takes. The willingness to step up in a big moment. You can’t buy it. You can’t give it to someone. Either you got it or you don’t. I think we showed that in a major way.”  Klay Thompson was a prime example. He came into Game 6 averaging 17.6 points on 42.7 percent shooting. He’d made just over a third of his 3-pointers, 13-of-36, which is good but beneath his standards. But he came out shooting like he had the hottest stroke in Houston. He made 5 of his 9 3-point attempts and scored a game-high 21 points in the first half. The Warriors needed every basket. But he gave them more than the points. He gave them confidence. He fired the first shots in the mental war that games of this magnitude become.  Thompson famously destroyed Oklahoma City in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals in 2016. In 2018, he burned these same Rockets in Game 6. He came out reminding them what kind of night they were in for, what it was going to take to beat them. Thompson signaled how the Warriors were bringing it.  “His personality, his perspective on life, really makes him different in these moments,” Curry said. “I don’t even know if he really even feels pressure. He’s just out there hooping. The shots he was taking in the first half — understanding the situation, the confidence to knock them down — that was huge for us. We don’t win this game tonight without everybody on the court, but especially Klay that first half to give us life and to give us a reason to be in it in the second half.”  At the 9:57 mark of the fourth quarter, Andre Iguodala checked out of the game. At that point, he had logged 29 minutes, 45 seconds after closing the third quarter and starting the fourth. But at the 8:15 mark, Kerr put him right back in.  Iguodala was stunned. He was spent. He needed a longer breather. He said one moment he was so tired, he felt lightheaded and a little dizzy. He said it was probably the most mentally exhausted he’s ever been.  But experience has taught him some things that come into play in the most intense moments of playoff basketball. He’s learned how to override the fatigue and conquer the thoughts that lead to defeat. Friday, he leaned on meditation principles. He embraces those moments, those thoughts. He lives in those moments — feels them, examines them and then discards them with a breath. It’s his championship pedigree serving as an antivirus for exhaustion, doubt, frustration, weakness.  It was a lesson he learned in the Warriors’ first championship back in 2015, when he first felt what it took to be a champion. It was late in Game 6 of those NBA Finals, and a couple of calls went Cleveland’s way. He remembers complaining to himself about how hard it was, about how the referees weren’t giving them calls, how the mountain seemed so steep.  “The referees were (officiating) like, ‘You have to win.’ That’s the thought I had,” Iguodala said. “We have to win. You’re not just going to win the championship. You have to go get it.  “If I’m ever in a game,” he continued, “and I’m like, ‘Yo, this is hard,’ then I tell myself, ‘That means you’re doing something right.’ … When you know something is hard and you’re doing it the right way — that’s really a championship moment, when you overcome the mind, overcome the body being tired, the mind being dead.”  Iguodala overcame in a big way. His 17 points and five steals, his calming presence on the court. When he checked back in after 102 seconds of rest, his defense helped hold Harden to 1-of-4 shooting with a turnover in the defining stretch of the game that saw the Warriors go from a four-point deficit to a five-point lead.  Behind Iguodala was Green, holding down the back line. He filled the stats as usual — eight points, 10 rebounds, seven assists, a steal, a block, four turnovers, four fouls — but he anchored a defense that held the Rockets scoreless on eight shots over a span of 3:56 that saw the Warriors take control of the game.  “Draymond,” Shaun Livingston said, “we wouldn’t have championships without him. Heart of steel. Steph playing through what he’s playing through — all the expectations, people talking. The character behind those guys. Them two. Klay. Andre. The character behind those guys is unmatched. We stay in the trenches. You’ve got to put us down. We’re like that dog that’s going to keep biting if he’s got one tooth left, but you know he’s going to bite you with it. We all have that mentality. I’ve seen it. That mentality of staying locked in. ‘We can’t give this game up. We can’t celebrate early. We can’t think we got it in the bag.’ That’s what champs do. We’ve just got guys.”  So when it was winning time and the Rockets had to dig deeper to beat the champions and stave off elimination, they couldn’t do it. The Warriors came alive in that moment and the Rockets couldn’t.  Curry seized the moment and carried the Warriors home. He hit the shot of the night, hitting the Rockets’ best defender in P.J. Tucker with a series of crossovers and drilling a fadeaway 3. That’s when they knew, the Warriors and the Rockets, that the gulf between these teams would not be conquered.  Of course, Thompson hit the dagger 3-pointer, the one that punctuated the reality of this most riveting rivalry: The Rockets are great. But the Warriors are champions.  “I can’t remember a situation where we’ve had must-win games and my guys folded,” Green said. “I can’t remember. I’ve seen guys have bad games. But I’ve never seen us in any situation where there was a big-pressure moment and they fold. But yet they’re light-skinned and they’re soft. Fuck outta here. They ain’t never folded in a big moment. But they don’t get credit for that because their jump shots are pretty. Fuck them jump shots. They show up in big moments. They got heart.”  (Photo: Andrew D. Bernstein / Getty Images)"

It’s clear that you don’t even watch basketball. You’re totally right! Harden makes all the key decisions about the team’s offensive strategy. What is a coach? Nah.

The Warriors had 2 good quarters of Stephen Curry.
"Ahem, I'm afraid I must interject, it's Wardell Stephen Jose ""Golden State Warriors Legend"" Calderon Curry II"
"Stephen Curry, the 2nd of of his name, has never ever lost to Rockets in the playoffs."
Stephen Curry.
"Here are three takeaways from the Warriors' big victory.  **The Warriors' bench is more capable than we thought** Golden State obviously had the most talented starting lineup in basketball this season. But many knocked it for its lack of depth.  The Warriors have had elite talent for a while, but the quality contributions they got from their bench were critical Friday night.  In the absence of Kevin Durant, who was ruled out for the series with a calf injury, Golden State posted 33 bench points. Both Kevon Looney (14 points) and Shaun Livingston (11) tallied double-digits in scoring.  The Warriors' rotation had shrunk in recent weeks, but 11 players were featured in Friday's close-out game.  **Stephen Curry is still … well, Stephen Curry** The two-time MVP's shooting has been inconsistent in the second round, and Game 6 was no exception.  Curry had been dealing with a dislocated finger for several games and was held scoreless in the first half. But he heated up to finish with a team-high 33 points and sank clutch free throws to seal the deal for his team.  Golden State's leader has continued to pull through for his team in the postseason, and now the Warriors will go to their fifth consecutive Western Conference finals.  **The charity stripe helped do the Rockets in** Houston and Golden State had almost identical stats.  Both teams made exactly 42 field goals on the night. The Warriors made one more 3-pointer but lost the rebounding battle by five.  The Rockets only lost by five points. James Harden finished with a game-high 35 points, but accounted for all five of Houston's missed free throws. Houston didn't have much room for mistakes, and one of its failures to capitalize on one of its strengths might have caused it to fall short.  The Warriors will get to rest for now and prepare to face Portland or Denver in the Western Conference finals."
I’m sure Stephen Curry made sure to read the posts r/nba to fuel his performance tonight !

I'm starting to think Stephen Curry is good at basketball.
The Rockets just kind of forgot about Stephen Curry in the first half but he certainly didn’t forget about them.
Good guy Stephen wins game so mommy curry doesnt have to decide which sons game to go to on mothers day
Sources allege that if you leave Stephen Curry open he is liable to make shot attempts at a rate that surpasses most.
I am here to see everyone's apologies. How do you forget who Wardell Stephen Curry (Jr?) is
No. He is Stephen Curry.
I am inevitable - Stephen Thanos Curry
I think the reason that lost the game wa Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson hit shots and the rockets didn't
"HE'S STEPHEN CURRY, YOU KNOW WHO HE IS"
"I want all the clowns saying that Steph isn't clutch to show their faces on this comment and personally apologize not only to Wardell Stephen ""Skyfucker"" Curry II himself, but to me and to all other believers as well.  Shame on you all."
"Stephen ""Tom Brady"" Curry"
"Haters, Stephen Curry still the best player in the league. Period."
He pretty much played the worst basketball of his career this series EXCEPT for the 4th quarter of game 5 and second half of game 6. 33 fucking points in the second half after laying an egg in the first. Letting everyone know who Stephen Curry is once again
That sink's name? Stephen Curry.

So realistically speaking Kyle Lowry is a tall as Stephen curry?
"[yeah actually](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/1/16/14229548/stephen-curry-stats-cavaliers-defense-analysis), the cavs wore him down with physical defense just like the raps. it's the best strategy against him"
The warriors without kd are not more talented than the Chris Paul rockets  They had a chance but lost to the warriors at home without kd and allowed Stephen curry to drop 33 in the second half. Which is why I think it's crazy that people would have harden above curry
LeBron James Kevin Durant Stephen Curry Russell Westbrook James Harden Kawhi Leonard Blake Griffin Chris Paul Dwayne Wade Anthony Davis  This is tough..cuz some guys are more significant than they are good

"Typical warriors fan Stephen curry would be 0-5 without his superteam, and could never carry a team like bron."
"Stephen Curry is currently 31, and he'll turn 32 towards the end of this upcoming regular season.   He's only 3 years younger than LeBron James, and he's 6 months older than Kevin Durant even though those two had been superstar MVP level players for years and years before Steph broke out into one himself.   I still find all of that pretty surprising.   Another classic one is Amir Johnson, who just turned 32. He played on the Pistons with Chauncey, Rip, Prince, Sheed, and Ben during the season when they won 64 games and lost to the eventual champion Miami Heat in the Conference Finals."
What's crazy though is harden shot a respectable 36%.   Stephen curry shot 45% from three while taking 1084. His 2015-16 season was absurd.
You get to look forward to the Stephen Curry MVP train part 3. Cuz he gonna have to average 35 a game if we want to win anything.
man fuck analysis  stephen curry had 3 other all-stars and a hof in andre igoodalalala   kawhi only had choker lowry
LOL where’s KD or even Stephen curry old man?
"He averaged 24, 5, and 7, and shot 49% from the field. For advanced stats freaks, he finished just behind Stephen Curry in PER. The Horford/Irving pick and roll and late game heroics by Irving saved so many games its a shame, and yes, I watched the games. The problems were Hayward, Tatum's shot selection, Brown's injuries and slow start, Morris Jr's attitude, Rozier falling off, I could go on."
Stephen Curry traded to his hometown Charlotte Hornets!!!!!
[Woj] James harden to the warriors for Stephen Curry.
[Woj] Lebron has requested a trade to the Golden State Warriors. Deal reportedly involves Stephen Curry
Tbh developement from the bottom takes a lot longer than people think the warriors after drafting Stephen curry didnt become dominate for awhile
"Steven/Stephen.  Curry, Nash, Adams, Francis to start, find a couple of halfway respectable wings somewhere and that’s a hell of a team."
"Max: AD, pass it to Stephen!  SAS: *bricks it*  AD: Wait, that wasn’t Stephen Curry?"
Retarded. Lebron didn't play with all those players at once. By your logic Kevin Durant has played with  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Draymond Green  Demarcus Cousins  Serge Ibaka  Steven Adams
"Fun fact if it wasn't for Klay Thompson, Draymond green, and Kevin Durant, Stephen curry would be 0-5 in the finals."
"You’re absolutely right. For the record, the one guy who *isn’t* making these excuse is Stephen Curry himself. In his defense, he just played really hard and did everything he could to try to will his team to victory, and I’m willing to praise him for that.   But of course he’s my favorite player and the greatest player in the history of my team, so you wouldn’t be wrong to call me biased. The only problem with the dialogue (which isn’t occurring in your comment, but the talking heads seem to be parroting) is that this particular Finals somehow is an impeachment of Steph’s resume as one of the great players in the game’s history, and I think that’s particularly unfair."
Yep I don’t know why Steph is held to the standards of LeBron James and KD tho. Look at the all time top 10 list. There isn’t a single point guard aside from Magic who was 6’9. Height matters in basketball. Big men used to be the way to win rings now it’s scoring wings. Point guards who are elite scorers like Stephen Curry don’t win championships by themselves very often because it’s easier to stop someone who is 6’3 and not very athletic. If Steph was 6’7 he might be in the GOAT conversation.
"All Decade 1st Team has to be, I'm pretty certain: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Lebron James."

I think he could start for the Raptors next season if Kyle is willing to take a demoted role. He was a pain in the ass for Stephen fricking Curry. He still put up 30 a night but he made Curry make uncharacteristic decisions. His shooting was insane as well and he’s a solid 3 and D PG for his height.

Need to be All NBA or DPOY the season before OR the 2 previous seasons before.  Or MVP one of the 3 previous seasons.  Because of this there are only 4 true Supermax contracts: Stephen Curry, James Harden, John Wall and Westbrook.    This offseason (at the moment) Anthony Davis, Lillard, Kemba Walker, and Giannis Antetokounmpo (who can be offered a 247M/5yr deal) can sign supermax deals this summer.  IMO Klay Thomspon was robbed of 29M when he wasnt voted to an All NBA team and missed qualifying for a supermax deal.  Klay can opt in and try to get one next year though.  Unlikely with his injury."
"Shaun livingston, stephen curry"
Stephen Curry
"Who the fuck are Payton, Drexler, or Hayes? You can't just come on this sub and make names up. Now the true great finals carry was of course Dwight Howard in 2009. Could Stephen Curry take Dwight's place and lead the Magic to the finals? Probably not. He would not be an effective center, and I don't remember their backup. Turkoglu?"
"On a personal level Steph seems like a really great guy. He's a great guy to have around when it comes to coaching. I'm just trying to do what is best"" Curry said. ""At the end of the day, Steph is just a great guy. Obviously I have to come and play basketball with. But sometimes it's good to talk basketball, but that never turns into real conversations.""     While the NBA is not going to be involved in the NBA 2K16, that doesn't mean we won't see some amazing moments. With all the rumors out there including the possible move of Stephen Curry's old club the Oklahoma City Thunder to Cleveland, it's pretty clear we will get to see some classic moments from the late 1990s. You can watch The Game of Thrones Season 4 on HBO starting this Thursday.     You can get The Game of Thrones season 4 trailer now:     While we wait for The Game of Thrones season 4 trailer, you can see Steph Curry do some of his typical nonsense by the pool.

"*After succumbing to too many injuries, the Golden State Warriors and Stephen Curry are* back in the Western Conference Finals, as the Cleveland Cavaliers will meet again in an NBA Finals rematch. Here are some key developments from this series:  The Golden State Warriors and Stephen Curry aren't outgrowing their Finals loss. (Photo: David Richard, USA TODAY Sports)  1. Curry continues to put the ball on the court. Curry, for his part, is trying to make the most of the opportunity for himself in this playoffs.  ""I know in the end we will be the ones to get the rebound,"" Curry said before Game 2 of the Finals. ""The shot clock is going to slow down, but they're going to have me for the rest of the series and hopefully they'll take it one step at a time. I'm going to keep it close and keep trying to make a play. I feel OK and feel like I can score, but I know the game's not all about scoring and stuff.""  ""I know the game's not all about scoring and stuff""  The Warriors, who had the No. 0 defense on the Warriors all series and who had been outscored 102-82 in the first two games of Game 1 - and who were 0-of-12 from 3-point range all series - responded."

**stephen curry** and his name is the only reason
My main concern is that Joe Lacob considered offering Steph less than the max and Myers had to talk him out of it  https://sports.yahoo.com/report-warriors-gm-bob-myers-kept-owner-joe-lacob-lowballing-stephen-curry-165936380.html
"Lowry's playoff history over the past 3 seasons (42 games):  37.2 MPG, 15.7 PTS, 6.9 AST, 4.4 REB, 1.4 STL, 2.4 TO, 46/38/81 shooting, 59.7 TS% (15th among all players in that timeline, min. 500 minutes played), 2.2 VORP (10th), 4.7 WS (9th), 3.0 OBPM (11th, min. 500 minutes played).  Also if you think that 500 minutes minimum is a high cutoff, that allows for 79 players.  Out of 37 guards in that list, here are all the players with a higher TS%: Stephen Curry, Kyle Korver.  It is an illogical and outdated narrative and it was that before this playoffs even started.  I swear that 90% of the people who parrot it forget Lowry was the only Raptor who showed up in that Cavs sweep 2 years ago, then he got hurt near the end of Game 2."
Ain't no salty statements here fam. All of Toronto is how Stephen Curry is in this video right now.
""" *I apologize for us being healthy, I apologize for us playing who was in front of us. I apologize for all the accolades we received as a team and individually. I’m very, truly sorry, and we’ll rectify that situation this year.* ""  &amp;#x200B;  \- Stephen Curry"
"""Sobering Shot of Stephen Curry"""
Klay score 30 points in 32 minutes in a must win game. When he got hurt the game ended.  With Stephen Curry still on the floor.  I would go into how you know what every GM/Player in the league would say but there's no need. You're fucking delusional and I knew you would double down instead of just admitting Klay is the better player which at this point glaringly fucking obvious.  The above was funny tho. Complete horse shit but entertaining none the less.
"so you could at least agree ""amazing photo of stephen curry"" might not be a perfect title here?"
Except he hasn't only had two injuries. Here's a list of ones from the past 2 years alone and only one was due to rest  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/stephen-curry-player-injuries
"Per the @bball_ref Shot Finder tool, only 9 players have taken 9+ potential go ahead FGA in the final 24 seconds of the 4th Qtr/OT of playoff games since 2001. Stephen Curry is the only of those 9 with no makes"
"&gt;	For the series as a whole too, could you say that Durant healthy wouldn’t be worth at least another 5 point swing?  Sure, which is why I never said we win if Durant is healthy for the whole series. He played a quarter and won them that game. But without Durant they are still a championship-level team, so I am not too weighed down by his absence.  &gt;	You really going to say Klay doesn’t isn’t good enough for at least a 5 point swing one way or the other?  Maybe. Tough to tell considering how considerate the referees were after Klay left, and how lackadaisical the Raptors were at the end because they felt secure, and how well the other guys on the Warriors stepped up. But regardless, we outplayed the Klay Warriors enough throughout the series that I have no doubt we close it in seven games. Again, the only reason this series made it to six games was because Durant gave them eleven brilliant minutes.  &gt;	Oh and Kevon Looney being healthy and able to play I to the 2nd half wouldn’t have had an impact?  I mean, it would help somewhat, but really not seeing a series swing there. And at that level, we may as well throw in the “what if Anunoby had played through the playoffs and thus been properly ready for the finals” card.  &gt;	Also, Boogie still recovering from another injury?  Not a lot of sympathy there, it was questionable when they signed him whether he would ever fully recover. He also won them game 2 and contributed well in this game. And the Warriors only had him *because* of a massive injury.  &gt;	And Stephen Curry recovering from a dislocated finger?  Lowry had an injured hand all series, and Kawhi has been playing with a limp for weeks."
"By the greatest choker in NBA finals ever, Stephen Curry."
Only time I’ve ever felt bad for Stephen Curry.
"Steph, GSW's dynasty is over, Kawhi is likely leaving Toronto - come to the Raptors  I saw your face when you knew Toronto was winning. Back of your head was young Stephen Curry, Toronto kid and son a Raptor - you liked seeing that win  Come home, Steph"
"Let’s be real buddy, Injuries had a lot to do with these games going to Raptors way. You really going to say Klay doesn’t isn’t good enough for at least a 5 point swing one way or the other?   For the series as a whole too, could you say that Durant healthy wouldn’t be worth at least another 5 point swing? Oh and Kevon Looney being healthy and able to play I to the 2nd half wouldn’t have had an impact? Oh wait. Also, Boogie still recovering from another injury? Oh yeah. And Stephen Curry recovering from a dislocated finger?"
"I'm a Pistons fan but I have to be honest, I don't love all of these Stephen Curry stats being thrown around alongside their supposed connotations.   What I saw for a significant portion of this series was a guy (Curry) being forced into a facilitator role down the stretch by a defense that knew it could double, triple, or trap him while often facing zero repercussions on account of Golden State's lack of supporting help.   I think one must consider what kind of player Curry is and how he typically thrives. If you give him any semblance of breathing room, you die, and if you close him off, he's liable to drive, kick, or initiate a ball movement process that's supposed to result in an able-bodied teammate getting an appropriate look that makes opponents pay for sending help to Curry in the first place. More times than not, those swings were ending up in the hands of guys like Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Quinn Cook, or DeMarcus Cousins this series, all of whom attempted at least 9 3-pointers but converted at less than a 31 percent success rate.   The real connotation should be that the Raptors played some great and smart basketball. Their game plan was logical and appropriate and their personnel executed it nearly flawlessly. Not to mention, Toronto applied top level pressure on the offensive side of the ball, constantly churning in key buckets and conversions that left Golden State scrambling to keep the game within arm's length.   On account of that Raptors pressure, a couple of Curry's fourth quarter 3-point attempts felt like they came from moments after a mid-to-late Raptors score that threatened to push the game out of reach where Curry seemed to try to take things into his own hands, rushing the ball back down the other side to take a go at one of his typical insane-o 3-point bombs.   Last night in particular, I'm just not totally sure what Curry could have done differently to induce better fourth quarter production. Every single screen was switched and jumped 25 feet from the hoop, largely because the repercussions for such defensive over aggression weren't there. And each time they put the ball in Curry's hands at the start of the offense, a defensive scramble would force him to get rid of it.   I mean, Curry left some shots out there too. Not going to get that twisted, but Toronto's whole goal was to x him out and hope the rest of the team couldn't compensate. They didn't."
Stephen 'Not a Finals MVP' Curry
"Right on. Had the Warriors not signed Kevin Durant, I imagine different forms of help would have been added to keep the team competitive. But if you go the All-Star heavy route, and one or more of those All-Stars go down, the trade-off is often a severe lack of depth.   This Warriors team isn't constructed to operate with Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, and Quinn Cook as the primary options along the perimeter and elsewhere when Stephen Curry is doubled the moment he crosses half-court or resting on the bench. But again, that's what happens when two of your options return from injury only to suffer a catastrophic injury and another never fully recovers from his own catastrophic injury (Cousins).   Also, the Raptors played really doggone well. Circumstances are circumstances, but the Raptors went out and won this championship."
"I do agree he obviously was the catalyst. But you’re joking if you think he’s an all time type winner.   He’s been bailed out soooooo much over the years by his support cast. I mean. Any time he has a bad game. He gets let off the hook by Klay going nuclear or Green turning on the offense out of nowhere.   Stephen Curry is an absolute marvel to watch but I really just don’t see in him what I see in Durant, LeBron James or even Chris Paul. Let alone the Kobe, Jordan type shit.   Special player but he’s prone to not doing the job in the defining moments."
"Stephen Curry is great player, but he can be slow down with length, athleticism, and good team defense. The Raptors defense goals don't let Curry shoot, hound him off ball, if curry comes offscreen switch, and they were willing to let other players shoot the ball. Stephen Curry not tall, long length, or crazy athleticism. Curry maximize the level of athleticism he has combined, shooting, ballhandling, screening, and body movements which makes him a great player just not on the level of individual talent of Kevin Durant, Lebron James, or Kawhi Leonard."

"Stephen Curry legit has a great family, must feel good having that support."
"Curry is the worst MVP who has ever played in the NBA finals.  What a garbage performance by Stephen Curry, completely outplayed in Fred Vanvleet, an undrafted 6ft guard.  He will NEVER win an FMVP or another title."
"It happened to Kobe and Lebron. I never really get it. It's just a game, why do people take this so seriously and personally.  Stephen Curry is a 6' 3"" guard who's not particularly athletic in the NBA. He would straight out murder everyone on Reddit in basketball, but Bob Myers even alluded that Curry doesn't have much to work with compared to everyone else in the NBA.  He has transformed the NBA with his shooting, willingness to run off ball, and to screen for others. Hell, teams love to switch onto him so he constantly has to defend the best player and he does that willingly too. He never gets any calls either. Anyone who has played sports before knows that what he does is exhausting and it fucking hurts."
".... still my point remains. If you ask any true fan of the sport what a box and 1 is, I'd be willing to bet you 80 percent could tell you. It's not like it's some new super secret tech used to stop Stephen curry."

Has Stephen Curry done something to you personally to make you this mad in the mid nba offseason? Do you want to show us where he touched you
"WTF are you talking about?  &gt; By Curry's second year in the program, his dead lifts could touch 400  &gt; pounds -- more than twice his bodyweight and second most on the  &gt; Warriors behind 6-foot-11, 265-pound center Festus Ezeli.  Source: [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14750602/how-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-got-best-worst-ankles-sports)"
"  Who were LeBrons amazing teammates from 2016-2018? They were all over the hill shooters with a Kevin love who was a bad fit in the small ball era. Him and Kyrie were the only co-stars.   Durant averaged more points than curry in 5 out of the last 6 postseasons with a slightly worse EFG% due to playing on the worse spacing team in the NBA. Durant is top 3 most unstoppable offensive player in NBA history and he’s the best midrange shooter of all time. Curry isn’t on his level in terms of dynamic scoring. LeBrons a superior scorer as well posting a similar TS% to curry the last 5 post seasons but averaging more points.  Curry more often than not sees the first pass out of the PnR than players Like LBJ and harden who swing the bullet pass to the corner.   Warriors are statistically the best passing and screening team in NBA history. Stephen Curry will absolutely not have the same effect on any other team. I literally just illustrated to you How point guards of other teams Get trapped but don’t have an elite playmaking big to influence their ‘advanced’ metrics.  Just think about this logically, Steph gets trapped from 30 feet off a screen and he gives up the ball to frank kaminsky instead of Draymond green, what will Frank do?  Fumble the ball? Or insert curry into the 2009 Cavs, What’s his use on that roster after getting trapped?   LeBrons offensive versatility, ability, size and playmaking translate to any team in the NBA because he’s the best floor raiser in League history.   In reference to Net rating tweet I linked, there’s a direct correlation between Draymond’s increasing production and warriors historic rise in 2015/2016 and 2017 before they decline in 2018.   I’m not arguing Steph vs Draymond, I’m arguing how Draymond is the guy in the passenger seat in regards to spearheading the warriors historic offense along with curry.  I don’t put much stock in PIPM as I’ve already argued or OBPM without context but if you want to use advanced stats, Curry has the steepest drop in NBA history in augmented Plus/Minus, OBPM (-.7) and  PIPM while Draymond has the highest increase in AUPM and PIPM.   https://youtu.be/BtL_zCF6qgQ  Starts at 2:55.   Draymond is just as vital to the warriors Offensive system due to unique traits, just as curry is.  Without him, the team doesn’t hit historic heights and it’s no coincidence that his increase in production in 2016 (top 7 in MVP voting coincided with Steph’s best year).   LeBron‘s offensive production and playmaking  isn’t predicated on a complimentary player of draymond greens caliber"
"He's in the perfect scheme to maximize his talents and where his weaknesses are camouflaged or dont matter. Perhaps more so than any other top 30-40ish player in the NBA. Things like poor playmaking, ball handling etc they show up in advanced metrics but they dont really end up mattering to GSWs bottom line so his perception doesnt meaningful suffer beyond people just making jokes about it  If you want to look at his drop offs from reg season to playoffs I think the otehr thing Id note is he for years has had a meaningful drop off whenever Steph isnt on the court. As in like his TS% the past 5 yrs on average drops like 6% without Steph it's as bad as anybody on GSW. [This MAtt Moore article from last yr is relevant Klay and Steph get the most wide open shots in the NBA despite everybody knowing how deadly they are](https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-klay-thompson-analysis).   But a good bit of that excess goes away in teh playoffs when teams consistently try every night, switch more and in general actually gameplan for GSW's motion offense which in the reg season catches teams off guard even if theyve played GSW before. Steph has counters he can create, he can be utilized more creatively and is far more expansive in his skill set than Klay. But Klay it's not so easy."
"&gt; LeBron rarely gets doubled because of size and vision to find the open player either at the rim or the three point line.   Wait so you're telling me they'd rather have LeBron have a 1v1 than a shooter shoot a 3? Who would have thought???  You really think LeBron wouldn't get doubled if the players he was passing to were garbage finishers? This is just an insane level of dissonance. You come across was really disingenuous.   &gt; I already provided you context as to how LeBron tailored historic offenses with minimal shooting (only Delonte west shot 40% on the 2009 Cavs)  The best offense he's ever led in the regular season was a +5.5 rORtg. Steph has tied/ecplised that FOUR times in the last 5 seasons.   That 2009 Cleveland offense was ""only"" +4.1 rORtg. Hardly a historic offense, and that was the best ""shooting depraved"" (not even true) teams he had at the time.   &gt; I provided you Strong correlation of Curry’s best production being directly in line with Draymond green’s production.   You quite literally didn't in any of the replies before.   &gt; and he’s the reason for warriors historically high powered offense.  Dude, you have no idea what you're talking about. Every single offensive metric paints him as ""just"" an above average to below average offensive player. Look at O-PIPM, O-RAPM, OBPM, ANYTHING. Like for the love of god actually look at some useful stats and interpret them with some competence.   &gt; Steph doesn’t have close to the same effect on any other team.  This is based on literally nothing. You just throw out blanket statements without any basis. O-RAPM predicts he has one of the smallest drop-offs offensively on a random team, with Harden having the biggest drop-off.   &gt; He will still play like a superstar but he won’t elevate the team to a historic offense while LBJ will with just spare parts.  LeBron has never led a historic offense in the regular season. He has in the post-season but that was when he had amazing teammates (Cleveland 2016-18 offenses)  &gt; Their strengths on ball are harder to take away than curry.  Oh. Is this why KD was a had around a 56 TS% in the playoffs (last 3 seasons in OKC) before coming to GSW?   And Steph averages more PPP in isolation than both of them.....  &gt; Here’s the reason why Warriors are a historic offense (https://twitter.com/datafox21/status/1134084175336747009?s=21)  Do you even know what you're fucking looking at? You have no idea how any statistic works.  1. This is citing correlation to net rating, NOT OFFENSE 2. This is not done on a GAME LEVEL, this is highly volatile  You could use O-PIPM, O-RAPM, OBPM, ANYTHING offensively speaking. Stephen crushes Draymond in any offense impact metric"
People often forget that Stephen Curry is the greatest shooter in the history of the game

"The late 2010s are fairly recent but from a historical perspective the Warriors were a jump shooting team lead by point guard Stephen Curry and won a title in 2015. After capping off a historic 73 win season by losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in a historic 3-1 comeback in 2016, they added former MVP Kevin Durant and proceeded to win titles in 2017 and 2018. This past year they were the favorites to win, but unfortunately suffered major injuries to their starting lineup and lost in 6 to the Toronto Raptors."
"&gt; They were 2nd in ORtg because Russ led the team that year unanimously. He finished higher in MVP voting without a narrative/story. He was just flat out more important to the team and ran the offense. KD was the one who capitulated up 3-1 and then Russ followed suit. But since GSW was so successful (see: Stephen Curry) KD gets a perma-pass now  1. KD had forty points in Game 5, as opposed to the 7 TOs (is that a record) that Russ had in Game 5 2. KD went 10/31 in a Game 6, whilst Russ went 10/27 with 5 TOs (one of them wrongly attributed to him) in Game 6 3. KD went 10/19 with twenty-seven points, as opposed to the 7/21 shooting for 19 points from Westbrook (with a +/- of -14, to KD's -4). 4. Russ shot 32% while being guarded by Steph, while Steph shot 44% from the field. He was thoroughly outplayed by his opposite number ([https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4lahpm/russell\_westbrook\_is\_shooting\_32\_against\_steph/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4lahpm/russell_westbrook_is_shooting_32_against_steph/))     Russ was the main reason why OKC lost those final three games and his subsequent THREE successive first round exits (losing to Harden, and a crippled Utah and Blazers team) highlights why OKC would've been so much better if it was just KD and Harden."
"Also, you said it yourself. They were 2nd in ORtg because Russ led the team that year unanimously. He finished higher in MVP voting without a narrative/story. He was just flat out more important to the team and ran the offense. KD was the one who capitulated up 3-1 and then Russ followed suit.

"oh and for Golden State - obviously Curry, Klay, and Draymond will have the most references, but Spreewell should be the most popular after them.   Stephen Jackson gets a bunch of shoutouts from Houston rappers   Arenas and Hardaway should have some love, as well some forgotten Run TMC mentions   Also, in Just Another Day - Too Short shouts out Gary Payton playing in a Seattle vs Golden State game   Bonus: before C-Webb was traded, the Luniz made a reference to him in Playa Hata off Operation Stackola"
- Bron  - Durant  - Chris Paul  - Harden  - Mark Gasol  - Stephen Curry  Are all clearly better then Melo. And one can make an arguemnt for others as well.

[Kawhi was better this season in both the regular season &amp; playoffs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id2_select=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=leonaka01&amp;idx=players) even though he had basically not played in 18 months  Curry is a liability on defense. Kawhi is arguably the most well rounded player in the league
"&gt; Giannis on a random team could struggle if he didn’t have spacing and teams could just clog the paint.  This is quite literally true for any player. Harden lives in a system that maximizes spacing  &gt;  The bucks were so deadly because you couldn’t do that or double Giannis since they’d make you pay on the perimeter.  Yes, and also because they had the best defense in the league lol   &gt; Harden conversely has balled on trash teams (2014-2015 rockets), and on great teams like the 2018 one  I never said he couldn't play well on any team. I'm saying he can't replicate his value right now on random teams because he's simply too ball-dominant. This is exactly why Stephen Curry is a better offensive player. If you use O-RAPM to predict offensive value on a random team, Harden has the biggest drop-off of any player.  I'd cite this but the statistic is behind a pay-wall on patreon. If you're interested go to Nathan Walkers patreon.  &gt;  WS, Vorp, OWS, BPM, OBPM, VA, EWA, RPM, and ORPM.  I mean, at least use ws/48 first of all, which had Giannis first. Secondly VA uses PER and just multiplies it by playing time. This is hardly a useful stat. Thirdly, EWA is heavily outperformed by WS, I don't find it all that useful. RPM is fine.   Meanwhile, Giannis outperformed Harden in PIPM, ws/48, LA-RAPM, D-PIPM, DBPM, DWS, and he had better lineup data.  &gt; Harden has had a individual impact only matched by LeBron since he’s been in Houston.  This is not true at all. Stephen Curry has consistently been at the top of PIPM, LA-RAPM and RPM since 2014-15.  &gt; usage arguments are tired, Harden happily took the backseat last year when Paul was performing  It's not that he took a back-seat but that his value comes from being ball-dominant. When Paul has the ball, Harden has negligible off-ball value   &gt; Harden is still capable. 1st in deflections, 2nd in steals, TOP 5 in blocks among Guards, 90th percentile in post defence.  He's straight up still a bad defender lol. Steals have never been a good predictor of defensive value, and his post-defense is hardly impactful.   This year he had a D-PIPM of -1.50, which is quite bad. He also had a D-RAPM of -0.38, also quite bad.  His lineup data is bad as well. The Rockets w/ Capela, Gordon, Tucker, and Paul had a DRtg of 109.58 w/ Harden, and w/o had a DRtg of 93.69.  Capela, Gordon and only Tucker had a DRtg of 114.19 w/ Harden and w/o had a DRtg of 99.19"
"&gt; Yes, he should have made the first team. He was second in the MVP Race and had a solid argument for winning it  [he was 9th in MVP](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2016.html) and quite obviously did not have a solid argument for winning over unanimous MVP Stephen Curry"

Important difference between 2011 and 2016 Finals:  1) 2011 Finals was primarily LeBron not playing anywhere near the 1st-Team All NBA player he was.  He averaged 17 PPG over 6 games (Bosh averaged 19, Wade averaged 27), with a 54% TS and lower usage than Bosh.  It wasn't only that LeBron choked, it was that he seemed to actively not even try to dictate the game.  It's not that he missed shots that he usually made, it was more so that he didn't take shots at all.  Couple this with the fact that the 2011 Mavericks team was by far the weakest team LeBron has ever played in the Finals and the weakest team out of the West to make the Finals since the 96 Supersonics (Or maybe the 06 Mavericks), and the narrative that LeBron choked is always going to be the main one when discussing 2011.  2) 2016 Finals was primarily about LeBron having an all-time great series and Kyrie having what may be the greatest ""sidekick"" performance in recent NBA history, than Stephen Curry truly playing horrible.  Steph underperformed for sure, but he still averaged 23 PPG, 5RPG 4APG on 40% 3PFG and 58% TS.  Those numbers are no where close to his MVP-historic numbers, but he didn't play absolutely horribly.  The team that wins narrative plays a large role in how people remember performances - he played much, much better in the 2016 Finals Game 7 than Kobe did in the 2010 Finals Game 7, but no one is going to mention Kobe going 6-24 if they win.  LeBron put up an absolutely historic 29/11/9 on 50% FG in one of the greatest NBA finals performances ever from Games 3-7.  Accordingly, I think the narrative that LeBron choked away the 2011 Finals and that LeBron dominated the 2016 Finals should hold more weight than saying Dirk dominated or that Steph choked (Even though those are obviously still factors)."

"...so did Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, and James Harden. All-Defensive team votes mean literally nothing."
That's exactly why I said Stephen Curry game 3 in the finals. The guy was diving for loose balls and playing good defense while doing most of the scoring load
"Imagine thinking someone who literally doesn't play defense, gives 150% every game. You want to see someone giving 150%? Look at Stephen Curry in game 3, dude was still diving for loose balls even though the game was basically lost. The only time Westbrook will try to get a loose ball is if someone is boxing out and it counts as a rebound."
Imagine if they drafted Stephen Curry in 2009 and/or Demarcus Cousins or Paul George in 2010.

Stephen Curry.
"The Warriors were never supposed to be a permanent home for KD. LeBron was supposed to retire on the Cavs. If it wasn't for Stephen Curry, LeBron would still be in Cleveland.   &gt;2015 Regular Season: 24/4/8  &gt;2015 Finals: 26/5/6  Wow, what a drop off.   Face it, you guys won't be relevant for at least another decade. And all because of Steph lol."
"Nicknames do not count, otherwise I’d have to add Stephen “baby faced assassin” Curry to the list and it’d be OP"
Stephen A Curry
"There's a drop-off after West, but Oscar is still in that 13-16 range all time.  KD is arguably there already too - After the ""Top 12"", the potential picks you can choose from 13-25 are players like Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Kevin Durant, Julius Erving, David Robinson, Stephen Curry, Isiah Thomas, Moses Malone, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett, John Stockton, Elgin Baylor, Dwayne Wade, Scottie Pippen.  I think KD is likely already in the 14-18 range in that list all-time - but to crack above Jerry West is possible, but to be above players like Hakeem / Shaq / Kobe / Duncan / Bird (The next players who are in the 7-11 range) there is CONSIDERABLE difference."
that's stephen b. curry to you.

I don't know who Steven Curry is but I hear that Stephen Curry guy is pretty darn good
*stephen curry has entered the chat*
Yeah and Stephen curry still carried y’all when he was gone. He came right back and y’all still lost and were down in game 6 with Klay on the court. What’s done is done move on.
"Imo Stephen Curry 2016, no other player I’ve seen comes close to that and I’m not a big Curry fan.   Revenge season because of how every one dissed the Warriors and wrote off their ring because of injuries."
"The brilliance shooting of stephen curry continues, and he ties his NBA record with his 12th 3 pointer of the game!"
"Those people aren't real fans. They KNEW Stephen Curry, a 6'3"" 180lb guard with questionable ankle health out of the highly-touted NCAA powerhouse Davidson College, would turn into a MVP GOAT shooter and lead the Warriors to 3 championships after 40+ years of drought. Bandwagoners suck"
I sure fucking hope so if the day comes where Stephen curry is not in a warriors uniform I will not know what to do with myself
He finished 7th in the [2019 American Century Championship celebrity golf tournament recently](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2845586-tony-romo-wins-2019-american-century-championship-stephen-curry-finishes-7th).
"It blows my mind how a team with Stephen fucking curry, DLO, draymond, and quality role players is ranked below the raptors with no kawhi"
"Why do you keep talking about the team when we're talking about Stephen Curry?  &gt;just saying the MDA's system isn't perfect enough for a ring   Just good enough to make deep runs on the Suns and the closest team to dethroning the Warriors big 4. They would've beat them if they didn't get KD.  &gt; So yea, Curry would still be a great under Jackson, but I'd still question if he'd have a ring.   Which is again, a matter of team. You're completely changing the topic from Curry's shooting to the Warriors, not Curry, the Warriors winning rings. This started with you make false statements about the Warriors. Not even opinions, just actual objective information you made up instead of looking up the facts."
Stephen Curry and D'Angelo Russell
&gt; Stephen Curry  lol
Not the first guy to dominate LeBron.  Just off the top of my head:  - Tim Duncan  - Kawhi Leonard  - JJ Barea  - Jason Terry  - Kevin Durant  - Stephen Curry
Keep a 30 on me like Stephen Curry
I wonder if Stephen Curry on the remix.
"Dude, Curry has been attempting a ton of 3s for a long time. Nothing Curry is doing is new for him. The main difference is his teammates got better and their system improved. He's been taking a high volume of 3s and shooting crazy shots forever. MJax was the one pushing Curry and Klay to shoot more calling them the best shooting backcourt and possibly the best backcourt in the NBA back when the Warriors were viewed the way the Blazers were viewed the past few years.

"I’m going to get downvoted for this, but I think John Stockton was vastly underrated and has an argument for being comparable to Stephen Curry.   Obviously, Curry is a better pure shooter than Stockton. He also is a better dribbler and quicker, but there are arguments for Stockton.   Stockton was a better defender than Curry. He is the NBA all time steals leader. Despite being small and lacking athleticism, he was a tough defender who scrapped and fought on defense. He also seemed to have this genius level anticipation where the ball was going and would beat more athletic opponents to the spot.   Stockton made more plays for his teammates while turning the ball over less. He averaged more assists while making fewer turnovers.  He and Magic Johnson might have been the greatest of all time when it came to setting up their teammates with an assist.    I’d argue that someone who stops his man from scoring more consistently, steals the ball more, turns over the ball less and makes all of his teammates a threat to score with his amazing court vision and passing ability can give Curry a run for his money.    And yes, Curry has more rings.  But I’m talking about who is the better individual player on the court, not who won more in their career."
[No single player has a better plus/minus over the last 5 years than Curry](https://www.wsj.com/articles/stephen-curry-changed-the-game-by-changing-every-game-11559140592) He dramatically improves the Warriors when he's on the court. If that's not elite playmaking I don't know what is.

"&gt;Contrary to popular perception, poverty and broken homes are underrepresented in the NBA, not overrepresented. For example, while 45 percent of black male children in the U.S. live in households earning no more than 150 percent of the poverty line ($22,050 for a family of four in 2010), just 34 percent of black athletes in the NBA grew up in that financial situation, according to Dubrow and Adams.   And  &gt;According to research conducted in 2009 by The Mag, NBA players come from hometowns with a median population of around 110,000, and that population is 59 percent white and as educated as the U.S. as a whole.  And  &gt;A new study says arriving to the NBA is more likely for players that come from wealthier, two-parent families, all but eschewing an outdated, presumptive narrative that most elite black athletes overcome poverty on their way to the top.  And   &gt;Growing up in a wealthier neighborhood is a major, positive predictor of reaching the N.B.A. for both black and white men. Is this driven by sons of N.B.A. players like the Warriors’ brilliant Stephen Curry? Nope. Take them out and the result is similar.  https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/6777581/importance-athlete-background-making-nba  https://www.blackenterprise.com/nba-players-less-likely-come-poor-backgrounds-study/amp/   NBA players coming from poor urban areas was mostly true in the 70s. But it hasn’t been true for a while now."

Hey interesting post but I don’t agree with Some of the comments you’ve made.  1. Why do you think Stephen Curry will get injured? I understand he has had a history of injuries but I don’t think he would get injured especially with Russell running the ball mainly allowing Stephen Curry to make better shots and spend less energy.  2. If I recall correctly didn’t Steve Kerr go through surgery and spent a decent time off from coaching while Brown took over? I think they still had a remarkable record that year and continued to dominate the league especially people like Westbrook harden and Chris Paul.  3. I think draymond will remain a warrior forever and I don’t see mike brown being the laissez fair coach he is to impose any tension on his players especially with the history and success that they both share.  32-48 that sounds like the rockets record next season.
For Klay you obviously should have added “and kills Stephen Curry” at the end

"I am a chinese, and i think there might be people behind this, maybe the people who didn't get his sign couple days ago, because this video was not the first thing that people  focused on, it was a post about  Donovan Mitchell not signing for fans in his private time, then this video was shown and i think this video was last year when he came to China.   The biggest problem is somehow the guy who posted this video translated the word ""Chilling"" into the meaning of being noisy or annoying instead of being cool or relax, so people believed that he was calling the people who waited there noisy or annoying, with the laughing and crying emoji people thought that he was mocking the chinese fan and people used that to make him looked like he was against all chinese fans, and somehow there were people who explained or corrected the meaning of ""Chilling"" got no attention and the people who tried to say something good about Donovan they called them licking **(lick generally means being loyal even that person disrespect you)** him or trying to wash **(wash generally** **means getting rid of some bad image from a guy)** for him.   And i think there is one more reason why this thing happen, because other big names like Stephen Curry, James Harden, Klay Thompson etc when they came to China, they did something that people can talk about, for Klay, he played basketball with hoopers, failed the 360 dunk, ate chinese food or even tried dancing with chinese people, for James, he got caught for riding electronic bike wrongly and it became a meme saying James can get whistle anywhere or the traffic police is the only guy who can guard him one on one in China, for Stephen who is a Mr nice guy, so nothing more to say, even Derrick Rose riding bike delivering shoes for his fans and cried when he saw the video made by his fans, but Donovan is like going to the venue for business then back to hotel then repeat this pattern and not signing when it is not business hour, it is totally fine and  professional if you are Kobe or Lebron, beacause they are big and they have their image, the people who tried to say something bad about them is hard, but it is not hard to do this to Donovan when his image is not a Mr nice guy instead they think his is here only for business even when other stars were here for business too, but they have their non-business side to see.  I am just here to say something that i saw and something that i know, i think it is so unfair that the foreign stars get charged on a forum that they don't use, and they don't even know that there are people saying something bad behind them and some people might believe these rumors, the most notable examples are D-wade and Allen Iverson in Hupu, every time when people talk about which NBA stars who are not friendly to fans, there will be people calling these two names, and i did see people explain or clarify for them but not much people care, maybe these impressions were too old to clarify , so i wonder if this is how D-wade and AI got their label  just because they didn't know and couldn't explain. It is hard to explain after the getting charged with so call ""evidence"" , because whatever you say is licking that guy or trying to wash, even an official explanation would seem like an official way to handle charges like this, hope that there will not be another JJ Redick."

It depends really. There are times it would be right to take Kawaii Leonard over Stephen Curry and vice versa depending on what kind of team you have already. So I would rank them roughly the same.
How do you get [GSW] Stephen Curry on your name??

And guess what a lot of point guards won’t win in this era because of Stephen Curry. Stockton wouldn’t be but another cp3 in stephs era
"But if you're the sort of person who buys a season ticket, you should probably be a real fan of that franchise. Teams have good seasons and bad ones. If you genuinely care about them, watching them piece together something and see it in real time would be incredible. Everyone sees Stephen Curry *now* but who did in 2010?"

"also, I recommend watching players' highlights from previous years to understand how good these guys are.  Idk how long you've cursory followed the NBA, but for the Modern NBA age I'd begin reading season review from 2010 onwards. You seem pretty enthusiastic so, i'll try to give a synopsis of the past 8-9 years   In 2010 the Lakers and Celtics, greatest rivalry in the NBA, faced off in the NBA finals. The series went to the max 7 games, and the Lakers beat the Celtics for their second straight championship (back to back). Kobe Bryant won his 5th NBA championship and was named finals MVP (best player of the series). The Lakers and Celtics are the NBA's largest superpowers and two most historic/storied franchises.  However, that summer the entire NBA would change. The best player in the world, 2x reigning MVP, LeBron James decided to 'take his talents to South Beach' in an unprecedented power move via the televised event 'The Decision'. LeBron decided to form a team through free agency, teaming up with his great friend Dwyane Wade (3rd best player in the NBA) and fellow all-star Chris Bosh. The Heat were the most reviled team in the NBA, and were expected to waltz to a ring. However, in 2011 a young star emerged, Derrick Rose. Rose led the Chicago Bulls to the #1 seed in the eastern conference and won MVP. Nonetheless, LeBron choked in the 2011 finals, and Dirk Nowitzki led the Dallas Mavericks to surprise championship with an amazing NBA finals and playoff run.  In 2012 Miami looked like the dominant team again, obtaining the best record in the Eastern conference. LeBron James easily won his 3rd MVP, and Kevin Durant finished second. Additionally, in 2012 the OKC thunder finally emerged as a contender. They were led by 23 year old superstar Kevin Durant (KD), 23 year old all-star Russell Westbrook, and a future star James Harden. During the 1st round, Derrick Rose tore his acl vs the Philadelphia 76ers. The injury would set Rose back years and he was never the player he was before the injury. In the conference finals, the Heat faced elimination in game 6 away vs Boston. LeBron put on an all-time great performance to clinch victory and force a game 7, which the heat won. Conversely, OKC emerged as a young super team, beating the spurs in a close 6 game series. The heat would vanquish the thunder in 5 games in the NBA finals, with a blowout in game 5. LeBron would win his 1st ring and claim finals MVP.  In 2013, arguably the most consequential move in the modern nba occurred. During the off-season, the OKC Thunder traded young talent James Harden to the Rockets for picks. Also, the Lakers attempted to create a super team by adding Dwight Howard and Steve Nash to their team with Kobe. During the season, LeBron stamped his mark as the games best player. He won his 4th MVP, and had one of the most dominant seasons of all-time. The Heat won 27 straight games at one point. In the West, OKC and the Spurs were dominant forces. The Lakers had flopped as a super team, but Kobe's heroics had buoyed the Lakers to a playoff seed. Nonetheless, Kobe tore his achilles at the end of the season vs Golden State. In the playoffs, OKC's hopes were dashed during the 1st round. Russell Westbrook tore his meniscus on a controversial play, after he crashed into Patrick Beverly of the Houston Rockets. Westbrook would miss the rest of the playoffs and the Thunder lost to the Memphis Grizzlies. The Grizzlies were known for their grit-n-grind play, emphasizing slower offensive possesions and tough physical defense. As the Heat made their way through the east (they had a great ecf series with the pacers), the consistent San Antonio Spurs did the same in the West. The Spurs are one of the greatest dynasties in American sports. Helmed by the greatest coach ever, Greg Poppovich, and the legendary Tim Duncan, the Spurs never won less than 50 games from 1999 to 2013. The Spurs were a machine. In arguably the greatest NBA finals of all-time, the Spurs had a chance to clinch the title in game 6. Now old, Tim Duncan had turned back the clock in the first half with an amazing performance to give the Spurs a comfortable lead. During the 4th quarter, LeBron James went on the charge and took over the game. He willed the Heat back from their deficit. However, the Spurs were still up 4 with 37 sec left. In the ensuing drama (you must watch it) the Heat came back, and Ray Allen hit arguably the clutches shot ever to keep Miami's hopes alive. LeBron would then take over game 7 leading Miami to their 2nd straight title and his 2nd finals MVP. (I'm serious, Heat vs Spurs 2013 is one of the greatest NBA series ever)  In 2014, KD won his first MVP. With Westbrook hurt, KD carried the Thunder to the 2nd best record in the West. LeBron was still the NBA's best player, but the Heat's deep playoff runs were taking a toll and Wade had substantially declined over the past few years. The Spurs, however, were merciless in their pursuit of a 5th championship since 1999. The met the Heat for a rematch and played arguably the greatest basketball ever, destroying the Heat in games 3-5. Budding star Kawhi Leonard was named finals MVP.  In 2015, the NBA changed permanently and a new superstar left his indelible mark on the NBA. During the offseason, LeBron decided to go back home and return to Cleveland. He formed a superteam with young all-star Kyrie Irving and all-star Kevin Love. The cavs had arguably the greatest luck ever in the lottery, and had back to back #1 picks in the NBA draft. They traded Anthony Bennet (a bust) and Andrew Wiggins for Kevin Love, a 20 points and 10 rebs machine on the timberwolves. The Cavs would have an up and down season, with LeBron missing time due to a back injury. However, they would make the playoffs and led by the King, make the finals. In the West, a revolution occurred. The young talented Golden State Warriors hired Steve Kerr as head coach. Kerr transformed the Warriors and they emerged as the best team in the NBA (67 wins) during the regular season. Stephen Curry, Skyfucker, transformed the NBA into a simple math fact: 3&gt;2. He won MVP and made the most 3s ever in a season. His fellow splash brother Klay Thompson was an all-star and a new young combative defensive anchor Draymond Green anchored the warriors. They faced off against LeBron's cavs in the 2015 finals. Kevin Love was hurt against the celtics and missed the finals. Kyrie Irving injured himself during game 1 and was out for the series. Essentially, the series became LeBron vs the Warriors. LeBron did everything and led the Cavs to a 2-1 lead vs golden state. However, the firepower of golden state was too much and they beat the cavs in 6 games. Andre Iguodala, LeBron's primary defender, was controversially named finals MVP.  In 2016, the NBA season was all about the Warriors. Steph Curry took his 3pt shooting prowess to 5 levels higher and drained 400 3s. The Warriors won an NBA record 73 games including a legendary thriller vs OKC (watch this game). Also in the west, the Spurs still remained supreme. They won 67 games and were led by superstar Kawhi Leonard. The Thunder were finally fully healthy, as KD had finally recovered from a jones fracture injury that plagued him for 2 years. The Cavs marched to the finals in the East, led by King James and a much improved Irving and Love. In the West, the Thunder beat the spurs in a tight 6 game series (western conference semi finals). The moved on to face the warriors in the conference finals. During the wcf, the Thunder took a 3 game lead against the warriors. Draymond Green kicked Steven Adams in the balls a few time, but wasn't suspended. In game 5 the Warriors won at home. In game 6, the Thunder looked to finish the Warriors off. They held sizeable lead, but the Splash Brothers, especially Klay Thompson kept the Warriors in it. His 41 pts and 11 3pters along with Curry's  31 points finished off their comeback and forced a game 7. In game 7, Curry performed like an MVP and the Warriors overcame a 3-1 deficit to reach their second straight NBA finals. The Warriors were now attempting to finish the greatest NBA season of all-time. The 3-1 blown lead by the Thunder would become a huge storyline in the future. In the NBA finals (another must watch) the Cavs looked for revenge. However, the Warriors ran out to a 3-1 lead and all hope looked lost for Cleveland. During game 4, Draymond Green had slapped LeBron in the dick, and was suspended for an accumulation of flagrant foul points. He would miss game 5. In game 5, LeBron and Kyrie put up legendary performances, each scoring 41 points and answering everything the Warriors had. The series was now 3-2 heading back to cleveland. In game 6, the Cavs ran off to a massive lead. LeBron was running the show; scoring, assisting, rebounding, and playing fabulous defense. He scored 41 points again an added 11 rebounds and 8 assists. The series was heading back to Oracle Arena (gsw' home) for the pivotal game 7. Game 7 was a close game that came down to the last few min. It was a battle of attrition for two fatigued teams. With the game tied, the Warriors got a rebound and were quickly on the fastbreak. Curry threaded a pass to Iguodala, but LeBron came out of nowhere to block it. Then, Kyrie Irving hit a fade-away 3 to put the Cavs up by 3. Kevin Love then stopped Curry and forced him into an awful 3pter, which he missed. The Cavs ended clevelands curse, and won the 2016 finals. LeBron was named finals MVP. He led the NBA finals in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks; he's the only player to ever do so in an NBA finals. The Warriors blew a 3-1 lead, but their biggest prize was coming. After game 7, Draymond Green sat in the Oracle parking lot and made a phone call to one Kevin Durant, asking him to join the Warriors during free agency.  During 2016 free agency, the NBA had a new TV deal, so the salary cap increased substantially. In pursuit of the hardest road, KD joined GSW."
"Lebron would win back to back championships with Jordan, and win FMVP both times, which would start the GOAT debate right off the bat.   But when Jordan leaves, the awful Wizards management does nothing to surround Lebron, and Lebron misses the finals on his own. He might have won a league MVP, but the ring is the thing. Questions arise as to whether the chosen one was really great, or whether he was riding the coattails of the 8 time champion MJ.   After yet another disappointment in 2005, Lebron's first free agency looms, and he decides to join up with a new friend in Miami - a young Dwyane Wade, and an old Shaq. The Miami Big 3 is formed, and demolish the Mavericks in 2006 with no questions about refereeing. In 2007 though, they meet up against the Tim Duncan Spurs, and Dwyane Wade having succumbed to injuries means Lebron loses his 1st finals. And 2008 he fails to see the playoffs. With 3 rings and 3 finals MVPs, he has defined himself as one of the top 2 to ever play - but with a finals loss and sporadic finals appearances, he might have just found his ceiling at that #2 spot.  But Lebron doesn't take things lying down. In 2009, he wins his 2nd MVP, and faces up against Kobe and the Lakers. Kobe has his own business to prove - that he can win one without Shaq. But Lebron doesn't care about Kobe's legacy, and takes yet another ring for himself. And in 2010, Kobe gets a rematch but Lebron wins yet again. And in 2011, Chris Bosh joins up with Miami to form what is seen as an even more potent Big 3.   But over in the West, the Dallas Mavericks come out of nowhere to silence the 5-time champion Lebron James, preventing him once again from completing a 3peat. Jordan starts to point this out - saying that he's the only one who could achieve such a feat. This fuels Lebron's fire even more, and the Mavericks upset especially humbles him. A new Lebron is formed, one that leads the Heat to back-to-back championships against the Thunder and the Spurs. Lebron with 7 rings, 7 FMVPs, and 5 league MVPs. It's 2014, and Lebron sees the Spurs one more time to achieve the coveted yet elusive 3peat.  But a young Kawhi Leonard and the Popovich-signature beautiful basketball of the Spurs prevail, and Lebron sits broken. He knows he needed that 1 ring to tie Jordan, that 1 ring to get the 3peat that had evaded him. Lebron is frustrated with the Heat organization and the players, and after talks with his mother and family, decides to do something he's always dreamed of in the back of his mind.  ""Cleveland- I'm coming home."" The boy from Akron returns, and as Lebron is tearing up the East with Kyrie and Klove, his new flame might be ignited by the West's Splash Brothers. And with injuries plaguing Lebron's team in the finals, Stephen Curry and his partners in crime win their first championship.   And the going gets even worse. While the Cavaliers deal with locker room drama, firing David Blatt only to hire Tyronn Lue, a coaching unknown, the champion Warriors are breaking records left and right, until they demolish the barrier that is 72 wins. A 73-9 team. The media runs wild. Every ESPN talking head talks about how Curry is the modern-day Jordan, an elite scorer, but most importantly - talk about how even MJ himself couldn't stop this team.  Well maybe MJ couldn't, but down 3-1, Lebron and the Cavaliers fight their way back from oblivion, and Lebron James hoists his 8th trophy to the sky.   He might not have achieved the 3peat, but he has achieved greatness in his own right. People debate on whether Lebron's achievements outshone MJs, and the vote on who is the GOAT is nearly evenly split. Lebron returning to two more finals in a weak East but losing to the KD-Warriors only makes the waters more murky, and when he moves to LA and shows weakness for the first time with a groin strain, people think the legend is over. But come 2020, the script might change once more."
And part of being the best player on the floor is being available to actually play. Stephen Curry was the Warriors best player in the series because he was available to play and averaged 30 on 59 TS% while being the focal point of the Raptors defensive scheme.   So lets say Curry gets injured and misses the same amount of time that Klay did. You think Klay is still averaging 26 on 70 TS%? What do you think the Raptors would do to him when every other Warriors player was unreliable as a shooter? It's very disingenuous to compare their statistical performances when the circumstances were not the same.
Australian media reported that some fans were issued refunds because they bought tickets based on promotional materials depicting Stephen Curry and LeBron James. Neither is on the team.
Stephen Curry with a 40 inch vert
"By the way, the commenter of the video also has Curry as the best player in the NBA. Whether you disagree or not is up to you, but OP has deliberately ignored the rest of Taylor's comments on Stephen Curry.  I respectfully suggest we lynch him."
"Yep they sure did. Too bad the rockets keep getting fucked by Stephen curry, Stephen curry, Stephen curry and warrrriors."
"1) Curry wasn't in his prime in the Mark Jackson era. Still, he was very very good. 2) Harden's not multidimensional (no post threat), neither is Davis (no passing). Also no one that you listed has an  aspect in their game of coming off screens like Curry. Also, Curry is too unathletic to be a post threat, however, he has the prodigal shooting over everyone (catch and shoot, off the dribble, contested/uncontested it simply doesn't matter). 3) Curry is the best 3 pt shooter ever. 4) MDA's offence is primarily based of high volume 3 pt shooting, doesn't matter how you get the shot. No one has ever been better at high volume 3 pt shooting than Stephen Curry ever. EVER."
Never forget that Stephen Curry asked for a switch while girding Fred Van Vleet.
Who in their mind thinks Stephen Curry is better than Kobe Bryant.
"&gt; What makes Stephen Curry better than Giannis  A few years ago, the NBA changes the rules so that a a made field goal shot from a farther distance away counts as 3 points instead of 2. Kind of a stupid gimmicky carnival-game like rule in my opinion, and one unlikely to last, but for as long as it remains, Steph Curry, given his range, has a certain type of value that a player like Giannis with a more limited range doesn't really have."
"FG% in the playoffs, 4th Q or OT, 2:00 or less, score within 5 points:  Player | FG/FGA | FG% ---|---|---- Stephen Curry | 12/32 | 37.5% LeBron James | 34/98 | 34.7%"
Stephen Curry might be the best PG at setting screens.

"&gt;Yeah no, Warriors were the 7th best defensive team in '16, became the 2nd best defensive team in '17 despite losing Bogut. Wrong.

No. Ok, why does he play off the ball? Because he is a better scorer than when he is on ball, because he has to get open with screens?  He's literally a better scorer on the ball and off the ball.   &gt;Ok. Does KD play PG? No. So why the fuck would he run PnR?  Because it's extremely efficient. When did only PG's run the PnR? All scorers do it! LOL!  &gt;""Higher rate"" Ok. So why the fuck KD got 4 scoring titles to Curry's 1, lead the playoff overall PPG 5 times to Curry's 0, and has a higher career PPG than Curry?  Durant has lead the league 4 times, Curry 1.  And Curry dominates his opponents so badly that he often doesn't need to play the fourth quarter. That's why you have to look at points per minute or possession. Efficiency is also important.    &gt;Spell properly. But Ok. Why the fuck did Pat Bev guard him when Curry got Shamet. Why the fuck did KD get PJ when Curry got CP3. So why the fuck did KD get Kawhi, coming off an injury when Curry was getting guarded by VanVleet? Never gets defended by the best defenders when KD is on the court. Never.  &gt;I don't have to respond to the rest of your comment because you clearly don't know what to say because you know you're wrong. I have thoroughly enjoyed this. Thanks.  BAHAHAHA!! This is a joke! Curry is legendary for his gravity and the defensive attention he gets! It's like trying to argue that he isn't a good shooter!!!!!  Jesus, even LeBron and KD double teamed Curry in the fucking All-Star game!!! NO ONE gets more respect form the defense than Stephen Curry. NO ONE!"
Other NBA players make boneheaded plays (Stephen Curry errant passes) but because Shaq kept playing JaVale up and upping his memeability it kind of hurt.
Yep it totally is. But he could’ve just set up a Stephen and Ayesha Curry foundation and nothing else. at least he’s giving to a historically black university’s sports team in a sport that sees African Americans severely underrepresented

"Read my post. The entire postseason is a clutch stage. No one in their right minds would EVER chose Chauncey Billups over Stephen Curry on a playoff stage. So why are you isolating ""last second shot"" when Curry's upgrade over Billups would eliminate the scenario of a last second shot if it would even come to that.   YOU try to think. In a game where Billups has to take a last second shot, Curry lifts the team above that circumstance. In a game where Billups can't bring his team to a last second shot, Curry gets his team to that circumstance."
"So you think Lillard is a more clutch playoff performer than Kobe Bryant on the basis of his GW exploits in the postseason, even though he tends to fall apart in the playoffs when facing increased competition. You would say Chauncey Billups is more reliable in a clutch time scenario than Stephen Curry in the playoffs based on these statistics even though he is far more inconsistent on a playoff stage in general and doesn't attract half of the defensive attention.  The problem with your perspective is you're ignoring that the playoffs in GENERAL are a stage for clutch performance. Not just the last ten of twenty four seconds of a game, and that not all GW attempts are equal."
"HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  &gt; KD does not have a real argument over Stockton. He is a much better scorer, but that's really it. Stockton is just as good a shooter, vastly superior passer, much higher durability, and consistently better defender (only time KD showed he was a better defender is when he plays next to 3 all-stars).  KD is a significantly better scorer, is the better shooter with volume.   Stockson is not the defender KD was... Stockson's match ups against quality PG in the playoffs are extremely underwhelming.   &gt; Between Stephen and Stockton, it’s not even contest. Curry is a better shooter and aggressive scorer, but that’s about it. Stockton on the other hand, is a significantly superior passer and defender. Durability wise, no contest. Stockton is an iron man.  Yeah no.   Curry is much, much better than Stockton. Received far more fixation and lead his team to heights Stockton could only dream about.  KD and Curry's peak is so much higher than Stockton that Stockton himself would be shocked if people believe Stockton was better."

Wasn’t better than Stephen Curry or Isiah Thomas
Two time unanimous mvp Stephen Curry
"Oscar Robertson, Jerry West and Stephen Curry would be my Top 3."
"What? Are you joking?   Anyways, google search data shows Lebron is way more popular than Curry:  https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=lebron%20james,stephen%20curry"
"Draymond declined offensively because they didn’t need him to be good at offense. Although I think he probably shouldn’t have had that mentality, he obviously did. He knows he has to score more this season. Yes, Stephen curry is injury prone but if he manages to play at least 70 games, I think the warriors are gonna be higher than a 6 seed."
"LeBron built that culture, when he left, the culture left with him. Stephen curry is the engine that created the culture, he’s still there and I’m pretty sure he’s gonna play like he has something to prove."
"Yes, Stephen curry is a champion, the culture in golden state is winning. I don’t think steph will allow the team to deviate from that culture."
"Culture alone will take golden state to the playoffs, there is no way in hell Stephen curry is going to allow them to miss the playoffs."
Stephen Curry and Draymond Green
"Warriors guards :some scrubs named Stephen Curry , Klay Thompson, and D’Angelo Russell."
Lmao you're ignorant as hell dude. Klay has had Steph and Draymond his whole career and KD for a little. Warriors FO also know how to build a team unlike OKC.  Klay can't create for others and can't reliably create his own shot. I wonder how he would look on a team without Stephen Curry. Not to mention he's coming off an ACL injury.   If you really think Klay is a better than Russ I don't know what to tell you.
"&gt;I’ve seen multiple posts about us “dumping” him for Danilo Gallinari when Kelly has a 58.3 career TS% and Danilo has 58.8 career TS% and Danilo is made of glass and expiring.  This is some information on Danilo Gallinari that would be relevant to that assertion. Take a look, and tell me how Kelly Olynyk provides even 50% of that overall value. If you need even more context or additional deatil (frequency, sample size, etc, plus other numbers) here's the entire compendium: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/143viGobcP9Puj-26sP20OrJPOeRP_0TMW6-moWqYfTs/edit)    -In 2018/19, 46.3 FG%/43.3 3P%/90.4 FT% shooting splits on 5.5 3PA per game and 6.0 FTA per game (usage rate of 23.8, good for the 89.5th percentile in the league)  -1st in the NBA in PointsPerPossession last season (among players with at least 1,000 posessions). In 2016/17, he ranked 2nd among the 73 NBA players who used 1,000+ possessions, behind only Kevin Durant  -13th in NBA history (5th among active players) in ORTG (118)  -29th in NBA history with a FT% of 87.1% (a career FTr of .450, compared to Olynyk's FTr of .264, and a FT% of 76.5%)  -.142 career WS/48 (.191 last season) compared to Olynyk's .128 (.126 last year)  -21st all-time in TO% (8.9%, to Olynyk's 14.7%)  -In 18/19, 1st out of 87 players (to play in at least 50 games and average at least 0.5 possessions per game) in PPP in post-up possessions (1.15)  -Also that season, 1st of all those same 87 guys in Free Throw Frequency in the post (26.9%, and his 90.4% from the line was also 1st of those 87 players)  - Other PPP possession types as follows:  -**91.3rd percentile on Spot-Ups**   -**69.2nd percentile on Iso** PPP  -**92nd percentile as PnR ball handler**   -**91.6th percentile as the PnR Roll Man**  -**82.4th percentile in Transition**   -**78.3rd percentile on Cuts**   -**91.8th percentile Off Screens**    -**97.7th percentile on “Misc”**   -**85th percentile (1.01 PPP) Off The Dribble** (as of 2/28/19)   -**90th percentile (1.28 PPP) on Catch-And-Shoot opportunities** (as of 2/28/19  -Only 1 of 2 players (Stephen Curry was the other) that ranked in the top 5 in both 3-point percentage (43.3 percent -5th) and free throw percentage (90.4 percent – 4th)  -shot 44-for-45 (98 percent) on clutch free throws, the best mark among players who attempted at least 25  -23rd in the NBA in charges drawn last year (12)  -The only NBA player 2016/17 to provide positive value in all 14 (7 offensive and 7 defensive) play types. In addition that season, opponents didn’t shoot better than 39 percent in any action that Gallinari was part of defending.   Gallo has always been a starter (and finisher) who has always been matched up with the other team's best forward defender for his entire career (save sometimes in the first 2/3rds of last season, and he played even better actually after the Tobias trade). He's averaged nearly 10 minutes more per game throughout his entire career, has been asked by his team to do much more for himself and others than Olynyk, has been much more the focus of the other teams' game plans than Kelly. Not to mention Olynyk has spent the majority of his career surrounded by more talent, and playing in the Eastern Conference.  If you want to argue that his injury history kills his value, you'll get no argument from me. But to quote the true shooting percentages without context to act like Olynyk is just as or almost as good is blatantly dishonest."
"&gt;The USA Basketball roster from the 2010 World Championship in Turkey boasted Derrick Rose, Eric Gordon, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry and Kevin Love.  I don't think Eric Gordon helps the argument"
"Yep, Stephen Curry is playing as long as he doesn't get injured.  Lebron might be back for one last olympics as well."
"Jason Kidd was—and still is—one of the greatest floor generals I've ever seen. It's interesting and difficult to compare him to guys like Stephen Curry and Russell Westbrook because their games make it seem as though they're playing a different position entirely.  In terms of running a team, evoking the best out of the supporting talent provided, seeing the court, delivering the ball at just the right time to all the right players in innovative ways, and having that Larry Bird knack for seeing the play before the play before the play that's going to lead to the play, I don't think there's a single player in the modern NBA who eclipses Jason Kidd in that regard.  Ranking these guys as point guards gets weird though because while I don't think Stephen Curry has nearly the same court general mastery as Kidd, I *do* think he positively impacts the game to astronomical levels on account of the other stuff he does, largely thanks to being the greatest shooter of all-time (ex: knowing the exact right play to make when teams begin trying to take away his shot, often leading to great opportunities for teammates)."
"The Lakers have Lebron James, Anthony Davis, and that Kuzma guy.  The Warriors have Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and now D-Lo.  The Lakers have more depth than the Warriors but it's the Warriors.  In conclusion I would take the Charlotte Hornets."
"**Best regular season record:** Denver Nuggets because I feel they will be the best team in the Western Conference that does not have star players resting for load management.  I predict the Clippers and Lakers will have early chemistry issues as well as resting their stars and saving energy for the post season.  The Nuggets are a young team with good chemistry that should continue their regular season success in the 2019-2020 season.  **Best regular season record in the other conference:** Philadelphia 76ers.  I think the Bucks lost valuable pieces in Brogdon and Mirotic.  I do not see Wesley Matthews filling the shoes of a 50/40/90 shooter.  The 76ers have to incorporate new pieces as well but I think defensively they will be on par with the Bucks and given Tobias Harris has had more time to learn the team's offense, I think he could be a big scorer for them at the wing position.  **Worst regular season record:**  Phoenix Suns.  This seems like a team with no direction despite having good young talent.  Could be under 20 wins again as the West has gotten so much better.  **Regular season MVP:**  Stephen Curry since he will have to carry the Warriors' offensive load in the absences of Durant and Thompson.  Russell will help out, but in trying to fill the void of 47.5 PPG, Curry could have a monster year.  My only fear with this prediction is the NBA's history of giving the award to high seeded teams.  I can't see the Warriors being higher than the 5th seed next year so we'll see how my prediction holds up.  Westbrook did win it at the 6th seed two years ago.  **Rookie of the Year:**  Zion Williamson.  Most talked about in the media, insane skillset to perform day 1 in the NBA.  **Defensive player of the Year:**  Rudy Gobert.  I think he will continue his run as DPOY since the award is usually given to a big man and I predict the Jazz to be a very successful team this year.  **Most improved:**  I'll risk sounding crazy and say Tobias Harris.  This is a player that averaged 20 PPG last season, and over 15 PPG the last 4 seasons of his career.  It's hard to believe that he could improve any more.  However, at age 27 with no more Jimmy Butler on his team and another year to learn the system, I think he could become a primary ball handler in clutch situations.  He is the best wing player on his team, I could see him having an All-Star season in the Eastern conference, and averaging close to 25 PPG.  This is my most risky prediction and I'm prepared to be completely wrong.  **6th man of the Year:**  Lou Williams.  With Kawhi and even Paul George coming off of some injury troubles, I could see Doc Rivers giving Williams a lot of minutes still.  Especially when they are blowing out teams.  I think his stats as a ""6 man"" could get inflated that way and even without the extra minutes he is the most consistent bench scorer in the NBA, I think he will get another 6MOTY award.  **Coach of the Year:**  Mike Malone to go hand in hand with my best record prediction.  The defensive energy that Malone has created around this team will flourish next season and earn him recognition his coaching.  **NBA Champions and FMVP:**  Los Angeles Clippers and Kawhi Leonard.  I think they are the most complete team in the NBA.  The 2018-2019 LA Clippers were a team of role players that beat out LeBron's Lakers to reach the 8th seed and took the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors to 6 games.  Take the important pieces to that team and add two All-NBA Forwards, arguably the two best two way players in the NBA, and I see them dominating any team in the West come playoffs.  I left out the ones I wasn't sure of.  Thanks for reading."
Stephen Curry gonna win 2020 mvp 32ppg book it
12-1 because Smart decided to turn into Stephen Curry with 7 threes while Avery Bradley had an even luckier bounce on a game winner than Kawhi.
Stephen curry is good at shooting three pointers.

"&gt; He led all players on both teams in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots. Elias Sports Bureau research shows that it’s the first time any player has led both teams in all those categories in any playoff series of any length.   &gt; James scored or assisted on 50 percent of the Cavaliers' points in the Finals, his second-highest mark in a Finals, surpassed only by his 62 percent last season (when he was playing without Kyrie Irving or Kevin Love).  &gt; In Game 7, James scored or assisted on 52 of the Cavaliers 93 points, including 13 of 18 in the fourth quarter. In the first four games of the series, James scored or assisted on 45 percent of the Cavaliers' points. He was responsible for 57 percent in the last three games, all wins.  &gt; James also got it done on defense. James held the Warriors to 36 percent shooting in the NBA Finals (21-of-58), best of any player on the Cavaliers. Stephen Curry was 1-of-7 against him. Klay Thompson was 2-of-6. The Warriors did not make any of their seven shots against James in Game 6.  &gt; James blocked seven shots in transition, including one on Andre Iguodala with 1:50 remaining in the fourth quarter of a tied Game 7 (which you can see atop this article). James was also the primary defender for 14 turnovers, tied for most of any player in the series.  This is a carry job."

Wardell Stephen Curry II
"Stephon Marbury, Jamal Crawford, Nate Robinson, David Lee, Zach Randolph, Al Harrington and Danillo Gallinari ('07-'09 New York Knicks). Not all of them played together at the same time, but at any given time during the season, at least 5 or them were teammates. The amount of Offense, All-NBA selections, and Awards these guys generated in their careers makes this notable to me.  Here's another Knicks team... Penny Hardaway, Stephon Marbury, Jamal Crawford, Allan Houston, and Vin Baker ('05 Knicks). If you add the '06 season, you can add David Lee, Steve Francis, Matt Barnes, Trevor Ariza, Eddy Curry and Nate Robinson to that list. Albeit, like the last list, not all at the same time, but most played with each other.  The mid-2000's Isiah Thomas Knicks were the epitome of dysfunction.  Jermaine O'Neal and Chris Bosh ('09 Toronto Raptors)  Tracy McGrady and Joe Johnson ('12 Hawks)  Steve Nash and Vince Carter ('11 Suns)  Pau Gasol and esteemed former RoTY, 6MoTY Mike Miller ('06 Grizzlies)  Patrick Ewing and Marcus Camby ('98-'00 Knicks)  Peja Stojakovic, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal and Stephen Jackson ('06 Pacers)"

[Kawhi Leonard Defense on Stephen Curry](https://youtu.be/mUF8MGH9Fh8)
Stephen curry
"Just look at the biomechanics of his shot.  There are several ways of being perfect, I think (as long as you've got the ball in front of your eyes at some point and have a repeatable stroke) but Bird's shot was pretty much perfect.  Every time.  In an era when Stephen Curry is one of your leading scorers from outside, you're going to throw away someone 5 inches taller, with a better basketball brain, and a completely repeatable almost perfect shooting action?"
"My all-time team:  *starters:* Hakeem Olajuwon / Kevin Garnett / LeBron James / Michael Jordan / Stephen Curry  *bench:* Tim Duncan, Larry Bird, Scottie Pippen  Jordan and LeBron are no-brainers. I want Curry for his shooting and gravity; I don't need to worry so much about having a traditional PG since everyone on this team can handle, pass, and make plays.  At center, I'm going with Olajuwon because he's relatively fast and mobile as centers go, and crafty and creative enough to synergize well with the tremendous talent around him. I considered Kareem here, but he loses a little something in the speed and mobility department compared to Hakeem. Also considered Shaq and Wilt, but I don't want the team to have any glaring weaknesses (FT shooting) if I can help it.  Garnett is perfect as a role player on this team. He can focus on being vicious on defense and being a complementary piece on offense with his shooting and passing.  Off the bench, I've got Scottie Pippen as my backup PG. Much like Garnett, he's skilled enough to be more of a complementary player on offense with his ball handling and modest (for this team) scoring abilities, and his primary role is to be a disrupting force on defense.  Duncan is there as another post threat and defender with an all-around game. He can play backup C as well as backup PF in bigger lineups.  Bird can slot in at SF in bigger lineups or PF in small ball lineups. In addition to the roster flexibility, he adds more playmaking and shooting.  If this team has weaknesses, it's that there's not quite as much 3 point shooting as I'd like, and it also doesn't have a lot of traditional guards. I'm going with size here to really suffocate the opposition on defense. On offense, even if there's not a ton of 3 point shooting, everyone has a dangerous midrange game and everyone is a great playmaker for their position. Additionally, Curry alone is almost as good as having two dangerous 3 point shooters on the court at once with his gravity and off-ball movement.  All time offense:  *starters:* Kareem / Bird / LeBron / Jordan / Curry *bench:* Dirk, Magic, Kobe  All time defense:  *starters:* Bill Russell / Garnett / Leonard / Jordan / Payton *bench:* Ben Wallace / Rodman / Pippen"

"Lamenting is too strong a word. Do you think the Clippers are lamenting the fact that they got Blake Griffin over Stephen Curry, even after they traded him? I firmly believe that the top 5 guys in last year's draft will be stars.  In any case, you can't really judge who will be better after their rookie year. I will say that Bagley has the **tools** to be a better player, so it's not for want of potential. Going back to the 09 draft, people would have been saying Blake was better than Harden because Blake had a historic rookie year averaging 23-12, while Harden didn't even average 10 ppg."

Wait so you mean to tell me James harden and Stephen Curry aren't two of the best defenders in the league?
"It was expected to play all four years in college back in the day and now there isn't the opportunity to come straight out high school.

"&gt; That goes only to an extent, Curry fans use ""gravity"" to downplay every bad performance he has had, ""he isn't double teamed like Curry"", ""he isn't getting constantly fouled like Curry"", ""he doesn't create like Curry so that's why Curry does less"". There are so many versions of that narrative and no it doesn't justify him going cold on games. He has lots of games that are almost as bad as LeBron's 8 game in the finals.  I’m not defending the stans who use gravity to shield Stephen from all possible criticism. I’m just saying that evaluating Curry’s performance has to be different from other superstars who are ball dominant creators. Curry causes just as much havoc off ball as on, and most of what he does off ball goes unrecorded, so his performance is never just limited to what he produces in the box score. Just as you have some overzealous fans who abuse the gravity argument, you have even more haters who don’t understand basketball beyond an on ball level for stars presume it is a made up function.   &gt; I don't have the time, see, I don't want to waste it trying to defend my favourite player, you see everyone knows what KD does, I don't have to explain in to you, I don't have to justify why he played bad. If you want to look at KD in action go look at the the Rockets series from last year, he frustrated every defender on it and they constantly switched, same in the Clippers series, and the Rockets from 2019. Go look at Harden's series, look at his gravity, look at how players get frustrated guarding him and get aggravated and end up fouling him constantly out of anger.  You don’t have the time. Okay then I guess. If you don’t have to explain anything to me then why are you replying? Doesn’t Curry wear out defenders too by running miles around the floor and forcing defenders to shed countless screens? Difference between he and almost all of his peers is that he is just as fearsome off ball as on, and he is utilized in very unique ways (such as a screen setter) that causes a defense to overreact to his actions,  &gt; That narrative is like me saying ""Oh look at Rudy Gobert, offensive players are so scared to go attack the rim it makes defending a lot easier, that mean he is a top 10 player?  This makes Rudy Gobert one of the best rim protectors of his generation. offense holds him back from being a top ten player. Comically bad comparison.  &gt; Not it's not, statistically it is but he's had way more bad games than anyone, games where he gets completely shut down, multiple.  Care to prove this with ANY level of evidence? Show me how Curry had way more bad games than anyone please."
"lmao , it’s stephen curry does he really have to dunk ? lmao 😂"
"Literally none of the players you listed had any success as  a one man offensive machine, period. None.  Btw, side note, Iggy was injured during that playoff run and you severely underestimate the Rockets vs the Warriors role players in 2018. Iggy would have been far more useful as part of their Wing Depth.  Also, I don't think you realized that Curry has two finals appearences without KD, both led by his offense. I'd also argue that if Curry was healthy in 2016, they win that postseason because his quickness was off a cliff and we saw that even in the OKC series.  You act like none of the players you listed didn't have elite playmakers or have had a system built around them as well. MJ had Pippen, who was a weak MVP player by himself, and one of the best wing playmakers ever, and with excellent shooting and role players, he won far more in the Phil Jackson triangle offense. LeBron has had Wade, Kyrie, Bosh, and Love, all players who are more than capable of creating their own offense. Giannis has a system with shooters around him, and his lack of shooting by himself limits his offensive portability and his  fit in the Bucks was almost perfect for him. Harden, well I explained what happened with him already. Also, btw, if you're going to be a fan of small sample sizes, Harden's team got destroyed by 1.5 games of Stephen Curry absolutely ripping that defense to shreds.  Curry's postseason offensive rating has never been particularly poor unless he's been injured as we saw with an MCL sprain and dislocated finger. If you want to argue staying healthy is a valuable attribute, I am more than willing to entertain that, and Curry would be far higher in all time status if it weren't for those injuries.  Also, you forget that when you have Klay and KD out against literally almost the greatest defense in NBA history, no one is scoring more than a point per possession and KD isn't doing that if Curry and Klay are out.  Dray takes advantage of Curry's creation, similar to Pippen, Wade, and Kyrie.  I actually don't have a counter to the Warriors system being perfect for Curry because I do think that's the best system in the NBA rn. However, you didn't respond to my argument about 2015-2016 Curry's effective on ball play, which extended to the postseason even when he was injured.  KD's efficiency didn't just improve, btw, it skyrocketed and that was due to Stephen Curry and Klay's offball presence literally giving him wide open shots of luxury that he never will get in any other team.  You don't need a historically talented team to be valuable as a ceiling raiser. The Warriors team without KD was at best a 50-55 win team, and Curry takes that to new heights. If you place Curry a team like the Pacers with a healthy Oladipo, I guarantee you that's a 60 win team with an explosive new ceiling.  You seem to underestimate just how much manpower is used to stop Curry opening up space for everyone."
"Parker's my guy, but I can't in all honesty rank him above any of the following:  1. Magic Johnson 1. Stephen Curry 1. Oscar Robertson 1. John Stockton 1. Steve Nash 1. Isiah Thomas 1. Chris Paul 1. Allen Iverson 1. Russell Westbrook 1. Jason Kidd 1. Walt Fraizer 1. Bob Cousy 1. Gary Payton"
- Lebron James  - Kevin Durant  - Stephen Curry  - James Harden  - Giannis  - Paul George  - Anthony Davis  - Kawhi Leonard  - Joel Embiid
"Yeah they do. Certain players also do one better than the other. Please don't write that off as ""bullshit"". It makes no sense to call it that.  LeBron James is far more likely than Stephen Curry to get a team 50 wins and Curry is better at getting 50 win teams to 65 wins.  Ball dominance typically doesn't scale well, especially considering how quickly it produces diminishing returns, while off ball play fits in literally every single team.   Certain attributes are more scalable than others and more portable than others, which Curry excels at."
"LeBron and Curry is extraordinarily debatable. I actually would be willing to see an entire thread dedicated to this with some good discussion.   If you look at the SRS, you notice that immediately that the Warriors aren't even close to as dominant as those 73 wins suggest. Additionally, Draymond Green might be super underrated on that team, DPOY level defense while being able to shoot beyond the arc is mental and combined with high level passing, he might have been a top 5-10 player that year that retrospectively, no one noticed due to the offensive genius of Stephen Curry.  However, LeBron also had the last season of true Prime Wade and a two way impact player like Bosh with a team maximized to support his ball dominance. On the other hand, he was playing DPOY level defense.  All time great ceiling raiser vs GOAT floor raiser. I kind of want to make a detailed post on this, but I think it's going to be buried."
"It comes down to Stephen Curry and Draymond Green or James Harden and Clint Capela, but I give it to Harden/Capela just because of the sheer volume of pick and roll plays they run.  Watch out for Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray or Trae Young and John Collins, they are on the rise.  Of course next year it might be LeBron James and Anthony Davis, but we just don't know how many pick and roll plays they will use, so I hesitate to call them a ""current"" duo."
LeBron definitely got a million excuses for that on this sub. If anything Stephen Curry doesn’t get any excuses for being injured in 2016.  Ask LeBron dragged his nuts across Draymonds head. If any man did that to you you would be pissed. The 16 ring isn’t organic like the 15 ring
&gt; Stephen Curry has lost 15  &gt; Kawhi Leonard has lost 7  &gt; Kevin Durant has lost 9  How many total finals games have these guys played compared to Lebron and West?
"Steven Curry isn't good, yeah. Stephen Curry though, he's incredibly good."
Jesus that size up on a man twice as big as you. I'm wet Stephen curry
"[Here’s a link to the source article for this quote.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/nba-insider-tom-haberstroh/steph-curry-warriors-breaking-point%3famp)   _“Now comes the mind-blowing part -- let's take Draymond out of the equation and leave Curry by himself a cast of role players. No Durant. No Thompson. No Green.  With Curry rolling solo, the Warriors are still plus-14.3 in 216 minutes of action. That’s without the help of an MVP, a former Defensive Player of the Year and perhaps the second-greatest shooter ever not named Stephen Wardell Curry. The offense scores 116.6 points per 100 possessions in these lineups, which would be the league-leading offensive rating this season.”_  The sample size isn’t enormous, but still equal to almost 5 full games of basketball where Steph and a bunch of bench players will beat the opposing team by 14 points every game."
"Patrick Beverly. Didn’t even have to leave the zip code.  Dude is a good perimeter defender on bigger wings. No, not point guards, and wait, not too big - but in that small sub section between Stephen Curry and The Freak (great players he couldn’t guard in the playoffs). But if you got someone between that . . . Oh wait, he didn’t shut down Klay either. So, I mean, if you need a really great system defender who will *always* be where he is suppose to be, communicate, and challenge shots, he is your guy.   So, yeah, actually, I’d take Pat driving point guards nuts rather than Danny making life inconvenient for the off guard (and yeah, he sometimes picks up guards on switches but, seriously).  All of this - yes, he’s a great team defender. But he ain’t a stopper and when the difficulty steps up in the playoffs he’s dead weight on half the court.  He’s a 3 and D guy who shuts down other 3 and d guys and is only a d guy in the playoffs.  I’d say he’s a 10-12 guy (JJ Reddick-ish). He got 15 a year on a two year deal because everyone knew it was an overpay - Lakers didn’t even want a third year option. They needed something this summer and then he is a 15 mil expiring deal next summer for a trade deal (they hope).  But anyway - I’ll let you die on this Danny Green hill."

"With all due respect, Stephen Curry averaged 31.7/6/5 per 36, and 30.1/6.7/5.4 per game. MJ in 1987-1988 averaged 31.2/5/5.3 per 36, 35/6/6 over the season. MJ averaged 43.6 per 100 possesions, Curry 42.5. MJ had a VORP of 11.8 to Curry's 9.8. MJ had a 31.7 PER to Curry's 31.5. MJ HAD A WS OF **21.8** to Curry's 17.8. Oh, and here's the other thing, MJ was not a 0.1 DBPM on defense like Curry was that year, he had a 2.3 BPM and won DPOY. So yeah, there you go."
"It's almost like the opposing team guards Quinn Cook differently than Stephen Curry.  Nah, it can't be that. /s"

Stephen Curry will be SO MUCH MORE appreciated when he retires  It's crazy how little respect he gets
My point is that giving someone a position based on who their primary assignment is doesn't really work logically.   For example lets say Kevin Durant is guarding Lebron James. Perhaps you would say Kevin Durant is a SF then. But if Lebron James is guarding Draymond Green then suddenly Lebron James would be a center and Kevin Durant would be as well since he's guarding Lebron James.   Or even more simply you could just look at two players playing different positions guarding each other. Would Stephen Curry guarding James Harden make Stephen Curry a SG or does it make James Harden a PG?
WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY IS NOT BETTER THAN KAWHI ANTHONY LEONARD.
"If you want to do the whole like ""team has 5 lower level all stars who gel well together"" thing then sure you could open it up to like 20 dudes, if you mean like as a legitimate #1 clear cut lead alpha dog, then it's probably like 6 dudes.   Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo"
No Stephen Curry is
It was more his overall scoring ability rather than simply treating him as an elite shooter. I.e. he was more Stephen Curry than Kyle Korver
“Fred VanVleet was statistically Stephen Curry”   I can subscribe to this.
See: Stephen Curry 2016 season
"I'm not confused at all.  I know someone (who is very much a socially conservative Christian) who was friends with Stephen Curry in college and said that Curry was very much ""solid"" on these issues.  Curry is very much similar to former coach Mark Jackson (who Curry pushed the Warriors to retain as coach), a strong homophobe."
"""Seth and Callie are already the parents of a daughter, Carter, who was born last year.""  I really have no respect for hypocritical Christian jihadists (Seth Curry played at Liberty ""University"" and both him and Stephen Curry are well known for supporting homophobic legislation like HB2) who try to impose their values on society while excusing themselves from their ridiculous beliefs."

FYI: Steph made 77 straight 3-pointers in practice and finished 94/100 from 3-point land. So I’m **DEFINITELY** sure he could shoot a better percentage from 3 uncontested than Lonzo currently shoots from the free throw line.    https://www.si.com/nba/2015/04/15/warriors-stephen-curry-77-straight-three-pointers-practice

"https://www.si.com/nba/2017/04/10/stephen-curry-book-excerpt-ankle-injury-mark-jackson  It's actually crazier than I remember... But Curry's ankle has mostly been ok since then, so who can say it didn't work?"
"But Bill, Bill. You have to think about it this way. Stephen Curry took his family on a safari. Sure, the safari was in Tanzania, but they spent approximately 47-minutes of flight-time in the airspace above Nigeria. If you have flown over the mountains, the jungles, the Nigerian coast ... you can't help but to be transfixed into the cultural fabric."

"1. (i did an actual top) Lebron James. Goat, awesome at everything, weakness is probably he become a lazy defender with time, and he will do everything for the win like trading half of his team lol. 2. i'll go with Kevin Durant. Phenomenal Scorer, A not bad playmaker, and became a really great defender with time, no real weakness in game, except than he actually injured, and we can say he's not loyal too lol. 3. Kawhi Leonard, Definition of an Elite defender, and he probably as good defender as he is in scoring. weakness is probably his playmaking, if he was an as good playmaker as Lebron he would without any doubt be the number 1 today.  4. Stephen Curry i guess, Best shooter of all-time, bring so much spacing on the floor because of this, a really good finisher and playmaker, weakness is probably  his lack of seriousness sometime and even if he's good he's not the best defender so is often target in defense. 5.  i won't put Harden here like everyone would probably do but Anthony Davis, i think he's one of the most unstoppable player,  never really saw him got lockdown by someone, and can be MVP like he can be DPOY, weakness is probably he didn't won anything. 6. still not Harden sorry.. Giannis Antetokoumnpo, he's unstoppable inside the paint, Same he can be MVP like he can be DPOY, weakness is he still don't have a good shoot but he keep improving. 7. James Harden, best Scorer in the NBA statistically (just 36ppg..) also an incredible playmaker, weakness is even if he made some effort , he's not a good defender and also not a really nice teammate. 8. I think Joel Embiid,definition of a beast, so powerful and skilled at the same time, also a DPOY/MVP caliber, Weakness is probably the regularity and shot selections,he take a lot of 3 for someone who average 30% at 3. 9. it may be shocking people but i believe Paul George is 9th, also an Elite Defender, amazing scorer and shooter, and an not bad playmaker, weakness is without any doubt his regularity. 10. its tough i really don't know, i think Nicolas Jokic is 10th , Great player at everything, he's known for the fact than he a really good passer for a center, averaging 7 assist per games, i don't really watch him so i think the weakness point is his athleticism lol, pretty slow and almost never dunk."
"Strengths and Weaknesses becomes an essay quick, so here’s my very brief list. I can’t order the players well, so I tiered them instead.  1. The Best of the Best Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, LeBron James, James Harden, Kevin Durant (injured for season). These guys singlehandedly change the fortunes for any team they’re on. All except Giannis and Harden have won multiple championships, and those two came close to playing in the Finals before falling to historic teams.   2. Like A Hair Below Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic.  These guys do the same as the others with incredible two way dominance (yes, Jokic is a very good, if flawed, defensive player), with the caveat that they’ve had very little success so far and need to prove more before moving up. None of these three have advanced beyond the 2nd round of the playoffs.   After those 9 guys, it becomes hard to pick a single guy to round it out, because while there a lot of good options, nobody solidly takes that spot. Here are who I would put  3. The Jumble Damien Lillard, Karl Anthony-Towns, Paul George.  None of them have come particularly close to winning much, and Towns has barely been in the playoffs. But all it takes is a perfect storm and a change of fate for these guys to change that narrative."

I can’t even remember who the games were against right now, except one was the post amare Suns, so I get Steve Nash too I guess lol"
"&gt;PG - 2015-16 Stephen Curry (Game was GSW @ DET, it was one of GSWs 9 losses that year but Steph went for like 44 and did a 360 dunk in warmups.  i remember that game. He hit a shot from the logo that night as well."

"&gt;Stephen Curry  Who?  &gt;Green’s Golden State teammate  Ooooh, thanks"
Kevin Durant is younger than Stephen Curry...
"Do people really not believe in a team starting Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Lebron James, and Anthony Davis, with Paul George, Jimmy  Butler, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, and Blake Griffin winning the tournament?"
"Sure, some of them were young, but that team was still packed with really, really good players.   KD had already made the All-NBA First Team and was the leading scorer of the NBA at the time.  Rose won the MVP award the following season.  Kevin Love led the league in rebounds per game and became got awarded as the most improved player during the following season.  Chauncey Billups was selected to the All-NBA Third Team just one year prior to the tournament.  Stephen Curry was the league leader in FT% and already a deadly shooter.  Russell Westbrook made the All-NBA Second Team the following season.  Lamar Odom was a 2-time champion and became the Sixth Man of the Year the following season.  Danny Granger was an All-Star and top 10 scorer in the league at the time.  Andre Iguodala made the All-Defensive Second Team the following season.  Tyson Chandler won the championship and made the All-Defensive Second Team the following season.  Other than those guys it's just Eric Gordon and Rudy Gay left, and both of them were already good players."

"Steph makes his roster better, to an extent that no player (even Harden) comes close to. [Here's data from 2016-2017 that shows why he probably could have been given the MVP that year.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/)  Simply saying ""he has a better roster"" is a bad argument. 73 wins was a different stratosphere and is 32 (or pretty damn close to double) wins better than the Rockets in 2015-2016. In 2016-2017, the Rockets only had 8 wins better than the Thunder. So the classic ""narrative changes to go against Harden"" remark is pretty bunk."

You do understand there are great shooters who arent in the nba right?

"You mean 2002? It's weird to retroactively look back and judge FIBA teams because they are more of ""futures"" or up and coming player teams. Hell look at the US last FIBA tournament, a lot of those guys had 1 or 2 all stars under their belt at the time and weren't crème de la crème especially compared to the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams. These are the accolades they had in 2014. Arguably the only superstar at the time was Paul George who had that gruesome injury.  * 	Curry, Stephen	 - 	1 All Star	  * 	Thompson, Klay	 		 - 	 * 	Rose, Derrick	 - 	3 all star, MVP	 - 	Coming off injury and played 10 games in 13-14 NBA season * 	Faried, Kenneth			 * 	Gay, Rudy	 	 * 	DeRozan, DeMar	 - 	1 all star	 - 	 * 	Irving, Kyrie	 - 	2 all star	 - 	 * 	Plumlee, Mason	 - 		 - 	 * 	Cousins, DeMarcus	 - 	2 all star	 - 	 * 	Harden, James	 - 	2 all star	 - 	 * 	Davis, Anthony	 - 	1 all star	 - 	 * 	Drummond, Andre	 - 		 -  The US in particular treats the Olympics as the soccer World Cup stage where as the FIBA tournament is more like the Soccer olympic stage.  There definitely is complacency due to dominating and I think PGs injury affected at least players going to FIBA tournaments, but not as much as simply not caring as much about the World Cup compared to the Olympics. Plus no offense to China but Tokyo iis a more intriguing place from a tourism perspective."
I think it should be:  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard  3. James Harden 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Stephen Curry 6. Anthony Davis 7. Joel Embiid 8. Nikola Jokic 9. Paul George 10. Damian Lillard
A little preview from the future: “Stephen Curry breaks Olympic record for most three pointers in a tournament on way to tournament MVP.”
"Stephen Curry James Harden Lebron James Kevin Durant Anthony Davis - Damian Lillard Klay Thompson Kawhi Leonard Paul George Karl Anthony-Towns - Kyrie Irving LaMarcus Aldridge   Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Draymond Green and Demar Derozan would be the first three substitutes if any of the above guys didn’t play. I threw LaMarcus in there because in FIBA the big guys are a little more valuable, even though I don’t think he’s one of the twelve best American basketball players."
Stephen Curry   Michael Jordan   LeBron James   Larry Bird   Shaquille O’Neal
USA is missing   - James Harden  - Kevin Durant  -  Lebron James  -  Russel Westbrook  -  Stephen Curry  -  Draymond Green  -  Kawhi Leonard  -  Klay Thompson  -  Paul George  -  Damian Lillard  -  Blake Griffin  -  Anthony Davis  -  Bradley Beal  -  John Wall  -  Jimmy Butler  -  Derozan  -  Andre Drummond  -  Mike Conley  -  Deangelo Russel  -  Tobias Harris  -  and Eric Gordon.

Doesn't matter. Ok I'll give you ONE more try.  geekboy69: uh sure whatever  Me: HOW many years didnt Derrick White play Division ONE basketball?  geekboy60: uh I dont know man, Im pretty much over this   Me: ok ok just give it ONE guess, just try ONE time.  geekboy69: oh ok I think I get it, one year. He only played one year of college basketball.  Me: Ugh No! he played four years of college basketball but only one year of D1. Thats why he was fairly polished as a second year guy last season. Like when he dropped 36 on the Nuggets in the playoffs.  geekboy69: Wait, ok but can I come in or not?  Me: Oh yeah of course dude. Im not a real gatekeeper, just having some fun."
" Was Stephen curry injured in the 2018 finals in game 3 when he had 11 points?   Was he injured in 2015 when LeBron + Delly took them to 6 games?  Steph’s game is purely based off chaos and motion which means finals intensity defense doesn’t warrant him a lot of cheap points that he thrives on. Teams limit the amount of open threes he shoots. Injury isn’t really an excuse as Kawhi just had the most dominant playoff run in 5 years with a degenerative quad.    All I hear are a ton of excuses on why Warriors lost 8 out of their last 10 games without KD in the finals.  I’m not really a KD Stan, And I don’t support him or the warlord. GSW have no problem beating bad teams without KD. It’s when they face switch heavy defenses that limit the ‘chaos’ the warriors thrive on.  They get back to the finals in 2017 due to Kawhi getting injured + No Houston rockets.   In 2018 and 2019, they don’t make it back without KD and they probably don’t beat LeBron in the 2017 finals. Steph’s game is is high variance. They need a superstar to carry the load when he has his inevitable 3-15 shooting nights."
i agree 100% but do you see deron outplaying stephen curry on the biggest stage?
"If a team uses every available tactic to counter Stephen Curry, with double teams, holding him off ball, hard fouls, forcing him to defend ball on switches etc....the rest of the team has to use that decreased attention on themselves and step up.  They did not, and the dubs lost, so it was Steph choking because his team didn’t take advantage of the fact that one player held the Cavs defense hostage.  People just genuinely don’t understand basketball or what Steph does.  Steph pulls double teams all day and KD gets a 1v1 from an off position help defender who gets there too late and drops an efficient 35 all series and people don’t realize KD is balling out because Steph makes it stupid easy.  Not that KD isn’t a top 3 player in the world, but damn.  Steph and LeBron were the two most valuable players in every series 2015-2018."
"Ah yes, [Mark Jackson's never been known to lie in order to manipulate people](https://twitter.com/thealexwolfe/status/986656887704866816?s=20).  I still don't understand why y'all cling to this.

"**FIRST let me make it clear that it *was* impressive, Klay is the 2nd best shooting guard in the league today as far as I'm concerned, and I'm not trying to denigrate him**  But...  Because there has never been this combination of circumstances.  1. An NBA team that is in the middle of rebuild suffering so many injuries as to essentially be fielding a G-league roster  2. Playing possibly the best team ever assembled  3. With his teammates KD (9 shot attempts) and Curry (9 shot attempts) taking less than **HALF** their normal attempts per game in order to feed Klay  4. Who still required 24 attempts to reach 14 made 3's  [Game log](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201810290CHI.html)  Now compare that to when Stephen Curry hit 13 3's against the Pelicans.  1. It was against a decent team with good talent, although they had a little injury issues themselves with Jrue not able to play. Still **MUCH** better talent than the Bulls squad Klay faced  2. His teammates did **NOT** try to force feed him. Klay took 20 attempts, KD took 17  3. He hit 13 3's in 17 attempts  I love the Warriors and watch all their games so I simply wanted to put a little context on this 14 made 3's game."
"&gt;One of the easiest stars, not players.  I'm about to name fifteen 2015 all-stars easier to stop than Stephen Curry and I want you to point out which is actually harder to stop -   Marc Gasol  D Wade  Carmelo Anthony  John Wall  Kyle Lowry  Paul Millsap  Al Horford  Chris Bosh  Jimmy Butler  Klay Thompson  Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  DeMarcus Cousins  Blake Griffin  &gt;And Iggy shot better than Curry for the series(10 less points of course) had a much better assist to turnover ratio and guarded LeBron better than anyone ever has.  Do you think that had something to do with Iguodala being open on most of his looks and not being pressured as a ball handler? How many double teams did Iguodala have to pass out of? How difficult were his field goals when 88% of them were assisted compared to 36% for Curry?  &gt;Curry only played well in the second half of games once Delly was in a coma because he was asked to to play starter minutes and run the offense when LeBron wasn't even though he had only been a back up defensive specialist at that point in his career.  That's a nice narrative you've crafted there. If you think Curry played like shit in the 2015 finals, your evaluation of basketball cannot be taken seriously. At all. That's how bad of a take this is."

"&gt;Almost every great player's TS% drops in the playoffs.  -Not to that extent, and those great players score on far higher volume than Stockton. You can't even compare Karl Malone's drop in efficiency from RS-PS when he doubled the volume of Stockton and assumed the greatest burden in the Jazz offense. There's a huge difference between James Harden's decline in efficiency when being the alpha and omega of an offense and Stockton who played off Malone.  &gt;You say mediocre scoring volume, whereas I say high efficiency and a product of playing for Jerry Sloan and with Karl Malone. He was never in a position to be the main scorer, nor did he play in an era that was as nearly conducive compared to Nash, Curry, etc.  Stockton was often the third leading scorer of his own team in the postseason. That's not an excuse. In reality, Stockton was just a limited m2m scorer who wasn't suited to take on the burden of a primary scoring option. He wasn't out in a position to score because he wasn't a great off the bounce scorer.  &gt;We consider Magic to be the best because he won 5 championships. If Stockton had 5 championships to go along with his body of work and Magic had 0 instead, it'd be no contest.  Do you think Magic leading #1 offenses almost every year of his prime had something to do with that.   &gt;He was not in a free flowing, run-and-gun, transition orientated offense like Magic was.  The Lakers didn't have a run-and-gun offense until Magic was drafted. He ushered in that style. Stockton would not be as well suited for that style because he was a less aggressive passer, less aggressive driver, and a less creative passer.  &gt;I don't think you watched much of Stockton. He was constantly collapsing the defense and driving. He played free throw line-in, just like Magic.  I don't think *you* watched Stockton. He was NOT constantly collapsing the defense and driving.   Look at his video of his career high in assists. Do you see a lot of aggressive collapsing and driving?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiUBGD2rQ8E  &gt;If Stockton played under Mike D like Nash, he'd have been able to really show how great a scorer/shooter he was.  He never put *himself* in a position to leverage his scoring prowess because he *didn't have great scoring prowess!!!!* You are WAY overrating his scoring capabilities. He didn't have close to the off the dribble capabilities of Steve Nash whose handles are every bit on par with Stephen Curry, just a less talented scorer.  &gt;Stockton has a reputation as a clutch performer because he was a clutch performer. Just because there are a few instances of another player getting the best of him doesn't change that fact.  Do tell me all these instances of Stockton being a clutch performer in the playoffs and I'll give you more to the contrary. Did you even remember what happened to Stockton in the '92 WCF before I told you? No right? because his failures have been forgotten while the clutch moments have been remembered. That's the problem with legacies.   &gt;And a guy who played 82 games a season 16 times, 19-year career average of over 10 assists, and was top 10 in steals 16 times, is unequivocally on par (at the very least) with Magic, Oscar, and Curry. Curry shouldn't even be in the conversation tbh, he has like 8 more years of elite play left to prove to compare to Stockton. &gt;You can overlook a major gap in longevity, but I am not willing to whatsoever.  So your problem is that you think Stockton's apg average equates to being on the level of the best passers of all time, which he was not. You think his efficiency means he was a great scorer, which he was not. Actually limited. And you think his steals make him a great defender, which he again was not. Great *team* defender but very limited m2m which is exactly what Terry Porter exposed of him in the 1992 WCF.  Stockton actually has around ten seasons of elite level performance. Though he played 82 games for 16 seasons, he clearly declined around '98 where the Jazz began to play him under 30 mpg to conserve him for the playoffs and lessened his overall responsibility in the offense. He didn't have an elite year averaging 11-7 at age 36 and struggling with his shot in the playoffs. So Curry doesn't need eight more years of elite play when Stockton didn't have sixteen years of elite play and to say he does is flat out wrong. Curry now having seven seasons of star level performance, most of which better than Stockton at his peak, gives him a strong argument as better all time *right now*."
Stephen Curry fan 100% Lol
"You do realize the only ""objective fact"" in basketball is statistics. If that's all you care about, then why even watch the game or talk about it? KD is best pure scorer we've ever seen but can we back it up with objective fact? We all would agree Melo is top 5 iso player of last decade, but can you back it up with objective fact? Stephen Curry is a better 3 point shooter than Klay Thompson and Ray Allen but ""objective fact"" says otherwise."

"Possibly...but through Bargnani’s demise we have now clean slate.    Everything happens for a reason.    Im not sure if you’ve become a recent Warrior fan ( saw your flair).  But there was once a man named Monta Elis.    A star point guard for the Bay Area.  Who himself promised to bring the City of Oakland into the promise land.  Through his demise out came your savior Stephen Curry.  Where now you can enjoy the fruits of your dynasty, 3 Rings and all.  All thanks to your Office ending Monta Elis."
" It's a combination of things. Talking strictly US players, the FIBA world cup plays second fiddle to the Olympics and the Olympics are next summer.  The other thing is PGs injury. The talent since the 2008 ""redeem team"" has been on a small downtrend talent wise but the US has still showed up with the perennial all stars for the most part:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_men%27s_Olympic_basketball_team  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_United_States_men%27s_Olympic_basketball_team  On the other hand the FIBA tournaments have been more of an up and coming star or one/two time all star kinda team rather than a superstar loaded team. Looking back at the 2014 team and a lot of those guys panned out as superstars but at the time they only had 1 or 2 all star games under their belt max. See players below with how many all star games they had at the time they played for that team:  * 	Curry, Stephen	 - 	1 All Star	 - 	 * 	Thompson, Klay	 - 		 - 	 * 	Rose, Derrick	 - 	3 all star, MVP	 - 	Coming off injury and played 10 games in 13-14 NBA season * 	Faried, Kenneth	 - 		 - 	 * 	Gay, Rudy	 - 		 - 	 * 	DeRozan, DeMar	 - 	1 all star	 - 	 * 	Irving, Kyrie	 - 	2 all star	 - 	 * 	Plumlee, Mason	 - 		 - 	 * 	Cousins, DeMarcus	 - 	2 all star	 - 	 * 	Harden, James	 - 	2 all star	 - 	 * 	Davis, Anthony	 - 	1 all star	 - 	 * 	Drummond, Andre	 - 		 -  The US in particular treats the Olympics as the soccer World Cup stage where as the FIBA tournament is more like the Soccer olympic stage.  Also as the US keeps dominating year after year you will see people care less and less until they lose a game or get less than a gold (see 2004). Then the superstars will start caring more.  I do think PG's gruesome injury in 2014 has a little to do with players not showing up, but not as much as simply not caring as much about the World Cup."
"What the fuck?  First of all, the Warriors beat the Thunder in 2016 because Steph clapped KD’s cheeks to the tune of 30+ in each of the final three games.  Curry is actually not that bad at defense, you would know this if you watched a game once in a while.  But like I said, dumbasses will bring up defense and act like it matters if a guy’s impact is 50/50 defense/offense or 90/10 defense/offense or 10/90 defense/offense.  Are you not understanding what I’m saying or can you just not read??  Let me spell it out for you: Stephen Curry is more impactful on a basketball court than Kevin Durant.  At this point in LeBron’s career, with his defensive impact at an all-time low, I would say that Steph is likely the most impactful player in the game.  Giannis is up there, KD is up there, probably higher than Giannis, Jokic is up there...but I digress.  Kevin Durant is probably the most gifted scorer of all time.  He’s an incredible scorer, he has the total package.  He’s a very unique player, it’s just that Steph is...well, more unique.  Steph’s shooting ability simply breaks the game—it makes everyone on the court much better and no one else in the league is in the same realm (that’s a fact btw, Steph raised his teammates TS% by 8.0 in 2017 for example).  I don’t know what you think when you think offense, but that speaks for itself.  I mean, this is a man who can playmake without the ball in his hands.  Kyrie and Lillard are not even close to the same level that Steph is at, I think we both know that.  Also, please don’t bring Harden into a discussion about two great players, that’s just a joke."
"You understand how everyone else is playing. You dont understand Curry sometimes, this is the most magical basketball ive ever seen. Duncan, Kobe or Jordan played much more from tactic (Maybe not early Jordan) and Stephen Curry is more intuitive in his movements and shot selections, but he actually knows what hes doing too.. most of the times. And the way he release layups is crazy (super high arc and smooth as hell), Curry also can do fadeaways and stuff with superb efficiency feels like, he just doesnt need to cause 3-point is better than 2 and if they dont go then layups are enough. And the most thing i respect is how he runs off-ball and put screens for teammates."
I forgot he was on the 2014 team until you mentioned it. But yeah the overall talent of his teammates this time around is definitely less than it was then.  2014 FIBA USA Team:  Stephen Curry Klay Thompson Derrick Rose  Kenneth Faried (when he was still good)  Rudy Gay DeMar DeRozan Kyrie Irving DeMarcus Cousins James Harden Anthony Davis Andre Drummond Mason Plumlee

"[Kinda reminds me of that time that Curry won at Davidson without scoring because he was double teamed all the game, though](https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2fsports%2fwizards%2fthe-time-stephen-curry-was-held-scoreless%2f2015%2f05%2f29%2f5ebb8fd2-061e-11e5-93f4-f24d4af7f97d_story.html%3f)"

"Not true, Kevin Love stuck defense on Stephen Curry in a season when Stephen Curry was dropping 3's from near half court all season. A season where they proved their record as the best team of all time, 73-9. In that moment, Kevin Love stepped up and guarded Stephen and Stephen missed.  Regardless, we won't know just like we won't know how many rings Kobe and Shaq would have had, had Shaq stayed and worked out or if CP3 trade wasn't vetoed to the Lakers back in 2012."
Lmao how is dominating the ball a problem? It's not hardens fault be doesnt share the floor with kd.     Besides. While harden does have a 40% usage to Curry's 30%..... He also has a 40%assist rate to Curry's 24%.... Meaning that even if they had the same exact usage harden would still be assisting at a far better rate. This isn't just a matter of usage. Harden is a far far better playmaker.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id1_select=James+Harden&amp;player_id1=hardeja01&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id2_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id2_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=curryst01&amp;idx=players
Not only that he is also looking like a babyface white skinny kid compared to nba players and that really has an impact on all of Europe. And a bunch of Instagram pages who post a highlight clip and in the background you hear “the dont wanna see me fall stephen curry how i ball”

"Larry Bird, Reggie Miller and Stephen Curry. The goats of off-ball play on offense."
"Lets use Stephen Curry for an example.  Curry now has seven seasons of star level performance (in spite of not making the ASG nor an All-NBA team in '13 he was certainly deserving of such). In 2015 he ascended to all time levels of historical offensive performance; from hereon the centerpiece of some of the greatest offensive teams ever (confirmed by relative offensive rating, which takes into account current league average performances relative to the performance of a specific team) and combining volume scoring with efficiency at a level that few have matched historically (with Bird, Nowitzki, Barkley). He is particularly unique among elite offensive anchors because of his off ball work that allows him to co-exist with virtually any player and grants his team the flexibility of playing in an equal opportunity offense without sacrificing his influence on the team.   Curry not having a FMVP does not matter in my evaluation, as it does to Max Kellerman, Skip Bayless, every other fan who uses the award to judge whether a player is good in the Finals, because his averages in the postseason both in terms of volume and efficiency are stellar. The only years that he has suffered a major decline in performance from PS-RS were those in which he missed chucks of the postseason due to injury.   Curry has the prime performance to rank within the top fifteen of all time. But he does not yet have the longevity to measure up with the likes of Oscar Robinson (who similarly led top ranked offenses in almost every year of his prime and then went on to be instrumental to the Bucks success in '71). If he can continue to extend his prime to a point that is comparable to or surpasses other historical greats, he can surpass them.  I'd like to know how you respond to this before going further, as there's a lot more detail that goes into player evaluation. What you'll find is that this level of discussion is much more informative and comprehensive than rattling off wikipedia entries of All-NBA, all star, champion, so and so."

"I think it's because the objectivity gets mixed in with subjectivity and people object to the latter being stated as though it's objective. Saying some rules and their interpretations were different back then is objective but saying Stephen Curry wouldn't get an inch of space back then is subjective.   Yes, I think a Gary Payton-Stephen Curry matchup would be interesting to observe. But all 27 to 29 teams back then didn't have a Gary Payton locking in each night. And although rules allowed for more physicality along the perimeter, guys like Mark Price were still able to roast and operate. And while I acknowledge Price's skill, I'll also say that I believe Steph Curry surpasses him in multiple facets of the game. It's just not too difficult for me to envision Curry still finding ways to cook back then (which you acknowledge, just not at an MVP level - mostly talking about the ""couldn't get an inch of space"" comment)."

would stephen curry be just as good under the old rules?
—Stephen Curry
"cause they still got a decent squad around them. they just need to find a new Iggy and have D'Angelo Russell be a 6th man like Lou Will. or even just a good wing defender who can hit 3s every now and then. I mean they'd be the clear favorites if they still had Iggy.  - Stephen Curry, D'Angelo Russell, Jacob Evans - Klay Thompson, Alec Burks, Jordan Poole - Alfonzo McKinnie, Glenn Robinson III - Draymond Green, Eric Paschall, Omari Spellman - Willie Cauley-Stein, Kevon Looney, Alan Smailagic  add a player like Trevor Ariza to that squad on the MLE next year and they're winning it all probably."
"I think it would go like this:  PG: Stephen Curry  Bench: Tim Hardaway  SG: Klay Thompson  Bench: Chris Mullins (SF but can play SG)  SF: Kevin Durant (no duh) Bench: Rick Barry  PF: Nate Thurmond  Bench: Draymond Green  C: Wilt Chamberlain  Bench: Andrew Bogut  Head coach: Steve Kerr  Assistants: Al Attles - Luke Walton  This all team I have to imagine would be one of the best all time teams out there with a great mix of playmaking, scoring, and defense. Imagine going up against a starting lineup of Curry, Klay, KD, Nate and Wilt. Imagine trying to score against that lineup! Imagine trying to *stop* that lineup from scoring.   If I had a magic genie I'd wish to watch this team, all in their primes, go through an NBA season and playoffs."

HOT TAKE: STEPHEN CURRY IS A BETTER SHOOTER THAN LONZO BALL
lol that's easy  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Carmelo Anthony  Jeremy Lin  Stephen Curry  Donald Sterling  Demarcus Cousins  Uhhh uhhhh shit you're right
Half of r/nba was watching football before Stephen Curry started playing like an MVP
Stephen Curry was always injured until 2013
Before Stephen Curry was a decade ago.
They were all very serivceable role players if you watched basketball before Stephen Curry
It's funny because there are *clearly* some folks out there just angry at the Warriors and their prolonged success and they are relishing any opportunity to tear the team and Stephen Curry down.  But haters gonna hate.
"[AI is also on record saying that both Kyrie and Steph have better handles](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2465203-allen-iverson-says-stephen-curry-and-kyrie-irving-have-better-handles-than-him). I think Kyrie and Steph have more tricks in their bags and are more skilled with the handle, but Iverson had the advantage in speed and athleticism that enabled him to just blow by dudes easier than Irving and Steph can."
Stephen Curry on the court .
Tomorrow news: Clippers have traded Patrick Beverley to Warriors for Stephen Curry.
"Here, I know this is really hard:  James Harden, since joining the rockets has ALWAYS had a better supporting cast than the one Stephen Curry CURRENTLY has.  There, now go back to math class."
"If you can’t tell the difference between the two, then you aren’t as smart as you think you are.  I don’t believe saying “Stephen Curry plays with 2 all stars” is accurate. That has absolutely nothing to do with discussing who gets criticized for body language and who doesn’t"

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Stephen Curry.  .  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Curry in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Curry's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Curry, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Curry in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Curry is better.  You might be jealous of Curry's three rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Warriors fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Curry isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"""Clearly""... you gotta be kidding me my guy. Stephen fucking Curry is in a different conversation entirely. Just watch, your memory seems to be clouded."
Andrew Wiggins and Stephen Curry had a Freaky Friday Flip
Lol yeah can’t believe people don’t think Stephen Curry and Book are the same thing
Stephen curry is the 2nd most popular player in the entire league bruh chill
"Back to the Monta Ellis era Stephen Curry, throwback"
"Yeah, breaking news: “Stephen Curry, not as good as 1 of the 2 greatest ever”"
Stephen Curry.
Yes. Stephen Curry is legit the most overrated player in NBA history
1) Anthony Davis  2) Karl-Anthony Towns (i don't get this one)  3) James Harden  4) Giannis Antetokounmpo  5) Stephen Curry  6) Lebron James  7) Nikola Jokic  8) Damian Lillard  9) Joel Embiid  10) Bradley Beal  11) Kawhi Leonard  12) I selected Rudy Gobert and Westbrook in tandem
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate James Harden.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you don't watch any of his games.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you just meme and shitpost in this subreddit instead of watch James Harden play basketball.  And because you didn't watch his games, you try to compensate for that by diving into chopped clips and analyzing individual, one-off plays.   But here's the thing: basketball isn't played in random clips. The moment somebody shows me a video of James Harden ""flopping"" or ""not playing defense"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Harden's game cannot be encapsulated by one clip. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best offensive players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that Steph Curry is better than James Harden, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watches actual full games of the Houston Rockets wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Harden is better.  You might be jealous of Harden's three runner-up MVPs, or jealous of his status as the greatest free-throw line scorer in the NBA today, or whatever. Unless you're a Heat fan who watched basketball in the 2010s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what actual, full-game, uncut, 48-minute basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Harden isn't even a top 100 player ever, based on the clips they upvote.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you don't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like Stephen Curry or Luka Doncic, but leave the Harden talk to the adults. Fair?"
Stephen Curry 2.0
He walked off with 2 more Finals Los because he didn’t have Klay Thompson and Stephen fucking Curry

"Wardell Stephen Curry is playing, so there's always a possibility."
"Stephen A. Smith does go into the fact that Kristaps is not a key figure enough to get the team 12+ wins from last season to get them into the playoffs.  Also, name their 3rd best player. Wright? Seth curry?   They have no depth. It’s a silly argument to call them playoff worthy."
Stephen Curry may have the biggest impact on a single franchise of all time. They really built this monster of a franchise on his back. It’s crazy what a good run can do for you.
"""God of"" Wardell ""Stephen"" Curry."
"I guess what i'm getting at, is that its no longer a major component of American culture in the same way that the NFL and NBA are. People who have never seen a NFL game in their lives know who Tom Brady is, and people people who have never seen an NBA game could probably describe Stephen Curry. MLB doesen't have any recognizable personalities, and rarely, if ever, reaches news stations that aren't specifically catered to baseball.   Basically, only people actively seeking baseball really know whats going on, and in this day and age that's almost atypical."
"1. Kawhi Leonard 2. Stephen Curry 3. James Harden 4. Giannis Antekoumpo 5. Joel Embiid   After that you have Lebron, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Anthony Davis, and maybe a few others that could make a stake for Top 10.  With Westbrook’s decline and KD’s injury, it’s surprisingly tough to knock Lebron out of the Top 10."
1) Lebron (Until Proven Otherwise  2) Wardell Stephen Curry  3) James Harden  4) Kai Leonard   5) Giannis Antetokoumpo ( Will be #1 at some point in the next decade.)
Clippers are America’s team.   Greatest players of post Jordan era after this year:  1. Tim Duncan 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Stephen Curry 4. Kobe Bryant 5. Lebron James

*[ESPN] Stephen A Smith says Curry is getting uglier!!1!*
Yeah. Stephen A lost me on that. Curry was even more of a pretty boy then. At least now he has facial hair.
"I don't know how I'm being downvoted, but in all seriousness I can get to 17 players definitively better that those guys.  In no particular order  West  LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Karl Anthony Towns, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook.  East  Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, and Kyrie Irving.  I am willing to concede Kemba Walker, which makes 18.   So, that's 2 spots.  Any 2 of Blake, Butler, Beal, and Oladipo are not definitively better than Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Lamarcus Aldridge, Demar Derozan, or Draymond Green, Kristaps Porzingis, or even Luka Doncic.  I would personally fill it out with DeRozan and Draymond because advanced stats are meaningless when you only manage to win 25 games.  OPs attempts to shoehorn in Al Horford and John Wall are peak EC stupidity."
Is your existence centered on sucking off Stephen Curry?
Is your existence centered on hating Stephen Curry
"Y'all reading way too much into an obvious joke of ""Stephen Curry is 'not a Hall of Famer (as of this moment he is technically not eligible for the Hall of Fame) Yet'""  Jordan isn't saying Curry doesn't belong in the Hall of Fame, holy shit guys."
Unpopular opinion but I think Stephen curry might be a decent shooter
"Is this in reference to 2015 or 2019?  I seem to recall Curry having particularly good 4th quarters in '15, which is what we're talking about. edit:  [https://hoopshabit.com/2015/06/15/nba-finals-4th-quarters-difference-stephen-curry-warriors/](https://hoopshabit.com/2015/06/15/nba-finals-4th-quarters-difference-stephen-curry-warriors/)   &amp;#x200B;  Looking at specific quarters (which often aren't entirely played in garbage time and can also have a lot of last ditch heaves) though is just in general bad statistical practice since you have a lot of variation in data due to low sample size"
"Its utterly ridiculous to suggest he hasn't done enough. An MVP is already enough, let alone two.

"* Jimmy leads Miami to a better record than one of the Bucks or Sixers. * Lebron gets old man injuries, Anthony Davis leaves in free agency after the Lakers miss the playoffs. * Toronto wins 50 games. * Warriors win the championship. Stephen Curry wins finals MVP and league MVP."
"Don’t worry, even if all our players get injured, I’ll just call Stephen Curry and let him know you guys are acting up again"
when lebron james hit the game winner in the 2016 finals and three-way made out with stephen curry and kevin durant after
Lance Stephen Son Curry
All hail Stephen Curry🙏
"Oh come on, it's some fun, harmless drama. Think about it, this tweet sets off a timeline in which two former MVPs Harden and Westbrook fight off former MVP-LeBron and (future MVP) Davis , former two time MVP Stephen Curry, *and* superduo in (controversial MVP this season) Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, only to meet current MVP Antetokounmpo in the Finals. Then in the 2020 season, regular season, but not Finals MVP, snubbed Giannis has to fight through the East with now-healed former MVP Durant back in the lineup for the Nets. It's MVP's all the way down!"
"The only bias in against is recency bias. I feel like everyone you debate with is emotionally invested in a player at this point so any negatives are quickly dismissed. For example, Stephen Curry and Kawhi. If you criticize them in any way people start to get emotional."

"Stephen Curry. The answer to almost any all time big 3 is Curry. He gives the other stats room to work with his gravity, and someone like Magic/Bird can set him up for a ton of easy threes."
Watching warriors vs okc back in 2011 lockout season. Warriors had monta Ellis as the main ball handler and young Stephen curry and David lee. Thunder had Durant harden and Westbrook and in the end the warriors got cooked so bad. That's when I started watching basketball
"Yeah that season had Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, LeBron James, Isaiah Thomas, and Stephen Curry putting up MVP-calibur seasons. For some reason, a stat padder on a mediocre team won it."
"KD’s Efficiency blip after 2012 can be put to statistical anomaly. Even without Stephen Curry in 2018 playoffs, he averaged 28 on 62 True Shooting with Klay and Draymond. Playing with Anti Gravity Westbrook/Robertson (historically bad shooting backcourt) probably compounded his efficiency numbers.   Also, I wouldn’t say Durant struggled against Memphis or San Antonio in 2014.   Efficiency also isn’t the end-all be all of production. LeBron’s efficiency was below league average in the 2015 playoffs but it was one of the most productive playoffs ever. Dismantled Celtics/Boston/60-win Hawks and took 2 games off of 67 win warriors. I don’t really believe efficiency is the golden standard of whether someone performed or not. Harden had a sub 55TS against the Jazz but they beat the jazz 4-1 due to harden gardening attention."
1. Michael Jordan 2. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 3. LeBron James 4. Magic Johnson 5. Tim Duncan 6. Larry Bird 7. Hakeem Olajuwon 8. Wilt Chamberlain 9. Shaquille O'Neal 10. Bill Russell 11. Kobe Bryant 12. Kevin Garnett 13. Karl Malone 14. Kevin Durant 15. Dirk Nowitzki 16. Dwyane Wade 17. Stephen Curry 18. Jerry West 19. Moses Malone 20. Oscar Robertson
I’m not gonna get into numbers but Stephen Curry is one of the most impactful players when it comes to winning . Curry would get picked over Barkley 100 times out of 100 times by any competent gm.
He’s better than both. curry has 3 rings and 2mvps one unanimous in 5 years .Longevity is not as impressive as Stephen Curry’s career accomplishments.  Would you rather have Steph for 7 years and win 3 titles or Barkley for 12 and win 0?
Stephen Curry.

"Yeah this is the right answer. If given time to prepare warriors would pick up 3 300 pound brutes to chuck at shaq.  With no roster changes I think it goes to 7 and is a toss up there 50/50  Even thought logic says warriors because of sheer talent it’s just an all around tough question, because I can almost certainly say that prime KD is better than 2001 Kobe, and so was that Stephen Curry."

"More so Lebron got lucky than teams gave up.  The best team to challenge him, the Bulls, had their best player get injured which knocked them out of contender status.   Then looking at top 10 draft talent from after Lebron got drafted that could challenge him.  Carmelo to the West, Wade/Bosh to East (but Lebron joined them), Dwight Howard East, Deron Williams/Chris Paul West, LaMarcus Aldridge/Brandon Roy West, Kevin Durant West, Derrick Rose East (Injured by 2012), Westbrook West, Love West (joined Lebron), Blake Griffin/James Harden/Stephen Curry West, John Wall/Paul George East, Gordon Hayward West, Kyrie Irving East (joined Lebron), Kemba Walker East, Anthony Davis West (joined Lebron), Damian Lillard West, Bradley Beal East, Oladipo East, McCollum West, Joel Embiid East, Karl-Anthony Towns West.  The majority of star talent went to the Western conference. The few East guys that were stars teamed up with Lebron.

And instead one knee Festus and Varajou had to take those. Which is a huge drop off. Dray most def did not deserve to get suspend for that game.

"I can understand waiting until Steph is done to anoint him as the greatest shooter, but if you look at the analytics of shooting % and stats, Steph is on his own platform... Like no one even comes close.   Look at this article from his 16' MVP season, a good example of how crazy Steph is.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-curry-is-the-revolution/"
"**Background**  China is a dictatorship that is currently committing several human rights abuses (concentrations camps, state sanctioned violence, suppression of free speech, etc.) While technically under Chinese rule, Hong Kong (HK) has their own systems (governmental, economic, etc.) and are fairly autonomous.   Protests begun against proposals that would have allowed extradition from HK to China. Residents of HK felt this would expose them to unfair trials and poor treatment. Demonstrations have resulted in protestors being arrested, beaten, and sometimes shot by Chinese authorities with China threatening that any form of separation would result in, ""bodies smashed and bones ground to powder.""  **Morey's tweet**  Seeing these demonstrations, Morey tweeted support for HK's fight for freedom.   As you can imagine, China was not pleased.   **Why does the NBA care about what China thinks?**  The NBA is extremely popular in China. An estimated 500 million people in China watched one of more NBA games last season. The NBA's business in China is worth around $4 billion.   This also applies to the players. In terms of basketball LeBron James is the face of Nike, Stephen Curry the face of Under Armour, James Harden the face of Adidas, etc. Are these players staying silent and/or not taking a definitive stance because they don't want to negatively affect business? A lot of people seem to think so.   **LeBron's hypocrisy**  It's pretty self explanatory. Just look at [this tweet](https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/952902403422150657)."
"For Adam Silver, Harden and many other sports commentators, the bottom line was to say they support Morey's freedom of speech.   For Steve Kerr and Stephen Curry, the bottom line was to make no comment and say nothing.  For Lebron ""Mr. I am More Than An Athlete"" James, his bottom line was to literally go the opposite way and attack Daryl Morey for being uninformed and uneducated."
&gt; Stephen Curry [...] a lot of free throws  I don't know why you think the refs are going to give him calls all of a sudden  &gt; bad injury bug bites  This is pretty much the story of our lives since 2013

Unbelievable   He truly is the greatest shooter that the game has ever seen and evolved for where now everyone shoots 3s"
It was 4 games and 56% of his attempts were 3’s. His play style is so volatile of course he’s gonna go through bad stretches. He’s still Stephen fuckin Curry he would’ve been just fine over the course of a season.

"But we aren't talking about impact, we are talking about the best 'shooter'. I guess it's really dependent on your own definition of best shooter.

"KAT is still young in his career, I agree he isn't playing like prime KG, that'd be the consensus best basketball player in the world.   But I think you're understating how historic of a season KAT is having offensively. He's shooting similar from 3 compared to STEPHEN CURRY! And he's doing it on a pretty high volume while being one of the best facilitators in he league.  He's playing like a borderline top 5 player THIS SEASON, and I think ""a lot more defense"" is kind of selling KAT short for what he's doing offensively (so far)..."
"&gt; In Game 4 of The Finals on Friday, the Toronto Raptors went back to the box-and-one defense - four guys in a zone and Fred VanVleet chasing Stephen Curry - ***that helped them come almost all the way back from 12 points down in the fourth quarter of Game 2.***"
"He had issues with the Warriors drafting Curry when it happened, yes. He had a different perspective later in his Warrior career:  https://www.slamonline.com/archives/monta-ellis-looking-to-squash-beef-with-stephen-curry/  &gt;  ‘A month before the season was over with, I really had to sit back and blame myself in a sense because I’m that leader; I’m that one who everybody feeds off of,’ Ellis said. ‘Everything that went on last year (regarding Curry) shouldn’t have gone on. I blame myself.’ Ellis said he made amends with Curry this summer, attempting to clear up whatever residue remained from their inauspicious start. Curry has certainly met him halfway in attempt to fix the relationship that so many saw as broken, even attending Ellis’ wedding in late July when the only other current teammate present was Devean George.”  He was traded, however he did not request a trade if we take him at his word. It was pretty obvious that the franchise wanted to move in a different direction though, so he was understandably annoyed about that and knew the trade was coming.  https://www.slamonline.com/archives/monta-ellis-wasnt-sad-to-leave-the-golden-state-warriors/  &gt; Did you tell them that you wanted out?: ‘They didn’t hear that out of my mouth. I kind of figured that something bad was going to happen today. I was prepared for it. I’m good.’ Did you know you were going to Milwaukee?: ‘I knew they weren’t going to send me to a playoff team. But the Bucks are still in the running. I think we can go for the eighth spot.’ […] You seem very calm: ‘I told you, I was prepared for this. I’m not going to say anything negative.’ You said you wanted to be a Warrior for life?: ‘Everybody says that, but it doesn’t happen that way.'”  My conclusion is that he did not willingly walk away.  However, it is technically true that Stephen Jackson requested a trade from the Warriors early in Curry's rookie season. But I don't really count that one because it wasn't Curry's team yet."

"You're dumb. 2010 season, the Warriors were bad. Same in 2011. 2012, Curry got injured. Then in 2013, the Warriors got going and went to the playoffs because of Steph. 2014, Steph lead them to an another good year and they lost in game 7 against the Clippers. And then in 2015, after Steve Kerr came, and led by the MVP Stephen Curry, they won 67 games and won the championship."
He's not Giannis or LeBron athletic. He doesn't have the physical gifts that the best players in the league usually do. RJ does not say Luka isn't athletic. He's saying he's not absurdly so to the extent that a players physical gifts come before their actual skill when being appraised. This is more of a compliment than a slight considering he's just 20 years old and will get stronger.  Stephen Curry is black. No one mistakes him for a good athlete.

"I thought 7 foot curry already exists, aka the Black Stephen Curry  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abALBRnnVwE"
Nobody except: Stephen Curry aaand...     Damian Lillard. Hmmm...
&gt; For a game for my life I would take Kyrie Irving over Stephen Curry.  Kyrie would let you die on purpose just to prove some kind of point that he wouldn't elaborate on in the post-game interview.
"So I preface this by saying I'm a huge Stephen Curry fan (prefer him to Harden), but I was always surprised at the people who thought he would have a supernova Hardenesque style season this year  (increased usage, crazy #'s, etc).      Steph isn't really built for stratospheric single superstar usage rate. What Harden does, as a guard, is incredibly difficult. Harden is built like a tank which is why he can keep dropping 40pt games night after night with both the 3 pt game but also aggressive take it the hole game. Of course Curry can drop 40pts night after night, but under more limited circumstances (with other superstars on the floor to help take pressure/increase space he can operate in). Otherwise, if Curry is asked to carry the load like Harden as some were hoping to see this year, I think he would eventually have broken down (we never got to see this whole theory tested since he got injured so early).      What we see Harden doing is extraordinary and very rare. Few players can score at this rate night after night, the energy and strength it takes is underappreciated. The guy is driving to the hole a huge amount of times every game, taking a beating (and yeah he oversells  some fouls and tries to trick refs which is obnoxious as hell), taking and making high-difficulty volume 3s... imo he should get respect for the legendary feats he is producing right now. He is a cheat code unto himself, which sure maybe a lot of people might not enjoy watching, but you probably aren't going to see this type of thing duplicated for a very very long time. I'm not the biggest Harden fan, but I do enjoy watching history and someone who is incredibly talented perform at an extraordinary level."
That doesn't mean he's better though. For a game for my life I would take Kyrie Irving over Stephen Curry. I would take Reggie Miller over James Harden. Doesn't make them better.
"Warriors fans need to realize it's a lot different drafting at 28/30 than it is drafting in the top 15.   Not counting Stephen Curry, since he was drafted by Larry Riley under Cohan's tenure as owner, the new ownership and front office drafted Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green (2nd rounder of course), then after we got too good for lotto picks Kevon Looney who has worked out really well for a 30th pick, Damian Jones who didn't work out but brought us Omari Spellman in a trade who *has* looked pretty good, Jacob Evans (poor rookie season but looks much improved this year), and finally Eric Paschall and Jordan Poole.   Frankly I feel like the Warriors front office have done pretty well with their draft picks."

https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14750602/how-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-got-best-worst-ankles-sports   Here's the artical I found on the Curry case.
"Lol probably cause he was injured, his team was injured, and the 2nd best player on that team was Brandon Ingram lmao. And remind me of the players he beat in the West in his final runs. Here, I got you: Kevin Durant, Tim Duncan, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson. Let’s not forget he also beat KG, Paul Pierce, and Allen in the East when he was with miami."
You mean you didn't know Stephen curry is an overrated system player who's a top 25 player at best??? /s
"STEPHEN CURRY SOLD HIS SOUL TO LUCIFER TO GAIN HIS THREE POINT SHOOTING SKILLS. THE CURSE IS REAL, ALSO THE NEW ARENA IS CURSED, IT IS PART AND PARCEL TO CURRY'S DEAL WITH SATAN. THE DEVIL DEMANDED THAT A NEW ARENA BE BUILT IN A SPECIFIC LOCATION, A SPOT WHOSE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE CORRELATED WITH SATANIC WAYPOINTS AND INDIGENOUS BURIAL SITES. KERR IS IN ON IT, BOB MYERS IS IN ON IT, JOSEPH S. LACOB IS IN ON IT. THANKS TO STEPHENCURRY, THE WAYPOINT IS OPEN TO THE NETHER REALM AND BEELZEBUB MAY NOW ENTER EARTH FREELY.      LUCKILY, GOD AND HIS ANGELS HAVE STEPPED IN TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION AND HAVE ANOINTED AND SANCTIFIED A HUMAN BEING TO STAND IN SATAN'S WAY. THAT MAN IS ALEX CARUSO."
"Let me preface this by saying I truly enjoy watching women's basketball, but the physiological differences are just too great.    I played against 7th grade guys who were dunking on people. There have been 20 dunks EVER in the WNBA and 13 were from Griner.     I've watched guys who never played outside of high school dominate a solid D1 girls team that ended up advancing in the NCAA tourney.    They are in their own lanes for a reason. Nothing wrong with that.     Finally, for your comment about Curry- there will never be a woman as tall as him, [with his vertical,](https://youtu.be/_hnl3Bw--eQ?t=11) (he had a 35.5 inch vertical!) and [with his strength](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/stephen-curry-can-deadlift-400-pounds/) I think you're underestimating how great of athletes even the supposed 'weak' nba players are."
Ooooooooh baby. Fuck you Warriors and SPECIFICALLY one Mr. Stephen Curry! [11 mens]
All of Steven Adams sisters are physically stronger than Stephen Curry...
"My personal injury tally tentatively has us at 8 healthy players now...  * ~~D`Angelo Russell~~ thumb? * ~~Damion Lee~~ hand * Willie Cauley-Stein * Jordan Poole * Omari Spellman * ~~Kevon Looney~~ neuropathy * ~~Alen Smailagić~~ ankle * ~~Eric Paschall~~ wrist? * Alec Burks * ~~Jacob Evans III~~ groin * ~~Klay Thompson~~ knee * Ky Bowman * Glenn Robinson * Draymond Green * ~~Stephen Curry~~ hand * Marquese Chriss  Poole, Bowman, and GR3 are the 3 players who haven't been injured at some point since start of training camp."
" Harden's last 5 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) have ended by him losing breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard, and losing to a warriors team without kd and giving up 33 second half points to Stephen Curry who was scoreless in the first half of an elimination game in Toyota Center. Harden was also extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.  2012: Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.  2013: Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  2014: Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  2015: Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  2016: Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  2017: Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.  2018: Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-  2019: Harden shoot 11-25 from the field, 58.3% from free throws ([3rd worst game of this season by FT%](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bn7vhu/hardens_712_from_the_ft_line_is_in_line_with_the/)) and caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."

"Hell no! They were not considered contenders at all. They had just gone 51-31 entering the playoffs as a 6th seed and losing in 7 to the lob city Clippers. Andrew Bogut suffered a broken rib in April that saw their most important defensive piece (this was before the rise of Draymond) unable to play in the post season.  They actually competed well and pushed the game to seven, I kind of think they would have advanced to the 2nd round if Bogut had been healthy.   But anyway the Warriors fired Mark Jackson shortly after this series ended and started their search for their next head coach, quickly focusing in on Kerr after being impressed by him in interviews. It is important to note that while Kerr had had a long NBA career and was a GM for the Suns he was working as an analyst when hired by the Warriors and had never coached at any level.   If you go back and look at media coverage or even just fan social media posts the Warriors weren't getting **NO** love. There was some love for Stephen Curry, as by this point people had recognized the kind of talent he was, but overall there was very little love for the team.   [This Bleacher Report article projected the Warriors to go 47-35, missing the playoffs.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2207017-nba-predictions-2014-15-win-loss-projections-for-every-team-pre-training-camp#slide1)  Look at all the expert predictions before that season:  http://www.espn.com/nba/notebook/_/page/nba1415/2014-15-nba-champion-predictions  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2014-15-nba-expert-predictions/  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/2014-15-nba-playoff-predictions-092914  The Warriors were quite simply not on anyone's radar. They were expected at best to maybe match their record from last season and eat a first or *maybe* second round exit.   But as that season went on, Steph was great, they kept winning games, that's when the media had to start paying attention. But even then most of the coverage was ""they aren't going to get it done in the post season, jump shooting teams don't win championships, all this player and ball movement is nice but it won't work in the post season, etc."""
Stephen Curry is a poor mans Devin Booker.  no bias at all in this post...
Bruh Vanvleet is still miles away to reach to the level of Stephen Curry.
This is in no particular order. Just names that came to mind:  1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Magic Johnson 5. Larry Bird 6. Wilt Chamberlain 7. Bill Russell 8. Hakeem Olajuwon 9. Tim Duncan 10. Shaquille O'Neal 11. Kobe Bryant 12. Oscar Robertson 13. Julius Erving 14. Moses Malone 15. Kevin Garnett 16. Kevin Durant 17. Karl Malone 18. Jerry West 19.

Stephen Curry literally didn’t last 4 games this year

"I think it's tough to justify him over Jordan, Durant, or LeBron looking at points per 75 possessions.  He has had a great regular season last year, but is rather unsuccessful in the playoffs and a 1-year peak isn't enough for me to say he's better than the 3 of them.  A toss-up between Steph for the #4 spot to me, I think Steph is better.  Put some statistics below.  If you want to count Wilt, who knows where he lands, but I'm sure he has a good case to be put higher than him.     [For his career, James Harden is tied 4th per 75 possessions.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;type=per_poss&amp;per_poss_base=75&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=mp&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=10000&amp;order_by=pts_per_poss)  &amp;#x200B;  1. 30.3 - Michael Jordan (.569 TS)  2. 27.6 - Kevin Durant (.613)  3. 27.5 - LeBron James (.586)  4. 26.8 - Kobe Bryant (.550)  4T. 26.8 - James Harden (.609)  15. 25.1 - Steph Curry (.623)  &amp;#x200B;  At best he could be #2.

Stephen Curry? The unanimous fucking MVP? 400 three pointers in a season? The fuck?

There are only 4 unique back to back MVP winners in the entire span of 30 years, which is once again the modern era. Steph Curry, Steve Nash, Tim Duncan, and Lebron James. if you count MJ who already had multiple MVPs in the 80s as a unique mvp back to back winner than at best you're talking 5 people who have done it in the modern era. That is an extremely uncommon individual feat.   Individual back to back winners are extremely uncommon."
"That’s why I asked this question. See on one end you have a Stephen Curry type star player (not Steph Curry impact necessarily but In simplistic terms a player who has more of an impact off ball ) and then you have a prototypical 2019 facilitator/star  that can be a threat to the defense consistently by his ability to playmake .  I reiterate that this is not Steph Curry or another player comparison,but more of this interesting phenomenon of people saying Steph revolutionized basketball but by same token many people and many of those same people would rather take a player with a smaller Points Responsible because of their instant offense .  There are so many factors that play into this dilemma of the player Who plays better with the help of others ,or the whole floor raiser/Ceiling raiser arguments I just find it interesting"
"Stephen Curry I hate you. I could use a pair of stability shoes in size 12.5 for my overpronation. Once again, I hate you."
"Lol you're point is not even slightly made dude. It's hilarious that you actually can't comprehend basic facts. I don't know how many more ways to try to simplify math for you. The odds of Giannis having a back-to-back MVP season this year are exactly precisely 4/25. Not extremely common. Now can he be a Lebron or an MJ and beat the odds? Sure. Is it extremely common to do so? No.   Let me break this down for you with the actual list from your timeframe since you can't seem to comprehend basic math or facts.   2018-19     Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks (Voting) 2017-18     James Harden, Houston Rockets (Voting) 2016-17     Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder (Voting) 2015-16     Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors (Voting) 2014-15     Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 2013-14     Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City Thunder 2012-13     LeBron James, Miami Heat 2011-12     LeBron James, Miami Heat 2010-11     Derrick Rose, Chicago Bulls 2009-10     LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2008-09     LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2007-08     Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers 2006-07     Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks 2005-06     Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2004-05     Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2003-04     Kevin Garnett, Minnesota Timberwolves 2002-03     Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2001-02     Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2000-01     Allen Iverson, Philadelphia 76ers 1999-00     Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles Lakers 1998-99     Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1997-98     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1996-97     Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1995-96     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1994-95     David Robinson, San Antonio Spurs 1993-94     Hakeem Olajuwon, Houston Rockets 1992-93     Charles Barkley, Phoenix Suns 1991-92     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1990-91     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls   As you can see, outside of MJ and Lebron James the only players to experience b2bs are: Tim Duncan, Steph Curry, and Steve Nash.  The top 2 players of all time won 8/30 of the last 30 MVP seasons. Even including them, one unique person per decade gets to experience this feat. The 2010s already had theirs in Steph Curry, it'd be a statistical outlier for it to happen again this year. It's an extremely uncommon feat.   Nothing about what you are saying jives with the actual data which shows a host of MVP seasons dominated by MJ and Lebron with one other person per decade pulling in a b2b which already happened."
"Imagine being presented with cold-hard facts and continuing to be a stick in the mud. Here is the list of all the back-to-back MVP's in the league: https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/02/22/stephen-curry-lebron-james-michael-jordan-magic-johnson-wilt-chamberlain/80604040/  Anyone with a brain can see this is one of the most uncommon occurances in the NBA. I see no source for your stat the above is what has actually happened and maybe MJ has skewed something but I assure you only 10 guys have done it out of 100000s of players. If you think it's ""extremely common"" you are truly the kind of person who never changes their mind about anything and only has preconcieved notions based on homerism assumptions that have nothing to do with reality."
"Tim Duncan finished 12th in RPM in his last season and 2nd in DRPM. He was so good on defense, he was 12th in RPM even with a negative ORPM. He led the league in DBPM.   Among players that played at least 41 games, he was 3rd in defensive rating and 8th in net rating behind the Warriors (Draymond Green, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andrew Bogut, and Festus Ezeli) and his teammates (Manu Ginobili and Kawhi Leonard).  His offense was shot, but his defense was elite until the end.  Curry and Duncan's primes don't need to matchup for them to win championships together."
"Mumbles under his breath, ""But if we had traded you for Stephen Curry in the early 2010s, I could have more championships than MJ."""
"Stephen ""Take my strong hand"" Curry out here"
"My opinion that Steph Curry is 2nd best player in the league (well he considers him best) is echoed by Ben Taylor, someone who has watched  thousands of hours of basketball film analytically.  I certainly watch every Nuggets, Rockets, and Lakers game. I accept your position on KD,  Its unlikely he'll be at that level again,   But don't act like it's ridiculous to believe that either James Harden or Stephen Curry are better than Giannis. Curry is by far the most underrated player by people like you who are obsessed with the ""eye test"",  Most people on this sub, including myself, know little about winning basketball from a strategic perspective. Almost all of the stathead film watcher combo basketball people I follow say that Steph is the best player in the league.    In fact, you're regurgitating one of the most trotted out lines by ""forum fans"", which is that a player like Giannis's offense is equal to to Curry or Harden, and because he's better at defense he's better overall. This is complete bullshit. Defense is important, and offensive players like Lou Williams are overrated in comparison to defensive players like Robert Covington, but Curry is so far ahead of Giannis offensively.  You're just asserting that Giannis is in the top 5, and acting like it's insane, or unbelievable to think that LeBron, Kawhi, KD, Steph, and Harden are better. It's not. We can get into myriad of arguments on this. I even said that Harden vs. Giannis is a toss-up for me,  And btw, your opinion that Giannis is top 5 and possibly the best player in the league is much, much more popular than my opinion on this subreddit, as well as the general ideological stance about ""watching the game"" (which I do). So this whole strawman about ""forum fans"" esposuing my opinion is not even true."
"Great post, phenomenal work. But I kinda disagree with guard's unicorn index. Personally, I believe that Stephen Curry is the most unicorn type guard."
"Full health (injuries discounted and assumed to be fully healthy during playoff run. If factoring for availability this changes with projected playoff LeBron from 2017-2018:  1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Anthony Davis 9. Joel Embiid 10. Damian Lillard  My list is pretty standard, with 2 exceptions, the higher placements of Jokic and Curry. I believe Curry is still the most impactful offensive player  in the league closely followed by James Harden. He warps defense like no other. My next controversial placement would be Jokic above AD. AD is a an amazing defensive player, but overrated on offense due to his lack of creation, Jokic also had one of the best postseasons in the last 10 years last year statistically, and in advanced metrics was second to only Kawhi in value.   This whole list is pretty tentative considering the uncertainty of a 2 year older LeBron, and Steph and KD's injuries. Giannis certainly has a argument over Harden, as well as AD over Jokic."
In the absensce of Stephen Curry his heirs duel for the crown of limitless range.
Is this the white version of shaq being the black Stephen Curry

"Kind of, except I can name the PG that started alongside each of those dudes. Off the top of my head:  AI - Eric Snow  Bradley - Rajon Rondo  Lou Will - Patrick Beverley  Ellis - Stephen Curry"
"D-PIPMs of superstars:  LeBron James: +0.20  Kawhi Leonard: +0.46  Stephen Curry: +0.26  Anthony Davis: +2.57  Giannis Antetokounmpo: +3.08  James Harden: -1.03  So only one superstar has “bad” defense, and he is one of the best offensive players of all-time.  If you consider more than just those to be superstars:  Damian Lillard: -0.24  Kyrie Irving: -0.50  Joel Embiid: +2.86  Nikola Jokić: +1.18  Karl-Anthony Towns: +0.31  Jimmy Butler: +0.70  Luka Dončić has worse than all of these players except Harden for multi-year, but his current D-PIPM this year is -1.3 which is bottom 10 in the league and Harden’s is -0.9. So he’s probably the worst defender out of all these players, especially if we want to overreact to small sample sizes like this sub is doing to push Luka into the tier of these players, and only 1 top 15 player actually has bad defense. These don’t even include Durant and Paul George who are also positive defenders."
If ben simmons could shoot like stephen curry he'd be a better player than he is now
"Eastern conference but also that roster was significantly better than what Steph had available to him in the first 4 games (he only played 4 before his hand fracture).  That roster in the playoffs had:  LeBron James  Kevin Love   J.R. Smith  George Hill  Jeff Green  Larry Nance  Tristan Thompson  Kyle Korver  Rodney Hood  Jordan Clarkson  That's not a *great* roster but that's not as trash as people make it out to be. There's real talent at a lot of positions on that roster. NBA veterans who know how to play the game.  In the season opener Curry had, in order of minutes played...   D'Lo  Eric Paschall  Glen Robinson III  Draymond Green  Jacob Evans  Jordan Poole  Marquese Chriss  Omari Spellman  2 of those players are rookies. Two of them are 2nd year players. Only 2 of them had ever played in an NBA game with Stephen Curry before. No true center.   And we've got people who want to take those 4 games, where his numbers weren't that bad outside of his 3's not falling, and try to make pronouncements about what kind of player he is?  Luckily even most of the nephews on r/NBA realize how ridiculous that is, hopefully the few people who espouse will get so embarrassed by their obvious axe to grind that they delete their accounts and never post again."
Certainly Stephen Curry. Shooting is the most important skill in Basketball so the best shooter would be the best player if everyone was same size.
Top ten MVP candidates according to Basketball Reference (based on past voting patterns):  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. James Harden  3. Anthony Davis  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. Kevin Durant  6. Nikola Jokic  7. Stephen Curry  8. Joel Embiid  9. LeBron James  10. Paul George  Many would put Harden ahead of Giannis because Harden has been historically hot in the last month.  Keep in mind that team record is a big component of this formula.

Wow that’s crazy! Did you know that Stephen Curry and Lebron James we’re born in the same hospital?
"Nobody will hit threes at 2015 Stephen Curry level anytime soon. There’s a reason he’s the greatest shooter of all time. That season literally cemented his legacy as the greatest. Harden is an amazing shooter and he’s creating for himself, but even if they’re unassisted, it’s just not comparable to Steph in terms of efficiency. Steph also has some of the greatest shooting highlights of all time that season. As a thunder fan I can tell you from first hand experience "

WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY II
"Game 7 of the NBA finals. Raptors vs Warriors. Golden state lead by 2 with 46.3 seconds to go. DeMarcus Cousins elbows Kyle Lowry in the face and even that thicc ass can’t cushion his fall. Lowry is concussed, that’s the end of his finals. No foul is called because Tony Brothers is the biggest waste of oxygen planet earth has ever seen. Nick Nurse calls a time out. “Jeremy! You’re on!” He yells. But Jeremy is frightened. He sinks into his chair, but alas, the buzzer sounds and he jogs onto the hardwood with Serge, Kawhi, OG and Pascal. Raptors ball. Pascal inbounds to Jeremy. Before he can even look up, Steph has stolen the ball and peeled off down the floor. He’s going to do it. Stephen Curry is going to break the hearts of all Canadians, and Lin will be a villain. But then, out of nowhere, right before Curry was going to caress the ball into the net, the claw of Kawhi spanks the ball against the backboard. There will be no Curry game winner today. Kawhi chuckles to himself. hueehuEeEHuAa. 22.7 seconds left. Serge Ibaka retrieves the ball and passes it off to Pascal Siakam. Pascal holds the ball up. He’s been toying with Draymond all night. Pascal drives to the rim, blowing by Draymond and ducking under Boogie. He flicks the ball up toward the rim. It bounces, rolls and teeters on the edge of the rim, but alas misses the net. Boogie goes up to fetch the loose ball, but shockingly loses the tussle to Ibaka. 9.83 seconds left. Ibaka is smothered by Durant, Boogie and Draymond. Tony Brothers is picking his nose in the corner, no foul is called. 7. 6. 5.  3 seconds go past before he flings the ball to what looks like someone in a raptors uniform, standing in the corner. He guessed right. Jeremy catches the ball. 4. 3. 2. The Warriors flock to him in desperation, but Jeremy is calm. It all floods back to him. Being cut from the Warriors. Linsanity. The injuries. At this moment, Jeremy is at peace. The milliseconds go past. 1. Jeremy puts up the shot. The buzzers sounds. The Air Canada centre goes silent. SPLASH. The arena erupts. The raptors bench and staff flock to Jeremy, smothering him in happiness and joy. Toronto are NBA champions.  Jeremy, JEREMY, wake up! Jeremy rubs his eyes and looks around. Trae Young is looming over him. He’s so close that Jeremy can see his bald spot. “We’re here Jeremy”. He looks around. He’s on a plane. “Big game today” says Trae, “Sacramento are a tough team this year.”  Jeremy Lin starts to cry."
Stephen Curry. Because I simply can't stand him. Fantastic player tho. 
Stephen Curry is a good 3 point shooter
"It just goes to show for all the scouts and stuff we have we just don’t know who will really be the next One. Jokic was a mid 2nd rounder, Giannis mid first, Pistons picked Darko over Melo, Wade, and Bosh. Hasheem Thabeet and whoever Johnny Flynn are were picked before Demar Derozan and Stephen Curry! I laugh whenever anyone is SO sure they are right about young players."
"Traditional PG (That means no LeBron, Doncic, Simmons) I would want right now and would trust to best a starting caliber PG:  Stephen Curry  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Damian Lillard  Kemba Walker   Kyle Lowry   Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook  Mike Conley  John Wall  &amp;nbsp;   Jamal Murray  De'Aaron Fox  Eric Bledsoe  Goran Dragic  Spencer Dinwinddie   Lou Williams  D'Angelo Russell  Ricky Rubio  Reggie Jackson   Jeremy Lin  &amp;nbsp;  Terry Rozier  George Hill  Derrick Rose  Darren Collison   Lonzo Ball  Patty Mills  Tyus Jones  Jeff Teague   Rajon Rondo  &amp;nbsp;  Guys that're playing well but are still proving themselves: SGA, Van Vleet, Payton, Tomas Satoransky, CoJo // Mudiay, Kris Dunn, Derrick White &amp; Dennis Smith Jr. (Less Proven)  The rest of the PGs imo are just about the same level, and are more a  better of fit, and they're hundreds of guys in about the same level such as Shane Larkin and now Brad Wanamaker on the Celtics.

"Laker fans making anything up to shit on the Celtics is bizarre lol   ""Since Nov. 26, the Celtics have scored an outrageous 119.3 points per 100 possessions with Irving in the lineup while maintaining close to a league-best type of defense with him on the court.

"Reggie Miller is basically a better version of Klay Thompson, at least on offense. Better shooter and a much better passer than Klay.  He led the league in TS% twice and offensive rating three times. His 1990-1991 season is the best offensive rating season in NBA history from a guy that scored 20 or more PPG. That season is also the 12th best TS% season in NBA history from 20 PPG scorers.  Among players that averaged 18 PPG or more (his career average was 18.2 PPG), he is 4th all time in TS%, behind only Stephen Curry, Adrian Dantley, and Karl-Anthony Towns.  Only behind Chris Paul and Magic Johnson for career offensive rating for guys that averaged 18 or more.  Absolute legend, and one of the most fun players to watch in the league. Not quite as electrifying as Steph, but it's not too far off.  I know when I was growing up, Reggie Miller (and then Peja, Ray Allen, and Michael Redd a little later on) was the guy that you emulated if you wanted to be a three point shooter, like people do with Curry now.

"“They didn’t even play with the 5 point line,   I’m not saying that Stephen Curry WOULDNT be able to hit 200-foot jumpers, I just don’t think he’d be the best in the league at it”"

What I meant is : you can pick up a ball, Chuck some 3s and think that you are the second coming of Stephen Curry but you won't grow 6'8 250 pounds moving like a guard, having the court vision of a eagle and be as athletic as LeBron.   "
"Can you read the actual article instead of posting garbage every single time. This is a serious pattern with you. Let me just quote the article which makes this a total non-issue.  &gt;The contentiousness connected to the two teams went in many different directions, reportedly including an unofficial ban by the Cavaliers on any sneakers endorsed by Warriors’ point guard Stephen Curry.  Not an official ban, if anything the contents contained in the story make this more of an understanding than an actual ""ban"". But let's continue through the article since this is the only chance you read anything in the actual article.  &gt;Ric Bucher of Bleacher Report looked at how NBA rivalries and the competitive nature of individual players help drive what footwear is worn. He noted that edict by the Cavaliers after citing Golden State forward Draymond Green’s similar attitude about wearing shoes endorsed by former Cavs forward LeBron James.  This talks about it as a policy across the NBA as a whole. You don't wear your rivals' shoes. This is very understandable. It's why Nike's owner might choose to never wear Adidas. It's not a true ban, it's about how rivalries influence the choice of shoe.  &gt;It was understood more than plainly stated, leaving one member of the Cavs’ Finals roster last year unaware of the rule—but only, perhaps, because he never considered wearing UAs. Another former Cavalier texted: ‘There was no way anyone on [Cleveland] the last few years would wear [them], for the obvious reasons.'  Read as: If you aren't a dipshit, you would understand why Cavs would never wear a Curry shoe.  This is such a non-issue and you want to pretend like it's something substantial. You're a joke."
&gt;an unofficial ban by the Cavaliers on any sneakers endorsed by Warriors’ point guard Stephen Curry.  Imagine if Steph took a tactical courtside interview and rapid fire endorsed all their shoes.
"I honestly don't think this one is ghostwritten. I think it's heavily editorialized. I'm almost 90% sure Steph wrote this but a ton of editing went into correcting format, flow, and styling.  Hence why halfway through the piece he mentions they could put a screenshot of the tweet he mentions. He probably wrote it then went back and forth with an editor at the Tribune to finish the piece.   [Look at his past article from August 2018](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/stephen-curry-womens-equality). This is ghostwritten. It has proper sentence structure everywhere, formatting, big paragraphs, and even a semi colon at one point. They are almost night and day."
Idk man. Sure Jlin gets fucked real hard but Stephen Curry does too. Close call imo.  Well I have been hoping somehow Jlin gets back to the Warriors and now I'm just a little unsure about that. They'd been fucked so bad every night. 
"&gt;	I think you’re overestimating the talent of Curry and underestimating the Warriors as a squad on a whole  I think *you’re* doing the exact opposite.   &gt;	While their offense is potent..it’s a system  Yep. Know what that system is called? Stephen Wardell Curry. With Curry on the court during the KD era, they’ve won 80% of their games. Without Curry on the court, they’ve won 55% of their games.   &gt;	It’s not like they just iso the ball with Curry like the Thunder Do with Russ.  Are you trying to blame caching for why Westbtook takes some of the dumbest shots in the league?  &gt;	All the things that have to go right for a team to win. Russ not winning anything isn’t proof of Curry being better.  Winning isn’t the only metric Curry has over Russ. He also has one more MVP. Steph also has higher efficiency stats across the board. Curry vs. Westbrook isn’t even a contest. I’m taking Curry literally every time."
"The Cavs medical staff sent a memo to the team:   &gt; It has come to our attention that players wish to wear the new Stephen Curry sneakers. Please, no fucking Under Armour. Our jobs are hard enough as it is."
"Were thinking of two different metaphorical bars here. The bar your referencing is a bar for everyone to be able to reach for because it is the absolute top of the top. The bar that were referencing here is the bar that needs to be met to be considered a ""spectacular shooter"". I would think thats a broad enough term that much more than one player in league history should be able to meet that bar, therefore Stephen Curry should not be the bar in this instance."

"Here, mate:  &gt;Stephen Curry declared for NBA Draft. Doug Gottlieb ""He doesnt have the upside of Rubio. Jennings, Flynn, Mills, Teague all more athletic"
Great read. This article is the cherry on top of why no one can hate Stephen Curry. The dude is a baller and I'm glad he continues to make his critics eat their words. Steph gonna Steph. 
Stephen Curry and Westbrook lol

"yes, stephen curry makes superstar teammates better than say lebron.   steph unlocked the rest of his game he didnt have unlocked in OKC"
Lays down on the floor in Stephen Curry
Michael Jordan Magic Johnson Larry Bird Tim Duncan LeBron James Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Wilt Chamberlain Shaquille O'Neal Kobe Bryant Bill Russell Hakeem Olajuwon Dirk Nowitzki Oscar Robertson Stephen Curry Jerry West Moses Malone Julius Erving Dwyane Wade Karl Malone Kevin Garnett 
Honestly kind of depends on the situation but virtually no one besides only Stephen Curry and Harden maybe but those two are kind of old so probably no one tbh.
"I don't know who the dream is? Don't be a douchebag. All I'm asking is for these claims to be backed up with facts. I'm not a Warriors fan or a Curry fan, but shitting on the greatest regular season run most of us have ever seen is disrespectful. There have not been ""quite a few"" seasons that are better, and, while Hakeem had a great MVP season, I don't know that it was better than Curry's. Would I draft prime Hakeem over prime Curry? Probably, but that's not the question.  [Basketball Reference Player Comparison](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y1=2016&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Hakeem+Olajuwon&amp;player_id2_select=Hakeem+Olajuwon&amp;y2=1994&amp;player_id2=olajuha01&amp;idx=players)  According to basketball reference, Curry absolutely annihilates Hakeem in almost every single metric, be it traditional or advanced, except defensive box plus/minus and defensive win shares.  In fact! If you ask basketball reference to rank every single MVP season ever by Win Shares, Hakeem sits right at NUMBER 50. That's 5-0. 49 other MVP winners with a higher winshare (including Curry, who sits at number 5 for that season.)  So Hakeem DEFINITELY had a better MVP season than Curry? Definitively, the answer is No. And before you try to talk about Curry losing in the playoffs, and everything Hakeem did during their title run, remember we're talking about the regular season that preceded the award.

"Maybe so, but integrating KD has altered what made the Warriors the Warriors: A fully realized Stephen Curry, where the team runs through him and him alone. KD is reducing him on his own team. "
"I would give it to Harden. The catch and shoot numbers for Lillard are better and Lillard probably has the crazier range in the league for anyone not named Stephen Curry. But Harden is a much better shot creator, shoots similar overall percentages from three while creating a lot more of his own shots and has better numbers finishing around the rim.  They are both really good, but i think we need to value how crazy it is that Harden shoots this well (with overall percentages equal or better than Dame) creating so much of his own attempts.  Dame is assisted on 51% of his threes. Harden is at 13.8% this season."
"Wizards are not that dumb to trade Beal for Drummond. On the other hand, Ernie Grunfeld traded no. 5 pick for Mike Miller and  Randy Foye in a draft which had Stephen Curry in..."

The world doesn't deserve Stephen Curry. 
Is Stephen Curry better than James Harden? lol
"&gt;STOP SUBBING STEPHEN CURRY OUT WHEN HE GETS HOT, YOU ARE LITERALLY WASTING AN ALL TIMERS CAREER  I'm fine with it"
I just want to quickly note that Giannis was absolutely NOT looking to run away with MVP at the beginning of the season. It was all Stephen Curry talk. That man was shooting significantly better splits than even his legendary 2015-16 season. Warriors also had the best record in the league at that point with Steph averaging 3 more ppg than anyone else in the league while shooting like 54% from 3. Just wanted to clear up the recency bias...
"sweet, dead ball. here's the trivia question:   who averages more points per game in finals games, Stephen Curry or Kobe Bryant? and, by how many?"
First Team  LeBron James Giannis Antetokounmpo Anthony Davis James Harden Stephen Curry  Second Team  Kevin Durant Paul George Nikola Jokić Kyrie Irving Damian Lillard  Third Team  Kawhi Leonard Jimmy Butler Joel Embiid Russell Westbrook Ben Simmons

Stephen Curry with a 40 inch airball

"Here’s an analysis (with statistics, not just someone “talking out of their ass”) of Curry’s 2016-2017 season. This was his worst season out of his last 5, yet he still had the highest impact on the performance of teammates. You can gather that same data for 2017-2018 from nbawowy and compare to Harden or other MVP candidates, no one has the same impact.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/amp/"
"Hey I'm a Lakers fan,  I hate the stephen curry. No offense, you're a great guy who's really good and has been an MVP. You really impact the Warriors and you're awesome but I hate you."
Harden is not below average on defense. He is exactly average. Do you want me to name some truly bad defenders?   * Stephen Curry * Kemba Walker * Kyle Lowry
"Golden State Warriors at OKC Thunder February 2013    To quote the game log:    &gt; 0.0 Stephen Curry makes 37-foot three pointer	121 - 118    The Warriors were in the middle of the epic 73 win season, Steph was in unanimous MVP form, while the Thunder were also at the height of their powers. KD was a monster this game.    In terms of narrative, history, and quality of game, this was my absolute favorite. I've watched the NBA pretty closely since the early 2000s. The LeBron/Melo game I hardly remember, but this one I will never forget.     The other game I remember that comes close was when the Heatles' 27-game win streak was snapped by Chicago in 2013."
Maybe stop playing Stephen Curry like he’s Kyle Korver
http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21978406/kevin-pelton-weekly-mailbag-including-stephen-curry-mvp-case  That was last year.  Curry is playing much better this year so it's only going to be crazier the gravity he creates.

#WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY II
"Stephen ""Lowry"" Curry"
Stephen Curry is atrocious at defense. Much worse than Harden
"This sub has so much potential holy shit James harden, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Austin Rivers, Draymond Green. Salt level over 9000"
"Stephen Curry is overrated, he's not even better than KD"
Stephen Curry is not an above average defender?
I want to see humility in a Spurs star. I know James is called King and he can be arrogant sometimes but I guess he earned it. I'm not saying other superstars are arrogant. I just like how Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard are just doing their jobs.  Maybe Stephen Curry would be a good fit too but I don't think someone as flashy as Russell Westbrook would fit Spurs. We all remember how weird it was when T-Mac was playing for Spurs.
James Harden Chris Paul	 Stephen Curry	 Kyle Lowry	 Russell Westbrook Damian Lillard  Calling Kyrie not a top-5 point guard isn't that crazy imo. He has been really good this year though
1998  PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Dwyane Wade  SF: LeBron James  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Dwight Howard
"I was born @ year 2000, here we go.  PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Paul George  SF: LeBron James  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Joel Embiid  All can shoot 3s decently (IDK about Embiid though). All can space the floor. All can finish well. All can switch in D to cover Curry. Can teamplay or ISO at any given moment. With that being said, spacing is key for today’s NBA so y’all are barbeque chicken. "
"Stephen Curry, Luka Dončić, and Γιάννης Αντετοκούνμπο. Honorable mention is Harden FreeDawkin's videos because I'm not watching 15 free throws in real time."
"I dunno man, it seems you just have an axe to grind because you hate Russ. [Stats say Russ is really good this season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id1_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=westbru01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id2_select=James+Harden&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=hardeja01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id3_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y3=2019&amp;player_id3=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id4_select=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;y4=2019&amp;player_id4=leonaka01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id5_hint=Rajon+Rondo&amp;player_id5_select=Rajon+Rondo&amp;y5=2019&amp;player_id5=rondora01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id6_hint=Marcus+Smart&amp;player_id6_select=Marcus+Smart&amp;y6=2019&amp;player_id6=smartma01&amp;idx=players)."
Stephen Curry is not an MVP candidate this year.
"Classic backing away from an argument because you're clearly wrong by making it about me. You say ""You don’t seem to truly understand the dynamic that occurred in Chicago or in LA."" while at the same time believing that the spurs 16-17 season should've been focused more on LMA.   My response could be summed down to ""Being able to finish is a sign of greatness."" 'Lebron is way better than any other current nba player, so much better that it's actually an insult to group him with them' while he is 3W 6L in the finals. According to your words Stephen Curry would be a much greater player, because he has 3W with only 1L. And as we all know ""Being able to finish is a sign of greatness.""  Also how did you manage to get all the way up there on the high horse chief? &gt;""You don’t seem to truly understand"" Feel free to explain it, I'm right here.   And how am I the triggered one, you seem to be out here downvoting every single one of my comments, that makes me very sad!  "
“Scurry” = Stephen Curry
"That 73-9 team was a Curry led team. Not Draymond, not Klay - Stephen Curry.  "
"Stephen Curry changes how teams play defense. His presence alone nets open shots and space for his teammates. OCD about stats, id say Curry is more impactful offensive player, even though KD is the best ISO."
"Hand checking and tough defense does test you for sure, but MJ was not playing 1 v 5 like Lebron does today. Defenses had different rules, but they were also way less advanced in terms of schemes. If you watch games from that era you'll notice WAY more ISO 1v1 plays and WAY less PnR/PnP than you see today. The game changed. With the illegal defense rule, MJ used to ISO all day long lol and almost nobody in the league could stop him. Try to run that same scheme today and it just wouldn't work. Teams can help off their defender a lot more and can focus their entire effort on 1 guy, whereas in MJ's time they could not.  He'd certainly be great, but the new rules would not free up MJ, they'd make his bread and butter more difficult. Thibs was able to exploit the new rules when he was an assistant in Boston when they won a Chip. They would flood one side of the court and use KG (and then later Noah in Chicago) but staying in the paint for 2.9 seconds, stepping out, and then stepping back in to forgo the 3 second rule. That shit was impossible during Jordan's era.  In the 90s, you weren't allowed to double a player without the ball. What the cavs did in 2016 to steph curry also exploited these modern rules by completely focussing 1 player on Curry, and ALWAYS helping when he was running off screens etc. You can read more about it here https://www.sbnation.com/2017/1/16/14229548/stephen-curry-stats-cavaliers-defense-analysis  I'm not discrediting MJ, but the new rules would have made his game much harder to play. He would obviously adjust, as would any great player. But he wouldn't get better coming into the modern NBA. The NBA made those rule changes in large part BECAUSE of MJ. "
"He said Steve Nash, then Steve Curr, then Steve Nash again. He also said Steve Curr has cemented himself as being the best three point shooter the last few years so that makes me think he meant to be talking about Stephen Curry. I really don't know."
"I'd say:      1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. James Harden   4. Stephen Curry   5. Giannis Antetokounmpo   6. Kawhi Leonard   7. Anthony Davis   8. Russell Westbrook 9. Paul George   10. Kyrie/Dame/Jokic/Embiid      The rest, I agree with. You could switch up Curry and Harden, PG and Westbrook or Embiid/Dame. But I'd definitely say that Harden is top 3 at this point. I see an argument for Curry over Harden, but this is just how I'd put it."
Wardell Stephen Curry?

"u mean they not the same person?? stephen ""seth"" curry??"
"[Who is the hotter of the two, James Curry or Stephen Harden?](https://i.imgur.com/TvwU7vS.jpg) "
There is no doubt in my mine that the REAL MVP is the man Wardell Stephen Curry II.   If Curry had the freedom to do what Harden is currently is we would all be saying Curry for MVP. Harden has an unprecedented usage and time on the ball rate.   It is just a shame that instagram highlight videos of Harden pushing people over then the caption being 'Harden put him on SKATES!' is so popular. 
"LeBron drives, bringing 2-3 defenders with him. He takes flight. Both teams watch closely to witness the complete and total decimation of the rim.   WAIT, LeBron is turning in mid air. How can he think this fast? What could he possibly be doing?   He sends the ball across the floor back to half court. This had to be a mistake... He had to have been over thinking, so he just made a stupid decision, right?  Suddenly, the ball falls perfectly into another man's hands. Who could possibly be at half court waiting for his opportunity?  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Stephen ""Skyfucker"" Curry.  He drains that shit "
Stephen Curry is a Christian and would not support a spirit cooker.
"Game 7 of the NBA finals. Raptors vs Warriors. Golden state lead by 2 with 46.3 seconds to go. DeMarcus Cousins elbows Kyle Lowry in the face and even that thicc ass can’t cushion his fall. Lowry is concussed, that’s the end of his finals. No foul is called because Tony Brothers is the biggest waste of oxygen planet earth has ever seen. Nick Nurse calls a time out. “Jeremy! You’re on!” He yells. But Jeremy is frightened. He sinks into his chair, but alas, the buzzer sounds and he jogs onto the hardwood with Serge, Kawhi, OG and Pascal. Raptors ball. Pascal inbounds to Jeremy. Before he can even look up, Steph has stolen the ball and peeled off down the floor. He’s going to do it. Stephen Curry is going to break the hearts of all Canadians, and Lin will be a villain. But then, out of nowhere, right before Curry was going to caress the ball into the net, the claw of Kawhi spanks the ball against the backboard. There will be no Curry game winner today. Kawhi chuckles to himself. *hueehuEeEHuAa*. 22.7 seconds left. Serge Ibaka retrieves the ball and passes it off to Pascal Siakam. Pascal holds the ball up. He’s been toying with Draymond all night. Pascal drives to the rim, blowing by Draymond and ducking under Boogie. He flicks the ball up toward the rim. It bounces, rolls and teeters on the edge of the rim, but alas misses the net. Boogie goes up to fetch the loose ball, but shockingly loses the tussle to Ibaka. 9.83 seconds left. Ibaka is smothered by Durant, Boogie and Draymond. Tony Brothers is picking his nose in the corner, no foul is called. *7. 6. 5.* 3 seconds go past before he flings the ball to what looks like someone in a raptors uniform, standing in the corner. He guessed right. Jeremy catches the ball. *4. 3. 2.* The Warriors flock to him in desperation, but Jeremy is calm. It all floods back to him. Being cut from the Warriors. Linsanity. The injuries. At this moment, Jeremy is at peace. The milliseconds go past. *1*. Jeremy puts up the shot. The buzzers sounds. The Air Canada centre goes silent. SPLASH. The arena erupts. The raptors bench and staff flock to Jeremy, smothering him in happiness and joy. Toronto are NBA champions.  Jeremy, JEREMY, wake up! Jeremy rubs his eyes and looks around. Trae Young is looming over him. He’s so close that Jeremy can see his bald spot. “We’re here Jeremy”. He looks around. He’s on a plane. “Big game today” says Trae, “Sacramento are a tough team this year.”  Jeremy Lin starts to cry."
"Also [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaAgabg4sX0)  And last year's All-Star game where Team Stephen lost to Team Lebron was technically for charity too:  &gt;[The NBA previously announced that it will donate $350,000 to the winning team's cause and $150,000 to the losing team's charity.](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/lebron-james-stephen-curry-choose-charities-star-game/story?id=52904804)  &gt;Also Each player on the winning team will receive $100,000, and the losing-team players will pocket $25,000, league sources said. The only modification is the winner's compensation, with a $50,000 boost from previous years.  [Curry was 3/11 from 3pt land.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/allstar/NBA_2018.html)  Jokes aside, Curry care about kids. Curry goes out of his way to visit (sometimes terminally) ill kids. I've watched one clip where Curry was there talking to the kid and giving the kid kicks but the kid was either too sick or too sad to care."

"&gt;	On the film, Payne is belting out dribble-and-shoot orders to both Curry and Doncic. One dribble, side step 2. One dribble, escape 3, coming back the other way! Side step 2, mirrored footwork, escape 3. Side step 2, come back, one dribble, escape 3.   &gt;	“These are really difficult concepts,” Payne says. “When you’re Stephen, these are difficult concepts. This wasn’t a BS workout. This was a real I-have-something-that-I-have-to-get-done-with-Stephen workout. To be thrown into that and respond as well as he did, it was impressive.”  &gt;	This particular drill took Curry three minutes flat to complete. His shots were flawless, barely grazing the rim. Doncic, trying to keep up with the commands and pace, took nine minutes and forty-eight seconds. (Doncic is also still learning English, his fourth language.)  &gt;“That’s a lot of information coming at him at once, that’s tough,” Payne says. “My terminology runs deep. The words aren’t complex. But when you start putting together combinations, it’s … tough.”  ——-  &gt;	“Everyone’s like, he’s got this stepback,” Payne says. “Yeah, he’s got a stepback, but you’re not looking at how he’s slowing them down before that stepback. You fall asleep, your feet die and then all of a sudden, he hits you with this real hard stepback. It’s so easy for him because he’s big and strong. His mechanics are really good, too.”  &gt;	The week before the Curry workout, Doncic had spent time assessing and training his biomechanics at P3 Sports Science lab in Santa Barbara. They found that his deceleration abilities -- to figuratively go from 60-to-zero -- are some of the best they’ve ever seen among hundreds of pro athletes. (Doncic has visited P3 annually since he was 15 years old)."
"Ok well who's smart? List them and I'll give you routine dumb shit they say. And no, constantly praising everyone doesn't make you smart. Find people who praise and criticize on an equal level.   From what I see Cowherd praises the Warriors, the Patriots, LeBron James, Tom Brady, Sean McVay, Stephen Curry. Looks like the people he praises constantly win. The people who doesn't constantly lose. Seems smart to me. "

Surprised to not see Stephen Curry on that list
"Dude is brilliant but there are these other all time greats in the league currently too named Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and LeBron James."
"Pure supposition not supported by the data.  Seriously, [read the thing](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-curry-is-the-revolution/). There's a lot there. Curry is not like other players."
"Except that 538 [did an analysis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-curry-is-the-revolution/) that demonstrated that Steph Curry *uniquely* doesn't become less efficient with higher usage, already."
Harden is better than Stephen Curry.
He should invite  Stephen Curry  to  a big meal ！
"Warriors - Klay and Dray.  Imagine the lineup of Stephen Curry, Kevin Durrant, Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, and Jordan Evans.      Yes.  I know it is Jacob Evans.  "
"Let's see, what would be the best Warriors roster we could put together, keeping their current best players?  Starting lineup:  PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Draymond Green  C:  Demarcus Cousins  2nd string:  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: Luka Doncic  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C:  Joel Embiid   My question is could you make a team with the remaining NBA players who would have a chance at beating this roster in a 7 game series?   I purposely left LeBron off this list to give the theoritical dream crusher team a chance to beat this (mostly) theoretical dream team. "
They’re fair to Stephen Curry. That’s all that matters to me.
"Stephen Curry: pro-cancer, anti-vaxxer"
"Starters  James Harden Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant Anthony Davis Paul George  Reserves  Nikola Jokic LeBron James Damian Lillard Rudy Gobert Karl-Anthony Towns   ( Same as Zach Lowe’s, but Davis, Jokic for me was 6’s)   Westbrook is averaging a triple double right now, but his numbers for me aren’t as impressive in terms of effectiveness this year. That said he would be in.  The last spot is hard because in terms of impact and how they play I really want to give the last spot to Steven Adams. But L. Aldridge has been a beast for the Spurs, especially as of late. I watched his career night a couple weeks ago and he looked like a spry chicken playing out of his mind. I’d give the nod to Aldridge. "
"How good are you at taking comments and putting a different meaning to it then originally intended? Are you willing to make Stephen Curry look like the anti christ? If so, you're hired!"
"I honestly do not understand the Warriors hate.  They literally only have **2** All Stars on the team, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.  All this talk about 5 All Stars is overblown.  Klay is not going to make the All-Star team.  Draymond Green is not going to make the All-Star team.  DeMarcus Cousins is not going to make the All-Star team. "
"Is it just me or is this thanking God for every made three from Steph just to fucking annoying? For fuck sake ur Stephen Curry, scoring threes for you is like walking on the street for me...I respect you're faith but come on every fucking time three is made and he points finger in the sky? Makes him look like an idiot when he repeats it for like 75083 times. "
"Derrick Rose is one of the best mid-range shooters in the league.  From 10-16 feet, he's shooting 46%. From 16-3pt, he's shooting 45%.  For comparison, DeMar 37% and 40% from those two spots. Stephen Curry is shooting 42% and 44%"
"Stephen hates charities, anti-cancer charities more so, and the dude probably hates anti-children's cancer charities the most. The dude also has a serpent on his side.  Clearly Stephen Curry is the devil. "
/u/cassatta is talking shit. He said it in 2016 and that was the 3-1 year so he was correct.

i heart stephen curry
Your sense of humour has as much FMVPs as Stephen Curry
we picked 3 point guards in the first round of that draft. none named wardell stephen curry.
"Klay ""Stephen ""Klay Thompson"" Curry"" Thompson"
HERE COMES STEPHEN CURRY
Has Curry lost his touch? This hot take and more by Stephen A after the break! 
Nice of Klay to pass up a 3 to that bum Stephen Curry 
Or Kevin Durant/ Stephen Curry/ Klay Thompson or Dray but his ego is bigger than all those guys combined for some strange reason.
Stephen Curry could have taken the night off.

Wardell Stephen Curry 54
"He also didn't have to face the caliber of explosive scorers that Paul has had to.  He never had to defend Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Tony Parker, Damian Lillard in playoff series.  Paul played in that era and STILL made 7 All-Defensive 1st teams."
Age 27 seasons for the following players:  Kobe Bryant 2005-2006  Stephen Curry 2015-2016  Dwyane Wade 2008-2009  Dirk Nowitzki 2005-2006  Lebron James 2011-2012  Michael Jordan 1990-1991  Magic Johnson 1986-1987  Kevin Garnett 2003-2004  Shaquille O'Neal 1999-2000
I thought it was the plethora of all stars on the Warriors that made them good. Apparently it's actually the league propping up their sorry asses.       Up top I've seen you claim that Stephen Curry of all people doesn't know how to do a step back.       Do you actually watch basketball?
It's funny because he shares a last name with Stephen Curry
they said in youtube hes the next stephen curry after 6 years.
"I was gonna say a cow, then donkey but then said Draymond as a thow away joke. SHould have scratched the donkey part and put Draymond there  In case you didn't know i was trying to make a reference to [Curry being the best deadlifter](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/stephen-curry-can-deadlift-400-pounds/), behind Ezeli, in the team even before he put on weight after the 2016 finals"
Delete this Stephen Curry is the best shooter in NBA history
Not if you’re named Stephen curry lol 
That would be Stephen Wardell Curry but i do agree Harden is better than Lebron and Durant offensively in the regular season. Not even close in the playoffs however.
Harden shoots FTs at essentially the same rate per drive to the basket as Stephen Curry.   Math.   /end
"James ""Stephen Curry"" Harden"
Team A or Team B?  PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Michael Jordan  SF: LeBron James  PF: Tim Duncan  C: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  or  PG: Luka Doncic  SG: Luka Doncic  SF: Luka Doncic  PF: Luka Doncic  C: Luka Doncic
"Hi, this is Stephen Curry and I'm taking that point guard spot on the offense team. "
"he went from dunker, to post ups, to mid range, to stephen curry. THE FULL CIRCLE"
With fucking Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson spotting up.

"Returning center DeMarcus Cousins yelled out, “I made as many threes on fewer attempts as Steph Curry!” Sharpshooter Stephen Curry gave a look of pleasant surprise. Hot little slut Steve Kerr yelled out, “We got an \[expletive\] Infinity Gauntlet now.” And before the Warriors hit the locker room door, the rest of the league sobbed and cried, “We all so fucked now.”"

"It's different types of games. Stephen Curry 2015-2016 was one of the most effective seasons of all time, ridiculously efficient. That being said, Harden shoots for more volume, at less efficiency, but he puts up such ridiculous numbers, 35/6/9, is underrated. I think Harden has a type of season that won't be really respected for a few years because to put up such points while being what, top 3 in assists is unique. With Harden the difficulty of his season to be able to overcome to this point probably won't get recognized because his team is ass, and then it's like they keep increasing the difficulty with the relentless barrage of injuries"
"It sounded like I said anyone could do what Harden is doing, but that's not what I meant. What I meant was Harden is dominating like he is doing and it should and does get more credit because he has the ability to be so dominant individually, some one like Stephen Curry or KD might be in a different situation but they aren't so we cant' hypotehtically say like many people do 'well Stephen or KD *could* do what Harden is doing on a less stacked team"" and that's why some people on worse teams get more MVP recognition, I think it's more about who has the most responsibility to elevate their team and is able to do it, the Rockets would be competing for Zion if they didn't have James Harden, which was how I meant to respond to OP.   But then again, I don't even think OP is right that people with worse players around them do get more recognition because it is rare to see a player who dominates on a bad team get the MVP, it's basically half a team award and half a player award. If I had my way it would just be the best player that season, but I don't"
"It was fourth quarter, with less than ten seconds left and Golden State was down by 2. T h e arena was so loud, that Steph couldn’t hear his own thoughts.          He calmly walked the ball up the court and saw Russell waiting for him at the half court line, watching him intently with his eyes. Once Steph reached half court, he quickly passed the ball to Kevin and once Kevin touched the ball, every fan in the arena instantly booed.          "" CUPCAKE! CUPCAKE!” everyone chanted in the stands. Kevin calmly dribbled the ball and watched as his former teammate, Andre Roberson, checked him.          After passing the ball, Steph ran straight through the lane and took a screen from Draymond. Russell bumped into Draymond and then hurriedly moved to catch up to Steph, but this was enough space to give the sharpshooter room.          Kevin dribbled the ball to the top of the key and Andre followed. He gave him a quick in and out with the ball and then passed it to Steph once he saw him open. Steph caught the ball in the corner behind the three point line and quickly released it in the air. Russell moved to contest the shot, but was too late.         The clock was running down as the ball sailed to the basket. Steph had landed and watched as the ball moved in the air. He closed his eyes and silently prayed that the ball would sink in the net. When he heard the buzzer go off, he opened his eyes and saw the ball rattle in the hoop. The whole Warriors bench stood and watched. BUZZZZZ!!!!!        ""  WOOOOO!!!!!” Steph yelled excitedly. He raised his arms in the air as Thunder fans booed. The team was running onto the floor to hug him and celebrate the game winner. Thunder players were shaking their heads at the sudden lost and standing in disbelief. Steph continued to stand confidently as Kevin was the first to reach him. He put his forehead to Steph’s and yelled.       “ YEAH!” Kevin yelled out loud. He brought a hand to Steph’s head and smiled. Steph looked in his eyes and smiled, too. At that moment, Steph focused solely on Kevin and wanted nothing more than to kiss him. Kevin was leaning close to him, so Steph leaned up and kissed him.            It went silent in the arena, every fan either stopped cheering or booing and watched as Stephen Curry kissed Kevin Durant."

"Uhh, the greatest team of this generation is built around 1 player - Stephen Curry. Their entire offensive system relies on Curry.  Meanwhile Harden is basically a 1 man team.  Or are Curry and Harden not ""great"" players either?"

"It’s the fans “fault”. So the ire is directed towards the fans and the rules that give them such power. Why does this thread even exist when Luka is third league wide in all star votes?   Is Doncic more fun to watch than Stephen Curry? Or does he just have a larger worldwide fanbase. Not about being “good” or even fun necessarily, it’s about who likes him more than others   Some players have contractual bonuses that award for all star selection. The all star game is more than an exhibition for the fans. "
“The greatest shooter have all time is Stephen Curry have the Warriors”. 
"&gt; This Green knows what to do when defenses don't guard him. The tactic isn't new, and the solution usually isn't to jack more 3s -- not on this roster. When Green catches the ball wide-open on the perimeter, he flicks it to Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant, and in one motion sprints toward them for an impromptu screen. If no one is on Green, that means no defender will meet his star teammate on the other side of that pick. And that is death.  All of this. He doesn't really need to shoot well threes as long as he's not stopping the offense dead, hesitating and hitching before a shot. And when his mind is in the right place, this team can start humming.  &gt; he exists almost outside of Toronto's offense  I haven't seen a Raptors game in a while but this was very apparent before. Wonder if it has somewhat improved."

Why are you so sure? Stephen Curry is pure skill and he even improve over the years
"Well we had Jordan 2.0 in Kobe, and lots of kids will be emulating Steph’s game, so I’m sure than in 5-20 years we will see the another Stephen Curry."

Stephen Curry is one bad man!    -Tim Roye
"Here's my question. The meaning of ""Stan"" as a reference to the song would make your above comment read something like this:  &gt; If you aren't such a fan of Stephen Curry that you're a mentally I'll suicidal, homicidal sycophant, what are you doing with your life?  Or perhaps  &gt; If you aren't such a fan of Steph to the extent that you project your problems and frustrations with your life onto him in a one-sided, hugely unstable and toxically volatile way, what are you doing with your life?  Obviously, I know you don't mean those things, and you (and everyone else, including me) use ""Stan"" to simply mean a very passionate kind of fandom.  However, until I recently revisited the song, the gap between the song and the common usage didn't seem to stark.  The song is obviously an iconic (and perhaps transcendent) piece of art. It deserves all the praise it gets.  But reflecting on the darkness and depth of the song adds a morose note to your comment that I don't think you intend, and I just find that disparity interesting. It's not unique to you, and I do it too, but I just find that gap interesting to ponder."

"a) Stephen Curry really helped as he generational talent changed the way teams play today. Also he’s very likeable to all kinds of audience, something that you need in a player when you try to market the team especially for kids.    b) Championships, duh whatever moves they made en pursuit to their titles. Signing Kerr, Durant, etc, helped them to be a dynasty and dynasties always make your team worth more.    c)  Silicon Valley, they are in the heart of the technological world at a time when technology is exponentially increasing so like the population increased quite a bit during the last 10 years. More people in the city = more fans = sell more tickets and merch. It’s only gonna get better from here on out as the more into San Fransisco and their new arena which will have everything.  "
STEPHEN CURRY
Stephen Curry is a hell of a drug. 
Just a reminder that the Ricky Rubio you’re seeing is the same Ricky Rubio thought to be better than Stephen Curry and thus drafted before Stephen Curry. 
"The Warriors were in a 3-way tie for 5th best Championship Odds before the 2014-15 season at 20 to 1, and that was with a lot of excitement generated around Kerr's ball movement offense in the preseason. Cleveland was overwhelming favorites. Kerr's success is a big reason Durant, and later Cousins, joined in the first place. Kerr is just as much a part of the GSW Dynasty as the players they have, not just a freerider.  Golden State Warriors: 20-1 24 of 30      If Klay Thompson ends up getting that big extension before the Oct. 31 deadline, he should consider giving a portion of it to new Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, whose opened-up offense has been generating nothing but quality looks for the shooting guard during the preseason.      Thompson can keep most of the cash; the vast majority of his improvement has to do with killer confidence and a perfect release. We can't credit Kerr for those things.      What's happening with Thompson is a symptom of a larger change in Golden State—one that is giving rise to the hope that last year's 51-win effort was just the beginning.      B/R's Howard Beck chronicled the issues with former head coach Mark Jackson's plan of attack: ""The offense too often stalled and stagnated, resulting in muddled isolation plays and contested jumpers. There was little movement or dynamism, and little sense of cohesion.""      Already one of the league's top defensive outfits (the Warriors ranked third in defensive efficiency last year), Kerr's club is moving the ball beautifully on offense. Andrew Bogut and David Lee, great passers both, are now hubs of the attack, and Stephen Curry, Andre Iguodala et al. are feasting on cuts, flares and brush screens.      All this, and Kerr has only had a couple of months to install the basics of his admittedly complicated scheme.      If Golden State gets past the turnovers that hurt it last year and continued to crop up during the preseason, it is the team with the best shot to take one of the West's top three spots from the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Los Angeles Clippers or San Antonio Spurs.      If that happens, Thompson won't be alone in owing a debt to Kerr. Fans across the Bay Area will be right there with him."

"Stephen Curry, CP3, Kyrie"
"Wait you’re arguing that the OKC rebounding scene isn’t unique to the Thunder? Because it absolutely is.   Plenty of guards rebound and plenty of big men are better at nullifying opponents on the offensive glass than grabbing rebounds. But I’ve yet to see another player run away from Steph Curry to chase a defensive rebound, or another team have their point guard grab every FT rebound, or another team argue that it’s a beneficial fast break strategy with no evidence whatsoever.   The ball advances more slowly in this scenario. That’s an indisputable fact. That means that you’re not putting pressure on the defense until Russ dribbles all the way up the court into a defense that has had more time to set. But yes Stephen Adams is now 3 feet closer to the basket which means he’s still not in shooting range. Huzzah!"

"I find it hard to believe a Stephen Curry in the middle of his prime is tired after resting for half of the 4th quarter. Why even sub him back into the game if you're not going to run any plays for him. No, this has more to do with Kerr trying to recruit Durant for next season, buttering him up if you will."
"&gt;""There's this thing there with he and LeBron that's a little weird,"" Thompson said.   &gt;According to Thompson, James and Curry were close from Curry's days at Davidson to his early years in the league. Thompson said James was ""like a mentor"" to Curry, but as Curry's game improved, coinciding with the Warriors' rise, he ""challenged LeBron's status."" Since then, the two apparently haven't been as close, and it reportedly bothers Curry.   &gt;Thompson said it was another example of the chasm between Curry and some of the NBA's stars:   &gt;""I think if you ask them and they were being honest, they don't like all the hype he gets, and they have to direct it that way. I think out of all of them, if somebody doesn't like Steph Curry, I think it's probably Westbrook. He just shows no sign of — this really ain't about Steph. It's bigger.

"Stephen Curry is often talked about the star that gets the least calls though, even though he gets mauled off and on-ball.

"So imagine this NBA in the late 00's: These would be 16 best team lineups if every lottery team picked the IMO best available players at the moment in the drafts from '96-'09, and then never traded them away, based on these [redrafts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/aohdgx/rnba_game_threads_index_daily_discussion_february/eg3jzov/) I've done in the past few days. So here's basically if every team played their cards right in the 90's and 00's drafts:   Team | PG | SG | SF | PF | C | Bench including ---|---|----|----|----|----|---- 1.

Yeah, I can edit those rankings if you've got a convincing argument. I also added counted a couple of players from 1991-95 drafts, mostly notable ones who played into the late 00's, and re-drafted those drafts just with them. Though they're in italics and most likely benched, since most of them declined by then. If a team lacks ideal lottery picks in a position, assume an average player in that position is there."
think about it He started his rookie season being backup pg at warriors .. before of being sent down to d league cuz they didnt know how to play him... now many years later he much more matured and isnt afraid of spotlight ... and had his fair shares of up and downs ... but main thing it was said that he on target list of buyouts for GSW ... would really love him to play his backup role for real on a team where he truly can play to his potential and also improve much much more cuz of steve kerr and steph curry can help him improve his shot oh and from lin's youtube vids i seen he is buds with stephen

Those draft classes shaped the peak years of my NBA following. Yeah you can disagree with me on anything here, sure that's natural, but at the end of the day you can argue that there's as much subjective as objective elements to it.  Ranking all the draft lotteries I did by strength starting with the best: **'96, '03, '98, '99, '09, '05, '08, '01, '07, '04, '02, '97, '06, '00.**  And here's something interesting for an epilogue: A roster of 14 players from those 14 years, starting with the first pick of the worst draft IMO, all the way to the 14th pick of the best draft, ranked above:  **SF** Hedo Türkoğlu (From 2000, 1st pick, 16th IRL)  **PG** Rajon Rondo (From 2006, 2nd pick, 21st IRL)  **PG** Chauncey Billups (From 1997, 3rd pick, 3rd IRL)  **SF** Caron Butler (From 2002, 4th pick, 10th IRL)  **SF** Luol Deng (From 2004, 5th pick, 7th IRL)  **PF** Thaddeus Young (From 2007, 6th pick, 12th IRL)  **SF** Richard Jefferson (From 2001, 7th pick, 13th IRL)  **SG** Eric Gordon (From 2008, 8th pick, 7th IRL)  **PG** Nate Robinson (From 2005, 9th pick, 21st IRL)  **PG** Darren Collison (From 2009, 10th pick, 21st IRL)  **SG** Jason Terry (From 1999, 11th pick, 10th IRL)  **C** Brad Miller (From 1998, 12th pick, undrafted IRL)  **PF** Boris Diaw (From 2003, 13th pick, 21st IRL)  **SG** Kerry Kittles (From 1996, 14th pick, 8th IRL)  I guessing my starting lineup here would be **PG** Rajon Rondo, **SG** Chauncey Billups, **SF** Richard Jefferson, **PF** Hedo Türkoğlu, and **C** Brad Miller.  Where do you fancy this team finishing if they played in the 00's?  ----  I'll also chime in with a reply or a post on another day of which teams would have which players if they drafted like I did in the '96-'09 timeline, if they played their cards right the legacies could have been different for that generation. Of course, assuming all the lottery picks were never traded afterwards."
You referring to the finals series where he was matched up with the best player on the planet? The same guy who held the first ever unanimous MVP Stephen Curry to 8% shooting from the field when he was guarding him?

So if you say that teams that cannot get a preliminary action through initial penetration will attempt stationary 3s with no initial action to set it up, then even if that happens, it means that NBA teams will attack inefficiently. Unless you're Stephen Curry. But there is one of him.   Def 3 secs is just a form of illegal defence.  "
You really think Harden is better than Stephen fucking Curry?
"Stephen Curry already is in the perfect situation for himself and his numbers would all worsen if he had to carry a team, plus he would struggle with the increased workload because of his physique"
"Eh. I hate flowery prose. Strauss sees things differently, and his writing style stands out from his peers.

Though no longer at the point of attack, the HMS Furious was perhaps even more dangerous far from the fray, as the launching pad for many an air assault. She stood no chance of sneaking up on a target, so the move was to let her shield and help the fleet’s fleetest.  &gt; While Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney might not seem to have much in common with British military history, they’ve undergone their own conversion from cruisers to carriers. They’ve gone from ineffectively lumbering near the point of attack to helping out a quick bomber like Stephen Curry refuel and launch from afar. It’s a transformation that saved the Warriors against the Rockets in the late stages of the Western Conference finals — through their 101-92 Game 7 victory on Monday — and can power them to victory against the switch-heavy Cavaliers."

"Say what you want about the Warriors. They're successful because they are genuinely unselfish. And it all starts with the Splash Brothers. It's no mistake why other superstars wants to play with this group, especially in an era where all the superstars only looks out for their own interests. Stephen Curry is easily the most unselfish superstar in NBA history, in every sense of the word whether it's on the court, behind closed doors, etc..."

They joked about not going to the moon for less than 1 minute with Stephen saying that the government will come get them, but some bad media members take that to make clickbait and then it snowballed into ""Curry denies moon landings"" when that was a joke and 99.9% of the real content is ignored because it doesn't get clicks.

Does Stephen Curry hate his hometown? 
Technically both or neither...  Both of their names are actually Wardell Stephen Curry I and Wardell Stephen Curry II
The funny thing is for a couple days after he won the nba 'analysts' may have called them 1a and 1b. I remember Stephen A Smith the hot take overlord saying Durant has caught upto James    But it really doesn't seem that narrative has stuck around very long. Especially with how Curry is playing this year and is far more important to the warriors success than Durant

"I agree with this. Instead of shying away from the Stephen Curry comparison, he leaned into it, and he's aware enough to be trying to model his game after both Curry and Nash.

Lonzo won't stop these guys, but he'll definitely make their jobs harder. Considering no one aside from Ingram seems to have the speed and want to keep up with guards, we desperately need Lonzo back.

Right? Stephen Curry sounds more like an insurance salesman than a basketball star. If he went by Wardell he'd be a lawyer.

&gt; I watched a sports science with Stephen Curry in which he was measured to be able to get a shot off in 0.27 seconds  I am going to need  a source because nothing returned for that in google the only thing I could find was that he gets his shot off in under .4 but that wasn't the quickest catch and shoot either.   
"Nah, that's Stephen Curry"
"It's been said before but the cooler your name the greater the chances of you succeeding in this league.  Which of the current star players doesn't have cool name?  Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, etc. etc.  Even Paul ""two first names"" George has a name that just rolls off the tongue and makes a cool abbreviation."
And Stephen curry.
"Not a stupid question at all man; my opinion isn't consensus at all and isn't backed up by empirical evidence, only my limited knowledge of biology.  So, as we all know, some of your athleticism is determined by genetics. One component of this is s trait called muscle tone, which contrary to popular usage has nothing to do with how a muscle looks. It has to do with static muscle contractions.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone  **Generally,** explosive athletes with large muscle mass (like Zion, Shaq, Dwight, Lebron, Russel Westbrook, Charles Barkley, Giannis, etc) have *much* higher muscle tone than those who are less explosive and have less muscle mass (Steve Nash, Kyle Korver, Stephen Curry, Steve Novak, Nikola Jokic, etc.) I hypothesize that there is a negative correlation between shooting ability and muscle tone. Think about it- high muscle tone is literally *random muscle fibers twitching without cognitive input.* Having more of that sounds like it would throw off your shot, and given the precision required, could have a dramatic effect.  There are exceptions to the muscle mass+explosiveness Versus muscle tone correlation, however. Some possible examples being Lebron and Michael Jordan. But exceptions are exceptions and I wouldn't put faith in Zion being one of them.  Looking at guys in the NBA, the huge, jacked athletes tend to be worse shooters than skinnier, less explosive guys. A lot of people say that's because these less explosive guys have to have more skill and the more explosive guys can get by on their athleticism, but I think there's more to it.   Here's another piece of anecdotal evidence- accuracey of a thrown object tends to go *Up* with the force required to move that object. Making a free throw is much easier than making a shot in beer pong. I think that's because you have to consicousley fire more muscle fibers, which lessens the impact of the ""random"" muscle twitches due to muscle tone.   I'm a wanna-be biologist lol. "

Stephen Curry and Greg Oden are the same age 
Stephen Curry is older than both and older than Derrick Rose.
"I'm digging my heels because Buddy Heild isn't and wont ever be Stephen Curry. I know this is a thread celebrating Buddy, and hes a great player, but saying that any good guard that can shoot is like Curry is stupid. Buddy cant doesnt have passing vision like curry does and cant create off the dribble like Curry can. It's a ""stupid af"" comparison, and that's really not me being stubborn."
"Christ, he isn't an ""elite"" finisher.  He catches lobs.  He has a great catch radius.  Let's give him credit for that.  But as your chart shows, he doesn't take difficult shots near the rim.  Hell, he doesn't take difficult shots at all.  Elite finishers are people like Kyrie and Curry, who can score in a variety of ways near the rim while taking extremely contested shots.   The coaches vote the reserves.  The coaches know how valuable specific skills are.  The coaches know how much game-planning and preparation go into stopping specific players.  The coaches have continually agreed that Klay Thompson is more valuable than Rudy Gobert.    Just ignore their names for a minute and think about player archetypes.  It's really hard for a 7-footer who can't create any offense, can't shoot outside the paint, and is a lob finisher (and a terrific defender) to be as valuable as an elite outside shooter who can capable guard 1-4.    This is not saying that Clint Capela, Stephen Adams, Rudy Gobert aren't really good.  It's just saying that it's really hard in 2019 NBA for that player archetype to ever be as valuable as an elite wing.    Calling Rudy Gobert ""maybe a top 10 player"" is just not in line with what the results of the NBA playoffs have been the last 5 years, and the NBA coaches who vote the reserves agree."
"You literally just described how college basketball already is anyhow. Cinderella stories generally come about form overlooked prospects (Stephen Curry), an elite coach (Brad Stevens), a Junior/Senior heavy team, or just the randomness of the tournament. This won’t go away.  We’ve already seen Duke and Kentucky seasons go into a season with all the top recruits. "

Steph is a 3rd. His name is Wardell Stephen Curry III. Same as Westbrook. Russell’s name is Russell Westbrook III. 
"Steph is a Jr (or II in his case), he's named after his dad, Wardell Stephen Curry I."
&gt;except Stephen Curry only played in two of those games.  
"* 2014-2015: Game 6 of the WCF, an elimination game. He broke the record for number of turnovers in the playoffs with a staggering 12 turnovers. I don't blame him for losing, I blame him for how he lost and in this case he was detrimental to his teams success.  2015-2016: He was eliminated in 5 games in the first round by the 73-9 Warriors. On the surface this doesn't seem that bad given that they're an all time team except Stephen Curry only played in two of those games. He was injured midway in game one and the Rockets still weren't able to win. Now credit to Harden I remember him hitting a gamewinner during that series so I'm not gonna go too hard on him for this one but I still expected a little more from considering that he was eliminated by a team that didn't even have their best player. The next best player on the floor was *Draymond Green*. Forgive me for thinking that Harden should be able to beat a team with Draymond Green as it's best player. If any other MVP calibre player (KD, LeBron ectr.) lost to a playoff team that didn't even have their best player for most of the series they would be publicly ridiculed.  2016-2017: Scored only 10 points along with 6 TO's in an elimination game against a crippled Spurs team who had lost both Kawhi and Tony Parker due to injury. I don't think it's too much to ask of him to at least tie the series when the opponent's best offensive and defensive player is out.  2017-18: He started off the WCF with a terrific 41 point performance where he looked like the best player in the series by far...and then proceeded to shoot 39% from the field and 20% from three for the rest of the series. He averaged almost 5 TO's a game along with shooting 24% from three in all seven games.There was no way he was going to win that series the moment CP3 went down that much was a given but he really didn't make it easy on the team with his poor play.  And this isn't taking into account just how much of a liability Harden was in the Finals when he got there in 2012.  The truth is I honestly don't what to expect from James because he'll have moments in the playoffs where he'll remind us why he's a first ballot hall of famer and then he'll follow that up with a performance that makes you doubt whether he could ever be the best player on a championship team."
"Disagree. That team and this team is world's apart in terms of effectiveness and chemistry. Stephen Curry and Klay are pretty much the only players that are the same. Draymond has declined significantly, and the bench mob is now one of the worst in the NBA. Kevin Durant is heavily relied upon on this particular team."
"&gt; Stephen Curry (75/196, 38.3%)  &gt; Kevin Durant (36/90, 40.0%)  &gt; Klay Thompson (35/91, 38.5%)  Man honestly fuck this shit.  I'm glad I was able to rekindle my Nets fandom this season because otherwise I wouldn't find this season entertaining at all, this Warriors team is just too damn good.  Happy for Brook Lopez though."
Is Stephen Curry not with the Warriors right now?

"""Russ shot them out of that game""   *Stephen Curry smiles as he shoots 6-23*"
"David Lee was on the Warriors the year after Stephen Curry was drafted. And for sure, Warriors were bad in Curry's early career. So if somebody knows about David Lee, I don't jump to conclusions that they're a bandwagon. At least just not as quickly. "
"I kind of hate how people want to have exact rankings of how good players are, especially when they play different positions.   For me I rank in terms of overall impact on winning NBA games. The highest impact guys are dudes like LeBron, KD, Steph, Harden.   Then you've got the guys right below that but still incredibly elite, Giannis, AD, Kawhi and this season probably Paul George.  Next level would be Embiid, Jokic, Kyrie, Lillard, and maybe BG the way he's been playing this season.  Next level would be Simmons (although I think w/time he'll move up this list), KAT, Klay, Gobert, Draymond, Kemba, maybe Jrue Holiday, Beal, Westbrook (in previous seasons I'd have him higher but his shooting this season...) and maybe Luka.   Etc., etc., but this is how I like to rank players. How much do they impact the game for their team. Because a point guard has got to be judged by different standards than a small forward or a center. A defensive anchor like Gobert has to be judged differently than an offensive wizard like Stephen Curry.   But could you make a case for KD being the best in the game right? I think you definitely could. "

"Only 1 team you cited actually beat the Warriors and that was before Durant. I don't see how you can say there even is a way to beat these Warriors in a 7 game series given the talent differential.   https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2018/05/14/golden-state-warriors-magic-number-stephen-curry-draymond-green/606040002/  The Warriors aim to have 300 passes per game. Maybe passing so much doesn't work for other teams because they don't have as much talent but given no one has beaten the Warriors in the Durant years, it's dumb to say ""ISOball is best"" when that's all that has even been tried against them in the playoffs by any teams with *somewhat* close talent."

That’s the key to stopping him: playing defense. I’m certain no coach or player has thought of that one before./s  &gt;	You can’t play defense on the perimeter anymore, not against 3 point shooters with a handle.  Again, you do realize that applies to the dudes you’re talking about too, right? James Harden would be a middling all-star at best if he wasn’t flopping after every ticky tack foul.  &gt;	 The modern rules allow a player like Steph to play.  I’m just gonna assume your a troll and end this shit here. The best shooter IN THE HISTORY OF THE FUCKING SPORT  is only an elite player cuz of the rules?

"If​ you watched the​ All-Star Game on Sunday,​ you​ saw it. Couldn’t miss it.​ And​ since these things start happening​ years​ out,​​ through careful planning, it’s safe to start thinking about this now. Because you know the Warriors are thinking about this now.  Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2021.  Let’s pause right here to let the enjoy-this-Warriors-season crowd let out their yells. To be honest, I’m with them on that. There is a point where looking ahead becomes too much. There can and should be more focus on the games.  But this is the All-Star break. So we have a window of freedom here. Most importantly, we can’t ignore what we just witnessed on television:  The chemistry between Stephen Curry and Giannis.  Critical Point No. 1: This only matters if Kevin Durant decides to leave at the end of the season. Or stays on another short-term deal. If he signs long term, the Warriors will ride out their four All-Stars for many more seasons.  But the Warriors got Durant because they had scenarios mapped out years in advance. They got themselves in position to make a play. You can bet front-office utility man David Kelly, the Warriors’ general counsel and salary-cap guru, has mapped out all possible roads from whatever decision Durant makes.  A year ago, my colleague and boss, Tim Kawakami, wrote that Anthony Davis was the next apple of the Warriors’ eye. But things change and Davis’ timetable probably doesn’t match the Warriors’ next chance at a big move. It’s gotta be Giannis now. After Durant wears the crown this summer, Giannis will be the league’s next huge free-agent target, with his current Milwaukee deal set to expire in July 2021.  Curry, Giannis and Klay Thompson: that’s a viable reset if Durant leaves. It’s possible. It would first require Giannis wanting to play with the Warriors.  Tell me you didn’t get a sense he’d want this from the All-Star festivities.  That ridiculous alley-oop between them created an All-Star moment for the ages. It was the highlight of the whole event: Curry with a bounce-lob to Giannis.  Also, Curry was Giannis’ first choice in the All-Star draft. Not James Harden or Kyrie Irving, not Paul George or Kawhi Leonard. That said something. Just like LeBron James has said something the last two All-Star drafts by picking Durant first. These selections are morsels of insight into these stars’ thinking and brotherhood.  Can’t you see the sparks in Giannis’ eyes watching Curry’s game-closing dunk on Sunday?  I kid. But there is no questioning that Curry and Giannis fit together, on the court and off. Throw in Thompson and those two shooters spreading the floor to give him open driving space would be a dream for Giannis.  How could this happen? Nothing’s for free, especially for the Warriors. It’d cost Draymond Green.  Curry is due to make $45.8 million in 2021-22. When he hits free agency in July 2021, Giannis would be set to sign a max deal that starts at $42.6 million. That puts their combined number over $88 million. The current salary-cap projection for 2021-22 is $123.9 million.  So those two would eat up more than 70 percent of the cap by themselves. If, as expected, he signs a max extension with the Warriors this coming July, Thompson would be on board for $37.9 million for 2021-22, which would put the Warriors very near the projected cap number with three players.  Which means that if the Warriors are aiming for another superstar, there would be no room for Green. That’s where it gets difficult, emotionally and financially.  Green is set to be a free agent in the summer of 2020 — a year before Giannis becomes a free agent. So if the Warriors re-sign Green, it could doom their chances for Giannis the next July. Or the Warriors would have to know they could trade Draymond in 2021 to clear space, just like they did with Andrew Bogut in 2016 when they needed to clear space for Durant.  If you start hearing that the Warriors are offering Green a big two-year extension this summer, you know they are setting up for the 2021 free agency. If they sign Green to a three-year extension this offseason, he’d have two years on his contract when the Warriors would theoretically need to get rid of his salary for the Giannis chase in 2021. Is that movable? But if, at that point, Draymond only had one year left — the same amount of time Bogut had when they shipped him to Dallas in July 2016 — Green would be much easier to deal.  So yes, it’s complicated. But it’s the same way the Durant plans were complicated for the Warriors years before July 2016.  There is also a drastic measure that could be taken to set up a 2021 attempt at Giannis. I don’t think the Warriors would do it. But it’s so risky.  The Warriors could choose not to extend Green’s deal, which, again, expires in the summer of 2020, and clear him completely from the cap a year before Antetokounmpo’s free agency.  How could you not keep Green? Especially if Durant has already left, don’t the Warriors have to keep Green? You definitely can’t lose him for the mere chance of landing another star in the future. That would set the Warriors up for a down year before the summer of 2021. To lose Durant for nothing already would hurt them enough. To also lose Green for nothing would be crippling.  But if the Warriors believe they have a real shot at Giannis in 2021, who knows what they might do and risks they might take to increase those odds?  Critical Point No. 2: None of this matters if Milwaukee jumps into championship contention or wins one before July 2021, which would greatly reduce the possibility of Giannis wanting to leave.  As we’ve seen with Anthony Davis in New Orleans, it is tough for small-market teams to compete against the magnetism of big-market champions. But the Bucks currently have the best record in the league and could make it to the NBA Finals if everything breaks right for them. If.  The more likely result, though, is that the Bucks bow out early because they don’t have enough top-end talent. Milwaukee has some good players and obviously one great one. But the Bucks look right now like they need another star to pair with Giannis if they want to take down Philadelphia, Boston and Toronto.  So if the Bucks lose in the early rounds for a few more years after losing in the first round last year, the pressure will turn up on the front office. If they don’t reach the Finals in 2020 and Giannis doesn’t have a co-star with him, the noise about Giannis’ impending departure will be deafening (the same way Davis asked for a trade this season, more than a year before his contract is set to expire). The Bucks might even consider trading Giannis instead of losing him if they haven’t been able to build a title contender around him.  If the Bucks can capitalize on this window of opportunity, their chances of keeping Giannis beyond 2021 improve significantly. Giannis showed that he prefers to take down the current stars when he declined to work out with LeBron James and others last summer. From what we know of Giannis, he’d want the challenge of raising Milwaukee to championship status.  But that doesn’t last forever, especially in smaller markets. (See: Durant, Davis and, long ago, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who leveraged his way out of Milwaukee and landed with the Lakers.) And the chance to be with elite players on an elite team, where the Finals is the goal, will be enticing.  When that time comes, the Warriors, you can bet, will be ready. If they lose Durant.  Wait, is there a scenario where they can have Curry, Durant and Giannis? Hmmmmm.  "

Ok Stephen curry flair 
"Against Portland he didn’t look like himself until the OT when he made a bunch of deep threes. And after he came back his paint % significantly dropped. He didn’t have the mobility to attack , so all he did was chuck threes the rest of the playoffs. He never looked like how he did in the regular season, he lost a significant amount of burst. He happens to be an amazing shooter so there are times where it doesn’t matter, but he couldn’t attack.  He went from shooting 61% in the paint down to 45%. He had 26 shots blocked Vs 31 all regular season. All numbers via Synergy. You could also just use the eye test, he looked slow going around Love and the very next season made a point to blow by him on every switch. Combine this with the Cavs anyone but Steph strategy and you he a recipe for a bad time.   MCL injuries across sports are really bad and can change the way you play. For example, there was a season where Russell Wilson didn’t hit 50 yards rushing until week 8 because of his MCL injury. But he still could play. But he obviously wasn’t the same guy we know him to be.   He opted not to have surgery but that also meant he couldn’t play in the summer games. This past offseason he said was his best in a while because didn’t have to recover from anything. If he was healthy why wouldn’t he have played with Draymond Klay and KD for the first time on the Olympic team? He had to sit to heal.   Some links for you regarding his injury from the Ws perspective:   https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-steve-kerr-finals-injury-lucky-cavaliers-lebron-james-081016  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-stephen-curry-on-the-finals-i-wasnt-100-percent-but-who-cares/  Complex.com/sports/2016/08/Steve-Kerr-admits-warriors-changed-playoff-gameplan-Steph-curry-injuries   Nytimes.com/2016/06/07/sports/basketball/Stephen-curry-rio-Olympics-United-states-injury.html  Good for them for not trying to pin the blame on the injury but they do acknowledge how it altered things for them. This wasn’t the 73 win team with Steph leading the charge by the end. They had to make uncomfortable adjustments because his physical ability wasn’t there.   As for the Cavs coach I’ll look for it for you if you want to see it . It’ll take time to find because it was quoted anonymously from a Cavs exec a few years back now. But if you care that much about seeing it I’ll try and find it, I’m really not trying to BS you I just don’t like revisionist history regarding this injury. During broadcast they talked about it a lot and there’s so many instances where it was clear even in other series. If you want to try and find it yourself the quote talks about how they noticed the Ws offense wasn’t being ran the same to try and mask his ailment and they looked for that in film. "

"There have been 20 total 50+ point games this season, 2 of which were back-to-back by Booker.  Back-to-Back 50+ point performances have only been done by 9 other players in the history of the NBA.

There are too many players with 40+ ppg games for me to review stats to see who all has had back-to-backs this year.  * Sauce on Top Scorers this Season: http://www.espn.com/nba/gameleaders/_/sort/points  * Sauce on James Harden Stats: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01/gamelog/2019/"
"Wardell Stephen Curry II, LBJ, Jokic, Dame, Conley, there’s a lot of good dudes in the NBA. "
Isn't Giannis pretty friendly with Stephen Curry?  Curry to the Bucks or Giannis to Golden State confirmed?  
"&gt; Both Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson has set career bests in 3 pointers attempted this season, Curry at 20 (made 10) and Thompson at 24 (made 14), Klay now holds the league record for most 3 point attempts.   for some reason i though this was James Harden record."
Stephen Curry no doubt will be a Warrior forever. He deserves a bonus.
"Tim Duncan, Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler, Lebron James, Joel Embiid, and a bunch more.  NBA is filled with tons of good role models right now. "

"Full article  HOUSTON—There is a number guiding the basketball philosophy of the Houston Rockets. This number that informs every decision by the NBA’s wonkiest team and explains the marvelous season of James Harden is a very specific one: 1.16. That’s the number of points per possession they have to score to be the best offense in the history of basketball.  It’s such a powerful number that Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni, who has long been known for strategies that pushed the boundaries of his sport, realized he wasn’t pushing the boundaries enough as soon as he came here and immersed himself in Houston’s analytics.  “I never had this data,” D’Antoni said in reference to points per possession. “Like, wait a minute. This (play) gives us 0.8, this gives us 0.9, this gives us 1.2. Why don’t we do the 1.2 every time? Why do we do the 0.8s and 0.9s?”  Mike D’Antoni turned himself into basketball’s Marie Kondo. He decluttered the Rockets. But unlike the Japanese tidying guru, D’Antoni wasn’t trying to spark joy. His benchmark was more objective: 1.16 points per possession. “Anything above that, we try to keep,” he said. “Anything below that, we have to figure out why and get it out.”  The obsession with 1.16 is the driving force behind the most peculiar strategy in basketball. It’s the reason the Rockets have taken the NBA’s pursuit of peak efficiency to an extreme.  “We cut out all the things that don’t work,” D’Antoni said. “Let’s go to the things that work and run it every time until they stop it. If they start stopping it, then we’ll figure something else out. But it’s never been stopped.”  That’s because more often than not, and far more often than anybody in the league, the unstoppable player is James Harden. James Harden is averaging more than 36 points this season. That is not a typo. James Harden is averaging more than 36 points this season. That is not a typo. Photo: Harry How/Getty Images  The league’s reigning most valuable player is putting the finishing touches on a season that’s statistically incomprehensible. He’s averaging 36.4 points per game, the most since Michael Jordan, and yet even that doesn’t capture the full extent of his nightly absurdity. He’s had two 60-point games and two sets of consecutive 50-point games. He’s shooting more threes than Stephen Curry and scoring more points per minute than anyone since Wilt Chamberlain. NBA players with the most iso possessionsSource: NBA 1,164310293266261247241HardenWestbrookDeRozanDurantAntetokounmpoPaulJames  But the unrestrained abnormality of his game fully reveals itself when Harden isolates his defender in a one-on-one matchup. It seems logical that what goes up in volume must come down in efficiency. His volume has increased for the last six years. His efficiency has remained almost exactly the same.  His stats look fake. There is no one who isolates more than Harden, and there is no one who scores more per isolation than Harden. He finished last season with a league-high 719 isolation possessions. He’s outdone even himself with 1,164 isolation possessions this year. To put that in proper context, there is no one else who has more than 300, and Harden alone has 53% more isolations than any team. It’s like he’s playing an entirely different game. The Isolation Effect  James Harden has more isolation possessions than any NBA player (left) or NBA team (right). Source: Synergy Sports Technology  Rockets coaches and executives say he’s the greatest one-on-one player of all time. He also may be a back-to-back MVP—he’ll almost certainly be No. 1 or No. 2 in voting for the fourth season in five years—at a time when isolation specialists should be the T-rexes of the NBA. His style of play is deeply inefficient. The average iso this season is worth 0.88 points per possession. That suggests it’s a bad idea. Except it’s not for James Harden.  He turns one of the sport’s worst plays into one of the very best. After scoring 1.22 points per isolation possession last year, it would have been basketball malpractice for Harden to do anything else. And so he didn’t. Harden is No. 1 in volume and efficiency again this season.  Harden was scoring exactly 1.16 points per iso possession as recently as January. He’s since inched down to 1.09 points, and his coach insists it has to be higher as the playoffs approach. D’Antoni is hilariously serious about this. He refused to entertain the premise of a hypothetical universe in which it goes the other way.  “It’s not gonna happen,” he said. “And if it does? You’ll see me in some other city.” Houston coach Mike D’Antoni’s benchmark: 1.16 points per possession. Houston coach Mike D’Antoni’s benchmark: 1.16 points per possession. Photo: Streeter Lecka/Getty Images  One of the few people in the Rockets’ orbit who doesn’t concern himself with such granular data is the person whose excellence can only be understood through them.  James Harden has his own theory of basketball. It’s that every action has an unequal, opposite reaction.  “If teams want to switch and put me on an island, I’m gonna keep taking advantage of it,” he said in an interview after a recent game. “If they want to double-team like they’ve been doing, I’ll dump the basketball.”  “Whatever they do,” he added, “I counteract.”  Like every successful NBA team, the Rockets are built around the unique strengths of their star player, and they get out of the way when Harden goes to work. They give Harden almost the entire halfcourt to dribble, dribble and keep dribbling once he handpicks his defender and figures out what to do with all that space. The Houston Rockets clear out and give James Harden all the space he needs to isolate his defender. The Houston Rockets clear out and give James Harden all the space he needs to isolate his defender. Photo: Photo Illustration: WSJ; Image: NBA.com  There is no good way to stop him once he does. He’s effective in the three most efficient ways of scoring. He gets 1.17 points per shot around the basket. He shoots 88% at the free-throw line and leads the NBA in foul shots for the fifth year in a row. He’s launching so many 3-pointers—Harden is going to break Curry’s record for attempts per game by close to 20%—that even Houston’s radical general manager Daryl Morey is content.  “He might be approaching some sort of limit,” Morey said. “I think this is the first time I’ve ever said that.”  He’s able to do this because he invented a new kind of shot. Curry shoots off the dribble. Harden shoots as he’s stepping away from the basket. He took the most stepback 3-pointers last year. He’s already taken 182% more this year.  But there are some limits to Harden’s game. His heavy workload puts him at greater risk of wearing down. He is not known for his defensive expertise. And his brutally efficient style isn’t for everyone. There are times when rooting for Harden feels like marveling at the subway.  D’Antoni is aware of this criticism. He would rather listen to a clanking radiator.  “Everybody runs to their strengths,” he said. “This is our strength.”  It’s their strength because of Harden. He saved their season when Chris Paul and Clint Capela were injured, and they climbed back into contender status by empowering him to be even more iconoclastic than he already was. That meant more isos.  The beauty of his isos is that they’re a means to the end that everybody can see coming. Harden goes one-on-one to get a layup, get fouled or get off the game’s most improbable shot. A possession that ends with four Rockets watching Harden take a stepback 3-pointer is perfectly acceptable.  It’s worth precisely 1.16 points. It’s the best offense ever. "

Damian Lillard isn't a slouch, he's ranked 7th at 115.5.

STEPHEN CURRY WITH A 40 INCH VERTICLE
This just shows that Stephen Curry is by FAR the most valuable player on the team. You could argue Durant is the better player but he doesn’t add the same value that Curry does. Kinda scary to think about if Steph went down in the playoffs what the result would be... I see them losing to the Rockets and the Eastern Conference Champions without Steph.
"I have a lot of hope in this rookie named Stephen Curry or whatever, he looks like he can shoot"
"So here’s a reworked suggested best possible working cohesive team of all time. If you’ve got a team that could beat them feel free to add your reasoning.  PG: 01/02 Jason Kidd - ideal game: 10+ pts, 10+ ast, 5+ rebs SG: 15/16 Stephen Curry - ideal game: 20+ pts, 5+ ast, 3+ 3pt SF: 89/90 Michael Jordan - ideal game: 20+ pts. 5+ast, 5+ rebs PF: 84/85 Larry Bird - ideal game: 15+ pts, 10+ rebs, 5+ ast C: 61/62 Wilt Chamberlain - ideal game: 25+ pts, 15+ rebs, 3+ blk  For PG - Jason Kidd, over Magic or Big O because of more emphasis on assisting (even though Magic was the best passer) and three-pointers, over Nash because of his top tier perimeter defense, and over Stockton because of his rebounding prowess. He can let you build the team around someone else perfectly.  For SG - Steph Curry, over Jordan at this position because as a combo guard, he is still there to provide those additional crucial assists and support MJ while still being free to efficiently down his countless threes whenever he is open. Over Jerry West because his true 3pt prowess will never be known, and over Kobe simply because of efficiency. Current Harden is a TBD atm, but could be at least a very worthy contender soon.  For SF - Michael Jordan, as an SF, akin to his later career, feels better building the team around the SF but still with the GOAT winger/player with Curry as his support. Top tier defender, goes without saying. GOAT SG/SF over any generational legends.  For PF - Larry Bird - can rebound, assist, score, contribute, whatever you want from him. Shouldn’t have any problems taking a lesser scoring role as a supporting PF for spacing. Over any natural PFs who weren’t really as good as Bird and a notch over LeBron because of his overall selflessness to the team even though late LeBron is perhaps as equally good at that.  For C - Wilt Chamberlain - but with Kareem in the closest second place of this entire team. Don’t know which would work out better in real life, personally like Kareem way more, but Wilt’s stats in every category are just impossible to overlook. Either way those two can’t be topped at C, not by even Moses (who could be a great PF though) or Russell.  Bench: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, John Stockton, LeBron James, Moses Malone, Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant, Oscar Robertson.  One last thing, the GOAT players at their position though: Magic, MJ, Bron, Duncan, Wilt. There we go, that one was easy to make, but using this lineup above is the most basic bitch thing to do and almost certainly wouldn’t work the best.  Feel free to completely shatter any of my theories if you’ve got points to disagree with. "
nephews really downvoting pure statistics!  who in their right fucking mind would rather let career 33% 3pt shooter jeremy lamb shoot at the 3pt line than past half court? past half court it's pure luck unless your name is stephen wardell curry
Stop overrating curry please. he hasnt been the best player on his own team in 3 years. KD literally walked in and stephen handed him the keys like a submissive lil girl.
Literally no one is saying that.... the warriors system’s main pillar is the floor spacing created by Stephen Curry. Everything they do relies on the fact that in every opponents head they’re all thinking about how to cover curry. He runs everywhere off the ball and everyone needs to pay attention to him or he slips away. That combined with his top 3 handles in the league and his ability to shoot anywhere in the half court in no time flat makes him the MAIN reason they’re successful. No one is saying Durant or Klay are bums. Some people are suggesting green is sorta not great but that’s up for debate. We all know the team is good even without Steph so just relax and stop commenting.

I’m honestly not sure if we’ll ever see another Stephen Curry again. The dude is way better than even normal “good” three point shooters.
Black Stephen Curry
"I don't think you have to translate the proper name when you translate the sentence, right? I would think a Mexican TV scoreboard would still show their name as the Golden State Warriors and not Los Warriors del Estado Oro (though that'd be pretty dope if they did) just like they wouldn't automatically start calling Stephen Curry ""Esteban Curry"" (though that would also be pretty dope)."

"The thing is though, you can pretend KD does not exist and the argument that you have to do it yourself is still incredibly silly when applied to Giannis. Giannis has not won much of anything yet. This isn't necessarily about KD, it's about how dumb this particular argument for Giannis is. We can talk about what he would or would not do on another team, or in whatever scenarios, but the reality is he has not won yet. If you want this to be your standard, I think that's dumb, but you have to at least pick a player who has won already. This is your argument? Okay, then your best player is Stephen Curry. "
"Just wanted to add a little more!   First off, upon rechecking, I wasn't quite right. After the injury, he had to retool how he moved on the court, improving his strength and changing his training so that he would use power from his core and legs to make cuts and stops and starts, instead of just using his ankles (which was causing all the injuries.) It was a big change that led to A better Curry, yes, but it wasn't his shot that was retooled.   [Pablo Torre wrote an amazing article for ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14750602/how-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-got-best-worst-ankles-sports) about Curry's ankle saga and how it led to becoming Skyfucker. (They obviously didn't use that term, lol) My favorite quote from the article is this one:   &gt; It was unthinkable that the Warriors might one day offer the theory currently being advanced inside this back room: *A Steph Curry who has never injured his ankles would be less preferable than the Steph Curry we actually have today.*  It's crazy to think the all-time great he is if he didn't have shitty ankles. So weird, but true. "
"Sure thing.     James Harden is not better at basketball than Wardell Stephen Curry II.   However, Harden is better than Steph at lots of other things. Like facial hair and wearing a prime number on his jersey etc.    "
Til you read “Kevin Durant klay Thompson and Demarcus cousins will start in place of Stephen curry absence”
Stephen Curry Stephen Curry Stephen Curry and the Warriors
Stephen curry with no 2s
"Stephen ""3rd quarter"" curry going at it again"
Curry in shambles though.   Not sure how warriors bad things will get if someone told Stephen that [KD also participating in charity for children and then made an impossible to miss dunk as the opening event.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dERxjfZjlIU)
"You’re just a blind hater.  Stephen Curry, the goat 3PT shooter, should not be used as the bar for impressive 3PT shooting. Of course everyone pales in comparison.  And you’ve got to be kidding me. Steph Curry with an all-star starting 5 draws more attention than Harden? Do you even watch basketball, or do you literally just look at 3P% and make your conclusions from that?"
"Giannis, Kawhi, Simmons, Embiid, Butler, Harris, Oladipo, Kyrie, Horford, Hayward, Blake Griffin, D'Angelo Russell, Dwyane Wade, Kemba Walker, John Wall, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Stephen Curry, Demarcus Cousins, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, Paul Millsap, James Harden, Chris Paul, Clint Capela, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Lou Williams, Danillo Gallinari, Demar Derozan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Karl Anthony-Towns, Derrick Rose, Lebron James, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Marc Gasol, Dirk Nowitzki, Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, Dearon Fox.  This is pretty much the NBA's start base right now. Only ones I can think of are:  * Blake Griffin - Sexually assaulting that trainer, and then punching someone as well I believe. * Chris Paul grabbing guys nuts. * Draymond Green kicking guys nuts.  * Derrick Rose possibly raping someone. "
"He's just a piss poor analyst and strategist.  He was mostly before my time, as I'm 30, but I love watching his old games.  He had a joy in playing I only see in Stephen Curry these days, and such a beautiful game.  His personal charisma and 1000 watt smile have gotten him jobs in coaching, managing and commentating that he is truly awful for.  I'd love to hear him with EJ talking about old times though."
I hate how people act like it's outrageous to say he is better than Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry has entered the chat. 
"""Hoping Minny drafts not one, but two inferior guards so that we can pick Stephen Curry because we've sucked for fucking eons"" "
"Statistically, he was similar in his first two years to the other current great guards were in their first two years, often times he's better.

&gt;  Is it ahead of Kobe’s in which he scored 81 in one game?   probably  &gt;Is it ahead of Curry’s unanimous MVP season?  no. Curry put up insane numbers while sitting out entire 4th quarters in many games. the level of production was insane. 67% TS% at that volume is bonkers.

Stephen Curry.  I'm so glad I get to watch this man play for my team.     
"It could still make a difference when comparing the productivity of Stephen Curry, who has played 2029 minutes, vs. Paul George, who has played 2455 minutes.  That doesn't necessarily mean Curry is better than George or vice versa.  On the one hand, it's great that George has been so healthy.  On the other hand, it's great that Curry has been so preductive despite playing 400 fewer minutes.  It's relevant information.  &amp;#x200B;"
yea man you just need brook Lopez to get an ez layup. Imagine Lopez on warriors dude Stephen Curry gonna start to Dunk on everything haha 
Just realized Giannis has a better TS% than Stephen Curry? That's crazy for someone who literally shoots and bricks 3s as a practice in game. 
Just Stephen Curry things.
"What’s to fix? Stephen Curry averaged half of James Harden’s FTA’s while having a way more impressive year, that earned him a unanimous MVP title."
"Yes, he lost MVP despite better stats because of Defensive Maestros Russell Westbrook and Stephen Curry. How dare I not mention defense from those seasons when comparing him to those DPOY candidates. "
Stephen curry on the remix 
Wardell  Stephen Curry II is a good basketball player
The fuck. Allen Iverson isnt better than Stephen Curry
Mike Conley Stephen Curry Danny Green Joe Ingles Javale McGee  6th Man: Ersan Ilyasova  31 CLUB!  
"Kevin Love played with 6th overall pick Johnny Flynn, a player picked ahead of some dude named Stephen Curry or something"
"I mean I don't even understand why finals MVP is now a thing. Old people who were there in the  MJ era don't even care. Maybe the fact that Stephen Curry didn't win that award for their first championship contributed to the discussion but really, it's almost as insignificant as the ASG MVP. "
I have as many FMVPs as STEPHEN CURRY. Send me to the HOF asap

I'm sure the Rockets are very aware of that lol.  Stephen Curry ain't no Jae Crowder

"You can never count Stephen Curry on a non-factor. If your game plan is betting on Curry having an off night, you *will* lose"
"Yeah that's true. I didn't like that move either and thought it was a fucking cruel one. But fortunately now both sides are doing okay it seems.  Hate to see Blake got hit by injury again though, hope he comes back fully healthy.   And even though I consider myself a Warriors bandwagoner aka Stephen Curry fanboy, and I  believe Beverly is a fucking dirty player and I hate him as much as anyone, I gotta admit the Clippers are playing at a pretty damn high level and Ballmer's reactions are lovable as you can tell how much passion he has for the team and the game of basketball in general. The Clippers fans are lucky to have him I guess."
"Warriors starters in 2014 were the highest +/- 5 man lineup in the league.   Stephen Curry led the league in +/- in 2014.  The warriors bench was the worst in the league, featuring such stars as Jordan crawford, Tony Douglas, Steve Blake, Hilton Armstrong, and 40 year old Jermaine O'neal.  In the offseason they signed Barbosa and Livingston, got a healthier Bogut so Ezeli could go to the bench, and an in-shape Speights who was their best bench player for 2015  The bench was the difference from 2014 to 2015, the starters were already the best team in the league"

We are talking in the context of top 10 playoff performances of ALL TIME. So yes, it should need to be up there with the more efficient, volume scoring game to be considered in this context."
DAILY PSA: RICKY RUBIO WAS DRAFTED BEFORE STEPHEN CURRY
"Dame is for sure more efficient in clutch moments, as he jas already proven. Several times. On the other side Mr. Stephen Wardell Curry has not. Don’t like to use this term, but Steph has choked on mamy occasions. Still probably the goat shooter. What is more, if you add so many talented players around Dame, he would probably also had much more energy to put into his offense, without spending it on defending the opposite playmaker, as is the case with Golden State, where KT is the primary deffender and Steph does not play a big deffensive role."
"Not saying these are better, but here are some to consider in the past 15 years or so that I think just deserve a shoutout:  &amp;#x200B;  Lebron James vs. Celtics Game 6 2018: 46/11/9 while down 3-2 in series  Lebron James vs. Warriors Game 1 2018: 51/8/8 in JR Smith game  Lebron James vs. Raptors Game 2 2018: 43/8/14 on 19/28 shooting  Lebron James vs. Celtics Game 6 2012: 45/15/5 on 19/26 shooting, down 3-2  Stephen Curry vs. Blazers Game 4 2016: 40/9/8 with 17 points in Overtime  Kevin Durant vs. Cavs Game 3 2018: 43/13/7 on 15/23 shooting  Kawhi vs Memphis Game 2 2017: 37/11/2 on 9/14 shooting with 6 steals (Grizz held to 82 pts)  Derrick Rose vs. Hawks Game 3 2011: 44/5/7 on 16/27 shooting   Dirk Nowitzki vs. Thunder Game 1 2011: 48/6/4 on 12/15 shooting, 24/24 from the line  Dirk Nowitzki vs. Suns Game 5 2006 50/12/3 on 14/26 shooting  Chris Paul vs. Utah Game 5 2018 41/7/10 with 0 turnovers  Kobe Bryant vs. Denver Game 2 2008: 49/4/10 on 16/27 shooting"

"That’s what I’m thinking. They didn’t have too much resistance getting to the finals but that was mainly because it was the Stephen curry show for the first three rounds. For instance, against Houston, Steph put up 30ppg on 50% 3pt shooting"
"I feel that Stephen Curry is closer to Steph Curry, in my opinion"
He’s not averaging it no but he’s also still getting them. Look at how many game where he has [7-10](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/3975/stephen-curry) rebounds. He’s not racking em up but there are enough games there to show he seems to be getting more and more.
"He was fringe top 10 before the season started (8-11 range imo), but is now clearly out of the top 12. Players I have clearly above him (roughly in order of who I would take right now):  &amp;#x200B;  1. James Harden 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Kevin Durant 4. Stephen Curry 5. LeBron James 6. Joel Embiid 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Anthony Davis 9. Damian Lillard 10. Nikola Jokic 11. Kyrie Irving 12. Paul George  &amp;#x200B;  I think there are a few other players that I'd take over Russ next year too like Bradley Beal or Luka Doncic and maybe even Trae Young if his improvement in the second half of the season is permanent."
"&gt; Also, don’t forget John wall was making a conversation for the second best point guard in the nba after Stephen curry in the 16-17 season.  That's because basketball fans and media are a joke, Giannis was clearly already better than him at that point, as were Kyrie and Lowry"
"John wall. He’s just never had that Paul George or Kevin Durant next to him but he’s been taking his team to the playoffs for a while. Also, don’t forget John wall was making a conversation for the second  best point guard in the nba after Stephen curry in the 16-17 season."
Stephen Curry ? He does that a lot

"Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, and Russell Westbrook. I think Kyrie and Westbrook are difficult to build around to championship team."
Damian Lillard  is better than Stephen Curry and it isn’t even close
"Kawhi is not a better player than Stephen Curry. He's a better defender sure but comon do people even fucking watch Curry's game? He's literally changed the game over the last 5 years like no one had ever done before except for Shaq or MJ. It's a first round matchup and people are overreacting like Crazy. I'm literally Canadian and a Kawhi fan and I'm rooting for them to win it all, but Curry deserves more respect. First fucking unanimous MVP man.  You watched that mvp season?! The shots he was making? The drives he was doing? breaking 3pt record by more than 100 3 pointers."
"kawhi ""stephen curry"" leonard"
"Hahahaha wow, stop repeating shit you hear Sthephen A Smith or Skip say hahahaha wow everyone is entitled to an opinion tho!   But for me many players now are more aware of their stats since it can be a financial factor when negotiating their contract.  But even if nba players tried to “stat pad” like you say it would be still rare to see someone average a triple double for a season let alone three.  Steven Adams almost averages a triple double but if you have a teamate that can get good rebounds with your help you do so is called teamwork. Golden State sets up Curry Durant and Klay to shot threes like a system of theirs since they are the best in that. Is not that Curry wants to break all recors is that his coach and organization same as OKC found a Franchise player and try to work it around them so their talent is even more exposed and they can entertain us. Same goes with Harden. He just ballout but Mike sets the team to have a system that helps him be in the position he is because he does it consistently.  And lastly he has been top 3 for four years in a row in assist. Explain that one Stephen A Smith hahahaha 🖕🏻🖕🏻🤣"
"Remember when this sub feigned outrage over Stephen Curry saying he thought the moon landing was fake?  Man, it’s hilarious that was a story everyone felt like taking seriously and playing the “im very concerned” card."

Rudy Gobert  I know all you steph curry stans are probably going crazy right now but think of it this way, if you took curry off the warriors, away from Draymond and klay who cover up his defensive issues, and put him on any of the other teams with those point guards ahead of them, would the new team hes on do better with him than say lillard, no. Would the celtics be doing better with him instead of kyrie, probably not since he isn't as good in the pick in roll. But for sure if you put lillard or kyrie on the warriors you would have a team that may never lose a game because they dont need the jump shot to be on so they can play good.   When I was making this list, I kept thinking, who do I want to have the ball at the end of the game to win it. So that's one of the reasons why klay is number 5 while others think he should be higher. Hes offensively limited as a scorer and creator. He is a defensive jj Reddick with a post game. The dude cant run a pick and roll, he cant go in iso and make a cross over and pull up, he doesn't have a step back, he cant create space for himself, that's why he and steph are running around screens on the sideline.   Let me know what you guys think and dont be ignorant. Thanks"

You genuinely think Kyrie is better than Stephen Curry?
"Stephen ""Draymond Green"" Curry. He hasn't shot well this game, but he was amazing with rebounds and assists. His shot will come, but I love that he still gives full effort."

"Erik Horne said Westbrook emasculated Billy Donovan by not coming out of the game to get the 20/20/20. What a bunch of bullshit.   If Stephen Curry, Harden, Giannis or other guys wanted to stay in the game, no beat reporter for their team would say that they emasculated their coach.  Kobe would often nod off Phil, one of the greatest coaches in **sports**, in order to stay in the game."
"Fuck the nba. That Gobert call earlier was fucking bullshit. This is rigged. Also, this team is trash. WE AREN'T FUCKING STEPHEN CURRY, OR RAY ALLEN. I'M FUCKING SALTY"
"And holy shit, has it been successful for Harden:  &gt;Harden has drained 240 step-back triples in 2018-19. Stephen Curry led the league in total 3s with between 261 and 286 for three straight seasons from 2012-13 through 2014-15. Just making that many 3-pointers was revolutionary four seasons ago."
"You're not making them billions, those TV packages and corporate courtside seats are. The merchandise. Are you ordering custom jerseys of your favorite player or just buy whatever players they put out for your team?

Just making that many 3-pointers was revolutionary four seasons ago. Making that many step-backs was not a thing that existed in the NBA's brainspace.  This is actually pretty crazy. The degree of difficulty on these shots is something I haven't seen anyone in the league replicate outside Steph. Step-back 3s at this rate are just unguardable, and more so than a player like Lebron or Giannis who rely on driving to the basket hard.  Jazz have been thoroughly outplayed and outcoached in this series. Mitchel's off ball defense is getting more exposed in this series as Lowe mentioned. Jazz have to start sprinting on defense to keep up with their scheme.  I personally think they should let Harden drive right into the paint to be met by Gobert and have his defender run to find the open shooter while the weak side help defends Capela. If Harden wants to take the ball back out and go 1v1 with Harden with the shotclock running down I think it'll be better than letting him pick his assists. Sometime a bit of chaos is good to throw off his rhythm."

"I could see the argument for Duncan, but not Kobe, who is massively overrated as a defender.  Curry has a 7+ TS% advantage over both Kobe/Duncan, which is massive.   Defense is hard to judge, as we don't have as much data on Kobe/Duncan outside of some imperfect stats. But using the stats we have available.  Kobe had a -0.6 DBPM, Stephen Curry has a -0.7 DBPM for his career. Now before you say (but Kobe's retired, so it's unfair to compare, his end years dragged him down), it should be stated Kobe has a negative DBPM in 14/20 seasons.  Tim Duncan was +4.0 DBPM, and blows them both away.  In terms of basketball-reference defensive rating, Kobe was 105, Curry 107, and Duncan blows them both away at 96, which is the best of the shot clock era.  In terms of DWS, Kobe's peak is 4.3, Curry's 4.1, and again Duncan is way ahead with 7.2 at peak.  The On-Off +/- play by play numbers are probably the best examples of trying to judge their on court impact.   Kobe is +5.6 for his career and +12.5 at his peak. Curry is +12.1 for his career and +22.2 at his peak. Tim Duncan is +7.5 for his career and +17.8 at his peak.  None of the statistical data supports Kobe being an elite defender, it supports him being an above average defender for his position, similar to Curry. Tim Duncan definitely has an argument in this regard, but Curry's offensive impact is much larger than Duncan's (and Kobe's) as well.  Then there's also the playoff stats.  In the playoffs Kobe has a 0.7 DBPM, Curry a 0.3 DBPM, and Duncan 3.8.  Kobe had a 106 defensive rating, Curry has a 105 defensive rating, and Duncan was 99.  Peak DWS, Kobe was +1.4, Curry +1.2, and Duncan +2.7.  For their On-Off +/-, Kobe was +8.3 for his career, +17.4 for his high, and +14.2 high for a finals run. Curry is +12.7 career, +37.0 1 round high, +25.2 two-round high, and +20.6 finals run high. Duncan was +9.0 career, +38.8 high (2 rounds), and + 23.1 (finals run)."
"Both amazing basketball players.  But Kobe allegedly raped a chick and the worst thing Wardell Stephen Curry II ever did was that childish tantrum when he threw his mouthpiece into the stands after fouling out of a nationally televised NBA finals game in 2016.  So I say Curry is better all time, including off the court."
"&gt;Every single good shooter in NBA history spent 4+ hours a day since high school practicing their shooting.  And yet they're both substantially better than the people who were good in college and didn't make it to the NBA, and at the same time not nearly as good as Stephen Curry. Something tells me Patrick Beverly isn't the best 3pt shooter of all time because he doesn't work hard enough at it. Like, Patrick, you never had any shot whatsoever of being the best 3pt shooter ever. You could've practiced for 8 hours a day every day for 20 years and never come anywhere close."
"They're able to play beautifully because the motor is Stephen Curry. They're able to play such a selfless brand of basketball because of the personnel they have, even before KD. You think most teams wouldn't want a flowing offense like they have? It's just that 90% of the league would be hard-pressed to emulate it because of personnel issues or coaching issues.  On a similar note, the Spurs also play beautiful basketball. It's not quite how it was when they had TP, Manu, TD, but the system is still there. But again, Pop has had to adjust given the roster he has."

"Westbrook, CP3, Damian lillard, jokic, luka doncic(arguably), trae young, draymond green, James harden, lebron, KD, Stephen Curry, D.lo, de’aaron fox, Mike Conley, kyrie, Kemba walker and Kyle Lowry are easily more proven, reliable, trustworthy, mature, and strong willed. You are plain wack if you say Ben Simmons is a better PASSER than all of these guys. And judging by your replies, you’re probably a troll."
Yes Love “locked down” an injured Stephen Curry lol
You're gonna tell me Stephen Curry wasn't the best player on the Warriors in 2015? Gtfoh.
Honestly though look at what Beverely was able to get away with and look at that pivotal fourth foul on Stephen Curry early in the 3rd.   However they want to officiate there has to be consistency on the levels of contact allowed.
"1. Stephen Curry and Jrue Holiday 2. Luka Doncic and Klay Thompson 3. Damian Lillard and Devin Booker 4. D'Aaron Fox and Bradley Beal 5. Kyle Lowry and James Harden (worried Lowry will age poorly, given the five season timeline) 6. Trae Young and Ben Simmons 7. D'Angelo Russell and DeMar DeRozan 8. Jerian Grant and Tony Snell"
Stephen Curry with Knicks Jersey
Lebron has a historically large impact on his teammates’ shooting efficiency compared to everyone not named Stephen Curry.
How is he a top 3 of all time? He’s not even top 10-15 offensive talent.   1. Kobe  2. Kareem  3. Harden  4. Larry Bird  5. Pistol Pete  6. Kevin Durant   7. Michael Jordan  8. Allen Iverson  9. Dr J  10. Wilt  11. Shaq  12. Magic  13. Stephen Curry  Maybe LeBron fits in down here but I find it hard to believe people think he’s a top offensive talent??
"Play too aggressively on D and you’ll be sitting on the bench watching most of the game. Plus, it’s exhausting to try and do what Patrick Beverly does on defense and keep that intensity all the time. If Stephen Curry played defense like Pat Beverly, his offense in the 4Q may not look so fluid and easy because he’d be gassed."
"Who plays out in Oakland with Stephen Curry?  (*K-D Snake-pants!*)  Not Slim Reaper, nor Durantula, instead the Servant, is he?

"I'm sorry, but there is no reason to bash Simmons this way. I can also say, ""Stephen Curry is a greatest player at shooting 3s. And he is average or below average at other things."" All super stars have their to-go move, if Simmons' to-go move is being great at transition, then idk how it can be a negative thing."
"Nor have I. Seems like Chinese whispers of stuff described, for example, in this article:  [http://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/14750602/how-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-got-best-worst-ankles-sports](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14750602/how-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-got-best-worst-ankles-sports)  &amp;#x200B;  He adapted a lot of stuff to protect his ankles, but I don't see stuff about shooting technique. It even says he had no ankle troubles in college, and he was already historical shooter then."
"Roger Federer and Stephen Curry are far better faces of their respective sports. More class, less arrogance."
Okay so do you think Seth Curry who has a career better percentage is better than Stephen ?

"I'm 43 and been watching basketball since Bird/Magic, and I've never seen a player, let alone a superstar, get less respect from the refs than Wardell Stephen Curry. And yes, this call didn't cause the Warriors to choke away that lead, but picture a game where the call isn't made and Curry gets to stay in the game."
"Nah hand-checking gets overrated.   Even in the era of hand-checking, you could still get a shooter open.   Shooters could still come off screens. They could still run to the corners in transition. You could still collapse a defence with a drive before kicking the ball out to an open perimeter option.   Rather than telling me to go back and watch the film, you should take your own advice. You'll see a lot of guys left open on the perimeter.   * [Here's Jordan shooting 6 threes in a finals matchup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03GT8q3BCZY). He wasn't an amazing shooter but you can see how tightly packed the defences are and how wide open perimeter options are.   * [You can also see in Reggie Miller's game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqRDszzz7Rw) that the 3PT shots prior to the hand-checking rule weren't really any more difficult than the shots you see today.   Ray Allen was also getting up 7+ 3PA per game before the hand-checking rule came into effect.  * [You can also look at the likes of Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf (formerly Chris Jackson)](https://youtu.be/e93l5so7f9s), he wasn't as good as Steph Curry, but he was able to come off screens and hit shots in a very similar way.     [Phil Jackson made that same comparison a couple of years ago](https://twitter.com/PhilJackson11/status/703987224858198017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E703987224858198017&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportingnews.com%2Fus%2Fnba%2Fnews%2Fphil-jackson-steph-curry-comparison-mahmoud-abdul-rauf-chris-jackson%2F1aa2vogd98vfm1g6mnnix7g8rv)  * [During Larry Bird's time the NBA was actively avoiding the shot:](https://www.nba.com/article/2017/02/21/history-3-pointer-evolution-nba-game-larry-bird-stephen-curry-james-harden)   *Bird wasn’t a fan at first. He doesn’t recall Bill Fitch, his coach, spending much time in training camp discussing or game-planing for the shot. Which means, the Celtics didn’t open the season with a single play designed for 3-pointers. It sounds insane now, but imagine having a young Bird on the team and never freeing him up by design for the shot.*   *“It was never in our arsenal,” Bird said.*   *And then on Oct. 12, opening night of the ’79-80 season, with the Celtics playing the Houston Rockets, history happened in the first quarter. Chris Ford, a set-shooting journeyman and the only Celtic who bothered to shoot from deep in the preseason, trotted downcourt and happened to stand with his toes beyond the arch.*   *“Well actually,” said Bird, wisecracking, “they were double- or triple-teaming me and he was out there with nothing to do so I passed it to him.”*   ...   *“We never practiced it,” said Grevey. “In camp we never talked about it. Dick never liked it. He said, 'Grevey, that’s a gimmick from the ABA and the coaches weren’t consulted about this. We’re not going to shoot the three point shot. We’re not going to be influenced by this shot, nor are you. Get that ball down low to Elvin Hayes.' ”*   ...   *“First time I touched the ball, in front of our bench, I shot it,” he said. “I looked back at Dick and he shook his head. Well, I was a good shooter, and after about a month we had the ‘Grevey Rule.’ I was allowed to shoot it but nobody else.”*   Those 3-point shots were available, even when hand-checking was legal. Teams just weren't gameplanning around them."
"WS/48 is an almost perfect predictor of MVP. The leader in this stat usually wins MVP. Not surprisingly when they deviate from the player leading this, these are the most controversial.  For this decade for example:  * 2010 - MVP Lebron James WS/48 - Lebron James * 2011 - MVP Derrick Rose WS/48 - Lebron James * 2012 - Lebron James / Lebron James * 2013 -  Lebron James / Lebron James * 2014 - Kevin Durant / Kevin Durant * 2015 - Stephen Curry / Stephen Curry * 2016 - Stephen Curry / Stephen Curry * 2017 - Russell Westbrook / Kevin Durant * 2018 - James Harden / James Harden  * 2019 - ???? / Giannis Antekoumpo  James Harden and company do too much whining. He’s a 1x MVP caliber player and they gave it to him the year he earned it.  In 2017, Durant was the best player. It was his first year with the Warriors and he played elite defense in addition to elite offense. Kawhi Leonard was 2nd, and since there was no way they were giving Durant the mvp that year, he would be more deserving than Harden.   Golden State won 67 games that year and Sam Antonio won 61.   This year he didn’t even finish 2nd, Gobert finished 2nd behind his beastly 68 TS%.  Harden is nice and has been Top 5 for most of the last 5 years outside of that one down year, but their constant whining about not getting MVP’s they don’t deserve is getting old. Want to win the MVP? Have an MVP season with excellent stats and team success."
Totally didn’t think of Stephen Curry when I first saw the title
I think OKC need to seriously consider trading him.  It’s bad enough running the offense through a PG that can’t shoot in this era let alone a PG who can’t shoot but chucks it up like he’s Stephen Curry.
Damian Lillard is better than Stephen Curry and it is not particularly close

Stephen Curry has played 12 minutes with 0 points. Warriors are up 6. What goes on
"I just came here to say fuck Stephen Curry, fuck the Warriors. And let's FUCKING GO PJ ""THE MESSIAH"" TUCKER"

"Folks, have we ever witnessed a bigger fall from grace than Stephen Curry?"
It’s gotta be frustrating to play defense for Stephen Curry. He’s not allowed to play defense with the same intensity and contact that is played against him.
What is the actual number of layups that Stephen Curry has missed in this series?  It feels like it has to be close to double digits
"Reminder that last time the Warriors played the Rockets without Kevin Durant, they eliminated the Rockets from the playoffs with Stephen Curry only playing a total of 38 minutes in the series."

He loved the idea of playing at Madison Square Garden.”"
"1.  It's been pretty well confirmed over the years that Stephen A Smith is paid by ESPN to say stupid things.  They do that a lot- see Cowherd, Colin and Bayless, Skip. 2.

It isn't like they're the Pistons on a night Griffin is injured."
"Lol at you.  The part that's odd for Steph, like why does that mean there has to be some beef between us? He loves LeBron, he respects LeBron, and he's like ... 'Because the outside world is pitting us together, why do you and I have to now have this disdain between us? I thought we were cool.' ""That's the question that's in Curry's mind and Curry's camp: 'Why do you not like me when all I did was basically respect everything you did and kind of follow the model you carried out?' So there's an interesting dynamic there, and it's not just with LeBron. ""Steph wants to be accepted by all these guys. This is what he worked for - for you to say, 'Man, you're one of us.' It seems like they don't want to give that to him. Not yet, anyway.""   SPORTS LeBron James and some of the NBA's biggest stars have reportedly had a 'disdain' toward Stephen Curry that he doesn't understand Scott Davis Jun 3, 2018, 3:27 PM ET lebron steph Ezra Shaw/Getty  Stephen Curry is a respected and popular player in the NBA, but some of the league's other top stars, including LeBron James, have been irritated by his rise, according to a 2017 report. Some NBA stars reportedly felt annoyed by Curry's rise and the fact he seemed immune to criticism from the sports world. Curry was reportedly aware of this feeling and was confused by it, feeling he had proved himself as one of the NBA's best players. Stephen Curry is one of the best, most respected, and most popular players in the NBA, but his quick rise in the league reportedly rubbed some of his peers the wrong way.  In 2017, Marcus Thompson of The Athletic, author of the book ""Golden: The Miraculous Rise of Steph Curry,"" explained to ""The Big Lead with Jason McIntyre"" that Curry was not all that popular with some of the league's biggest stars, including LeBron James.  ""There's this thing there with he and LeBron that's a little weird,"" Thompson said.  According to Thompson, James and Curry were close from Curry's days at Davidson to his early years in the league. Thompson said James was ""like a mentor"" to Curry, but as Curry's game improved, coinciding with the Warriors' rise, he ""challenged LeBron's status."" Since then, the two apparently haven't been as close, and it reportedly bothers Curry.  Thompson said:   ""The part that's odd for Steph, like why does that mean there has to be some beef between us? He loves LeBron, he respects LeBron, and he's like ... 'Because the outside world is pitting us together, why do you and I have to now have this disdain between us? I thought we were cool.' ""That's the question that's in Curry's mind and Curry's camp: 'Why do you not like me when all I did was basically respect everything you did and kind of follow the model you carried out?' So there's an interesting dynamic there, and it's not just with LeBron. ""Steph wants to be accepted by all these guys. This is what he worked for - for you to say, 'Man, you're one of us.' It seems like they don't want to give that to him. Not yet, anyway."" During the 2016 Finals, the second rematch between the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers, things got noticeably heated between James and Curry as James' Cavs came roaring back and eventually won the series.  In Game 6, James swatted one of Curry's shots and trash-talked him afterward. The two had bumped each other a few times and exchanged words. Finally, Curry was called for a foul, lost his cool, chucked his mouthguard, which hit a fan, and was ejected. From there, the ""beef"" seemed real.  It resurfaced on Thursday in Game 1 of the 2018 Finals, when the two exchanged words after James blocked a shot by Curry. James eventually pushed Curry out of the way, rankling Klay Thompson, who exchanged some words with James afterward.  Thompson said the root of this disdain for Curry came from his leapfrogging so many players so quickly in the NBA's elite and receiving adoration for it.  McIntyre brought up an incident in which Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook laughed when they were asked about Curry's defense in 2016. Thompson said it was another example of the chasm between Curry and some of the NBA's stars:  ""I think if you ask them and they were being honest, they don't like all the hype he gets, and they have to direct it that way. I think out of all of them, if somebody doesn't like Steph Curry, I think it's probably Westbrook. He just shows no sign of - this really ain't about Steph. It's bigger. His seems to be, 'I don't like that dude.' ""But LeBron and them, I think they will say: 'Man, I like Steph. We can have a conversation.' But there's something that burns them about the fact that Steph is the one that is exalted, and because of that, they want to go at him and, in fact, kind of demean his hype. They want to take him down."""

Compare [this season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players) alone. On a very similar usage %, Curry has a better VORP, better BPM, and very similar PER. Durant's edge on Curry in advanced stats are pretty much all defensive (blocks and rebounds) which are skills that require more physical play.   Curry's stat line, on the other hand, comes largely from his elite shooting, which is one of the things that older players like Wade or Rose try to develop once their explosiveness is gone.  Healthy KD is probably a better player than Steph, but injured, I don't think it's a contest."
You really saying that Stephen motherfucking Curry can’t take over a playoff game or a game against a tough team? What about when he played against Kobe back in the days? The OKC game-winner? When he put up the (now-broken) NBA record for threes? Is he not liable to explode?
"Stephen ""Joel Embiid"" Curry"
"There wasn't video, but it was reported at the time.        https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2442294-stephen-curry-reportedly-would-have-had-foul-called-if-he-missed-game-tying-shot"
I think it's a reasonable debate. Read [this dude's Quora post.](https://www.quora.com/What-makes-you-think-that-Stephen-Curry-is-better-than-Kobe-Bryant-or-LeBron-James) If /u/Miceland is saying that Curry's legendary record breaking seasons are things Kobe never had...he's right. Kobe doesn't rank near Steph in a lot of offensive statistics. But Curry isn't above him on anyone's all time list yet.
Thoughts on best player in the nba?   Personally:   1) Lebron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Kawhi Leonard  4) James harden 5) Giannis  6) Stephen Curry  7) Joel Embiid 8) Anthony Davies 9) Russell Westbrook  10) nikola Jokic
"The thing is as fans we are so use to him being so efficient that when he really declines its just irregular &amp; awkward. However I'm not worried, I'm not going to make excuses but to me he has earned a pass in my eyes to be historically bad because he has 1)Lived up to his promise, 2) Had one of the craziest NBA peaks, 3) It doesn't pay my bills if he comes up short...what I do know is he is Stephen Curry &amp; he isn't someone I can ever lose my faith in."

Welcome back Stephen Curry
"stephen ""where am i right now"" curry"
Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry or Paul Crewe?
Wtf is wrong with Wardell Stephen Curry the second?
"Stephen ""JJ Watt"" Curry"
Imagine a world where Stephen Curry can have 5 points and his team is still gonna blow out the second best team in the west
"Curry has bad ankle which hinder his movement in change of direction, and make hit shooting form inconsistent. What makes Stephen Curry a great is his basketball skills, and his talent coming together in sync. If he has an ankle injury in the playoffs he will get exposed, and he is no way like Kevin Durant with his height and length."
First take today - Stephen A was arguing that curry was most important player in this series lol
"Stephen ""Lowry"" Curry"
"""Stephen Curry gets the offense going"" - warriors fans  Green reaction:🤣🤣🤣"
"Again, it has to do with how famous Steph is and it making her feel insecure about how attractive she is.  This doesn’t happen to me because I’m not Stephen Curry."
Well i said if I did. I've never been in that scenario where I had a gf with the popularity of stephen curry. But if I did Idk its hard to say but its not out of the realm of possiblity. Maybe for ayesha its just a to reassure herself that shes still pretty and such and for everybody it can be different. Like you said it is bizzare but I'm trying to find the way to understand why she'd feel like that
Their switching defense at its core was built to limit the amount of open 3s for Klay and Steph. The ones they do get off often come contested because Steph can get them off due to his infamously quick release but they are still lower %. Even if Steph's numbers are down its clear Houston's entire gameplan is built around stopping him as their no 1 priority. But if you want to know why Steph's numbers vs Houston even including the reg season the past 2 years arent as high as vs other teams it just comes down to how Houston's defense is built to cut out all the excess easy looks he gets. And yes [nobody gets more open 3s than Steph and Klay despite their gravity](https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-klay-thompson-analysis)

Stephen Curry
"These NBA playoffs have been insanely entertaining for many reasons, as the competition has reached rare levels and teams have played closer than ever. Behind all of this has been a new, wider swath of star power on display. With LeBron James and the Lakers at home, other players have earned our attention and shined in the process. From Kevin Durant to Nikola Jokic, the list of amazing performances is endless. The Crossover decided to narrow in on the players who have dominated most consistently. Below, we debate and name the player we believe to be having the best postseason showing.    **GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO, BUCKS**  There’s a reason the Bucks have the fewest losses of any team this postseason and his name is Giannis Antetokounmpo. Khris Middleton has definitely pulled more than his fair share of the weight, but at the heart of the most dominant team this postseason is the most dominant player in these playoffs. Giannis is averaging nearly three more fastbreak points per game than the next closest player this postseason, and he’s well ahead of the pack in free throw attempts per game as well. Sure, his jumper is nowhere near as pretty as Harden, Durant or Kawhi Leonard, but when you finish at the rim like he does (74.6%) while forcing defenses to foul you more than any other player in the playoffs, it doesn’t matter too much. In the three games since Milwaukee’s lone playoff loss he’s averaged 33.3 points on 60% shooting with 12.7 boards, 5.3 assists, 1.7 steals, 1.7 blocks and 16.7 free throw attempts. He’s also gone 4-for-10 from three, making it harder to just pack the paint and stay connected to his shooters. And we haven’t even discussed his defense. — Khadrice Rollins  **KEVIN DURANT, WARRIORS**  Kevin Durant fielded question after question about Patrick Beverley's defense until he finally reached a breaking point. Confused by the efforts to build a rivalry, he looked around and reminded reporters, ""I'm Kevin Durant."" In the moments since he uttered those words, there has been no question what he is or what he is capable of. In the contest immediately after his famous press conference, Durant dropped 38 points on 14-of-23 shooting and led the Warriors to a Game 3 win. For the final four games of that series, he averaged an absurd 41.5 points on 57% shooting. Those numbers just don't happen over an extended run of games. If that's not dominant, I have no idea what is. The ease with which Durant completed this feat only added to the mystique, as he put his back to the basket for midrange fadeaways and stepped behind the three-point line for deadly shots from deep, barely breaking a sweat the entire time.  Durant has extended that dominance into the Warriors' second-round series with the Rockets, shielding Golden State from a below average Stephen Curry showing and a cold-shooting Klay Thompson. The best player in basketball is competing head to head with James Harden and putting 36.0 points per game and remaining uber-efficient. The Warriors have been the favorites to win everything since the day the season started, and while the team effort hasn't been as seamless as expected, Durant has buoyed his team and kept the dream of a three-peat alive. Along the way he's defied positions and logic, and if the Warriors bypass Houston and win another title it'll be through their two-time Finals MVP. — DeAntae Prince  **NIKOLA JOKIC, NUGGETS**  I maintain that Jokic is the most fascinating player in the league to witness in action right now. Sometimes it’s subtle and sometimes it’s not, but he might be the premier offensive conduit in the league at this point. Whenever I watch the Nuggets, instead of keeping track of where the ball is, I inevitably find my eye just following him around. He’s not doing it in remotely similar fashion as anyone else, but if we’re talking dominance, it’s not a ball-dominant guard or prolific jump shooter, but Jokic who best dictates the run of play at all times. It’s nothing particularly new. — Jeremy Woo  **KAWHI LEONARD, RAPTORS**  Round one of the postseason belonged to Kevin Durant, but the full body of work thus far tilts in Kawhi’s favor. Toronto’s gamble has paid off in full as Leonard goes full Terminator on the Eastern Conference, averaging 32.3 points and 7.7 assists per game this postseason. Leonard’s efficiency numbers are even more impressive. He’s shooting 58.7% from the field and an insane 50% from three, including a 5-7 mark from deep in Game 4. Leonard can get to any spot he wants. He’s a master of the midrange, creating separation without Durant’s extreme height advantage. And don’t think the two-time defensive player of the year has lost an edge on the other end of the floor, either. The Raptors could lose to Philadelphia in the East semis and lose Leonard just over a month later, but his brilliance this postseason makes the move worthwhile nonetheless. — Michael Shapiro"
"Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are great at shooting the basketball. Both have ankle injuries which hinder their movements in getting the correct form in shooting well consistently. Both have to play some defense in switches at some point in the game. Both of them are above average to good NBA athletes, but not great NBA athletes."
Jamal “Stephen Curry” Murray
"If both were given $2000 dollars to buy a car with the goal of putting as many miles on it as possible before it dies, who would make the best purchase? Chris Paul or Stephen Curry?"
"Joel ""Stephen Curry"" Embiid"
"Giannis, Kawhi, Butler, Curry, Durant, Harden, Lillard, and Jokic feel like the stars that really matter in this playoffs. These guys would form the basis of the All NBA Playoff 1st and 2nd Team  If I had to rank them so far, probably:  All Playoff 1st Team:  Damian Lillard, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antekoumpo, Nikola Jokic  All Playoff 2nd Team:  Stephen Curry, James Harden, Jimmy Butler  Unless I'm missing anyone, I feel like no one else feels like they should be honored for their playoff performance right now. (Curry is averaging 23 PPG on 62 TS%, despite his struggle in half the games in the Rockets series)."
"Fun fact: When the Warriors and Blazers advance, Stephen Curry will face younger brother Seth Curry in the Western Conference Finals"
What the fuck was that Kyle? You are not Stephen Curry.
"When directly guarded by Stephen Curry, Rockets players are a combined 16-41 from field. 7 assists total to 10 turnovers. Yawn. Watch the games. Looney is the only one clearly getting abused and KD is the only one who has been able to keep up with Harden in the 4th last night."
"FACT.  The biggest disparity in this series in the level of physicality allowed against not only the warriors, but in particular Stephen Curry."

Add Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson to that list
"There is a set of mechanisms in which the Warriors end up signing Giannis next off season.  All it will take is the Sixers or Raptors cock blocking the Bucks this year, Bucks free agents moving on making their team worse, and Klay and KD leaving in free agency, and Giannis deciding to team up with his boy Stephen Curry."
"I mean, she's literally talked about him having a foot fetish before so yeah, I can see how someone would deduce that.  [https://www.si.com/nba/2017/10/13/ayesha-curry-stephen-curry-foot-fetish](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/10/13/ayesha-curry-stephen-curry-foot-fetish)"
"Late to this thread, but here's my take on this series so far:  &amp;#x200B;  For once, I actually agree with Stephen A Smith and Charles Barkley - the Warriors need to get back to ball movement all the time and run through Steph Curry. The eye test on KD's statistics for the regular season show that the Warriors are far more successful on average when he shoots around 17 FGs/game and the offense flows pretty solidly through Steph Curry to all the players in the game when this is happening. The Warriors coaching staff certainly deserves blame for this - they've fallen prey to the easy choice. KD is a monster in these playoffs. He can hit shots over ever person and single handedly has carried this team after Game 3/4 of the Clippers series when Doc reoriented the defense to double Steph Curry. But the shots KD is taking are far too predictable, and the Rockets are starting to adjust. KD is shooting an average of almost 24 shots per game after Game 3 of the playoffs, peaking at 31 shots in the game 3 loss to the Rockets. These possessions are now littered with turnovers, stagnation if the iso fails, and missed shots. Yes, Steph and Klay aren't shooting well, but they seem to be forcing shots out of rhythm because they're basically getting half the opportunities they used to before within the flow of the offense. In other words, KD's missed iso's are worse misses than misses for Steph and Klay within the flow of the offense. Steph has clearly lost confidence and motivation on several possessions where the coaching staff has him spacing all the way out in the corner, often with a nonshooter on the extended elbow soft doubling him in the corner. Klay has missed some open ones, but he's also forced several bad, contested 3s which are like the first time the ball has touched him in 5 or 6 possessions down the floor.  &amp;#x200B;  KD is an all time great, but the Warriors only win this series playing this way if he drops 40+ every game and that's not going to happen"
Damian Lillard is an all around better version of Stephen Curry
"Well, that's not all that interesting to me. The Warriors' defensive gameplan to avoid the Curry switch on Harden is the exact same thing that they did on LeBron all those years - first pre-switch behind the action, then do the [high tag](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Dh48r_goPrwJ:https://bballbreakdown.com/2017/05/30/the-new-way-stephen-curry-defends-lebron-james/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us) if that failsI've seen all the adjustments and counter-counters already, there's nothing new about all of that off the ball action. I already know the Rockets gameplan is to switch Curry onto Harden, and the Warriors are doing what they can to prevent that, it's just a matter of seeing if it works or not. The Rockets being slightly smaller without Ariza is not that compelling of an interesting wrinkle to me, either. There's really no counter-punches either team has at this point, it's just who executes the gameplan better."
"thanks to bbref and [tableit.net](https://tableit.net) it's super easy!

"Two things U saw the Rockets abusing the living shit out of: Stephen Curry and Kevon Looney on switches. You have to live with what they’re doing to Steph and hope he can improve on defense, but god someone needs to save Looney, he’s too much of a liability.  It’s not his fault because guarding Harden and co. is a ridiculous task, but someone on their bench has to be better than that."

imagine thinking Kemba Walker is on the same level as Stephen Curry lmao
Stephen Curry sounds like a fake name hahaha
&gt; His numbers are all down from the regular season  I wonder what that says for one Wardell Stephen Curry
"Lowry misses his 3. With pure rage and disappointment, he throws a punch out of anger that accidently connects with the jaw of Stephen Curry. On the next play, Curry's head is still spinning. He then proceeds to take a deep contested 3 in the face of Lowry and sinks it."
"Andre Iguodala was playing basketball at least as early as 2001, according to a player profile showing he played for Lanphier High School in the 2001-2002 season: [Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20120608061506/http://www.arizonawildcats.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/iguodala_andre00.html)  Steph Curry was playing organised basketball at least as early as 2002, according to this article about his Canadian grade 8 team: [Source](https://www.thestar.com/sports/basketball/2015/02/26/stephen-currys-grade-8-season-at-tiny-toronto-school-remembered.html)  However, Steph also used to be brought by his dad to shoot on the Hornets courts as a child. Dell Curry played for the Hornets until 1998: [Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20140124024839/http://www.fca.org/themagazine/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors/)  1998 predates 2001, but 2002 does not. No source available.  Therefore Andre Iguodala plays basketball because Steph used to shoot on the Hornets court as a child."
I'm guessing because eventually they'd start shortening it to Dell and then they'd have to distinguish him from his dad by calling him Dell Jr. All of a sudden not so cool anymore. Altho DJ Curry wouldn't be too bad but then at that point why not just go by Stephen.
[What Stephen Curry said in 2009](https://twitter.com/ESPNNBA/status/611033681663234048?s=09)
"Wardell Stephen Curry, Second of His Name, the Skyfucker"
"I just love the “James Harden is easily a top 5 player in the league” comments. So where does that leave LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, and Giannis Antetokounmpo? Not saying he isn’t special, but easily...not really. I have him 6 or 7th in my book."
Iggy called Steph that: https://nesn.com/2013/07/andre-iguodala-calls-stephen-curry-second-coming-of-jesus-christ/
" its Lebrun James Greatest of all time King of seven kingdoms. son of stephen curry, bitch of Jayson Tatum, Ruler of the Raptors."
"Luka is so fun to watch. He makes it Looks so effortless, gonna get Downvoted, but I wouldn’t be mad to trade a  32 year old Stephen Curry for a 20 year old Luka Doncic."
"SI, ESPN and Bleacher Report ranked him top 10 in 2017. The Washington Post didn't, but had him at...12. Which, for the sake of my argument lol, is close enough.  https://www.si.com/nba/2017/09/14/nba-top-100-players-2018-lebron-james-stephen-curry-kevin-durant  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarank110/nbarank-players-1-10  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2737803-nba-player-rankings-top-100-players-before-2017-18-season-tips-off#slide52  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/sports/nba-top-100-players-2017/?utm_term=.4922a6764acb"

Wardell Stephen Curry II
"I'm with you. I don't feel as if he impacts the game as much as a LeBron, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden, a Giannis or a Kawhi. I've never felt this way but the media has parroted the top 5 or even best player in the league narrative for a while now."
"Were all these players actually in 2K? They don't exactly have a comprehensive list of historic teams. How did you account for the prime of players if the 2K version of them was off a few years?   Also, this was the only one that surprised me a little bit.  &gt;2009 * Blake Griffin * Stephen Curry * James Harden * DeMar DeRozan * Jrue Holiday losing to...  &gt;1996 * Allen Iverson * Ray Allen * Kobe Bryant * Steve Nash * Jermaine O’Neal  Underrated great matchup."

"CBC radio (""As it Happens"" - best radio show around fight me) had an interview with his high school coach **James Lackey** yesterday.

On his first impression:  &gt; I mean, Dell Curry was maybe 6-6 or 6-7 so I figured when I heard that his son was in Grade 8, you know, in my mind I was imagining maybe someone 6-2 or 6-3.  &gt; And when I met Stephen, here he was this tiny little guy, maybe five-foot-three or five-foot-four at the tallest. &gt;  &gt; I was, to be honest, a little disappointed. But that disappointment soon went away as soon as I saw him playing. &gt;   Imagine being a small time basketball coach and being told that an NBA player's son was enrolling in your school.  For anyone interested, As it Happens interviewd Kawhi's HS coach today ([HERE](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/kawhi-leonard-s-high-school-coach-rooting-for-the-raptors-all-the-way-from-california-1.5152884))"

"You're right, Stephen Curry is a great player."
"This Ibaka’s first finals? There were literally like 4 posts about how he beat Harden and Westbrook and this is his first time there?   Also the Spurs have the record for finals three pointers made, not Danny Green.   He shot 7-9 in that game. You know who else has a tendency to shoot 7-9 and just came off a series where he averaged 36 ppg? Stephen Curry. You know who holds the actual record for post season threes made? Klay Thompson.

At the very refs who carried Steph? Do you really think out of all the players in the league Stephen Curry is the one who gets carried by refs?
"Go ahead and add all the other stuff Lebron has accomplished while you're at it. You know...the MVPs, FMVPs, scoring titles, assists totals, getting to the Finals with last years Cavs. Getting to the Finals with the 2007 Cavs. Going to the Finals for 7 straight years with 2 different teams. Face it, Curry is a product of his team. He said as much in the quote posted above. Curry isn't leading a team to a Finals let alone a championship by himself. Hes not cut for that. Lebron will drag a sorry ass team, kicking and screaming to the Finals. Put Curry on the 2017-2018 Cavs in place of Lebron. No way in hell they go to the Finals. Curry hasn't even gotten a Finals MVP. He's A factor. Not THE factor. Take Curry off the Warriors and leave everyone else and they're STILL winning championships. Period. Stephen is not a GREAT. He's just a good player on a team of really good players that combined make an unstoppable team. But he's no Jordan, he's no Kobe, he's no Lebron. Just another really good basketball player that got lucky as hell to be in the right place at the right time. Robert Horry 2.0"
"No player should be loyal to Golden State either. They traded Monta Ellis for Andrew Bogut and a 90 year old Stephen Jackson. Had y’all not won a single ring, I’m sure Golden State would’ve done the same thing Toronto did.   I meant in current NBA discussions when I said they won’t be known. Who really talk about the Bulls in current NBA discussions.   For you to say Kawhi wasn’t injured shows how selfish a fan you are. These guys entertain millions of fans but when they feel pain , they’re not entitled to rest and recovery time. Derrick Rose was cleared to play and ended up probably ruining his career because he didn’t take the time necessary to recover. Regardless you and I are not Kawhi and we don’t know how he was feeling so idk how you assume he was perfectly fine.  In Toronto we are achieving something you will never understand. All of Toronto are real fucking hard fans. There’s going to be bandwagons here and there but my city is the realest in the world. Making the finals was the greatest thing that happened in our history but for Golden State, most of their fans had come from bandwagons. You will never understand because you weren’t a fan when they were in the mud. I can 100% guarantee you don’t know the whole rosters before the Steph Curry era so I don’t wanna hear no loyal fam bs. Most of your fans are bandwagons.   Yes Kawhi was a ready made superstar, but we had to give up our guy for that. No matter what we’ll always have love for Demar. Yah most of our team came from trades and what not but I find it hypocritical you say that considering you signed a former MVP who was considered the second best player in the world and third best scorer of all time, before he even entered his prime just to get 2 more rings. If you leave Cleveland the way it was the year they won, Golden State isn’t beating Lebron and the Cavs so you should thank the other “ready made star” that’s on your team for that."

"My argument against Curry being in the top ten has been he just took too long to get great. He was good, but the injuries slowed his early years, and he never really became STEPHEN CURRY until he was 25-26.  Now if he stays healthy and just keeps winning rings, that can totally change but right now.. top 20."

That 14 year old grew up to be Stephen Curry
"Out of curiosity, is your opinion on Curry’s defense formulated by facts or just the narrative that a lot of people perpetuate?   Because if it was based on facts then you would know that steph curry is a very good defender, probably even better than Lowry overall.   Now you might say “ well why do teams single him out?” Well that because literally everyone else on GS are arguably the best defenders at their respective position. If you put Lowry on GS I promise you teams would try and pick on him to. “Why would they put Klay on guys like Lillard or Kyrie if Steph Curry is so good?” Well that because Klay is one of the best guard defenders in the league. NBA defenses are designed to maximize efficiency, it’s the same reason you often Wont see Draymond on the ball, because even though he is elite in that regard the warriors are actually a better defensive team when he plays free safety.

Stephen Curry!!!
"I'd like to hear who you think a league average starting point guard is. My take on it was a league average player that plays point guard, hence Mario Chalmers (during the Heatles) and DJ Augustin.   And literally half the starting point guards in the league are All-Stars or deserve All-Star status. My point still stands, though, replace Kyle with any PG not named Stephen Curry and I can assure you the Raptors wouldn't even be here."
"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayesha_Curry  &gt; She was born and raised in Toronto until the age of 14, when she moved to Charlotte, North Carolina. [...]  On July 30, 2011, she married NBA player Stephen Curry. The two met in a church youth group in Charlotte when they were 15 and 14 years old."
Did you forget that Stephen Curry exists?
2 words               Stephen     Curry
Cavs' role players turned into Stephen Curry against us every single time we faced them. I literally don't understand why.
"Their biggest problem is that the Raptors Kawhi era could be setting up to be a tale of tragedy in the finals.   First, they take on the KD-less Golden State Warriors. A win for the Warriors would easily vault Stephen Curry into being a pretty unanimous Top 10 player.  Then, the next year, if Kawhi stays, they will probably play Lebron in the finals, along with one of Blake Griffin or Anthony Davis, and also noted Raptor Hunter Jimmy Butler, setting the stage for Lebronto to return."
"LBJ has been at home while the rest of these guys were competing in the post season, therefore:     1. Kevin Durant  2. Kawhi Leonard  3. Stephen Curry 4. James Harden   5. Giannis Antetokounmpo"
If the Warriors win I can't imagine Stephen Curry not winning it unless KD plays from game 1.
Tbh nobody saw vanvleet turning into stephen curry.
Giannis Antetokounmpo with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson impossible to stop
Yeah also the teams he plays against is in the same league as Stephen Curry.
Bruh wtf why is Stephen Curry leading in scoring against the Raptors with LeBron existing
"Man I really hope the Milwaukee Bucks defeat the Toronto Raptors in tonight’s game. Making the Eastern Conference Finals even at 3 games each would lead to a very exciting game 7 to decide who advances to face the Golden State Warriors, lead by Stephen Curry, in the NBA Finals!"
I cant imagine being so naive as thinking there is a 'potential better' scorer than Stephen Curry.
He aint no lying people just cant accept Stephen Curry is something special like Michael Jordan.

"That's on the road that fans of opposing teams were showing up hours before to watch his warmup routine  https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/3/18/11266122/stephen-curry-warm-ups-worth-price-admission-warriors  &gt;DALLAS -- It's 90 minutes before the Mavericks play and there's more people already seated in sections 104 and 105 at the American Airlines Center than there was at the last home game's tip off. They're all here to watch Stephen Curry.  &gt;Later on in the night, they'll watch him play the Mavericks, making shots that actually matter in the record book. Right now, though, he's just dribbling and taking uncontested three-pointers, something that has warranted an audience of at least several thousand. Consider this: The American Airlines Center opened 30 minutes earlier than usual so fans could get in their seat in time to watch the spectacle. When Curry finally runs onto the floor, there's an audible cheer around the arena. Before the game, Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle compared the Warriors' popularity to the Rolling Stones on tour. Well, Curry is Mick Jagger."

Stephen Curry is better for the Warriors*. If Klay leaves though Durant is actually more valuable for them.
So they’ve created Stephen Curry..
Stephen Curry is *more impactful to the warriors* than Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is better than Stephen Curry.
"Let me take this one!  During my 15 years of coaching ball, I've done a *lot* of probably *way* too in-depth studying of how to build the best jumper.  I LOVE LEARNING EVERYTHING I AM ABLE TO RE: SHOOTING, THEN TEACHING THIS INFO TO YOUNG GUNS.  Okay okay okay.  So, like the building of any great jumpshot, we'll start from the bottom and work our way up... ______  **Lower Body**  *SEE BELOW ""Supplemental Shooting Clips from Leonard's SDSU Days"" numbered 1-16*  * I see Kawhi's lower body action pre-, during-, and post-shot as quite consistent and close to the ideal of what you would want: gathers quickly in hip-width stance on balls of feet with bouncy knees for best explosiveness/power. Compared to the latest software Kawhi is using, lower body of SDSU.Kawhi looking so similar.  * The power for shooting the ball *should* come from you lower body and shooting on the way up (a la Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry II), NOT from your upper body.  * *HOWEVER*, if I could draw your attention to how Kawhi shot, in his SDSU days, in regards to *when* he released/shot the ball... HE DOES IT WHEN HE IS ALREADY ON THE WAY DOWN! It's subtle, but in practically all 16 of the gathered clips, Kawhi shoots once he is already descending back to Earth. This will be important to remember for when I touch on his '**Upper Body**' technique below.  **Upper Body**  *SEE BELOW ""Supplemental Shooting Clips from Leonard's SDSU Days"" numbered 1-18*  *This* is where one can really see how new programmers are far superior to the older programmers that worked on SDSU.Kawhi:  * As is best seen in profile angles of Leonard's jumper from *clips 3, 6, 8, 9, and 12*, Leonard used to 'sling' ball well above/behind his head before shooting. Doing this causes his upper body to slingshot the ball during what used to be his shot instead of purely shooting it. * This causes it to look as if Kawhi is throwing his butt slightly backwards when shooting, but in reality what is happening is that he is slinging his body forward to 'shoot' the ball at the rim; instead, one wants to shoot the ball *up* and *out* (not *forward* and *at*)  * I believe Kawhi was using this slingshot technique because he was shooting on the way down -- SEE above explanation of this in the last two points of '**Lower Body**'. SDSU.Kawhi had exactly NONE of that sweet, sweet elastic energy from his bouncy legs transfer to his shot... it's sad when I see this happen with players. You may as well not be jumping! I mean...besides to elevate above the D's hands of course. * Since SDSU.Kawhi was shooting on the way down, this could explain why he adopted a slingshot technique. The actual power for shooting the ball had to come from somewhere! Trebuchets and slingshots were hella *powerful* weapons in their days. * However, this is a chicken-egg type scenario... did SDSU.Kawhi slingshot because he was shooting on the way down and needed that power to get the ball to the hoop OR did SDSU.Kawhi shoot on the way down because he didn't need the power from his legs due to his *powerful* slingshot way of shooting? * Finally, aspiring coaches and players, remember this if nothing else! The upper body technique is what actually guides the ball to the hoop, whereas *power* for getting the ball to the hoop comes from the lower body. Especially the strength of the lower body and shooting while on your way up so as to use all that momentum/kinetic energy from your extending lower body to get the ball to the hoop. Think about loading a spring then letting it go! That bouncy/elastic energy is what you get from properly executed lower body shooting technique, which then transfers into the energy to get the ball to the rim.   __________  *Supplemental Shooting Clips from Leonard's SDSU Days*  3.

In addition, I think they smoothed out that hitch SDSU.Kawhi had where he would shoot on the way down, thus having no power in his jumper."
Most definitely. Recommend [this article](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14750602/how-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-got-best-worst-ankles-sports) if you’re interested in checking out how he got his body right. It’s a good read for some spare time
Is “Steven” suppose to be a derogatory reference to Stephen Curry?
3point shooting is legit the only thing curry is better than kobe at also its Stephen curry and Kobe Bryant not Steven and Bryan
"He had a great quote on this in a Business Insider article: ""One thing my pops always told me is you never count another man's money,"" Curry told Kawakami.

KD said the “system” is just a code word for Stephen Curry. Dudes the modern day Magic Johnson except all the assists he caused don’t show up in the stay sheet.

"A fact you omitted: In that 8 year finals run from 2011-2018, LBJ played against a total of **FOUR** All-NBA 1st/2nd team players. That is while having at least 2 other all stars on his two different teams.  Stephen Curry in his 5 year run 2014-2019 has played against **FOURTEEN** All-NBA 1st/2nd team players. Also averaging at least 2 other all stars on his one team.  Translation: What LBJ did was incredible but the East was hot garbage. Still, it is what it is and you can't take it away from him. What Curry did was also incredible and you can't take it away from him either because so far he faced over 3x the number of elite players of his era in 5 years than LBJ in 8 years.   So we need to respect the shit out of both of them and not argue who was better because it seems even."
"Thursday he said Stephen Curry was by far the MVP of these playoffs and today he said it's now Kawhi. He's like Max Kellerman but to his credit, he actually knows basketball and has covered it far longer. Max uses his boxing expertise (which is probably second to none honesty) and tries to make it fit his basketball takes and that's why he ends up with some many stupid ass takes."

To be fair Chriss looked like a star in his first few games. Especially against the Nets where he became a 6'10 uber athletic Stephen Curry.
"Giannis plays a way better defense than stephen curry though, that's not open to debate. Steph does a respectable job on the defensive end but Giannis is a defensive player of the year candidate so they're not really comparable."
Wow I cant believe this work. Klay Thompson is a better shooter the Stephen Curry.
"I can’t do it. We know Curry’s impact on a basketball game from advanced stats through a number of years. We also know Durant’s. We know Curry elevates other players while Durant doesn’t.  Yes, Durant has had better playoff stats with them playing together (I believe 3 PPG and 2 TS% better), while Curry has better regular season stats, but a large function of this is the following:  1. Stephen Curry doesn’t get to play with Stephen Curry, but Kevin Durant does. 2. Teams like Houston and Cleveland buy hard into doubling Curry while giving single coverage to Durant.   Right now I would put Curry and Kawhi as the two best players in the league. Not sure where Lebron factors in, because we can see what he’s done before, but him and Durant are the next two up. Then Harden and Giannis after that."
"Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson also have two greatest shooters in the world beside them. And they both averaged fewer assists than KD in the regular season. I'm not saying that KD is the best playmaker in the NBA. I just wanted to contradict the statement ""He does some playmaking here and there"""
"1. Stephen Curry is not a number 2 guy. The Warriors have two No. 1 guys. It might be unfair but it is what it is. 2. It is important to remember that the Warriors lost in the finals before KD joined them. KD joined them and won two finals MVPs in a row. While being arguably the most consistent player in the playoffs in that stacked team. KD brings stability to the Warriors when they aren't great. He's clearly a luxury. But being a two-time finals MVP in that role only goes on to show that he is one of the main contributors to the success of this team. 3. Did KD make the Warriors overpowered? Yes. Does the fact that Warriors are overpowered diminish KD's abilities? No.    Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are perennial all stars in their own right. However, not every team is a Portland that throws away three 17 point leads. This series might very well have gone the other way if it weren't for some disastrous performances in the second half by the Trailblazers. You need a player like KD to avoid such situations altogether or to get you out of those situations against a better team. 4. KD doesn't just do some playmaking and defending here and there. He is a great defender and a great playmaker. No pure scorer that does playmaking here and there has 6 assists per game. He is an iso-intensive forward and still managed to get high assist numbers."
"HUGE favorites  &amp;#x200B;  I don't see how Toronto stands a chance against GSW. They not playing against Eric Bledsoe, they playing against Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson."
Lowry got more respect and calls from the refs in this game than Stephen Curry.

I watched shaq in his prime just get mauled. I’ve seen a lot of things  But I have never seen anything like the physical abuse that Stephen Curry takes without getting whistle’s. I do not understand it. isn’t he supposed to get special treatment? Or at least equal treatment? They do not give him nearly the amount of calls that he deserves. It’s clear.. It’s obvious. And it’s  gross.

LeBron Has a turnover/assist ratio of 2,3 (compared to KD’s 2.03, which I had to find manually, since he didn’t even crack the top 100), a better assist ratio, and way way way worse team mates to pass out to.   LeBron has -six- more potential assists a game than KD, gets five more ppg via assists (despite way worse team mates), has a significantly higher assist to pass ratio,  and so on and so forth."

Oh please idk if you remember a player called Stephen curry who was hobbled for like three years straight and was given all the time to come back. KD wanted to play. Literally all he he’s is basketball. All the shit about players forcing him back was BS. He gambled and it bit him in the ass but he’s a grown man and he made a decision.

"In the last 5 regular seasons, Stephen Curry is averaging a cumulative 28.7 points per 36 on 64.8% TS.  In the last 5 NBA Finals, he's averaging a cumulative 24.3 points per 36 on 59.0% TS.  In the last 5 playoffs overall, he's averaging a cumulative 26.5 points per 36 on 61.7% TS. I can't find a way to exclude the Finals on Basketball-Reference, but obviously his Finals stats are dragging down his overall playoffs stats, so his non-Finals playoff stats would be higher and probably very close to his regular season stats.  I'm not saying that Curry plays poorly in the Finals, because that's not true. 24.3 points per 36 on 59.0% TS is really good.   But the fact is that he does play a lot worse in the Finals than he does in the regular season or non-Finals playoffs. I really think it's something that can be held against him when ranking him all-time, since he is at the level where you're comparing him to like the top 15 guys to ever play.   On the biggest stage it doesn't feel like you're watching a true all-time great performing at the highest level as often as it should. Obviously the 47-pointer last week is one exception, but it feels like truly great performances from him in the Finals don't happen too often."
"Thank you. This narrative is so annoying. The worst part is that it's not our choice that Iggy and Livingston are aging, that Klay got hurt for game 3 and KD is out for the series. When the Warriors swept the blazers nobody was saying shit about how crippled they were. The warriors have Stephen fucking Curry and Klay (for 3/4 games) in their prime, DPOY from as recent as last year. They don't need excuses to be down 3-1."
"The whole fast pace, small ball, and lots of three-point shooting was popularized a long time ago by Don Nelson and then blew up with the 7SOL Suns, then morphed into Moreyball.  Stephen Curry is a perfect player for the style, but it's not like the style was created because of him."
Warriors fans' psyche with this is actually quite interesting to be honest.  Some of them want him gone so Stephen Curry can shine.

"Taxes are insane in California and New York as well. I don't think taxes will be a big factor in Kawhi's decision if he's focused on these destinations..   As an example, Curry is taking home roughly 44% of his salary. Here's a [complete breakdown](https://businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-salary-taxes-nba-2017-9) of what his taxes look like."
"Stephen Curry proved that he can't lead a team like MJ, Kobe, Kawhi and LeBron could even though he had tons of all-stars and lottery players."
"You're right, there is a humongous talent differential. The Warriors still have what, 5 all-stars and Hall of Fame players?    Including the two time MVP and first ever unanimous MVP Stephen Curry?    Possibly the single most hot-streak shooter the league has ever seen and best defensive guard in the NBA, Klay Thompson?    Forward of the future with insane passing talent and DPOY type defense, Draymond Green?    How about former finals MVP Andre Iguodala?    Or maybe you mean six time all-star and 2 times All-NBA center Demarcus Cousins?"
"Open shots are defined as shots with at least 4 feet of separation.  [Here are the TEAM stats through four games](https://i.imgur.com/cHhRrbO.png)  Takeaways:   - Klay Thompson has been unreal so far. Doing it while hobbled in Game 4 made his performance even more impressive.  - Stephen Curry has been missing open shots that he usually makes. He's also been getting plenty of good opportunities from deep -- while the Raptors' defense has been great, Curry is getting open looks from deep at the same rate as he did in the WCF, against a mediocre Portland defensive gameplan. Curry has simply been missing good looks.  - Danny Green's numbers were certainly way better before he shot 1-7 from three last night. Even though his percentage is below his regular season average, he's been stellar for the Raptors thus far.  - Alfonzo McKinnie, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala are all getting tons of great looks from outside and they're simply incapable of knocking them down. The Warriors could use some Game 7 Draymond.  - Pascal Siakam's regular season open 3P% wasn't great to begin with, but he has been even worse in the Finals so far. Fortunately, he's been dominant inside the paint against the Warriors, so the Raptors haven't needed him to knock down those open jumpers.   - The team stats are pretty close. One more made shot would put the Warriors ahead in open 3P%. However, the Warriors are certainly a better three-point shooting team than the Raptors, so this small gap is still surprising."

"&gt; literally any other superstar loses in the playoffs  [Superstar] really underperformed in that series, fuck him. This should diminish his legacy and cement him as a choking, regular-season performer. *Rabid, horny dog noises.* See Westbrook, Harden, and LeBron.   &gt; Curry loses in the playoffs  What a defensive showing from the other team. Unprecedented professionalism, coordination, and coaching; few teams could stop the generational offensive talent that is Stephen Curry. This team should be heralded for their efforts, but this doesn't diminish Curry's legacy whatsoever because, I mean, he still shot 58% TS% despite going 3-17 that one game."
"Steph has one more ring than KD, they beat up KD in 2016, so yeah, nothing is tough if you looks straight up at facts - Stephen Curry is all-time great player, top-2 PG in history, greatest shooter in history. Good luck denying that."
My favorite part of the 14 finals was Tim Duncan getting his fifth ring. It killed the argument they liked to spam in the Kobe V Duncan debate and took so much wind out of their sails. They then moved on to classic arguments such as “Kobe is better than LeBron” and “Kobe has a better shooting form than Stephen Curry”.
"I would be looking to trade Draymond Green to reload. They’re not going to win anything with Curry, Klay, and Draymond as there three max contracts (taking up 100 percent of the cap) if Durant leaves.  Blake Griffin would probably be my main target in a Draymond trade. Trade first round picks if that’s what is needed to get it done, but after one flip of a season Pistons may be looking to unload the contract.  Would also look at Kevin Love too. He’s underperformed in big playoff moments in the past, but he would be a big threat from three, and he could probably be had for a simple salary dump. (Then the Cavs flip Draymond to another contender for more assets).   Would re-sign Looney. Then go after Danny Green with the MLE.  PG - Stephen Curry SG - Klay Thompson SF - Danny Green PF - Blake Griffin or Kevin Love C - Kevon Looney  Not in love with this, but Draymond is going to go back to being fat once he gets paid and kill the team, so they should be pro-active in moving him to re-tool around Steph and Klay."
"Warriors offense is Stephen Curry or Klay Thompson, and Raptors will let everybody else shoot. Raptors defense have length, and they are able to read the Warriors actions to stop or slow down Curry &amp; Klay."
You are not wrong. The Stephen curry apologise crew is the strongest in nba history. Expect heir leaders fables you and that Chinese name guy to come defend him any second
"I was one of the people calling Lebron out as a statpadder in one of those games, just one! I watched the games live and there was one game where he didn't have a great scoring game, scored like 19 on below average efficiency, while trailing by less than 10 with less than a minute to go iirc.. Lebron opted to score layups after layups, getting 6 points in the final seconds for free (as in, the Warriors didn't bother defending those), while Cavs were fouling Steph Curry who was (and still is) a 90%+ free-throw shooter (and now we're getting stats that he hasn't missed a free-throw in the final minutes of the finals games), that sure didn't look like he was trying to win the game to me, as he was about to go down 3-1 in the series. Look at the reaction of his teammates and his opponents when he was doing that. Iirc Stephen A. Smith also called him out on that shortly after the game.  Granted, he made it up by playing lights out in the remaining games of the series, but that sequence did not make sense to me if he wasn't statpadding."
"Your starting five was Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, DeMarcus Cousins, and Andre Iguodala.  Do you need a 6th star in case your 5th gets injured or something"
"&gt; Leonard may become a free agent this year. **If he does leave Toronto, for tax purposes it might be wise to stay away from California, too.** &gt;  &gt; California’s Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry, for example, takes home about $17,751,150 of his $37.5 million gross wages, according to Raiola’s calculations. Curry pays around $14.7 million in federal taxes, and just shy for $5 million in state, local and jock taxes.  Curry pays 52.7% in tax. It's not much different."
"i can only speak for myself, but here i go  i don't want to see stephen curry succeed because he is coddled more than any superstar i have ever seen in my lifetime.  sometimes i see posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bwq49d/helin_stephen_curry_i_cost_warriors_2016/) where far too many of the comments are defending him saying ""oh no, festus ezeli is actually the reason you lost!"" imagine a UNANIMOUS MVP who just had one of the greatest offensive seasons in NBA history escaping some of the blame after scoring SEVENTEEN POINTS in the biggest game of his life. instead, plenty of people pin it on players like festus ezeli and harrison barnes. huh?  everytime steph has a bad game, people defend it with the ""okay but his gravity!"" ""he's double teamed.."" as if plenty of superstars have not dealt with the same defensive treatment. they don't get the excuses he does."
I see Stephen Curry receive a fair amount of shit all the time.
"Please explain how Stephen curry is better than magic or Stockton. Magic is the greatest pg of all time and Stockton is the best pure point guard ever, and he has the most assists and steals in nba history by a long shot."

"Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins.""  Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer.  ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game. I MEAN EVEN KERR SAID THIS 3 years ago"
Kevon Looney is 7 points away from **tying Stephen Curry for points in a Finals game.**

"Imagine being Stephen Curry, making such a good drive you get your teammate a wide open corner three, and then Draymond throws it off the side of the backboard."
"&gt;It is the most efficient regular season of all time with this kind of usage rate, regardless of era      That's not true. Stop using FG%, we're not in 1990 anymore.      - 2012-13 LeBron James: 37.5 PTS/100, 30.2 USG%, 64.0 TS%   - 2015-16 Stephen Curry: 42.5 PTS/100, 32.6 USG%, 66.9 TS%      About the post in general - sorry, but for me, this is neither an effort nor a quality post. It consists of nothing but an enumeration of stats and award votes which may barely suffice if your goal was to argue that LeBron had a great season which should be obvious to everyone.      But how can your post make a case for 2012-13 LeBron having the best season ever when you don't even compare it seasons of other greats?      You say for example that LeBron had a WS/48 of .322, the highest since 1972 which is true. But for example, Jordan had a WS/48 of .321 in 1990-91 while following it up with a legendary post-season run which blows LeBron's playoffs out of the water (WS/48 .333 vs. .260, BPM 13.8 vs. 10.2). You say you want to contextualize his season, but why don't you contextualize it with seasons by other greats then?      I don't enough about the history of the game to judge how high 2012-13 LeBron ranks amongst the best peaks ever, but if you make a post with such a sensationalist title, you gotta deliver more."

I mean Tyreke Evans scored more points as a rookie than Stephen Curry did as a rookie.  Tyreke Evans had more assists than Deron Williams did as a rookie.  But yeah you got me on the rebounds
"I was making this argument during discussions about the MVP. Who actually hard carries a team to relevence like James Harden does single handedly? Dude was 1 game away from being the 2nd seed.   &amp;#x200B;  And what's beyond that its not like they go in every year with expectations like the Jazz or Blazers where its just ""Play good and see how it goes""  &amp;#x200B;  Its seen as a choke job if they don't beat golden state when James Harden doesn't seem to beat Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant because he carries that fucking hard we think its possible."
James Harden &gt; Stephen Curry  James Harden performed the best against Golden State than any other player this postseason.   Russell Westbrook is good at basketball
https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/report-warriors-gm-bob-myers-kept-owner-joe-lacob-lowballing-stephen-curry-165936380.html  here is an aggregation of the athletic article from marcus thompson
Stephen Curry
"All time starting 5, chemistry / team fit being most important (With the IMPORTANT condition we are playing in TODAY's NBA):  PG: 2015-2016 Stephen Curry  SG: 2015-2016 Klay Thompson  SF: 2013-2014 Kevin Durant  PF: 2012-2013 LeBron James  C: 1993-1994 Hakeem Olajuwon  I honestly think Steph + Klay are the perfect, perfect backcourt combination for a team.  Technically both of them can play off the ball and have 0 ego while playing.  Steph, Klay, and KD can all play off the ball, while Steph and KD can take some of the handling responsibilities as well.  LeBron is probably the biggest ""ego"" on this team.  I like this 5 man matchup against anyone elses 5 you compile in history in a realistic 5 v 5 game where people need to co-exist with today's NBA rules."
Stephen curry has never won a finals mvp and you are comparing him to the all time greats like mj magic hakeem kareem lebron shaq etc. Curry is not in the same category. And its not a slight against him. He is just too small.
The ability to be an elite team leader and set an example. The reason Tim Duncan and Stephen Curry are the two single most valuable players to me of this generation are because they establish an entire culture for a franchise that ultimately transcends them.
"The absolute disrespect to 1x NBA Champion, 5x All-Star, 2x All-NBA, 2011 Most Improved Player and League Leader in Rebounds, Olympic Gold Medalist, FIBA World Champion, 2012 Three-Point Shoot-Out Champion, Mental Health Awareness Advocate, Eggplant Connoisseur, Stopper of Wardell Stephen Curry II, Ally of the Infamous (Westbrook, LeBron, DeRozan, Kyrie), Lover of Models, and Ambassador of Banana Republic,  Kevin Love."
"2017 FA Class:  Kevin Durant  Blake Griffin  Stephen Curry  J.J. Redick  Jrue Holiday  I would take Durant, Blake or Jrue over Hayward. Hayward was the best player the Celtics had a chance to get bu t that is not the same as being the best in his class lol"
2017 FA Class:  Kevin Durant  Blake Griffin  Stephen Curry  J.J. Redick  Jrue Holiday  Hayward was THE ONLY guy the Celtics had a chance at. Not the same as Hayward being top 3 in his class lmao. Go ahead and downvote if you want though.
"All the awards have their own page. You select the players using a drop-down menu.  It would be difficult to mix up All-Second Team with NBA All-Defensive Second Team as you suggested. However, I could see someone selecting ""Curry, Seth"" instead of ""Curry, Stephen."" But if someone did do that, they give you a chance to review your entire ballot before submitting. And then after you submit, they send you an email with your ballot.  The odds are the people who made unusual votes meant to.  Also, `Nephew Index` is hilarious."
"Except there's this:  ""Five hundred thirty players appeared in the NBA this season. Only one of them averaged at least 23 points and six assists per game while shooting at least 48 percent from the field and 40 percent from 3-point range.  His name is Kyrie Irving.  Yeah, there’s a reason why he was named today to the All-NBA Second Team, and why has a legitimate argument that he should’ve made the First Team.  The memory of a single postseason series shouldn’t sour the outlook on what Irving brought to the table during the 2018-19 season. That would be a mistake. The reality is that Irving wasn’t just good this season, and he wasn’t just great. He was historic as he tallied averages of 23.8 points per game and a career-best 6.9 assists per game while shooting 48.7 percent from the floor and 40.1 percent from long range.  Yes, he was the only player to reach the numbers outlined above this season, but that’s only the tip of this statistical iceberg. There is far more gravity to this story. Let’s walk up the ladder of significance.  There are now two names in the Boston Celtics history book that have recorded a 23-6-48-40 season. One is Irving. The other is Larry Bird, who accomplished the feat four times.  There are only four names in the NBA’s history book that have recorded such a season. One is Irving. The others are Bird (four times), Stephen Curry (three times) and LeBron James (one time).  These are three very exclusive lists that Irving has etched his name onto, but there is even more to what he accomplished this season.""  Also this:  ""The point guard set new career highs in total rebounds (335), assists (464) and blocks (34), as well as steals per game (1.54). He had previously never totaled more than 259 rebounds, 433 assists or 24 blocks in a season, and his previous high in steals per 36 minutes was 1.6.""  And this:  ""Then there is the conversation about Irving’s defense, which arguably was at an all-time high. Certainly, Irving did not perform at an All-Defensive rate (although he did receive one Second Team vote), but he was pretty darn solid.  Among the 208 guards who logged at least 2,000 minutes this season, Irving ranked No. 6 in charges drawn (13), No. 8 in loose balls recovered (118), No. 17 in deflections (170) and No. 25 in defensive win shares (8.0).  The best way to compare the significance of those numbers is to stand them side-by-side with the man who stood next to Irving in Boston’s backcourt this season, Marcus Smart. The NBA on Wednesday named Smart to the All-Defensive First Team. Smart finished the season ranking among guards as No. 5 in charges drawn (15), No. 30 in loose balls recovered (83), No. 2 in deflections (258) and No. 21 in defensive win shares (8.3).""  Source: https://www.nba.com/celtics/news/sidebar/misc-052319-kyries-historic-season-earns-all-nba-second-team-honors  But sure, Kyrie is ""essentially the same player he was back then.""  Your bias has you looking real suspect nephew."
Stephen curry
Stephen Curry.
"Someone always says this without looking it up, you just dont know what you're talking about. IT joined Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, and James Harden as the ONLY 4 guards in NBA history to ever put up 25+ PPG on 60+ TS%."
"OP must have been in a time chamber to just realize this now. This thing started a few years ago. THree pointers didn't ruin youth pickup basketball.  Stephen Curry simply inspired them. Same way it inspired people to try to ankle break and 1v3 during Iverson's time. Same way people chose to take super contested fadeaways during Kobe's time.   I do agree people jacking up 3's they have no business doing and without putting much effort in other parts of the ball game is quite worse than the past trends, but everyone learns as they grow older. You are talking about kids 8-12 years old. Stop being a drama queen by losing hope on ""youth pickup basketball"" so quickly lmao Stop bitching and join them on the court, hell maybe you could teach them your vision of youth basketball."
"Look, I'm sorry if you're like a kid or something and I'm coming off as a dick. If that's the case I probably would've approached this better.   In the real world, opinions can be wrong. People spew incorrect opinions all the time on this sub. For example, Emmanuel Mudiay isn't better than Stephen curry, right? So if someone held that opinion, they'd be wrong, correct?   I think I laid it out pretty clearly but if you are still unable to see my point we're just wasting each other's time."
"When the Warriors won in 2015, everyone was ""the Cavs lost"", and when they lost in 2016, it was ""the Cavs won"", and when they won in 2017 it was ""KD won"", and in 2018 ""LeBron got swept because the Cavs suck"". Not in one case of these was ""the Warriors won"" or ""the Warriors lost"" was the main take. As long as LeBron was relevant, the media got extra points for talking about him rather than the Warriors.  I won't even start with the first take duo that to this point refuses to admit that Steph Curry is a top five player in the league whenever that question matters, or with people letting Chuck say his bullshit, or Paul Pierce being himself... basically, just everyone who shat on the Warriors was given the mic (there's that weasel-faced dude that was only given the mic because you can count on him to be a LeBron stan). Even /r/nba is an example, where they kept deleting the post-game thread on the 73rd win in that season for hours ""so people can celebrate Kobe's retirement"" or some other bullshit.  Then, once LeBron went to the Lakers after the Warriors just *beat* LeBron, because let's be real here, if both teams were healthy, maybe the Cavs win 2015, but they lose 2016... one out of four was really the best any player in history with a team tailor-made to get the maximum out of him could have done against them. No one mentions how absolutely fucking insane that is. It's sort of stupid that people look at LeBron's 8 straight finals and say ""that's amazing"", but don't look at the Warriors beating him three times out of those eight as a testament to how historically bonkers that team was.  There's a case for it being the greatest rivalry in NBA history, because both LeBron and the Warriors upped their games over and over until the 2017 finals (well, if you'll allow me to be dramatic, up until KD's three over LeBron in game 3 of that series) when they reached what I consider the peak of basketball. I truly believe that we were blessed to watch the two of the most talented teams ever assembled each play healthy and at 100% of their abilities with wildly different styles and everyone stepping up, and that those Cavs would have won against any other team in history except the Warriors because LeBron *was actually that fucking good*.  The moment LeBron was out of contention? The Warriors are titans. They're impossible to beat. Unguardable. It doesn't matter that KD's injured (in all NBA history, there is only one case that the best player on the team has a season ending injury in the finals and win, and that was in the final game of the series, not before), they're still gods. It doesn't matter that Igoudala was playing on one foot since as early as Houston, Boogie hadn't had enough time healthy to be anything but a shell of himself, Kevon Looney had *two different season ending injuries* during the playoffs, Klay's injuries clearly costing the Warriors games 3 and 6 (and possibly game 4).  Hell, there's a case for the Warriors being the single most depleted team to ever make a finals (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 8th most important players had to play through season ending injuries, Klay and Igoudala still managed to be arguably the 2nd and 3rd highest contributors while like that).  None of these mattered.  What should have been a story about how a dynasty falls apart in the saddest fucking way possible was an impossible narrative by now - the whole hot-take style of media put two opinions ""the Warriors are historically great"" and ""ASTERISK ASTERISK KD WEAK CURRY ISN'T A REAL SUPERSTAR"" on equal footing. The ""we hate the Warriors"" crowd needed someone to listen to that wouldn't let things like ""facts"" and ""news standards"" and ""integrity"" get in the way, and people needed people to talk about LeBron's greatness now that he left Miami. Because the Warriors outmatching LeBron's prime wasn't a story (other than people whining about it being ""unfair"" or some bullshit, as if LeBron's existence isn't a mockery if anything fair in the universe with his physique of a combination of greek god and battle tank), then these Warriors are not an exception in any way. How could their injuries matter when even at their best ""Warriors are actually bad"" was a legitimate media take even after they won 73 games in a season?  And thus, we have Kawhi Leonard's achievement eclipse that of LeBron as far as the media is concerned.  It's bullshit. It's the same bullshit that has the media ignore the Cavs and to a certain extent the Pistons of the 80s, Knicks and Jazz of the 90s, Sacramento and to some extent the Pistons of the 00s. It's what makes people automatically dismiss arguably the 2nd greatest team of the 90s because they didn't face the Bulls in the finals. The media narrative has actually won and rewritten history as far as most fans are concerned.  I guess that this is what happens when the biggest media personalities that talk about the NBA are now caricatures of caricatures of themselves rather than what they could be. People forget that Stephen A used to be an actual reporter (first man to report on LeBron's meeting with Wade and Bosh to team up in Miami), and that Max Kellerman was downright fantastic when talking about boxing.  This lunacy is what the nba fandom has always most wanted. It's just got very little to do with reality."
Stephen Curry
Stephen “Wardell” Curry my good sir
Ok now we need a warriors fans perspective of a non warriors fan perspective on a warriors fan perspective on Stephen Curry
ESPN: Stephen Curry celebrated after Durant's injury
ESPN: Stephen Curry not proud of team with Durant
"i didnt say he used it as an excuse, in fact i implied that he didnt use it as an excuse.  im saying that he enjoyed bringing it up so fans / media can use it as an excuse for him.  there are countless articles about “stephen curry says he wasnt 100% in finals” if you want to see it, google that"
people wonder why i dislike stephen curry  this post is why  the way fans and media treat him is so fucking annoying
"I agree with everything in this post, except the premise. Maybe I'm blind, but I have not seen the pervasive criticism of Steph Curry that OP alleges exists. I've seen the exact opposite - people generally seem to respect Steph's character, leadership, and his incredible skill. It's pretty obvious that the only people questioning these things are trolls or media personalities like Cowherd who want to stir up controversy. As soon as one or two trolls offer their dumbass opinions about Steph's playoff performances or Steph's role on the team, suddenly people are saying that ""a lot of people belittle Stephen Curry’s game and his greatness""."
"I cant believe this made front page haha, this is just a eloquent piece of garbage that every other fan uses to defend him.. which isnt even necessary because hes ranked as a top 3 player and the best shooter ever.  ​&gt; “He gets smothered defensively and can’t play through contact” . This one always gets me. This always makes me salty.   Is it not true? Is it not true hes light and weak for an NBA player? Whats up with this shit lol, we cant call a spade a spade now?!  &gt; Stephen Curry played 2nd fiddle. What's so bad about that? Why does that tarnish his legacy?  Well when you're in discussion for being the top player in the league, taking a backseat to another player wont help your case in that department  Alot of your points are opinions and worded in a way to push a narrative, this just looks like Warrior fans playing victim. Try being a fan of a Lebron lead team and having to deal with edgy Warrior fans taunting for 2015 then cry about the same thing happening to them in 2019. We didnt make a massive karma hunting post either"
"A nephew from work tried to say Curry could be the best all time a while back. Most of the uncles (?) slammed him down but I feel like a legit argument will be made when his career is over than he's top 10 all time. I don't think he's peaked by a Longshot and if Durant leaves, Curry will have a shot to prove that and re-establish his legacy.   He'll go down as the best shooter of all time, it won't be a debate, it's really not a debate now and this is coming from a guy who's favorite player is Kyle Korver.   Say the Warriors win just one more title, which I don't think is crazy to project, that gives Curry 4 titles which puts him in rather elite company. At that point the arguments currently against his finals record will dissipate. No one will care that Kyrie or Love got hurt, factually injuries impact almost every single Finals, can't hold that against him at that point. Being mad Durant went is silly, Curry didn't choose for Durant to come, I'm sure he didn't object but if anything it's harmed his legacy a lot. Regardless, 4 titles, 2 MVPs at the one, who else has done that?   He's the face of the current brand of basketball, ask most non basketball fans to name a player and they'll say Stephen Curry and it's been like that for years! (Obviously some will say LeBron or Harden but Curry is a super common answer) In terms of impacting the game, few will ever have the impact he has had on the game.   Point being, you should love Curry! I don't seriously dislike anyone on the Warriors, they all seem like relatively good people. I don't want them to win but seeing greatness is phenomenal. The only other dynasty I'd say of this century in basketball is the early aughts Lakers, which I was too young for.   Good content OP, let's respect the Legends we have before their careers are over"
"&gt; Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson get more open looks than Stephen Curry. They take more open shots than Curry could ever hope for.   I agree with basically everything you said here but this point. According to NBA.com's player tracking stats, Curry in both the 16-17 playoffs and the 17-18 playoffs had roughly 55% of his shot attempts with the nearest defender being 4+ feet away. Durant was at about 30%. Klay was right around 50-51%.   Now this doesn't tell the whole story, because only going over ludicrous amounts of video play by plays would give you a definitive answer. What it does show however is that Curry's shot attempts aren't nearly as contested as people like to believe."
&gt; Yup. He is. Kevin Durant is better than Stephen Curry.  No. He is not.
There's also a different Thunderstruck starring Stephen Curry: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316763/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316763/)  &amp;#x200B;  Just not the guy you were probably thinking...
"Kennegh Lau of BesTV voted Dwyane Wade to the 2nd team, and Marvin Bagley III to the 3rd team. That's really fucked considering the contractual implications of these awards.  Kennegh Lau BesTV   Antetokounmpo, Giannis (MIL) Durant, Kevin (GSW) Embiid, Joel (PHI) Curry, Stephen (GSW) Harden, James (HOU)   Gallinari, Danilo (LAC) Doncic, Luka (DAL) Drummond, Andre (DET) Thompson, Klay (GSW) Wade, Dwyane (MIA)   Bagley III,  Marvin (SAC) Siakam, Pascal (TOR) Gobert, Rudy (UTA) Lillard, Damian (POR) Mitchell, Donovan (UTA)"
"If we're talking about ballots, lets take away Lau Kennegh's.    1st team Antetokounmpo, Giannis (MIL) Durant, Kevin (GSW) Embiid, Joel (PHI) Curry, Stephen (GSW) Harden, James (HOU)   2nd team Gallinari, Danilo (LAC) Doncic, Luka (DAL) Drummond, Andre (DET) Thompson, Klay (GSW) Wade, Dwyane (MIA)   3rd team Bagley III, Marvin (SAC) Siakam, Pascal (TOR) Gobert, Rudy (UTA) Lillard, Damian (POR) Mitchell, Donovan (UTA)   Like if you're gonna have contracts that the worth is dependent on making All-NBA teams and people are going to vote like this, they shouldn't be able to vote."
Like they tried to do with Stephen Curry when his speech gave way larger thanks to his pops and the hours he put in with his sons.

"The five basketball positions are Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, and Center. They all have a certain place where they are meant to stand. Here is a picture showing their location: https://m.imgur.com/a/s4lX41H. Naturally however, these positions need to move around to get open and make plays, but this is their natural position. Now I’m going to show what these positions do and what their qualities are. Look back at the picture every now and then to see where they stand, because it all ties in together.   1. Point Guard (pg) - The Point Guard stands at the front of the 3-point line and acts as the leader of the rest of the players. They are the ones that run plays and try to get a player a good shot. A good point Guard should be a good shooter (example: Stephen Curry, plays for warriors) and should also be good at driving to the rim (Russell Westbrook, plays for the thunder). At the same time, point guards have to be very good passers because they are trying to make plays (example: Magic Johnson, retired legend). Point Guards are usually not very tall and on the smaller side so they can get by their defenders.  2. Shooting Guard (sg) - A shooting guards job is pretty self explanatory. They shoot and they try to get good shots. As you can tell by their picture, a shooting guard is outside the three point line, but closer to the basket than point guards because they are on the side, also known as the wing. Of course, they’re also trying to be making plays just like the pg, however they’re main goal is to be a good shooter so that when they get the ball they can score a basket. Some good examples are Klay Thompson and James Harden both of which are playing in the nba now. Shooting guards are usually more tall than point guards so that they can get good shots using height advantage, however they are not the tallest on the court, we’ll get to that later.   3. Small Forward (sf) - These are very versatile and athletic players. They are on the wing as well, opposite of the shooting guard, and they’re job can be to shoot (example: Kevin Durant, currently plays for the warriors) or to drive to the basket (example LeBron James, currently plays for the Lakers). They are usually strong and well built, while also pretty tall.   4. Power forward (pf) - If you look at the picture, you can now see we are inside of the three point line and next to the basket. The power forward and the center and meant to be the tallest on the court, so that they can get rebounds from the basket and so they can score next to the basketball by laying it in or dunking. Power forwards are usually meant to be strong and tall (examples: Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan, both retired).  5. Center (c) - The tallest on the court. Their job is similar to the power forward, and that is to get rebounds and score close to the basket. There are many legends that were centers, and some I’d recommend to look at are Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Shaquille O’Neal. Some other legends are Bill Russell (has the most champions won ever with 11) and Wilt Chamberlain (has literally the most insane stats you can imagine), but they both played in the 50s and you can’t get any good recording of them playing, so I wouldn’t worry about it.   For your height and body build I’d suggest you be a point Guard. That means you need to work on your shot (make sure you are shooting correctly. When i started my form was awful and i shot two handed for a long time. Before you fix your form, you’ll never be able to shoot consistently. Look up YouTube videos or ask friends to help if you have any that shoot well). This also means you need to dribble very well (example: Kyrie Irving, currently plays for the Celtics, and Allen Iverson, retired legend). You also need to decide what kind of point Guard you want to be. Do you want to shoot from far like Stephen Curry or Damian Lillard, or are you athletic and explosive and would be able to drive to the basket like Russell Westbrook. I’d suggest you first work on your shot, work on dribble moves, and work on driving to the basket, and then learn what you are good at.   Best of luck! Remember: YouTube is a gold mine for tutorials. I use it almost every time I go to a basket to see what I’m going to work on."
"Recently there are a lot : Jokic, Draymond, Gobert, Siakam, Isaiah... But if I had to choose one, I would choose Curry.    I know I know, Stephen was not really unknown and he is a top 10 draft pick. But seriously, no one expected him to become a double MVP (one unanimous, even MJ did not get that honor) and change ""bad shots forbidden to take"" into ""ok shots"". He has the most unexpected carrier imo, and the fact he was picked so high in comparison to the usual draft steals, make it more incredible."
Nothing will top Derrick Rose winning MVP in front of the crowd or Stephen Curry winning unanimous MVP in front of the Warriors crowd.
and if Stephen fuckin Curry was defending Scottie then pip would've dropped 40 a night
Stephen Curry is in that movie!
Ask Stephen Curry if Nike knows how to spell his name.

"C’mon. The guy was grinning like an an idiot while his dad was next to him yelling at Stephen A. Smith about how Lonzo was better than Curry. Lonzo could have spoken up and shut Lavar down. Instead he kept his mouth shut because he knew the fake media hype marketing campaign was their strategy.                                                              Wasn’t Lonzo a key part of “Ball in The Life”? He was the Kim Kardashian of the NBA if Kim looked liked she does now 15 years ago. In other words, Lonzo is only famous for sucking dick. Their entire life was based on BBB (seriously, they started drawing their own shoes at like 10 years old), they didn’t dream about anything other than fame.

The official James Harden hater in the media is Broussard. He always say he isn't a hater because he voted for Harden to win the award over Curry 2 years ago. He rarely says positive things about Harden without a qualifier. The other hater is Stephen Jackson

Warriors starting lineup next season:  PG - Stephen Curry SG - Seth Curry SF - JR Smith PF - Jimmer Fridette C - Draymond Green  Go 73-9 and win the championship with the greatest offense in NBA history as it turns out putting spacing and shooting around Curry makes an unstoppable offense.
Holy shizz. The quick release and smooth jumper. The real black Stephen Curry.
February 2016 Stephen Curry had one of the best months in NBA history and I would argue it was THE best.      In 10 games he averaged 37/6/7 on 55/54/88 shooting splits.
"In their last play of game 6, with the championship on the line, the Warriors decided to run a Brad Stevens play out of all plays that gave Stephen Curry an open look at a 3. He missed as we know, but it shows how highly the top coaches view Brad Stevens. I'd say he's undoubtedly a top 5 coach considering the absolute garbage rosters he brought into the playoffs."

Yeah that’s definitely a risk of adding to super teams. But it’s really the same concept as Stephen Curry playing injured early in his career to get a discounted contract.  There are going to be extreme scenarios. But overall this gives middle teams more chance at adding depth to their teams.
Stephen Curry is 0-for-8 on go-ahead shots in the last 20 seconds of NBA playoff games.

Devastating. I'm a Stephen Curry fanboy you know.  (•_•)   ( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■   (⌐■_■)
"Nah. Curry doesn't even come close to matching the hype LeBron generates, at anything.    &gt;   If Durant and Kyrie joins the Nets or Knicks.. or if Kawhi joins the Lakers to form the real MONSTARS with LeBron and AD.. then that'll be the Top Post of All Time, easily  &gt;   But r/nba has too many subs now, and it's mostly a meme subreddit right now. So the Top Post of all time will keep on changing.  &gt;   If Molly kicks Stephen A in the nuts, that video will be the ultimate Top post of All Time on r/nba"
"There are players that could run it. LaMarcus Aldridge, Kevin Love, Danny Green, Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Victor Oladipo, Robert Covington, DeMar DeRozan, George Hill, Otto Porter, Joe Ingles are a few players off the top of my head that I think could do well in a triangle offense.  Its just that the game has moved past the system. It would be like running wishbone offense in the NFL today. A well constructed system that was very successful for its time, but the game has moved past it."
Y'all really haven't been paying attention. I've been watching ESPN's coverage for years and they always been doing this. The year after Steph Curry won his first MVP and title I remember watching ESPN right before the season started. First Take had Skip and Stephen A give their top 5 MVP candidates.  Steph Curry wasn't on EITHER one of their lists. And they weren't the only ones on ESPN to completely leave him out of the picture. People think because he's popular and ESPN wants to make money so they show his family 24/7 that they're sucking his dick but the reality is a lot of sports coverage of Steph has been negative.
"Not sure what the guy you replied to meant but according to your logic, Stephen Curry has 3 rings with 3 big ol *."
Stephen Curry - turned us into a winner
What point guard besides Stephen Curry in 2015 actually lead their team to a championship in the last few decades? That doesn’t happen often..
"He said so himself. He didn’t use as a excuse for blowing the series lead, and nobody really should. But if you look at his stats that finals and compare to his others you can tell there was some seem drop off. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-stephen-curry-on-the-finals-i-wasnt-100-percent-but-who-cares/amp/"
Stephen Curry. KD and Klay are injured for the most of the regular season..
"Funny you say that, Kyrie's my favorite player.  But even Stephen Curry isn't the most *hypothetically skilled player* ever. Not even close. The best a human could be? The limits right now are around 50-40-90, as we know. Who *knows* how good someone could get?"
"Fair enough. But top 1% of people in what? People often say wingspan, height, etc. and the usual physical qualities, but I think people *far* underestimate inner talent—the intangibles of a player that separates someone like Stephen Curry from Gerald Green or Zach LaVine."
"Lol, you say that like ayton is some elite defender   It takes more than athleticism to become an elite defender, especially for a big   How high can their ceiling be? Way higher than any player who is defense first, would you like to take a look at the recent mvps again or are you good?   Stephen Curry was unanimous mvp while being an average defender   Kevin Durant was an average defender for his first mvp   Nash was a below average defender for both of his mvps   Dirk was an average defender for his mvp   Russ was an average defender for his mvp   Harden was an average defender for his mvp   It’s a different league, offense is king.  Luka can be hidden on the other teams worst wing, it’s not a big deal   And Luka can definitely become an above average defender, he just needs to get better conditioned."
Every superstar has that power.  https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2018/08/11/andre-iguodala-says-stephen-curry-pretty-much-been-warriors-gm-since-2013/
"Stephen Curry, as mediocre a defender as he is, is not nearly the train wreck on defense that Steve Nash was.  Nash wasn't just bad on that end, he was horrifically bad."
"&gt; that we shouldn’t have a forum for everyone to speak so we can correct misconceptions.  When did I say you held this belief?   &gt; For people to actually hate Steph or LeBron, saying they suck, saying they’re not all time greats, saying they choke under pressure situations - that’s just idiotic and opinions I don’t bother listening to  Believe it or not these media heads fuel these opinions.   And it's great you can tune out opinions, but these opinions do matter.   See, maybe you can discern these idiotic opinions, but many people can't. Many people just prescribe to group think and don't do any of the leg work themselves. This is why these media heads opinions matter, because they influence these people.   &gt; But if they’re receiving criticism for parts of their game, I think that’s fine. If people wanna criticize LeBron for giving up on defense when the rest of the league still plays it, so be it. If people wanna criticize Steph for creating stupid turnovers or missing shots he should be making, that’s just how it goes. We can’t live in a world without criticism. It’s not like those guys want the world to kiss their ass even when they fuck up.  I never said anything to the contrary.   However, a lot of the ""criticism"" is retarded. Stephen Curry going 0/8 in clutch field goals doesn't mean shit. LeBron haivng a bad series in 2011 doesn't mean shit. These are small sample sizes, but this is disregarded BECAUSE of the people in media."
Stephen Curry did not average less than 20 points in a Final series while averaging 44 minutes a game. Even in his trash series he at least had a couple great games. Lebron got shut down that series in the 4th quarter every time.
lol sorry. I should have realized that I'm on r/nba  Kobe is obviously better because he's a straight psychopathic KILLER. Stephen curry is 0/8 on go ahead shots in the finals. Fucking choker
1 - 5 pick and roll and just pray for a switch and your point guard is Stephen curry
"The only other 50/40/90 guys (Larry Bird, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Reggie Miller, Steve Nash, Dirk Nowitzki, Mark Price). So basically some of those guys are good"

"On the surface this entire thing is absurd, but gotta give you props for needlessly doing insane amounts of research just to conclude Tyus fucking Battle is Stephen Curry.  If he pans out you deserve a Presidential Medal"
Is Stephen Curry the longest tenured active member of just 1 team?
"And [here](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/05/13/stephen-curry-not-athletic-how-warriors-star-squashed-that-scouting-report/) is an article full of NBA players and coaches saying that he *is* in fact a phenomenal athlete, just not in the traditional jumping and sprinting categories people prefer to look at it."
"the question is:  if you could pick one player to lead your team during the playoffs to win a championship, who would you pick?  personally i would pick LeBron James first, then Kevin Durant, then probably Stephen Curry, then Kawhi  and that's my top 4 right there  yours may be different and that's fine"
"No one has kids?

The foreign names, sure. Kemba literally rhymes with Simba. What 3 year old can't pronounce that? Hell he knew how to use the word ""fuck"" in a proper manner by the time he was 2. Kids will say some things cutesy. Literally every name in the NBA? Na."
"The title of the youtube video is ""Stephen CurryANKLE BREAKS Marc Gasol"", when the only reason Gasol ended up in a ""spin cycle"" is because Curry literally moves his feet into Gasol which is an offensive foul"
Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry
....what even are these figures. Who the hell is averaging 16/4/3? We're talking about combining volume with efficiency.  Why do you think Stephen Curry is far beyond Westbrook's level? He'll never come close to a triple double.
Stockton is clearly worse than Stephen Curry.
"I dont really think so. As great As A.I was , his prime was shorter then Kobes / Lebron / Jordans, he was big for like 5 or 6 years? But his own stupidity and bad decisions made hime lose popularity vote.  Kobe had the whole rape thing but even that didnt make him any less popular which is a testament to have popular the guy was, A.I in LA would have made him more infamous cause eveey little thing he did would have been put under more scrutiny, sort of like carmelo when he went on the knicks.  If right now you asked a causal fan or any random person name 5 basketball nba players you know you’ll probably hear , 1. MJ , 2. Lebron 3 Kobe ... 4 . possibly Shaq or magic 5 . Stephen curry..  the first 3 names youll get probably 90% of the time any where you go around the worldz"
Lmao Stephen Curry is 3rd but with a much more impressive 26.8 points. Which is more comparable to lebrons and Jordans points.   Tbh Jordan and LeBron are heavily overrated if they're this far down on this list
"From 2016 but I found this interesting.    &gt;￼  Stephen Curry and the suburbanizing of the NBA  Once packed with inner-city players, pro basketball is suburbanizing  ￼  Isaac Eger in Timeline  May 5, 2016 · 4 min read  ￼  ￼  Stephen Curry #30 of the Golden State Warriors reacts after the Warriors defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 125–104 at ORACLE Arena on April 13, 2016 in Oakland, California. ©Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images  To the surprise of no one, the Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry is reportedly the NBA’s Most Valuable Player for the second year in a row. While Curry’s win reinforces his position as today’s preeminent point guard, it also illustrates a decades-long shift in the story of professional basketball. For a long time, the idea of the inner-city phenom has held sway. In the case of LeBron James, who was born to a poor, teen mother in Akron, Ohio, this tale is true. But it turns out that James is the exception, and Curry, who grew up in an affluent neighborhood outside of Charlotte, N.C., as the son of a former NBA player, is the rule. That wasn’t always the case. The NBA was once a league where young men from the inner-city dominated the game. As ESPN’s Peter Keating points out, during “1960s and ’70s, more than 90 percent of NBA players were from urban areas.” Greats like the Wilt Chamberlain, Dr. J, Nate Archibald, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Elgin Baylor grew up poor in city housing projects. But that’s changed. These days, both black and white players are far more likely to have come from economic privilege.  ￼  ￼  ￼  ￼  Right: Kareem Abdul Jabbar at UCLA in 1966. ©AP Left: LeBron James when he was a young phenom at Akron St. Vincent-St. Marys high school in 2002. ©AP Photo/Mark Duncan  A 2010 article in the International Review for the Sociology of Sport looked at the backgrounds of NBA players from 1994 to 2004. Among all NBA players during that period, “66 percent of African Americans and 93 percent of whites have advantaged social background.” In fact, NBA players who were raised in poverty and broken homes made up a minority of the league. The researchers found that “45 percent of African-American male children live in a lower social class context, while only 34 percent of African-American NBA players come from lower social class background. Similarly, 23 percent of white male children live in a lower social class context, while only 7 percent of white NBA players were from a lower social class background.” Another study, authored in 2013 by New York Times writer Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, corroborated those findings, concluding that “growing up in a wealthier neighborhood is a major, positive predictor of reaching the NBA for both black and white men.” Comparing black NBA players born in the 1980s and the quality of the upbringing to the average black male, Stephens-Davidowitz estimates that NBA players are 30 percent less likely to be born to an unmarried mother and a teenage mother. In the third study, a 2009 article in The Mag found that NBA players were most likely to grow up in towns with a median population of 110,000 where the population is almost 60 percent white and educated."
"russ's finishing dive off a cliff in the playoffs.  among the top point guards here are their shooting percentages in the playoffs the past 3 years   Russell Westbrook: 51, 54, 46  Stephen Curry: 58, 73, 67  Damian Lillard: 55, 52, 55  Kyrie Irving: 59, - , 54  Chris Paul: 87, 54, 59  Kyle Lowry: 65, 69, 64  People see dunks and mean mugs and thinks he's an incredible finisher when in the playoffs he's been pretty meh at finishing. This is the dude that got stonewalled by Enes fucking Kanter last playoffs."
"Eh, maybe it wouldn’t be. But, I don’t get why there is this idea that Westbrook, a guy who has evolved every year he’s played, has a natural ceiling that is unacceptable for a team with championship aspirations. You can literally say the same for every star save Lebron, Curry, Durant, etc. In fact, people said that about Durant before he left for the Warriors.  Could Westbrook be more efficient? Yes. But there are literally only a dozen or so guys better than him right now, and maybe 7 teams with a realistic chance of winning (and it’s usually 2-3 teams). Putting aside salary issues, this idea that Westbrook isn’t worth having on your team is mind-boggling to me.   It’s not usually Westbrook’s play on the court that causes his teams to have a ceiling, it’s been a mix of injury, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, and a decent helping of bad luck.  There’s an alternate universe where Miami Lebron gets hurt and the Thunder win in 2012, and stick together winning championships. That that outcome didn’t happen doesn’t mean the decisions were bad anymore than a casino taking a bad beat means they should get out of the gambling business.  And I should add it’s not just Westbrook. The same thing was said about Lillard and McCollum too... until this year when they get to the conference finals. Everyone likes to use results based ex post facto explanations to act as though results based largely on chance were foreseeable."
you are an idiot. it’s stephen fucking curry
"[AI himself said that Kyrie and Curry's handles are a step above his own](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2465203-allen-iverson-says-stephen-curry-and-kyrie-irving-have-better-handles-than-him)(can't find the video, but here's an article and the video exists 100% I remember watching it on NBATV or ESPN during a special). And White Chocolate was flashy, but wasn't breaking ankles at the consistency that these two still do to this day. I'd honestly put CP3 ahead of White Chocolate even though I hate his guts."
"&gt; FiveThirtyEight's Career-Arc Regression Model Estimator with Local Optimization (CARMELO) is a system that forecasts a player‘s future performance.  &gt; ...an algorithm that compares current players to past ones who had statistically similar profile through the same age. For instance, Utah Jazz phenom Donovan Mitchell is similar to players such as Gilbert Arenas, Ray Allen, Stephen Curry, Ben Gordon, Victor Oladipo and O.J. Mayo through this early point in their respective careers. Some of those players (Allen, Curry) became superstars, while others (Gordon, Mayo) didn’t really pan out. The combination of those good and not-so-good outcomes gives us a probabilistic forecast for the rest of Mitchell’s career.  &amp;nbsp;  So it's basically a comparative algorithm. It has a fairly good track record for accuracy, although some elements leave a bit to be desired. On this particular list, I find it hard to believe DeMarcus Cousins is about to provide that much value for the Lakers, but the algorithm doesn't take injury into account. It sees he's in prime age with a statistical footprint similar to past star-level talents so he must be very valuable.  Additionally, its advanced-stats appreciation doesn't always line up with the consensus. I don't think anybody believes Kevon Looney's 6/5 contribution will provide 29 million dollars' worth of value, but the advanced stats love his efficiency and so does CARMELO."
"1. You raised a point that Paul George is so good he went to the ECF, I pointed out that there are now players who weren’t playing then who may now be just as good, as they are all younger then him and having some successful years. Also, calm down. You sound stupid insulting my intelligence when I’m whipping your ass.   2. I guess. But people keep saying the same shit over and over like they know anything about him. No one knows anything so it’s all conjecture. He has legitimately no public persona.   3. The Clippers this year were fine but are overrated by everyone. If Jimmy Butler stayed in Minnesota, if the Kings didn’t lose a few winnable games, if the Lakers had more Lebron and he didn’t crater the teams chemistry with the AD trade, the Clips most likely don’t make it. App throws things didn’t happen so the Clips got the benefits. But in my estimation they were a fluke team, relying on Gallinaris best year by chance and then pulling it together with more luck then Clips fans care to admit.   Giannis nearly went to the Finals at 24 with no 3 pointer, what is your point? That he’s good? Yeah, he’s really good. 3 point shots are overrated in my estimation if you’re as good as Giannis is. And the thing is, AD could possibly be that good, He’s never had shooters on his squad like he does now.   Are you here telling me PG is Stephen Curry? I watched the man miss shot after shot last season. FOH with this take.  Ray Allen perfectly illustrates my point on AD... he’s on bad teams and never gets his opportunity. Only difference is that ADs ceiling is higher than Rays ceiling. If you don’t believe me then watch some AD highlights from 2018. AD is the same age as Kawhi and if he had Duncan on his team he’d also have one title. Stop it.   Ray Allen was about to enter the downside of his career when he went to Boston. AD is about to enter his prime and he’s already had an MVP caliber year, similar to Ray who had one too but with more time on his clock, depending on injuries, which no one predicts. You’re mistaking the importance of age. AD has 10 more years in the NBA if his body holds up. PG maybe has 6 years, he’s 29 now."
"Stockton was undoubtedly an amazing player -- his longevity and records are obviously incredible. But we might have different ideas of what factors constitute greatness.   All of the players I listed were considered superstars in their prime. Legit top 3, top 5 guys in the league. Kidd? He joined a 26-win Nets team, led them to back-to-back finals appearances, played at an MVP level (many critics argue he should've won MVP over Tim Duncan in the 2001-02 season). Nash? His arrival back in Phoenix saw the team making a 33 win improvement, and he was the key engineer for a revolutionary offense. This dude was a 2X MVP, do you know how difficult that is? People nowadays might scoff at his accolades, especially when considering his overall talent compared to superstars of his era like Kobe and Duncan. But his impact was very real, and much more discernible than what Stockton brought to the table for the Jazz.   CP3 arguably should've won MVP in 2008, he's the most efficient point guard the league has ever seen. Seriously, check out his advanced stats for the regular season and the playoffs, he's the ""point god"" for a reason.   Oscar Robertson? Dude averaged a 30pt triple double, invented the head fake and fadeaway jumper, brought Milwaukee a championship.   Stephen Curry broke the NBA, revolutionized the point guard position by making shooting 3s off a dribble the most valuable skill a point guard can have. While his assists do not match up with other NBA point guard greats, his off-ball play and gravity should count as secondary assists for the easy looks his teammates were getting.   If you were to construct an All-NBA all-history team, would you really choose Stockton? All the players I listed above have had greater impacts on their respective teams than Stockton ever had. They were all MVP calibre, top 3/5 player in the league types. Stockton's impressive longevity and Gretzky like unfathomable stats inflate his reputation. Superstars run the league, and Stockton was never one."
"I am not hating on anyone, so many free throws **require** one to be a black hole of usage. 3pt shooting is more valuable to modern game, more than whatever TS is telling you because of the intangibles it brings. Motion offense, spacing.  Curry is better at similar volume on the most important shot in the modern game. That alone tells me that he is more valuable offensively. Not generally, mind you, Harden's size can make him more valuable at times, like his post defense which can be valuable against teams with big guards that like to post up, folk like Ben Simmons.  What I am saying is in fact a truism amongst basketball circles. Curry is the better offensive player, I dunno why r/NBA is so unorthodox at this point.   As for the Rockets' game and level of play. Again, I am not hating , they merely showed that it was their defensive schemes more than their offense that carried them. Meaning that as powerful is it to have an one man offense, it doesn't afford you titles. And since we are talking about offense (strictly) it doesn't matter either. Steph's kind of offense is very helpful to people other than himself. Harden can be helpful with the gravity he offers, but nowhere near as much as Steph does.   I mean the dude merely touches the ball (Stephen does) and instantly a second player is open. Houston *can* be guarded because their game is way more predictable with everything having to emanate from Harden."

"&gt;Basketball casual here, but would you say this is due to the fact that the 3-pointer is relatively new to the game or because this era’s talent is exceptional?  The three point isn't new, but it being a focus of the game is.  Steve Nash transformed how NBA offences view the three and got kids to start [heavily practicing threes and ball distribution](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1820880-stephen-curry-says-he-shaped-his-game-after-steve-nash-and-reggie-miller).  As a result, we're seeing players who are more talented at shooting from outside, and offences that are more willing to use outside shots and quick shots."
Stephen Curry is now the oldest player on his team
There's no way in hell Stephen curry wins MVP without Klay or Durant.. all eyes are going to be on him
1. Kawhi Leonard 2. Stephen Curry 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. James Harden 5. LeBron James 6. Joel Embiid 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Anthony Davis 9. Paul George 10. Russell Westbrook
"Kobe Bryant   Tim Duncan  Steve Nash  Kevin Garnett  Allen Iverson   Dwyane Wade  Dirk Nowitzki  LeBron James  Jason Kidd  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Might be missing some obvious players but I don’t think anyone else is on the level of these guys. You could argue for Dwight, Allen, Paul, Gasol etc."
"Looking through the projected for a lot of these players really puts this list in question.  For most young promising players the model expects them to improve next season or two and then more or less plateau at 8-9 WAR at best (basically all star niveau) for the next few years.  [Luka Doncic](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/luka-doncic/)  [Ben Simmons](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/ben-simmons/)  [KAT](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/karl-anthony-towns/)  [Embiid](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/joel-embiid/)  [Tatum](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/jayson-tatum/)  It's similar for most young good players. For some reason the model really likes Lonzo and expects him to really keep improving.  It also doesn't expect improvements on good players to last and expects them to be outliers which might be true in some cases but less so in others  [Giannis](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/giannis-antetokounmpo/)  [Jokic](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/nikola-jokic/)  [PG](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/paul-george/)  Lastly the model predicts most stars around 30 to really regress the next few years.  [Harden](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/james-harden/)  [Curry](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/stephen-curry/)  [LeBron](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/lebron-james/)  This one might actually be because of his injury so the model thinks he got significantly worse this year.  [Westbrook](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/russell-westbrook/)  He is predicted to be better next year but then declines.  [PG again](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/paul-george/)  [Kawhi](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/kawhi-leonard/)  Overall it seems like the model is very cookie cutter for young players and older player, because young player will improve some more and then stay the same for a few years and older players simply get worse the older they get. It doesn't really recongnize if a player can be expected to be great or if a player has a game that ages well.  It also fails to interpret rapid improvement properly. Jokic, Giannis and PG are expected to be at their older levels next year despite their improvements this season.  All in all it seems very generalized and something everyone could tell you. Young players improve and older players get worse but it lacks individualism."
Stephen Curry sucked at summer league. And so did LeBron. Two biggest scrubs in the NBA right now
"Oh boy, don't say that. Draymond green, Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry are still there"
"maybe for Knicks fans but he was never ""clearly"" top 5 even in 2013. you had Lebron, KD, Duncan, and CP3 who were hands down better. [Gasol, Harden, Curry, Love are all up there too] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Carmelo+Anthony&amp;player_id1_select=Carmelo+Anthony&amp;player_id1=anthoca01&amp;y1=2014&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y2=2014&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id3_select=LeBron+James&amp;y3=2014&amp;player_id3=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Kevin+Love&amp;player_id4_select=Kevin+Love&amp;y4=2014&amp;player_id4=loveke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id5_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id5_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y5=2014&amp;player_id5=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id6_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id6_select=James+Harden&amp;y6=2014&amp;player_id6=hardeja01&amp;idx=players)"

"The Warriors still have Stephen Curry, D'Angelo Russell, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green - all recently all-stars.  Starting center would probably be Kevon Looney or Willie Cauley-Stein.  The starting squad still looks fine - it's the bench *this* year that's going to be thin unless some young guys come up big and become serious rotation players."
"Never forget in a game with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love it was Shaun Livingston and Leandro Barbosa that dominated the game. God I loved the Warriors those 2 seasons."
Uh willy. You literally played with stephen curry last year.
Stephen Curry = Curry
"After they receive Steph Curry, Stephen Adams, and Damien Lillard in a 6 team trade..."
"If I were to guess, and I don’t believe any of this, this why: Chris Paul is old af so he will be trash next year, so therefore the Rockets will also be trash. Harden and Paul also hate each other’s guts so the dysfunction will tear the team apart. As for the Warriors, Stephen Curry has been exposed as a fraudulent superstar who can’t get open when it matters and plays shit defense. Draymond Green is also old af and is a now a liability on the court."
"He's definitely not a top 3 PG, that's for sure. Top 5, sure. I have Stephen Curry over him."
So he can match up with Stephen Curry.
"Paywall so here’s the meat and potatoes:  &gt;Golden State needed a splashy offseason addition after Klay Thompson tore his ACL in the NBA Finals and Durant left in free agency.  “I don’t think you ever know until that day comes,” Russell said. “You hear a bunch of scenarios until that day happens and that time clicks. You’ll never know. I feel like everybody got surprised this summer.”  Heading into the season with Thompson sidelined, Russell is a natural fit next to Stephen Curry in the backcourt. Both players can create for others and be a scorer off the ball. When Thompson returns, all three could play together to maximize floor spacing.  “I look at it as a learning opportunity as well being around two of the best players in the league,” Russell said of playing with Curry and Thompson. “I think it’s a learning thing I can use. I can just learn from them on and off the court, how they carry themselves. A lot of things like that. I’m attacking it like that.”  If the trio of Curry, Thompson and Russell isn’t a fit, the Warriors can trade the 23-year-old guard down the road.  After leading the Nets to the sixth seed in the East and the playoffs for the first time in four seasons, Russell knows expectations will be higher with the Warriors, who’ve won three championships in five seasons.  “I think it’ll be special,” Russell said. “When you add guys that can shoot to your team I think you already get better and you’re just adding a piece to their core that they already have. I think it’ll really be special.”  After maturing in Brooklyn, Russell will take the same humbled approach heading to Golden State as he hopes to add another new accolade to his résumé — a championship.  “I feel like I’m a young veteran in this league that’s trying to get better day by day at the same time,” he said."
"But he didn't carry his team to a championship......  His offense wasn't game changing. He made a -1.2 rORTG (3-year postseason data) of the Raps to a +1.4 rORTG this postseason. For comparison Stephen Curry without KD this postseason led an inarguably less offensively talented squad to the best postseason offense of +4.3 rORTG.  Now, if you look at his defense, he wasn't even top 5 on his own team in impact. He was 6th in D-PIPM, which makes sense because of how important Ibaka, Siakam and Gasol were in helping off and at rim protection.   Their defense is what carried them and it Kawhi was hardly the main cause at all"
He's top 10 over who on this list?  &amp;#x200B;  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant   Kawhi Leonard  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Lebron James  Paul George   Anthony Davis  Nikola Jokic
Stephen Curry was like the iPhone but now everyone has smart phones. People catch up.
"&gt; Stephen Curry - this one sounds wild, but people are forgetting Steph is always potentially the best player in the world.  Somebody help me find my eyes. I just rolled them so hard they fell out of my goddamn skull."
Check their record with &amp; without Durant. Then check their record with &amp; without Stephen mother fuckin curry. And get back to me you'll be surprised
"&gt;We now have three pairings of top-15 players (depending on how you rank Irving): Irving and Durant; Anthony Davis and LeBron James; Leonard and George. Depending on your taste, the Warriors (Stephen Curry/Klay Thompson or Draymond Green) and Sixers (Joel Embiid/Ben Simmons -- the latter outside my top 15) are on the edge of sporting such a duo  It's just nice to be included"
"Stephen Wardell Curry, or does that not count?"
i wish i could see your face when you find out looney can shoot the long ball lol(and smailagic) oh and also we have stephen curry and klay thompson just fyi. btw it's draymond's contract year.
"&gt; Some are pretty obvious, like LeBron and Curry   Durant has been a lock to be a future first ballot HOF before most people even found out who is Stephen Curry. The Warriors and Curry was irrelevant, up until 2014. I'm talking about the majority, and in general.. not a few hardcore fans.   &gt;  LeBron and Durant has been the best and the 2nd best for over a decade now.   &gt;   Some of y'all kids forget that LeBron has been in the league since age 18, and Durant since age 19.. just dominating. Show some respect fool"
"The Golden State Warriors unironically broke the NBA regular season record with 73 wins, came back from a 3-1 deficit against the Oklahoma City Thunder, gained a 3-1 lead on the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals, and then lost 3 games in a row and did not win the championship. Stephen Curry unironically won unanimous MVP, back to back MVPs, and exclaimed ""We not goin' home!"" during a game, before being blocked by LeBron James a record 7 times in one series and indeed going home. Klay Thompson unironically said in a post game interview after going up 3-1 that basketball ""is a man's game"" and LeBron James ""got his feelings hurt"", LeBron proceeded to average 36pts/12ast/10reb and won the next 3 games and the championship. Draymond Green unironically avoided suspension for kicking Steven Adams in the balls twice, then STILL continued to play dirty and finally got suspended during the most important series of his life and ultimately cost his team its once historic and now infamous season. These things all actually happened, the thoughts of this reality stay with me at all times. I go to sleep at night looking up at the stars, wondering what celestial being aligned the universe in such a way to make an event as amazing as this occur. I wake up smiling every morning knowing that the Warriors genuinely went 73-9 and choked a 3-1 lead in the Finals. That even if time is a nonlinear fourth dimension, going to back to stop it from happening will simply create another universe where it happens again. That the state of ass-blastedness emanating from the city of Oakland is eternal and infinite, it crosses countless dimensions of the multiverse and its unending torment knows no bounds. I gaze into the endless cosmic wonders around me, still in disbelief that it actually happened, but knowing that my purpose in life was to be born just in time to see LeGod get one for da land."
I know that OP's post is shit but you're comment is trash.  Why the fuck would you say Dirk won over 2 FUTURE MVPS. At that point Harden is a 6th man and Russ is an above average PG lol.  It's like saying that the Clippers beat the FUTURE UNANIMOUS MVP STEPHEN CURRY on a playoff series last 2014
Idk about him but I do know about Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry

The lone guy who fell out and it wasn't because of old age (being 35+)  was Dwight Howard.  Over this five year span the guys who moved into the top 10 to take those spots were guys who were guys like Harden and Curry who were young and still considered top 15 players at the time.  Russ is only 30, I'm more than willing to bet that he can maintain his play for another 3 years."
Stephen Curry is a elite defender
Stephen Curry.
Your starting backcourt is Stephen curry and D’lo don’t talk about defense lol
"Im impressed how Jerry west managed to hang onto Harrell ( same age (25) as pascal, *similar* skillset but pascal is more athletic and the better defender with much better footwork and post moves and shooting( mid-range, ft, 3pt) while harrell is stronger and a better finisher, although Harrell has been improving his shooting, footwork is not as polished as pascal) ;    Harrell's shot distribution ( this isnt the whole story, just to help simplify things: [https://stats.nba.com/player/1626149/shooting/?sort=FGA&amp;dir=1](https://stats.nba.com/player/1626149/shooting/?sort=FGA&amp;dir=1)   Pascal's shot distribution:    [https://stats.nba.com/player/1627783/shooting/?sort=FGA&amp;dir=1](https://stats.nba.com/player/1627783/shooting/?sort=FGA&amp;dir=1)   &amp;#x200B;  Harrell is more like a good pick and roll, finisher, who can pop, I guess.   &amp;#x200B;  Surprised Clippers could keep him and shamet  when SGA no where near the value of Siakam, he's is young and a long way from being good anytime soon, he hasnt shown All Nba/ ALl defensive team potential like pascal ( skip bayless, stephen A smith, Pierce, all of them see it, Leo rautins torontos longest commentator and he's very objective and careful with his words, notices how pascal improves literally every game) , and fred vanvleet has shown he can start an undersized ""SG"" even though he's a point guard and can play like one, while guarding the best PG in the nba Steph curry, he definitely has a place in this league. It feels like presti overpriced it for the raptors."

No shit you’re talking about Stephen Curry.

Again, I'm not the one shouting team success at you. you're saying he cant get it done...its a team game. no one can get it done alone. Lebron ""couldnt get it done"" in 2018, that doesnt mean he wasnt the best player on the floor in those playoffs right?"
"The Western Conference Finals backcourt were: Stephen Curry (Davidson), Klay Thompson (Washington State), Damian Lillard (Weber State) and CJ McCollum (Lehigh)."

I can tell you here is 65% fans are bron stans and mostly ph nba girl fans are stephen curry stans.
The warriors still have STEPHEN CURRY like how does everyone keep forgetting this.
basically OP said that 15'-16' Stephen Curry would come back and lead the Warriors to a championship
"So that makes him better than LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and KD?"
"Stephen Curry and Aaron Brooks is the funniest one here, imo."

That's the first 15 that come to my mind since 2015. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are on the edge."
I'm tired of the arbitrary spellings and pronunciations (Stephen Curry vs. Stephen A.). If he's not going to pronounce it like Steph I'm not going to take the time to edit.
"I'm not aware of players *actually* winning them both the same year, but few people have come close to it.  + Derrick Rose in 2011  + Stephen Curry in 2016"

Stephen A Curry
I don't think she is. Marcus Thompson III wrote a (paywalled) article on the exact same thing a few days ago (honestly she probably just read it and repeated it).  https://theathletic.com/1055842/2019/07/01/thompson-kevin-durants-choice-showed-what-he-values-something-stephen-curry-and-the-warriors-couldnt-quite-give-him/
This is why I hate Stephen Curry with a passion ^
"&gt; He is mixed. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Curry mom is part white. If your mom is mixed then you're mixed.  In general, African Americans are only considered ""mixed"" or ""biracial"" if they have one non-black parent (or grandparent). So players like Klay Thompson, Jason Kidd, Blake Griffin are considered biracial because they have Caucasian moms.  Neither of Steph Curry's parents (or grandparents) are non-black. Apparently his maternal grandmother is Afro-Haitian, so she may very well have mixed heritage, and that's maybe where they got some the fair-skinned genes from.  It's kind of pointless to call any African American who has any Caucasian parts in their entire ancestry as ""mixed"" because then 99% of African Americans would be ""mixed"".  ---  Sources:  https://ethnicelebs.com/stephen-curry  http://www.haitianinternet.com/articles/list-of-haitian-nba-players.html  https://www.roanoke.com/news/local/curry-rooted-in-storied-new-river-valley-family-tree/article_a9337524-19d8-5129-9b05-5099e91b13d6.html  https://theundefeated.com/features/sonya-curry-stephen-curry-mother-turns-experiences-with-racism-into-lessons-for-her-children/"

Ten years is enough time for a player to get drafted and subsequently have a Hall of Fame-caliber career (see James Harden and Stephen Curry).  If China can't even produce a single consistent NBA player in that time it should be considered a massive failure.
Stephen Curry was the best player in the NBA during the 2015-2016 regular season
You can read about it here:  https://www.sbnation.com/2011-nba-free-agency/2011/12/7/2617435/chris-paul-trade-rumors-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry
"Stephen Curry? KD?  I'm sure there's another, but they're two immediate players I can think of that are insanely skilled that are definitely not known or celebrated for their toughness. Not saying they can't absorb contact, making a point that physicality would certainly be a weakness in both of their games, if you can really call it a weakness."
Stephen curry vs Seth
"The Undertaker then proceeded to choke-slam all the Cavs players until Lebron came running out from the locker room. Lebron was then infamously Tombstoned through the announcers table, and laid to rest in a casket that was then carried out by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Kevin Durant. Taker then shot 17/17 Three Pointers in the Cavs Practice Facility."
"Depends on what you're looking for.  For example, you looking for a Stephen Curry shot? Just search up ""nba spephen curry shot"" on google, go to images abd you should find some high quality images you can use."
"The worst part of KD going to the Warriors for NBA spectators isn't ""ruining league parity"", it's robbing the NBA from 3 more years of high-volume Stephen Curry."
This post is a prime example of how Stephen Curry changed the game
The black Stephen Curry
"Stephen Curry has literally never had a season he played more than 30 games in which he provided less than a win per season in Defensive Win Shares. Either the stat itself is useless or it has some weird Curry-esque blindspot. Of the 342 player-seasons since 2012 by players 6-3 and shorter, he has the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 42nd best seasons by DWS."
Stephen Curry at NUMBER 2???? WHATTTT?!?! That’s just so wrong. Post deserves a ban
Stephen Curry is not a pro. He's very good and a scratch golfer but the only tourney I've seen him play he finished dead last and that was the web.com tour which is like the D league of golf. Those guys are amazing at golf too but Stephen is not basically a pro. He's a very good amateur. Pros are way past scratch golf they give like 5-7 strokes when they handicap. With that being said 99% of golfers never reach scratch and he's very impressive with golf but the difference between a scratch golfer and a pga tour pro is astounding.
"There's almost no one in the league under 5'10.  It's Isaiah Thomas by default.  Of everyone in the NBA, best player shrunk down to 5'10'' would be Stephen Curry.  He's already a below the rim player, his game wouldn't DRASTICALLY change.  Still hit ridiculous shots, still have tight handle, still be a great passer.  His average to below average defense would go to the absolute shitter though.  Anyone who answers players like LeBron, Kawhi or KD don't understand how much being athletically dominant compliments their game.  For anyone to survive at 5'10, being an elite shooter is a pre-requisite."
"Marcus Thompson wrote an [article](https://theathletic.com/1055842/2019/07/01/thompson-kevin-durants-choice-showed-what-he-values-something-stephen-curry-and-the-warriors-couldnt-quite-give-him/) about it not being a recruiting visit, but just old friends paying respects kind of a thing. Idk that's what he thinks, he's pretty close with Curry and the team."
Honestly even though I hate the warriors I'm literally praying Dlo turns into another Stephen Curry and they just screw the league over together because everyone acts like Dlo is terrible.
"What he wanted, the bay couldn’t give him. And that’s to be seen as equal, if not superior, to Stephen Curry. It didn’t help that he signed non commital one and ones...you can’t get full commitment from the fans when you ain’t committed yourself.   KD was a hired gun. Nothing more. Next chapter."
"Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry, Russel Westbrook"
He gave Stephen Curry a bucket during a camp.  Relax fellas.  May I remind you that thon maker looked like Kevin Durant in high school.
Dude just think abt it this way.. Imagine if Harden averaged only 11 ppg for a fuckin playoff series.. What would happen to us? We'd get swept out of the building back to Houston  Klay has the luxury of shitting the bed and it not mattering due to his teammates being Stephen Curry and formerly Kevin Durant.
"Problem here is that we don't have any box score metrics that properly represent defensive value. Giannis was the best defender on the best defensive team in the NBA, and the best defensive team in Bucks franchise history (even better than the Kareem championship level teams). Is 36/7/7 inherently better than Giannis' production? It's fair to say no, and fair for voters to consider Giannis the MVP based not only on team success, but his ability to anchor an elite team on both ends of the floor in ways that go beyond what is captured in the box score. You can like how Harden plays and still acknowledge that Giannis had a historically great season that deserves to be recognized on the level of James Hardens.   Harden plays nothing like Stephen Curry and the Warriors would have to change their fundamental approach to basketball to accommodate James as a more ball dominant creator who is usually not active when not in control of an offense. I think Curry would be a monster in Houston where he'd have the greenlight to shoot 10 threes per game while being surrounded by good defenders and screen setters.  I get 2017. But I'm still not going to say Westbrook didn't deserve to win the award when I understand how voting works and the narrative that he rode entering the year. I don't place a lot of emphasis on MVP to begin with when ranking players anyway because I know the margins are slim and not necessarily indicative of best player."

Lmao yup it was all entirely Stephen Curry.
"I mean, it really doesn't work both ways. It mostly works one way.   I didn't expect you to just take the word of a random GS fan, which is why I gave you a highly respected, non-partisan source.     Again, please watch the video explaining it from Thinking Basketball:  &gt;How Curry makes it easy for Durant  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuP6-puSfRs&amp;feature=youtu.be  Here's Fivethirtyeight on it:  &gt;These days, we have much better data to help figure out whether a player makes his teammates better on offense. Curry does.2 Let’s take a look at what happens to teams’ shooting when their MVP candidate is off the floor (I’ll also add Durant so that you can see who’s really moving the needle in Oakland):  &gt;There are stories to be told in each section of that chart, but for our purposes, focus on the fire raining down from the sky in the Curry section. Not only do virtually all of his teammates (10 of 11 players with at least 30 shots, representing over 1,700 shots taken without him3) shoot worse without Curry on the court to draw attention, they shoot dramatically worse. Overall, Curry’s teammates shoot 7.3 percentage points worse with Curry off the court, with his average teammate4 shooting 8.3 points worse. Among our MVP candidates, LeBron has the next-highest impact on average teammate shooting (3.9 points), followed by Westbrook (2.5 points). When it comes to opening up a team’s offense, Curry has no equal  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/   Here's another one from fivethirtyeight:  &gt;The most important: It’s a safe bet that most of the key role players will shoot at least slightly worse without Curry in the picture — a majority of them have performed worse on offense in times when Curry’s been out and Durant’s been playing (compared with their performance when sharing the court with both Curry and Durant).  &gt;Durant’s offensive performance has also suffered when Curry isn’t playing. Despite being a top-three player in the world, Durant occasionally finds easy looks as a result of the fear that defenses have of Curry getting open along the arc. One indication of the boost Durant gets: Green has completed 16 alley-oops to him over the past two seasons — many of which were sprung while Curry was distracting defenses with fake backscreens. But those were all with Curry on the floor. Without Curry, Green hasn’t found Durant for a single lob during that time period, according to data from Second Spectrum and NBA Advanced Stats.  &gt;The high-octane club goes from scoring almost 122 points per 100 possessions with Curry and Durant to 108 when Durant plays without Curry.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-warriors-should-adjust-their-offense-without-steph-curry/   Ok, so we are at the point now where I've given you a bunch of evidence by respected, non-partisan sources.....and you've cited one instance of likely blown coverage by Kyrie.   So it is time to see whether you change your mind in the face of solid evidence and the lack of the same for your point, or if you do the common reddit thing of sticking your fingers in your ears and doubling-down in an attempt to try to save your ego.  Given that you went straight for attacking me, calling me delusional right from the beginning, i'm betting on your throwing a tantrum and doubling down."
he beat Lebron almost twice. he beat Stephen Curry now what.
&gt;Stephen Curry is the only player in NBA history to average 26 PTS + 6 ASTS in the Finals on the Winning team and not win Finals MVP. He’s done so three times.
"Only a couple players made me watch college basketball: Austin rivers, Blake griffin, Stephen curry, and John Wall."
Does stephen curry count? Since his full name is Wardell Stephen Curry II  and his dad's full name is Wardell Stephen Curry I.

4 game sample sizes heavily mess up net rating numbers. Let's actually look at 3 seasons worth of data instead: https://www.forbes.com/sites/andybailey/2019/05/12/stephen-curry-not-kevin-durant-is-the-golden-state-warriors-best-player/#4ad54f957b23  Pretty big difference if you ask me.
"Lebron James is 6’9 260 lbs and arguably the most physically gifted nba player of all time. Stephen Curry would die if he had to do what Lebron did, yeah. Doesn’t change the fact that a man who’s supposed to be in the GOAT convo shot 39% from the floor when he primarily shoots from the paint. The Cavs needed Lebron to even be in the series and without him they’d get swept. What does that have to do with the fact that the best player on the team who won had great numbers on better efficiency than Lebron while shooting primary outside shots? If you have an insane usage you’ll have big #s no surprise there. Why did Lebron James who I’m told is a top 2 player ever get pushed to game 7 against a team of role players who’s best player was 21 years old? At the same time Lebron swept the 1 seed raptors. Sometimes it’s about matchups and that Cavs teams scrappy defense and physicality matched up well against the inexperienced warriors of 2014-2015"

"1. 2008-09 LeBron James 2. 1990-91 Michael Jordan 3. 1985-86 Larry Bird 4. 1999-00 Shaquille O’Neal 5. 1993-94 Hakeem Olajuwon 6. 2015-16 Stephen Curry 7. 1989-90 Magic Johnson 8. 2013-14 Kevin Durant 9. 2003-04 Kevin Garnett  I selected Garnett because I wanted a more balanced player over someone like Wilt/Kareem. Garnett is a more capable distributor than them and his scoring is at worst not far off when you account for pace and minutes and era and I believe he was defensively superior peak for peak. He has the record for most wins added in a season which is a more modern version of winshares that includes the postseason.  He won MVP that season in a landslide and led an average supporting cast to the WCF where his best teammate by far got injured and they still took 2 off Shaq &amp; Kobe Lakers. I didn’t want to select Kobe because his offense and defense didn’t peak at the same time like Garnett (the Lakers were significantly better defensively without Kobe on the court in 2005-06). Garnett and Duncan were really close but I went with Garnett because he was slightly better statistically along with personal preference and also the fact I was representing Minnesota with the 9th pick.  It is also worth considering that PFs are much more valuables that centers and point guards in this due to the lack of depth at that position. This also explains why Bird and Durant may have gone higher than expected, because SF is relatively thin as well."
" [https://www.nbadraft.net/nba\_final\_draft/2018](https://www.nbadraft.net/nba_final_draft/2018)   &amp;#x200B;  look at the nba comparisons for Luka Doncic compared to the rest of the guys in the lottery for 2018. The mavs took a chance on a guy who was heavily stereotyped being from europe in his draft profile. And are now reaping the benefits. Trae Young drew a stephen curry comparison and went 5th overall. The mavs could have easily chosen Trae Young, but opted for Luka. People dont want to admit it, but as good as Steph Curry is, its the system the warriors have incorporated around him that makes him look better than he is. Curry was nowhere near the player he was in 2015 under steve kerr in 2013 and 2014 under mark jackson. And if you wanna say that mark jackson is a terrible coach, what do you think Kevin Mchale is( Harden finished 2nd in mvp voting under mchale in 2015), and was finally unleashed by dantoni in 2017. So we have seen Harden win 6th man of the year with scott brooks, make all-nba 1st team 2x under kevin mchale, and then peak with a superior coach in mike dantoni with 3 straight top 2 mvp finishes. So to me that shows me Hardens game is more portable than steph currys. And i think other gms believe the same"
"i'm mad?  &gt;If Dame or Lebron or KD or anyone else in the NBA had those stats you'd be jerking them off and no one would argue whether or not they should win FMVP  lmao u seem pretty upset.  &gt;Klay has Curry creating shots for him, Curry does not  someone didnt watch the series  klay didnt even primarily score off of curry creating for him. he was going berserk by himself. once again not respecting one of ur own players out of ur sheer delusional love for stephen curry. shame.  &gt;Not to mention Klay got to play with Curry spacing with him  weird how klay was still popping off when he was runnin the second unit without curry? that doesnt fit ur narrative tho, does it?  &gt;Curry had to play 2 and a half games with G-league spacing against a box-and-one defense.  no one gives a shit about your excuses for his performances, lol. all that matters is the outcome."
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-curry-is-the-revolution/
"&gt;  Yes he was probably very good defensively   lol no other defender even comes close to him. He's like a Stephen Curry-like outlier on that end.   Your comment is full of misinformation, what a shitty take. Have an upvote."
"Looking at this [injury history](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/stephen-curry-player-injuries) from Fox, which I'm not sure is accurate but I don't remember all his injuries off the top of my head, he's tweaked primarily his right ankle semi-often.   His two MCL sprains were freak accidents (wet spot in 2016, collision with Javale last year), so yep it's mainly on the ankles holding up but he hasn't injured them seriously (knock on wood) for a long time so I have faith."
Kevin Durant needs to replace Paul George and you have an unbeatable team of   Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant   Kawhi Leonard   LeBron James   Anthony Davis   This team has everything

"Which means you're predicting that Mitchell will have a better scoring season than Stephen Curry in 2017.  No need for insults. I've already PM'd the bot to alert me in February, after realizing 100 days is too short."
"&gt;The guy has literally no ego at all lol.  Then he'll be cool with sacrificing his volume and not averaging 26ppg.  &gt;Just because it would be historic and just because it would be a really elite stat line does not just automatically put it out of reach.  He's a completely different player than Curry, but in 2011, if you predicted curry to do even half of what he's done, you'd have been called an idiot. Curry is just the player you chose here, but players get doubted super hard and then come out as way better than they were given credit for all the time. Stop acting like that isn't a thing that happens lol. And in this particular instance, as I've said, getting to 25 ppg (or 26, cuz that's what dude actually said) Just isn't even that crazy of an improvement.  So now it's 25 ppg. Will you go to 24ppg next? I don't think Stephen Curry should be your benchmark for what Mitchell will accomplish as a scorer. You're basically saying that Mitchell will do so and so because it isn't outside of the realm of possibility for it to happen, which isn't how strong arguments are formed. Steph btw was hyper efficient from year 1. Injuries held him back more than anything else.  For Mitchell to average what you th  &gt;I have not defeated my own argument. I've just proved the tier Mitchell is in scoring wise and stopped you from being able to make dumb, lazily analyzed comments like 10+ year vet Mike Conley and 2 year vet Donovan mitchell are offensive peers relative to Mitchell's future.  You have. You gave me some players who scored more than Mitchell with better efficiency in year 2 and none of them would go on to increase their ppg averages with better surrounding talent. Mitchell is in their tier as a volume scorer, and his volume is about to decrease with Conley."
"Starting on December 20, 2018 Steve Kerr switched the warriors rotation and instead of Klay starting the quarter he had Draymond Green and Stephen Curry in that spot. The results were promising and the warriors kept this rotations for much of the rest of the season. Please refer back to your original comment stating that they would not play draymond and curry on the second unit and then delete it."

Though the defense might be questionable, the firepower more than makes up for it. Also, MELO is a far better play than McKinnie, who sucked so bad on the previous finals that his presence contributed to Raptors Ws."

"&gt;Whoever said Kobe was trash?  People who over-value efficiency in today's NBA climate. Not specifically you, but I do see a big overlap in the venn diagram of people who underrate Kobe, and people who underrate Melo. Similarly, AI, and even in today's game Westbrook.  &gt;Maybe inefficient, which you could make a case for  Blaming players from older eras for inefficiency is like blaming Johnny Unitas and Joe Namath for not having more passing yards. The game is so wildly different now, and the over-correction and emphasis on efficiency in the past ~7-10 years means players are actively playing differently than they did even just a decade ago.  &gt;Top 20 in league scoring? Really?  You're trying to shit on that? Let me list some people who are lower on that list: Miller, West, Ewing, Barkley, Wade, Baylor, Drexler, Gasol, Larry Bird (admittedly injuries, but they do have nearly equivalent PPG at 24.0 vs 24.3)  Being top 20 is actually incredibly impressive and you scoff at it lmao especially considering that most of the people above him scored those numbers in eras with a **higher** pace than the one Carmelo has played in~~~~  &gt;How can you be a Hall of Famer when you weren't a top 5 player in the league even once  Lmaooooooo my sides bro All-NBA does not mean top 5 in the league. Who was a better player in 2013-14:  Player | G | MPG | PPG | APG | RPG | SPG | BPG | Shooting ------|-|---|---|---|---|---|---|-------- Stephen Curry | 78 | 36.5 | 24.0 | 8.5 | 4.3 | 1.6 | 0.2 | .471/.424/.885 Joakim Noah | 80 | 35.3 | 12.6 | 5.4 | 11.3 | 1.2 | 1.5 | .475/.000/.737  Yeah, Noah made 1st Team, Steph made 2nd. Because it's not just the top 5 in the league, it's **best at position**. So sorry for Carmelo that he's had to compete with LeBron at that position, and a carousel of KG, Dirk, Duncan, and Durant also competing for that position. That's like blaming Joe Dumars for playing in a league with Jordan, Drexler, Magic, Isaiah, and Stockton. It's the same reason why people criticize LeBron's finals run: of course it's impressive but you 'only' have to be better than the people in front of you. The streak is absolutely impressive, but he only has to be better than the teams in the East. Similarly, Melo can be an all-time great player and still just not be as great as the 5 guaranteed Hall-of-Famers listed."

Ok let’s try this again harden couldn’t beat the warriors in 2013 with only one all star on the team. That all stars name is Stephen Curry. What’s the next excuse gonna be? Get creative
"Not rly because nobody is arguing he is Stephen Curry but in the context of being a center, being able to shoot almost/around 40% is great.(I expect him to shoot around 40% barring injury or having 3 starters missing for multiple months) There are just a few centers that are able to shoot better then that. Whatever its fine, trying to predict shooting percentages for young players is a crap shoot anyways."
"first of all im not the guy from the first post.  Anyways the season before his 39,6% was basicly the year he became a starter and overtook Nurkic. Yeah, he was a worse 3pt shooter that season and improved afterwards, then he got his finger injured and also we had 3 starters missing for a huge portion of the season which led him to take a lot of bad shots and his shooting fell off. playoffs came and for 14 games he shot almost 40% again.  Nobody is saying he is Stephen Curry but he is up there with the best shooting centers in the league atm."
"Putting like that, then I can see it for sure. But then I would take Kyrie Irving over Stephen Curry in that case. But Curry is a clearly better player."
"Just scrolled through your post history. Literally 90% of your comments are anti-Lebron lmao.

Lebron “Stephen ‘Skyfucker’ Curry” James
"Let me elaborate more on that first situation since you don't seem to want to. All-Star Kevin Durant (HOF) joined forces with a team led by the first unanimous MVP in history, Stephen Curry (HOF), who along with Klay Thompson (HOF) make up the best backcourt we've ever seen. All-Star Draymond Green (Debatable HOF) is also here. He tucked his tail between his legs and ran to the very team that he and Russ choked away a 3-1 lead to in the conference finals. LeBron and Bosh made a playoff team into a contending team. KD made a contending team unstoppable."
"I don't understand the downvotes. Lebron is clearly a better player and has had a better career than KD at this point. One is in the GOAT conversation and the other likely never would have been. Just not a complete enough game most of his career. Although if he stayed healthy and could win a ring somewhere else he certainly rises significantly.   So no disrespect to Lebron. But it is fair to say beating Stephen Curry (22 PPG 2016 finals) is just not the same as beating Kevin Durant. What team won a championship who's best player was not 6'6+ and athletic. In 2012 Heat were a better more experienced team. Hence a ""competitive"" 4-1. In 2017 &amp; 2018 Warriors were super stacked and Cavs had no chance. Hence a truly uncompetitive 8-1.   We never saw these guys with evenly matched All-Star teams. There are no 'equals' to Lebron at his peak similar to how there weren't equals to Jordan in his time. But KD is probably the only person in the NBA talented enough over the last 7 year to challenge that assumption without having more help than Lebron. Lebron knew KD was likely going to remain his primary challenger from 2012 on, but they didn't meet again until the odds were stacked for KD. So we never got to see a peak Kobe vs peak Lebron. We did get a peak KD vs peak Lebron but it wasn't the competitive series everyone would've liked to have seen."
That boy’s name? Stephen Curry
"Inflated is not the right word for it. Some similarities to the 87 finals in terms of high scoring.   Not even playoff career highs for Lebron (2017 vs raptors). Typical numbers for him ie. 2012 vs celtics similar FGA. 2018 Lebrons finals numbers were similar despite getting swept and having a broken hand, neither series as high scoring as 2017 finals.  Perhaps Lebron's numbers from 2015 were either 'inflated' or 'deflated' (efficiency) due to the additional scoring burden being on him but 2017 finals seems right in line. Lebron in the 2018 'carry job' put up similar numbers to 2017 finals throughout the postseason in 2018.    Kyrie's numbers were inflated because he took a couple more shots than 2016 on similar efficiency, same with Loves. Curry took fewer shots in 2017 than he did in 2018 which was a lower scoring series. In fact Curry just put up career highs in 2019 on fewer attempts than the previous year. Overall not much of a case for inflated stats all around.   Which leads me to suspect your whole idea of inflated numbers is we should search for some reason to discredit Kevin Durant's career highs from the 2017 finals. He took about one more shot per game than he did in 2012 or later in 2018, so I would say most of the reason for the better performance from KD was due not in fact to it being a high scoring affair and more to do with spacing due to playing with superior teammates namely, one Stephen Curry. Yes, there were several highlight open dunks for KD, I saw them. At the time people were critical, mainly being upset that KD had joined and ruined the NBA. But to be fair if KD had stayed healthy this year I think it would've been a totally different pace in this year's finals but I think in fact he would've put up similar numbers to 2017, maybe even better. So yeah, I think it's clear that either super team from 2017 would've easily dispatched this year's champs and the Warriors almost swept in 2017 .... which is ridiculous to think about.   TLDR: Warriors team was too OP. Cavs took and made a fuck ton of 3s. A lot of offensive talent  = harder to defend &amp; naturally easier for both stars and role players. This, in turn, led to higher-scoring game.  But stars don't depend on 'easier' shots to get theirs in the postseason and often put up career numbers when they have less help (Curry 2019, Lebron 2015). Finally, Durant was amazing in 2017. It would've been great to see Durant truly chuck, efficiency be damned. Then I would've believed his numbers were ""inflated"", while nonetheless awesome."

You make nephews look like Stephen Curry Hawkins
Stephen curry is 10x the player Lowry could hope to be.
Stephen Curry has never beaten Kyle Lowry in a playoff series.
Well Stephen Curry changed the game as far as the 3 point shot so if your offense is revolves around the 3 then it would make sense to revolve around Steph. However Kevin Durant is included in some of the most unguardable players of all time -LeBron -Kareem -Giannis  -Sometimes Jordan  If you were picking an All Star team Kevin Durant would surely be over Steph and I think in Brooklyn he’ll prove that he can lead a franchise or at least be the centerpiece of it.

"This is plain and simple a dumb take. With the Warriors without KD, without Iguodala, without Klay for most of the season, anything that isn't a top seed will be mediocrity?   Most talking heads are saying the Warriors will maybe just barely make the playoffs as a 7/8 seed, I've heard guys like Ethan Strauss pick the under on their 47 win projection, so if the Warriors are a top 4 seed and Curry has a 2016 type season he will absolutely have a **GOOD** shot at MVP.   The narrative is there for him. People were saying he wasn't even the best player on his team, some said the Warriors wouldn't have even made the finals if KD didn't sign (which is stupid but whatever).   You know who Vegas has as the favorite to win MVP next season? Giannis. You know who they have as the 2nd most likely? Stephen Curry.   Don't sleep on Curry."

Stephen Curry is the best shooter ever.  No idea how anyone can disagree with that.
Breaking news: Stephen Curry is good at basketball.
"magic johnson has had stacked finals teams with kareem yet he was able to rise above and be the best player on the team in the big moment.   see: 1987 finals.   stephen curry has never done that. his efficiency took a hit and he didn't win a finals MVP in 2015, he scored an inefficient 17 points in g7 in 2016, he was outplayed by kevin durant in 2017 and 2018, and he was disappointing for most of the 2018 NBA finals.  i really hope you're not gonna try and compare magic and steph's finals resumes"
"Stephen Curry. I still have nightmares from that Game 3 final shot, the 13 three pointers, and the game in the 2015-2016 where he scored like 50 points against us in the 3rd game of the season."
Ok this is just wrong lmao.   Stephen Curry is a monster handling the basketball and his two handed attack is ridiculous. No one can really stay in front of him because he can use his handles to quickly get around defenders. He even makes premier defenders (like Chris Paul) look like child’s play.   His in and out dribble and behind the back dribble always get defenders leaning. Then he either snatches back or blows by the opponent. Curry is deceptively quick  and after he blows by his opponents it always looks like he is trotting to the rim. Curry is the first player that has put deadly handles and deadly shooting together.   The best part about Curry is he is the ultimate play maker when he is dribbling it is not for selfish reasons. You can find Curry dishing a behind the back pass to a wide open shooter or setting up someone for a lob dunk. Out of all three he made the most plays for his teammates using his dribbling that’s why he hoisted the Larry O’Brien Trophy. It Is one thing to have handles but another thing to know what to do with it and Curry has both.
His name is Stephen Curry
*Stephen Curry has left the chat*
Stephen Curry is a good basketball player

"I just want to take this moment so say I can’t watch First Tale because of how shit Max Kellerman is. He has dogshit takes and then tries to defend those dogshit takes by making the argument have to fit to his biasedly fit guidelines that flip flop back and forth based on his position. For example when he calls Kylie the most skilled player ever and his way to define it is ball handling, finishing below the rim, and shooting. Like fuck passing, apparently defense isn’t a skill, and somehow even though Curry is shorter and less athletic and BY FAR the better player let’s just say Kyrie is more skilled. Just an example of how shit Max Kellerman is I love Stephen A. but Max Kellerman is too annoying Idgaf if he is playing a character the character is shit"
"This guy's articles are full of diamonds.  &gt;Nobody Who They Draft at No. 7 Will Be Desperately Needed  &gt; 6 - Andre Drummond, C - It would be nice to grab him as an insurance policy if Bogut gets hurt again, but that's exactly what Drummond will be if the Warriors draft him—an insurance policy.  &gt; 11 - Damian Lillard, PG - The Warriors will need a point guard to back up Stephen Curry if they do not feel that Charles Jenkins is ready for the task.   &gt;My point is that nobody who they draft seventh overall will make a dramatic impact on the team."
"Klay's not a superstar, he's an all star but he isn't at the same level as guys like James Harden, Anthony Davis, Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Giannis, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic. He's an all star like Jimmy Butler and the like."
" Top 3: Lonzo’s dad, Kawhi’s uncle, and Stephen curry"
"Stephen Curry, James Harden, Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, and Anthony Davis from the show Game of Zones."
"As a kid from the 90s living in Germany, I used to watch Shaq and Hakeem early morning. Never was the biggest fan of MJ, because he was too overpowered. Then I did a long break and started to watch again during the Playoffs 2016 as a LeBron and Cavs fan. To make it fair, I will grant every position two slots, so my list is gonna be a bit special:  PG: John Stockton, Stephen Curry   SG: Michael Jordan, Klay Thompson SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant   PF: Shawn Kemp, Anthony Davis   C: Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O'Neal    There were so many legendary players, it is just insane in what amazing time we live. With all the trades this summer, the next couple of seasons will be dope. Let's simply enjoy this sport!"
In order:  1. LeBron James 2. Kobe Bryant (tie) 2. Shaquille O’ Neal (tie) 4. Tim Duncan 5. Kevin Durant 6. Dwyane Wade  7. Dirk Nowitzki (tie) 7. Stephen Curry (tie) 9. Kawhi Leonard   10. Kevin Garnett (tie) 10. Giannis Antetokounmpo (tie)*  *Yeah I know that’s 11 but w/e js stfu bout it lol

Stephen Curry. He is always being disrespected.
"Sure but never to this extent. Do you remember the 2010 FIBA team USA roster? Wasn't the A-list stars but a bunch of the up-and-coming guys like Kevin Love, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Eric Gordon, Derrick Rose, and Russel Westbrook were on that team and they were a blast to watch."

Well he’s no Stephen Curry
"If we are gonna ignore the stats in those first two games of the Clippers series, should we also ignore the game Kawhi was sick against the Magic in Game 3? Either way their numbers would look better.  There’s a difference between having Lowry and Danny Green and having Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry. Kawhi had spacing but he still faced way more defensive pressure because Lowry and Green aren’t the two best shooters in history. Also since they were slumping for a lot of the postseason until the Bucks series, where neither of them were injured.   The Spurs were 25th in three point attempts, they weren’t the best shooting team in the league."
lebron hates him and uses his illuminati connections to practice black magick aimed at cursing Stephen Curry.
It's an $1billion over 8 years uniform deal. So yes. Some players circumvent this by rolling their socks to cover the logos.

Wardell Stephen Curry II
"I know this is a stupid question but I wonder what NBA superstars spend their money on, or what they do with it.  35M salary is probably [17M take home](https://www.businessinsider.sg/stephen-curry-salary-taxes-nba-2017-9/). If someone was consistently giving you 25M per year (endorsements?) in cash, and you already have a home, and you work FT (no ""vacation"" days like regular people, assuming you make/appear at the ASG) from beginning of October (camp) to end-ish of April. Obviously people have expenses, but where does the other 18M go? Even a modest investment strategy with no PE could generate ~1m extra per year."

Shoutout to the Stephen Curry Surfin' Bobblehead
"Right, but that's not a great stat to prove Drummond is more than a rebounder. I'm guessing you're just using it for Mitchell's name.   Mitchell's ts% was not good, it's different circumstances in playing style and responsibility, and ts% favors bigs. Or at least players who get their buckets at the rim. Or the preposterously efficient 3pt shooters (Steph, Harden, KD), who usually also manage to shoot a decent amount of FTs. Or in Steph's case, evidently someone who can't miss from anywhere. But there's a reason why the top 10 in ts% last season were all bigs, Joe Harris, Stephen Curry, and Giannis (who might as well be classified as a big with his scoring style). AKA Steph Curry and the guy who had one of the most efficient 3pt shooting seasons in NBA history (28th in percentage all time and only 2 of those seasons above him were 2010+, ie likely on a lot fewer attempts are the players above him).   Just look at the [ts% career wise](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ts_pct_career.html). It's all great 3pt shooters or bigs. And Dantley. And Kawhi. Who I didn't realize was that efficient for his career. wtf  Using ts% for Drummond with a comparison to Mitchell is like arguing Booker takes care of the ball because he had fewer turnovers than James Harden."
"Giannis won last year. Winning back to back MVPs doesn’t happen often. Moses Malone. Larry Bird. Magic Johnson. Michael Jordan. Steve Nash. LeBron James. (x2). Stephen Curry.   There’s going to be one team in the West that overachieves without a pair of stars. And I think their leading man will get the MVP. Mitchell. Curry. Dame. Jokic. Holiday. (Hield? Doncic?) Hell, if Booker drags the Suns to like 35-40 wins, I’d be willing to give it to him."
"A lot less than 2014, I'll tell you what.  &gt; Curry, Stephen &gt; Thompson, Klay &gt; Rose, Derrick &gt; Faried, Kenneth &gt; Gay, Rudy &gt; DeRozan, DeMar &gt; Irving, Kyrie &gt; Plumlee, Mason &gt; Cousins, DeMarcus &gt; Harden, James &gt; Davis, Anthony &gt; Drummond, Andre"
Underrated. I would rather have Stephen Curry than a lot of players in the league. A franchise superstar that you rarely see. Last week he was overrated though.
Reminds me of the time Kent Bazemore and Stephen Curry combined for 54 points in the Garden
James Harden is a better basketball player than Stephen Curry.
I'm not sure theres anyone in the NBA I would feel less threatened by then stephen curry
Hes not GOAT but hes in Top 5 all time   Jordan   Stephen Curry   Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant   Shaq

"I'd watch this as a series with Kobe issuing commentary as the snake to a handful of players every week, challenging them for their next matchup.   Ex: ""James, you've shown us that you can score like the best of us. But can you guard the three-point barrage of Stephen Curry?"""

"Stephen Curry?? Surprised he isn’t mentioned yet. Before KD’s arrival, I’d argue Steph was one of the most demoralizing players ever. Whether it’s him getting to the line in touch fouls.. or being unstoppable no matter what defense was played. Peep the faces on the OKC bench in that near half court game winner"

"He's 23 and has played four seasons in this league. Go look at Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry, Kemba, etc.   Look at how they improve over their early years, how their stats go up, how they go from youngsters with potential to bonafide stars. D'Lo is showing that same trajectory.   Players are not as good as they'll ever be at 22 and 23. Most players don't truly start to maximize their skills and knowledge until they hit 25/26. That is true of Kyrie, of Steph, of Kemba, James Harden, etc.   This is something we always need to keep in mind when trying to evaluate young players like D'Lo, or Jayson Tatum or Donovan Mitchell, etc."

"[Regardless, it’s a shame. I’ve been fortunate enough to meet President Reagan, both Bushes, Clinton, and Obama. I didn’t agree with all of them, but it was easy to set politics aside because each possessed an inherent respect for the office, as well as the humility that comes with being a public servant in an incredible position of power, representing 300 million people. And that’s the problem now. In his tweet to Steph, Trump talked about honoring the White House but, really, isn’t it you who must honor the White House, Mr. President? And the way to do that is through compassion and dignity and being above the fray. Not causing the fray.  Would we have gone? Probably not. The truth is we all struggled with the idea of spending time with a man who has offended us with his words and actions time and again. But I can tell you one thing: it wouldn’t have been for the traditional ceremony, to shake hands and smile for cameras. Internally, we’d discussed whether it’d be possible to just go and meet as private citizens and have a serious, poignant discussion about some of the issues we’re concerned about. But he’s made it hard for any of us to actually enter the White House, because what’s going on is not normal. It’s childish stuff: belittling people and calling them names. So to expect to go in and have a civil, serious discourse? Yeah, that’s probably not going to happen.](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/09/24/steve-kerr-warriors-donald-trump-white-house-stephen-curry)  Again, he's either incredibly misinformed on the legacies of those presidents or he cares more about civility than policy. Bush definitely didn't ""respect the integrity"" of the office, his administration repeatedly attempted to transition the position into the ""unitary executive""."
"A bubble to assume a 76ers fan in an NB**A** subreddit populated mostly by Americans talking about American politics is living in a bubble? They aren't stripping anyone's rights in America.

You say 'happy to sit back and watch that happen' as if I haven't specifically talked about fixing the situation. Like I ask everyone, what's your grand idea to fix the situation if it's so simple and doesn't take a long time considering we have all of history to look at to understand how difficult situations like this are? I'll wait, please tell. Let me know how LeBron, Stephen Curry, Steve Kerr, and Silver are going to end human rights violations being done by a 1.2 billion population nation lead by an authoritarian government with incredible economic power. I really want to know since according to you everyone is just sitting back and watching until we do... and again, I wanna hear your answer on this. Don't dodge it, I won't reply to any more messages until you tell me even an idea on how to fix it."
Stephen Curry is my pick!
"SHANGHAI — The Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets tipped off on Thursday night in Shanghai in, undoubtedly, the most geopolitically important exhibition game in N.B.A. history. Yezi Zhang, a college student, was there, too, and her emotions were decidedly mixed.  Ms. Zhang, a 24-year-old from the city of Hangzhou, was among a few thousand Chinese fans who showed up at the Mercedes-Benz Arena despite the N.B.A.’s clash with the Chinese government. Beijing officials have put growing pressure on the N.B.A. to apologize after an executive at the Houston Rockets tweeted his support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The N.B.A., citing free speech, has said the executive won’t be punished.  If the league doesn’t fully apologize, Ms. Zhang said, then she and the league might be over.  “At first I was quite happy about the game, but then after the recent issue I started feeling quite awkward,” she said, adding that she dare not post images of the game online for fear of disapproval from friends.  “It’s O.K. to chase the star players,” she said, “but we shouldn’t do it at the cost of the dignity of the motherland.”  The game on Thursday could represent the beginning of a thaw between the league and a country that accounts for a huge number of its fans. Patriotic vitriol against the N.B.A. appeared to subside online in China late on Thursday before the game began. Still, it was not clear how long it might take for China and the N.B.A. to fully resume their decades-long embrace.  Basketball once united China and the United States, the world’s two largest economies, offering perhaps the most visual symbol of bonds so deeply intertwined that some big thinkers have referred to the two as “Chimerica.” Now it threatens to drive them apart.  Image Mr. James, center, in a gray T-shirt, leaving his hotel for an N.B.A. game in Shanghai on Thursday. Mr. James, center, in a gray T-shirt, leaving his hotel for an N.B.A. game in Shanghai on Thursday.CreditHector Retamal/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Or as China’s jokers say online, referencing the first attempts at diplomacy between Mao Zedong and Richard Nixon in 1971, “China-U.S. relations began with ping-pong, and they’ve ended with basketball.”  China has demanded that the league make amends. An American backlash prompted Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, to defend the right of the league’s athletes and officials to say what they like.  HONG KONG’S PROTESTSHow the demands of demonstrators have broadened. Chinese companies are now suspending their sponsorships. The Chinese state media is blocking exhibition games. And China’s millions of N.B.A. fans are caught in the middle.  Severing that bond — built over decades of cultivation by an American sports league that long ago saw promise in a growing, prosperous China — won’t be easy. But if pushed, many fans said, they will sever it for the sake of loyalty.  “This year I think the Lakers have a good chance to win it all,” said Lin Wenwen, a 21-year-old student and longtime Lakers fan who was crushed by the cancellation of the team’s open practice on Wednesday because she could not afford a ticket to the game. “This was a great chance to see them. It’s a shame.”  Still, when asked who was to blame, she thought for a moment and said, “The young losers in Hong Kong.”  The game on Thursday kicked off in an arena where plenty of seats still stood empty. The usually prolific array of advertisements were absent from the stands and rafters. People outside the arena waved small Chinese flags. On one popular basketball forum, funds were being raised Thursday to buy 10,000 national flags to bring to the game.  Many Chinese N.B.A. fans said the choice was an easy one. Support for the protesters in Hong Kong, they say, constitutes foreign meddling in Chinese affairs. Thanks in part to China’s propaganda arms, many also mistakenly believe the pro-democracy protesters are broadly calling for full independence from the mainland. (Some are, but independence is not among their official demands.) Many see that as a direct assault on Chinese identity.  Mr. Mao, a 23-year-old law student, is such a big fan that he spent hours on Wednesday in front of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Shanghai, hoping to meet LeBron James at a fan event. He also plans to fly about 900 miles to the city of Shenzhen on Saturday for a Lakers-Nets exhibition rematch.  But he equated support for the Hong Kong protesters with racism, echoing a common point in the state media, and said that patriotism comes before fandom. He questioned the difference between the N.B.A.’s support of free speech and the lifetime ban the league put on Donald Sterling, the former owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, in 2014 for his racist comments.  Image Fans waiting outside the Shanghai hotel where the Los Angeles Lakers players were staying. Fans waiting outside the Shanghai hotel where the Los Angeles Lakers players were staying.CreditHector Retamal/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images “It’s a double standard,” said Mr. Mao, adding that “the issue of sovereignty is as serious as the issue of racism.”  Basketball’s roots in China go way back. Christian missionaries introduced the game in the late 19th century. Mao tolerated it when other Western entertainments were discouraged. In 1979, after Mao’s death led to China’s opening up to the world, the Washington Bullets became the first N.B.A. team to play in China when they came to Beijing for a pair of friendly games with the Chinese Army.  The N.B.A. sensed an opening. In 1985, the Chinese national team toured the United States at the invitation of the N.B.A. commissioner David Stern for what later became known as the N.B.A.-China Friendship Tour. Then in 1990, the league struck its first big revenue sharing deal with China Central Television, China’s state broadcaster, to air N.B.A. games in China — just in time for Michael Jordan’s first championship run with the Chicago Bulls.  A love affair was born, making the N.B.A. one of the first American brands to win a following across China. A generation of Chinese fans grew up crowding around dusty desktop monitors in college dorm rooms to watch fuzzy streams of N.B.A. games. When Yao Ming was drafted by the Rockets in 2002, it seemed to many in China like the completion, not the beginning, of their hoop dreams.  N.B.A. stars suddenly won millions of new followers — and sometimes awkward nicknames. LeBron James was “The Little Emperor.” Michael Jordan was the “Gang Boss.” Shaquille O’Neal, the hulking 7-foot-1 center, was “The Giant Shark,” though the historian Nick Kapur noted he became “O’Fat” after he began to put on the pounds.  Rong Qiang, 40, cut school to watch N.B.A. games in the 1980s and remains loyal to Mr. Jordan and the Bulls. “Their moves were just unbelievable,” he recalled nostalgically.  Mr. Rong was one of the few shoppers perusing the normally bustling flagship N.B.A. store in Beijing’s central shopping district, the league’s largest outside North America. Idle workers adjusted displays of jerseys, shoes and memorabilia. At one entrance, life-size bobbleheads of Stephen Curry and Kobe Bryant clutching Chinese flags greeted would-be shoppers.  Despite his decades-long love of the league, Mr. Rong, a clothing merchandiser, said he was prepared to withdraw his support. He was hopeful that the fervor would eventually die down, as it did after previous flare-ups between China and Japan.  Still, he said, China seemed to be in a new era in which nationalistic sentiment had become the norm.  “Everyone is feeling very patriotic,” he said.  “And we still have the C.B.A.,” he added, referring to the Chinese Basketball Association. “Though of course they’re not as good.”  Some N.B.A. fans said the game would still find love in China.  “A complete ban would never work,” said Liu Zhe, a 29-year-old Kobe Bryant superfan who himself goes by the name Kobe. A resident of the northeastern city of Harbin, he made headlines last year when he unknowingly bought the former Lakers star’s stolen high school jersey. (He later returned it.) “If they can’t hold the games in China, fans can still travel abroad and jump over the Great Firewall to watch them.”  On Thursday afternoon, Wu Shengjie, 22, came with a group of friends to play at the outdoor basketball courts in Dongdan in the heart of Beijing, China’s rough equivalent to New York’s Rucker Park.  Image The N.B.A. flagship retail store in Beijing on Wednesday.  The N.B.A. flagship retail store in Beijing on Wednesday. CreditKevin Frayer/Getty Images Chinese hip-hop blared over loudspeakers. Giant Nike posters of Yi Jianlian, a former N.B.A. player who now plays in China, loomed over the courts.  “They really hurt the hearts of the Chinese people,” Mr. Wu said dejectedly as he watched from the sidelines while his friends played a pickup game.  “The incident happened so suddenly, I can’t understand it,” said Mr. Wu, an electrical engineering major who has been playing basketball since the age of 7. “Now, my heart is very lost.”"

" Why Steph is  a spineless bitch.   “It’s a fine line but it’s about how we’re operating,” Curry added, “how inclusive we are, what we stand for. He’s the President. There are going to be people that are tied to them. But are we promoting change? Are we doing things that are going to look out for everybody? And not being so self-serving that it’s only about making money, selling shoes, doing this and that. That’s not the priority. It;s about changing lives. I think we can continue to do that.”  Curry is more concerned that the company adopts some of Trump's values. He noted that “there is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off if it wasn’t in line with who I am.”   [https://www.si.com/nba/2017/02/08/stephen-curry-donald-trump-under-armour-kevin-plank-supports](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/02/08/stephen-curry-donald-trump-under-armour-kevin-plank-supports)"
"From his comments about Trump  “It’s a fine line but it’s about how we’re operating,” Curry said, “how inclusive we are, what we stand for. He’s the President. There are going to be people that are tied to them. But are we promoting change? Are we doing things that are going to look out for everybody? And not being so self-serving that it’s only about making money, selling shoes, doing this and that. That’s not the priority. It’s about changing lives. I think we can continue to do that.”  Shoes belonging to Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry (30) wait to be used during media availability before practice at Rice University in Houston, Texas., on Sunday, May 24, 2015. (Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group)   But would Curry really leave Under Armour, the company that helped launch his empire, if he didn’t like the direction of the company?  “If there is a situation where I can look at myself in the mirror and say they don’t have my best intentions, they don’t have the right attitude about taking care of people,” Curry said. “If I can say the leadership is not in line with my core values, then there is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off if it wasn’t in line with who I am. So that’s a decision I will make every single day when I wake up. If something is not in line with what I’m about, then, yeah, I definitely need to take a stance in that respect.”  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mercurynews.com/2017/02/08/stephen-curry-respond-to-trump-love-from-under-amours-ceo/amp/"

"I do find fault in protestors vandalizing buildings, setting places on fire, [beating up other citizens who are against their cause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=83&amp;v=HpSHYa-wKPQ) and inciting fights with armed police officers even when not provoked themselves.  I'm saying this isn't a black and white issue and by saying you stand with Hong Kong with no nuance, you're also saying you stand by the use of violence in the protests that are more so harming everyday citizens than the chinese government.  Now imagine Stephen Curry coming out and saying he stands with Hong Kong in support of their actions 100%, and that encouraging even further violence. Again, he needs to be nuanced in his response."
So you’re assuming that Stephen Curry doesn’t support free speech?
"Needing to be tall is to succeed at basketball is such a cop out.

"Anyone who regularly uses their platform to promote civil rights, has security in the league, and is knowledgeable enough to have an opinion on it and still isn't talking is a coward.

"&gt;Last season, per Second Spectrum data, Adams ranked third in the league in total boxouts (713) and eighth in defensive boxouts (491), but 58th in defensive rebounds per game ([Stephen Curry](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry) averaged more). Westbrook had 46 total boxouts last season yet pulled in 47 more total rebounds than Adams. Some of it was by design (it helped the Thunder play faster), some of it was just the nature in which Westbrook plays, some of it probably had at least a little something to do with round numbers and historical significance"

And the NBA is in the USA, respected high ranking people like Greg Popovich, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Steve Kerr, etc regularly call out Trump or the US government when they feel there is something wrong with the policies."
"Stephen Curry, Ben Simmons, prime Derrick Rose. Shoots like Steph, slashes like Rose, big like ~~Klay~~ Simmons. A 6'10"" Curry with the same shot and release time is literally unguardable, as is someone that size who can slash and get into the paint like Rose could."
Rockets fans need to let Fertitta know that Stephen Curry is the legitimate owner of the Houston Rockets.
Why say contender?  Just say the Warriors.  Stephen Curry is not going anywhere and he will definitely not lower himself to the bench of a different team even at 40 years old.
Choke. Allow Stephen Curry to score 33 points in a half after going scoreless in the first. Choke is choke
Stephen Curry for cancer type numbers
"While he didn't win, Stephen Curry was 5th in MIP voting - including 7 first-place votes - in 2015-2016...the year after he won his first MVP."
"I don't like to overeact, but is Hettsheimeir already a better 3-pt shooter than Stephen Curry?"
"In 18/19 Gallo finished in the:  -90th percentile or better in PPP as the PnR ball handler, the PnR roll man, on post-ups, spot-ups, off-screeens, and misc, all on large sample sizes except for misc. -82.4th percentile in transition -78th on cuts -69th in isolation.  -2nd in the league overall in PPP (min 1,000 possessions).  -1st in the NBA in PPP on post-ups with any sample size (87 qualified players).  -FTr was .459.  -offensive rating of 125 (5th in the league) -WS/48 of .191,  -63.3% TS% on a usage of 23.8%  You lied about TJ Warren by the way (58 TS%, not 69%, which is a HUGE difference), and even so he still can't do half the things Gallo can do for you, and to just say ""he can shoot"" is neglecting at least 3 other objectively elite skills he possesses.  Also in regard to Warren being able to shoot ""just as good if not better"", Gallo in 18/19 produced: -Only 1 of 2 players (Stephen Curry was the other) that ranked in the top 5 in both 3-point percentage (43.3 percent -5th) and free throw percentage (90.4 percent – 4th) -shot 44-for-45 (98 percent) on clutch free throws, the best mark among players who attempted at least 25 -10th in Points Above Expected on 3s (91.1 total, 391.9 expected, 483 actual) -5th in Points Added Per 100 3-point shots (24.5 above average) -5th in  Defense Adjusted 3P% (43.7%) -51.9% of his 156 wide open triples (no defender within six feet) in 2018-19  and all on a higher usage and more attempts than Warren.

"Warriors had their worse offense in years precisely due to the high volume of midrange shots from Klay and KD. In fact I talked about this multiple times throughout the year and you see articles like this:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.goldenstateofmind.com/platform/amp/2018/10/24/18010476/nba-2018-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-three-point-attempts-kevin-durant-klay-thompson  popping up throughout the year.  You make a fool of yourself by citing the Spurs 3 pt %. They also had the *lowest* attempt rate in the league at 25.3 attempts a game. Most teams in the NBA shoot at similar % while 1.5x the volume. The reason they had the 6th best offense rating is precisely because they didn't waste many possessions like I mentioned and transition efficiency, not due to some magical midrange dominance. In fact, your statement would be countered by every trend observed by analysts for years. The Rockets had top 10 offense for years simply due to cutting off the midrange to take drives or 3 pt shots, and resorting to other tactics than a midrange if possible."
LeBron James  Michael Jordan  Stephen Curry  James Harden  Kevin Durant
"Did you read the article itself? I thought his explanation for the Warriors was fair. He even said ""If Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson are all healthy, Golden State is a Tier 1 contender."" Maybe he should've had another tier between strongish playoff team and borderline playoff team, but he also did mention that ""This is the biggest tier in the history of this column. If anything, it could be bigger"" meaning it is a wide range.   I wouldn't say with certainty that Steph + D'Lo + Draymond with the rest of their team will put together a regular season to be a strongish playoff team in the west, so I think their placement is fair."
"I can't understand how everybody is sleeping on the Warriors this year. Alright, they're a much worse team this year but last year with Curry and no Durant on the court the team had a 70+ win rating. A team with Russell, Green, Curry and Thompson(only in Playoffs) has to be a top title contender for sure. Maybe Im little biased but a team with Don Stephen Curry, the most impactful player in the NBA today, is a contender.  Im really waiting for the season to start and see how this team prove ESPN wrong"
Bigger Stephen Curry
"what about the ending of the game KD went down in. if i recall correctly, the Warriors were down that game too.   i guess what i'm trying to say is even though the Warriors were below average defensively, Stephen Curry is the greatest offensive force the NBA has seen (which the numbers **prove**) that it doesnt matter what their woes are as long as he's on the court. granted, if it's only him and a bunch of g leaguers, and the opposition can run a gimmick defense (see the box and one), then he can be slowed down. and that slowing down was still averaging over 30 for the series"
"Im not arguing that Steph is better than Lebron. As an individual player Lebron in better. Stephen Curry makes his team better thats the difference. His ability to play off the ball and not constantly have to iso to get ""his"" separates him. He can play as the #1 option or the #2 option seamlessly in order to help the team win. Klay and Kd both had better efficiency numbers playing next to Steph because of his impact on offense."
It’s because Stephen Curry and Steve Kerr have the same name 🤣

&gt;Women and children are worse shooters because you need an amount of strength to shoot and many of them don't have that minimum to shoot from any kind of range.  This is honest to god one of the most hilarious sentences ever uttered.  Stephen Curry is ridiculously strong. Why does he shoot so well?  How do strong big guys miss short if they can't moderate their strength down?
"Steve Curry vs Stephen Kerr, who wins?"
"I said you'd be a max player, not Stephen Curry, a MVP caliber player.  Shooting is a pretty valuable asset in basketball, even if you don't really know anything else to do. Especially if you do it as well as Curry does."
"At 0:56 - oh, there's Curry!  Oops, that's the other Wardell Stephen Curry..."
"&gt; nowhere close defensively to most of the list.   Yes, but good enough to be part of a great defensive team.  &gt; Obv the best shooter. How much of that is created by Klay/other shooters around him? Should that detract? idk   I always thought it was the other way. Klay is so good because Curry attracts so much attention.   &gt; Not sure how his game translates to the 80s and 90s. And who knows what those other guys would do if they spent their time practicing 3s instead of driving and taking full-contact layups.  That's the thing with Curry. He benefited from the hand checking rule for sure. But he was so good that he transformed the game. He won a championship with an offense centered around 3-point shooting. Something everybody thought was a bad idea before that. Mike D'Antoni was right but it took Stephen Curry to prove it. That's what puts him above the others. The really great players change the game around them. They don't adapt to their environment. Magic gave life to a whole generation of big guards. Jordan made athleticism the best asset in guard play above shooting. Curry changed the offensive game of the whole league."

"PM stats attempt to isolate individual impact but it doesn’t do a great job of it. It’s largely based off of point differentials + luck adjusted on-off ratings.   “Line ups with draymond, Klay, and Durant were a lot better defensively with curry than without”  Draymond and Stephen Curry share the floor on 88% of their minutes together due to Curry’s being a weak defender. Curry always plays with a variation of starters due to his defense and offense (Draymond finds him off-ball). Curry isn’t good defensively in any aspect. He doesn’t have a paint presence and he’s not ego of on-ball."
"A while back, I made a comment on this sub about John Stockton being vastly underrated and a comparable player in terms of greatness to Stephen Curry.  I was immediately downvoted and ridiculed.  It's hard to compare eras, but I still stand by my argument."

"So, a longer stephen curry.  Got it."
"Kyrie Irving, especially as a point guard. In my opinion, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, John Wall, and Damian Lillard have each been better PGs than him. Wall and Chris Paul drop off lately, because Wall is out and Chris Paul is older. Kyrie was routinely among the ranks of top 5 point guards anyway, even before Lebron returned to Cleveland.  Though he absolutely stepped up in the 2016 NBA Finals, some view his time as Lebron's teammate as if Lebron was 1A and Kyrie was 1B. If Lebron sat, then there was a very good chance that the team would lose (the Cavs record during that time, w/o Lebron, was abysmal).  Also, the talk of Kyrie saving Lebron's legacy got a bit out of hand."

"Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry II has countless FMVPs. Maybe that gave him the edge.. I assume 4 rings but I didn't watch Game 6 of the 2016 Finals."
they did the same thing with stephen curry in 2016 when he was making people question lebron's place at the top of the NBA hierarchy. I cant remember the exact phrase but it was something like Cursexual but slightly more clever than that
"Bro I think Curry could go down as a top 10 of all time player if everything goes right for him by the time he retires, but if you think he's anywhere close to Kobe right now you need to be drug tested in the wise words of Stephen A. And this is coming from a Kobe hater"
Then I'm taking 1986-87 Magic Johnson over 2015-16 Stephen Curry.   Also taking 1984-85/1990-91 Magic Johnson over 2014-15/2018-19 Stephen Curry.

"&gt;Not only did I watch the guy and his profile being similar to a worse slashing Giannis with better post moves  Way to self snitch on yourself for having no idea what you're talking about. This is the worst comparison I've ever seen. Giannis didn't have remotely the off the dribble shooting capabilities of Penny, nor is he as versatile scorer in the half court.   &gt;He shot 33.9% in 1997, 29.8% in 1998, 34% in 1999 from midrange.  The 1997 RS was the beginning of Penny's decline; he had arthroscopic knee surgery in December to fix an issue that had been nagging him from the start of the season and a down year across the board. His off the dribble shooting game was not the same after that.  &gt;His Ts for 3 seasons he was relatively healthy (non rookie) was 58% TS pretty much same as Kevin Johnson.  His TS% in 1996, his peak, was 60.5 TS% and we saw without Shaq him elevate his volume without sacrificing efficiency, showing that he is capable of assuming higher responsibility in an offense. 60 TS% in 1996 is +6 above league average. Stephen Curry TS% in 2019, the most efficient volume scorer in the league, in 2019 is +8 above league average.   &gt;You want me to name 7 players? that very easy. Curry/KD/Lebron/Kawhi/Harden/Giannis, last year PG and Embiid. Penny is around Dame.  I said name 7 players in 1996 better than Penny Hardaway. You said he wasn't top 7 in his own era."
"&gt; Thompson has made the third-most 3-point shots this decade, trailing only [James Harden](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden) and [Stephen Curry](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry). But what's incredible is that he did that as second or third banana on one of the era's most dominant teams.  ""second or third banana"" Is banana an actual term that people use in this context? I've never seen it used this way before."
"**ARTICLE HAS BEEN UPDATED**  NEW TITLE: *Warriors Refute Claim Stephen Curry 'Unlikely' to Return This Season*  &gt;The Warriors refuted a report that guard Stephen Curry is unlikely to return this season after breaking his hand last week.  &gt;Bleacher Report's Ric Bucher reported a team source said Curry's ""fracture was worse than originally thought.""  &gt;The Warriors quickly denied that claim, with a team source calling the report, ""complete hogwash."" The team maintains Curry will be re-evaluated after three months after undergoing surgery last Friday. Bucher walked back his report on Twitter, saying he meant Curry would not play for ""competitive reasons."""

&gt;Warriors Refute Claim Stephen Curry 'Unlikely' to Return This Season  They refuted it. Sounds like Steph will be back.
https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Warriors-refute-report-that-Stephen-Curry-is-14820683.php
" A Bleacher Report story suggesting that Warriors guard Stephen Curry is unlikely to return this season from a broken bone in his left hand is inaccurate, according to multiple team sources. &gt; &gt;“That’s complete hogwash,” one source told The Chronicle. “Like we’ve said, he’s going to get re-evaluated in three months, and we’ll go from there. There’s no reason to believe right now that he can’t play this season.” &gt; &gt;In the Bleacher Report story, reporter Ric Bucher wrote that Curry's “fracture was worse than originally thought.” Multiple team sources have debunked that claim, saying the fracture wasn’t any worse than anticipated. &gt; &gt;Curry, who underwent surgery on his broken left hand last Friday at the Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles, won’t be re-evaluated until Feb. 1. That means he’ll sit at least another 41 games. &gt; &gt;If Curry came back immediately after the re-evaluation, he’d play 33 more games this season. In his absence, the Warriors have understandably struggled, going 1-3. Draymond Green has also missed three of those games with a finger injury. &gt; &gt;The rest of the Warriors’ injury report includes Kevon Looney (neuropathic condition), Jacob Evans (hip), Klay Thompson (knee) and Alen Smailagic (ankle)."
"Yeah, a lot of former players are super skeptical of Curry lol. You can even somewhat understand it given how differently the game was played in their day, but some of it just seems to be insecurity. It's actually weird how many national spokespeople for the game are just older players who constantly disparage it, but that's another topic.  Feels like just yesterday when in 2015-2016 every ex-player from Oscar Robertson to Cedric Ceballos to Stephen Jackson were explaining how easy it was to stop Curry or how easily their team would have beaten the 73-9 Warriors."

"Holy shit dawg. Please tell me you had all that copied and ready for pasting and didn't just write that just now.  EDIT: Though excuse me if I won't include a rookie that has played 7 games as a notable member of next year's bench. And another player that had a bad rookie season? Need more than hope to include him. Your argument for next year's bench hinges a lot on young players that haven't proven themselves becoming consistent bench players. Too early in the year to convince me of that.  &gt; They haven't had a bench since KD came.  That's my point. KD more than makes up for a bad bench. I don't see them getting back their prior elite bench status. That's the main issue. Not Curry. He is a god, I have no worries about him not going off. But, Klay and Dray? I don't know if I see them playing at the level they need to being a top3 team again.  &gt; Stephen Curry/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/D'Angelo Russell/Kevon Looney/Eric Paschall/Jacob Evans/Jordan Poole/Omari Spellman.  That to me will be a very good team, but not at the level of the Lakers/Clippers/Bucks/Sixers/Rockets. More at the level of Celtics/Jazz."
"Oh man, really? Like... really? Curry/Klay/Draymond were playing against the Rockets just this last post season when KD went down in a tightly contested game 5.   Did the Warriors crumble and the Rockets rally? Nope, the Warriors actually rallied after KD's injury, Steph went off, and they won that game.  But going into Houston's home court, no KD all game, Chris Paul healthy, surely the Rockets will force a game 7?  Nope, after foul trouble and poor shooting Curry went off in the 2nd half, Draymond was great, Klay kept them in the game early, and they eliminated those guys.  They then went on to *sweep* the Blazers in the Western Conference Finals, while Curry averaged 36.5/8.3/7.3. Also made history in game 4 when both Curry and Draymond had a triple double in the same playoff game, which had never before happened.  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/steph-curry-and-draymond-green-make-nba-history-game-4-vs-blazers  When next season starts Curry will be 32, Klay and Dray 30. That's not old. The Celtic's big 3 were older than that when they won their first championship in 2008. They then had deep playoff runs for the next four years!  Now onto the ""without their bench."" I feel like you haven't paid attention. They haven't had a bench since KD came. But this season they are reloading.   The Warriors *will* have a bench next season for the first time in 3 years. They've got a rookie who already looks like he'll be the real deal in Eric Paschall. [If you haven't watched him yet I highly recommend you do. He did this on his birthday.](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/steph-curry-and-draymond-green-make-nba-history-game-4-vs-blazers)  He's on a *cheap* rookie deal for 3 years. They also have Jordan Poole under contract for 3 years, his shot hasn't been falling yet as he adjusts to the NBA but he does have a sweet stroke and I think he'll develop into a capable rotation player who can provide the spacing they've been missing. Also Smailagić who is unlikely to contribute too much this year or next year but you never know.   2nd year player Omari Spellman has lost considerable weight and has been playing quite well. They picked up his option so he'll be on the team next season and has shown himself to a capable stretch 5 who needs to work on his defense. If he continues to work and keep the weight off I think he could be a very effective Mo Speights type of player.  The Warriors drafted Jacob Evans in the 2018 draft and he had a disappointing rookie season. Was unable to earn many minutes, afraid to shoot the ball and when he did shoot he was clanging it. He did have a lingering tendon injury in the finger on his shooting hand which he got surgically corrected near the end of last season. Whether that affected him or he just needed to put in more work from this last summer league, through pre-season, and the regular season he looked like a different player. Much more confident in his shot, his shots were actually dropping, he's actually got some decent vision and passing ability, and he's worked on finishing through contact.   Right now these are the 9 dudes who are under contract for *at least* the 2020/21 season:  Stephen Curry/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/D'Angelo Russell/Kevon Looney/Eric Paschall/Jacob Evans/Jordan Poole/Omari Spellman.  They are likely to have a high lotto pick in the 2020 draft. They will lose their hard capped status, have their MLE back, and they have a $17m TPE. They will have *way* more flexibility in roster decisions and signings this upcoming off season.   That lotto pick might draft them a nice wing, a position of need, or it might be a trade asset along with someone like D'Angelo Russell to bring in the veteran wing they'll need. Maybe Russell will take a next step and they won't move him at all.   But bottom line the Warriors are in an **excellent** position right now, especially since it looks like they just might have hit on a much better than expected talent in Eric Paschall. They have an amazing core that is just enterting the tail end of their primes, they'll have another ~3/4 year window of contention with that core, they've found some nice young players to put around that core, and will the potential to really fill out the roster this off season.  Make no mistake about this, barring injury the Warriors are going to be back at the top of the league next year."
Wardell Stephen Curry
Right - Stephen Curry... became an all time great shooter  Wrong - Fultz... thought he was gonna be the best of the 76ers “big three” lol
Is shamet better than Stephen Curry
"Stephen A Smith chugs his 5th red bull in a record 1.69 seconds before coming on air:  # YOU KNOW THAT WE AINT GOT CURRY, WE AINT GOT DRAYMOND, KD OUT HERE ON TWITTER BLOWIN SMOKE, DONCIC AND PORZINGUS IN DALLAS, I'M HERING REPORTS THAT THERE IS AN ACTUAL NBA FRANCHISE IN SACRAMENTO. I AM HYPED AS FUQQQQQQQQQQQQQ I GOT MY OWN SHOW AND NOW YALL BETTER WATCH OUT. ITS GONNA GET SPIRITUAL UP IN THIS PLACE. I'M TALKING THAT FIRST TAKE ON STERIODS, BREAKIN YA EARDRUMS, FILTHY COMMENTARY SO BAD U GONNA RISE ON THE THIRD DAY AND SAY 'NAH FAM, I'M GOOD' AND CRAWL BACK INTO THA EARTH."
"Could you imagine if Lebron had Stephen curry, forget klay and draymond just if he had Steph, the fucking utter domination that would occur lmaoo it would be offensively ridiculous, KD needs to realise he’s just never been better then Lebron, dude dropped 51 on his dome with idiots, it was like watching god play ball"
"Of this list of 41, who is he more impactful than? (most names borrowed from Backpicks)  James Harden Ray Allen Clyde Drexler Kevin McHale Elgin Baylor Artis Gilmore Paul Pierce Jason Kidd Walt Frazier John Havlicek Bob Pettit Reggie Miller Rick Barry Patrick Ewing John Stockton Moses Malone Scottie Pippen Dwyane Wade Kevin Durant Charles Barkley Chris Paul Stephen Curry Steve Nash Dirk Nowitzki Jerry West Julius Erving David Robinson Karl Malone Kobe Bryant Oscar Robertson Larry Bird Magic Johnson Wilt Chamberlain Kevin Garnett Tim Duncan Hakeem Olajuwon Shaquille O’Neal Bill Russell Michael Jordan LeBron James Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"
"&gt; Stephen skyfucker Curry is not a system player, he is the system.  If he himself is the system, they should be winning games now. You still need a system built around them, so hence by definition, he is not the system, he's part of a system where he is a centerpiece."
"Lol, I definitely think Curry and Nash deserve their mvps, what are you talking about?  I’m just saying, Stephen skyfucker Curry is not a system player, he is the system."
Of current players here’s where I have them in the Top 50: LeBron James #3 Stephen Curry #16 Kevin Durant #18 Kawhi Leonard #31 Chris Paul #32 James Harden #37 Russell Westbrook #43 Giannis Antetokounmpo #48
Stephen Curry intentionally broke his hand and Klay intentionally tore his ACL so we could draft Eric Paschall with the 41st pick   Light years ahead baby
"&gt; Eric Paschall has career highs of ~~28~~ 36 points and ~~10~~ 13 rebounds, his first career double-double and the first 25-point/10-rebound game by a Warriors rookie since Stephen Curry on Feb. 10, 2010 vs. the Clippers (36 points, 10 rebounds, 13 assists).  https://twitter.com/WarriorsPR/status/1191591100349210624?s=20"
"Brandon Ingram, the Mavericks are a bunch of young players and some very few oldies, might as well add one more to the bunch. Kyle Lowry has post season experience and is playable but he’s not someone with super star potential like say KD, Stephen Curry, Klay, Lebron, AD, a whole team changer, like someone who you could easily say turns this flop of a team into a competitor, he’s most similar in caliber to almost like a Gordon Hayward or Kemba Walker, they aren’t a one man army, carry the team for over half the season and make it to the playoffs kinda person like the other 5 I’ve stated. Couple Lowry with his age, and it’s just not realistic. He just hasn’t been tested over the years as a reliable 20+ per season shooter. The tandum between Lowry and DeRozan and Lowry and Leonard was absurdly amazing, throw in a gasol and a VanFleet, and a Siakim and you have a super Star team. But that’s my point, the Mavericks have their tandem between Porzingis and Luka, we need a young reliable third in our main 5 lineup who can grow with the core. A dynasty that can be retained over the years to come like with golden state for example between their big 3. Brandon, Porzingis, Luka, Powell, and Brunson/Seth Curry would be a dangerous lineup to have every week. Couple that with bench players such as hardaway jr, maxi, Justin Jackson. Boban as we’ve seen can be an extremely potent role player as well from the bench."
"""Maya Spaeth — a hand surgeon and founder of the California Center for Hand Reconstruction in Riverside — said Curry’s initial three-month timetable isn’t as unusual as it might appear. Often, surgery on the second metacarpal requires eight weeks for the bone to heal and an additional four weeks for the patient to rebuild strength in the hand. Spaeth said that recovery can take longer if the fracture involved a joint or soft issue, the details of which aren’t publicly available in Curry’s case."" https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Stephen-Curry-undergoes-surgery-to-miss-at-least-14802749.php"
"&gt;***Damian Lillard on Warriors' rash of injuries: 'Never seen it'*** &gt;-- &gt; &gt;Portland Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard said he has never seen anything like the rash of injuries the Golden State Warriors have endured dating back to the 2019 NBA Finals. &gt; &gt;""I've never seen it,"" Lillard said in advance of Monday's game against the Warriors. ""I think they might be the first to do a lot of things. At one point they had a starting five of five All-Stars, won 73 games, they've done a lot of great things, made a lot of history. &gt; &gt;""It just seems like adversity has hit hard at this point for them. Those guys aren't old. They'll bounce back from it, but you just hate to see it."" &gt; &gt;Since Game 5 of last year's Finals, during which the Warriors lost All-Star Kevin Durant to an Achilles injury, the rest of their core pieces have gone down with various injuries that have shaken up the NBA. &gt; &gt;Klay Thompson tore his left ACL in Game 6 of the Finals and may miss the entire season. Stephen Curry broke his left hand last week in a loss to the Phoenix Suns and will miss at least three months. Draymond Green tore a ligament in his left index finger and is expected to miss at least a week as he recovers. &gt; &gt;Lillard understands that injuries are part of the game, but like many NBA players, he can't believe how many setbacks the Warriors have dealt with in succession. &gt; &gt;""It's just unexpected,"" Lillard said. ""You don't expect to see them go from being such a huge deal, big super team, to one guy [Durant] leaves and injuries. It's just an unfortunate situation that you hate to see. In that way, it's just different. It's kind of weird to see them not as the Warriors. &gt; &gt;""I feel for the players. You never want to see any of your peers go down with injuries. Klay's a great dude, so it sucks to see him go down that way. Same thing with Steph. ... They'll recover and they'll be back hopefully at 100 percent. That's what we all want to see."" &gt; &gt;Aside from the differences on the floor, Monday's game also marks the first time Lillard, a proud Oakland native, will play inside Chase Center, the Warriors' new billion-dollar arena in San Francisco. As he spoke to reporters following Monday's shootaround, he noted several times just how much different the new arena felt compared to Oracle Arena, the Warriors' home in Oakland for the past 47 years. &gt; &gt;""It's very weird,"" Lillard said. ""It's very weird ... this is extra weird. Because I'm looking around like -- this place has no history. So it's definitely different."" &gt; &gt;Lillard acknowledged that while it was tough not being able to play closer to his home, he was frustrated by the fact that several professional teams are moving out of the Oakland area. The Raiders are expected to move to a brand-new stadium in Las Vegas next season. &gt; &gt;""It just rubs me wrong,"" Lillard said. ""Like I've watched games here [at Chase Center] on TV and the crowd's just not the same. ...The Black Hole is still there. You still see the Nation in support, why would you leave that behind? It's a real sense of pride in Oakland about everything that represents us. &gt; &gt;""It's like the Warriors going across the [Bay] Bridge, the Raiders going to Vegas, it's almost like a money grab. The money moves is kind of pushing the real love and what's really behind these organizations to the side -- which is understandable, and also not understandable because I'm from Oakland. I know both sides [of the situation]. You hate to see it."" &gt; &gt;Lillard noted that he would still remain loyal to the Raiders after they relocate next year, but he didn't hide his feelings about teams leaving Oakland. &gt; &gt;""I don't like it,"" Lillard said. ""If that's what ya'll want to know, I don't like it."""
their starting lineup makes 1/8 of what stephen Curry makes in salary.
"The greatest defenders of all time will never, ever contribute 40 points worth of defense that a 30 point 5 assist player will. That’s what I mean by statistically, I hope that’s simple enough for you  There’s a reason the best players in the nba are offensive juggernauts and not fucking Andre Roberson. This concept is fucking simple and you’re losing your shit over it.   Fuck it, let’s not even look at it individually. Great offensive players can orchestrate all time level offenses. Stephen Curry’s gravity is one of the most fascinating aspects of a player. He elevates the entire team’s offense to a level a defensive player, again, could never dream of. James harden. Godly offensive player, terrible defender. 1 MVP. One of the best players in the league today. Same for Curry. Steve Nash. Westbrook 16-17.   These players make a point contribution to a team that no single defender could ever accomplish, it’s a fucking fact. It’s not as important, I’d argue it’s like 70-30.   I can’t believe people actually fucking think it’s a 50-50 game lmfao, Jesus Christ man all you have to do is count the fucking points.   Also, your last point has to be one of the dumbest things I’ve heard on this sub man. So funny. The champions are champions because they have so many things going for them. Of course defense is important. There’s usually going to be a team with both top 5 offense and top 5 defense. That team just so happens to usually be the champions. Let’s say the top 5 offense with middle defense plays the team with top 5 offense and defense, of course they’re going to fucking lose lmfao Christ what even is that point. The more I read it the less it makes sense lol"
Wolves and Suns could have amazing seasons and they'll hardly improve that number at all whilst Golden States stays intact.  People want to see Stephen Wardell Curry the third.

Stephen Curry would have secured a rebound off a missed FT.
"Slow down. Which top 6-7 player would he even replace? In no order Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Antepokoumpo, James Harden, LeBron James and Anthony Davis. I've been following him since his Real Madrid days and knew he was a surefire thing but cracking the top 5 is an insane leap so soon even for a player of his caliber."
"How far could this team go in the playoffs? Starters:  Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, D'Angelo Russell, Draymond Green, Kevon Looney  Reserves:  Jacob Evans, Alen Smailagic"
"Last year: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, DeMarcus Cousins. WTF Lol"

"&gt;PUBLISHED: October 31, 2019 at 3:53 pm | UPDATED: October 31, 2019 at 4:05 pm  Speculation from yesterday  &gt;None of the physicians interviewed by this news organization Thursday had first-hand knowledge of Curry’s condition. They discussed hand injuries in general.   &gt;Dr. Nirav Pandya, an associate professor of orthopaedic surgery at UC San Francisco, said physicians use advanced imaging, such as a CT scan, to make sure the fracture does not go into a joint.  &gt;“It is the one thing that could complicate things,” Pandya said. “If the break does go into the joints that increases the risk of stiffness and can push you into surgery.”   He had surgery today.  https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Stephen-Curry-undergoes-surgery-to-miss-at-least-14802749.php  &gt;A team source told The Chronicle that Golden State is following the orders of Dr. Steven Shin, who performed Curry’s surgery Friday morning at the Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles. Maya Spaeth — a hand surgeon and founder of the California Center for Hand Reconstruction in Riverside — said that Curry’s initial three-month timetable isn’t as unusual as it might appear.  &gt;Often, surgery on the second metacarpal requires eight weeks for the bone to heal and an additional four weeks for the patient to rebuild strength in the hand. Spaeth said that recovery can take longer if the fracture involved a joint or soft issue, the details of which aren’t publicly available in Curry’s case."
"Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Lebron James, Jimmy Butler, Chris Paul, and a lot of the other more successful playoff performers in recent years all make a killing in the midrange.   Houston Rockets continue to ignore all of that to shoot 2-16 from three."
"Allen Iverson, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry, Isiah Thomas &amp; Pete Maravich"
"He outplayed Stephen Curry on the biggest stage in basketball and got a ring to show for it. And if you think ""Lebron's sidekick"" is a proper description of his time there then you clearly didn't watch him play."
Superbowl is a bigger event. If lebron and AD went on a run with the Lakers winning a bunch of rings adding Zaire wade to LA and bronny to the 76ers winning mvp with old Stephen curry shooting 3s off the bench and prime Embiid and Simmons and lebron retiring and it makes it to game 7 it still wouldn't make top 98 game 6.

Wardell Stephen Curry
KD unenjoys Stephen Wardell Curry you heard it here first folks!
"Monta posted he has love and respect for Curry on Instagram when Curry wore his throwback jersey.   https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv-cKZNgKyC/?igshid=b0rw2h8j78fv  Monta said in an old interview the Warriors made the right move trading him and keeping Curry saying they would’ve never won a championship if they kept him.   &gt;	I think if I was there, we probably wouldn’t have won a championship.  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/golden-state-warriors-monta-ellis-stephen-curry-020916"
"I think D'lo will stay, his value is gonna be down big time because he's gonna be viewed as a player who can't win as the Warriors will have the worst record in the NBA at that time.   say the Warriors tank and get the top overall pick so the NBA can have it's bay area cash cow in the playoffs next year.   - Stephen Curry, D'Angelo Russell - Klay Thompson, Jordan Poole - (MLE signing), (vet min ringchaser) - Draymond Green, Eric Paschall - James Wiseman, Kevon Looney  is a pretty damn good squad imo."
Anthony Davis had several seasons with winshares in the single digits.  Funny you bring up Kevin Love when he had several years where he had single digit winshares as well. Stephen Curry had several low winshare seasons as well when the Golden State Warriors were considered a trash team. Winshare is such a team dependent stat and in order to nitpick Booker you have to use that is pretty desperate.   &gt;Any more excuses ?  That is my line for you.
But muh he should be MVP favorite https://www.theringer.com/nba-preview/2019/10/21/20924032/steph-curry-golden-state-warriors  https://www.espn.com/fantasy/basketball/story/_/id/27850185/what-maximum-stephen-curry-look-like
"The fact is Curry cannot handle such a massive load like that throughout a year, even if it looked good in the series. Writers all over the place (like https://www.theringer.com/nba-preview/2019/10/21/20924032/steph-curry-golden-state-warriors and https://www.espn.com/fantasy/basketball/story/_/id/27850185/what-maximum-stephen-curry-look-like) were comparing his 1100 minutes over 3 years without Thompson and Durant and trying to compare it favorably with Harden's 2900 minute year last year, saying he should be MVP favorite or at least close. Was insane to me, like curry just does not match that archetype of the player that can carry an otherwise below average team to a high seed in the playoffs. But on an otherwise great team, he will look like the godliest of gods."

Yesterday was a great day for Stephen Curry.

Jokic is the best passer ever, Vucci has a career year, Doncic is talented as fuck, and Steph is the greatest shooter ever.   You have to be really really good at something to make it in this league and not be a great-elite athlete"
"I mean looking at your post history it's obvious you just like to talk shit for no good reason and never really back up your talk so let's give you a chance. His last and best season with the Jazz was 2016-2017. Here are twenty players from that season. You tell me which one he is better than (Remember. This is 2016-2017. Not now):  1. Lebron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Russel Westbrook 6. Chris Paul 7. Anthony Davis 8. Paul George 9. DeMarcus Cousins 10. James Harden 11. Damian Lillard 12. Kyrie Irving 13. Kyle Lowry 14. Klay Thompson 15. Karl Anthony Towns 16. LaMarcus Aldridge 17. Blake Griffin 18. John Wall 19. Giannis 20. Butler  Make a case for any of those players of off their 2016-2017 stats. Which I am literally giving you Hayward's best year to compare to.  I could continue the list too if you like.  That's why I said top 30, maybe.  Hell, back in those days, I'd easily argue Millsap was the better player."
"Welcome to the Golden State Warriors. My name is Steve Kerr. I live in Golden State. I am known as the head coach. There is a story behind that. There are many stories in the Golden State Warriors — some of them are sad, some funny. Some of them are stories of madness, of half court three pointers. Some are ordinary. Yet they all have about them a sense of mystery — the mystery of winning 73 games in a season. Sometimes, the mystery of choking a 3-1 lead in the NBA finals. The mystery of the injury. The injuries surrounding the Golden State Warriors. To introduce this story, let me just say it encompasses the All — it is beyond the ""NBA"", though few would know that meaning. It is a story of many, but begins with one — and I knew him. The one leading to the many is Stephen Curry. Stephen is the one."
"They get to 5 straight finals, 3 titles, and then 4 games into a bad season people are saying that Draymond is not an All-Star and that Curry isn't a Superstar.   I'm no Stephen A., but the DISRESPECT in this thread is high. My very good friend Draymond does not deserve this.  Also flair up, show your colors."
"warriors won 51 games and you’re not about to sit here and act like that was on the back of stephen curry.   mark jackson had already dubbed that backcourt as the greatest shooting duo of all time.   david lee averaged 19/11, &amp; the warriors were deep  cut it out."
"He will, its stephen curry, hes one of the most popular players in the league"
&gt;Zach Lowe mentioned these stats during a podcast and also stated Stephen Curry will win the Scoring title. I think Stephen Curry has a great chance to win both the scoring title and mvp this year and Draymond has a great chance at Dpoy this year. The stats seem to suggest the duo will perform really well this season.
Later tonight:  Stephen Curry has been suspended for violating the NBA's anti-drug policy. Curry tested positive for marijuana.
"The frame of Allen Iverson, the jumping of Stephen Curry (I also have his knackered ankles) with unearned sense of elite shooting of Reggie Jackson"
"Ah yes, 2 time MVP, the first ever unanimous MVP, the greatest shooter in history Stephen Curry is not an all time great.   FOH nephew."
Warriors closed out the 2018-19 regular season in throw back jerseys that Stephen Curry wore in his rookie year
"1. Kawhi has seriously improved as a playmaker. He is making great reads out of the pick and roll, including LeBron-esque whip-around passes to the weak-side corner, pocket passes, and even no-looks.  2. This Trae Young injury is bad for the Hawks but might be a blessing in disguise. He currently has a 36.9% Usage Rate, behind only Kyrie and Kawhi. In his last two games, however, the Sixers, and the Heat (for a quarter) put out the blueprint: be aggressive with him and make him uncomfortable. This time without Trae could possibly be the end of the Hawks playoff hopes if he's out a week, but it will give him time to look at people who have gone through similar schemes against them (See: Lillard, Damian vs NOP; Curry, Stephen vs MEM and CLE)."
"I think it's the issue of his image and how he's branded, ticks ppl off. More than his play because, although he is being slandered for 3 games. there's a lot more ppl like strauss who will come and rush to his defense, than they would be if this was lebron playing bad for 3 games.   Stephen A eloquated it well on first take one day a few yrs back and said ""some co-workers (media pundits) on the network (espn) act like his poo smells like potpourri "" That statement alone I paraphrased speaks to the level of how people feel curry can do no wrong(in the eyes of the media). Which as a result creates push a huge push back to fans of rival teams that lose at the hands of GSW dominance."
" Stephen Curry averaged 31.7/6/5 per 36, and 30.1/6.7/5.4 per game. MJ in 1987-1988 averaged 31.2/5/5.3 per 36, 35/6/6 over the season. MJ averaged 43.6 per 100 possesions, Curry 42.5. MJ had a VORP of 11.8 to Curry's 9.8. MJ had a 31.7 PER to Curry's 31.5. MJ HAD A WS OF 21.8 to Curry's 17.8. Oh, and here's the other thing, MJ was not a 0.1 DBPM on defense like Curry was that year, he had a 2.3 BPM and won DPOY. MJ was similarly the steals leader.. but he averaged 3.2 steals to Curry's 2.1... and MJ averaged 2 blocks. So yeah, there you go."
"When Stephen Curry was benched in the third Warriors were already up 20, they only expanded their lead by 4 points until Curry checked in again.  And also, as I commented in the Game Thread there was some ugly basketball from both teams during last minutes of the third.  In fact, if you actually look at the Play by Play closely: Curry leaves the game with Warriors up by 10 in the first quarter with 2 fouls. He comes back in 2nd quarter and they are only winning by 4. In the 7 mins he stays in the court his team had a max lead of 20 and he is benched with Warriors winning by 16. He only could rest for 4 minutes because Pelicans were getting close and the gap was closed to 11 points. He checks into the game again and next time he is benched his team is up by 20.  And thats only stats. While I was watching the game I noticed how smoother and better was the team while Curry was on the court. Damion Lee, Jordan Poole or even Draymond Green were totally different players with Curry on and off the court."
"No, but Stephen Curry is blessed enough to have played with quite literally the most stacked supporting cast of any superstar in the history of the league."
"This is so, so wrong.  The best shooter ever, Stephen curry, has a career fg% of 47%.  Shooting a basketball is really hard. If it were just focus and fatigue, he'd be in the 60s or 70s I reckon."
Do you have a Stephen Curry fetish ?
"Time for some quick math to figure out the playoff/finals numbers. In order to get a rough estimate of Curry's points per 100 against FVV in the finals:  * Let's look at the raw data  * Over 6 games, Curry had 41 points over 112 possessions against FVV.  * Now let's turn it into points per 100  * (100 / 112) x 41 = 36.61 points per 100    Now let's compare that to the [regular season league leaders in points per 100 last season](http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/8J8op):  |Rk|Player|PTS| |-:|:-|-:|-:| |1|James Harden|48.2| |2|Giannis Antetokounmpo|39.3| |3|Joel Embiid|38.6| |4|Stephen Curry|38.4| |5|Kawhi Leonard|37.5| |6|Devin Booker|36.2| |7|Kevin Durant|35.7| |8|Kemba Walker|35.7| |9|Paul George|35.5| |10|Lou Williams|35.5 |11|Karl-Anthony Towns|35.4| |12|Damian Lillard|35.3| |13|Kyrie Irving|34.7| |14|Blake Griffin|34.6| |15|Donovan Mitchell|33.7|  Curry's scoring on FVV in the finals was good enough to place him just above Devin Booker in the 6th spot.  ***  Yes, FVV had some nice defensive stats against Curry in the regular season. When it counted, by your own metric (PP100), Curry torched him."

"Kerr delegates it to MB. You can read some articles on it:  - https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Mike-Brown-revamps-Warriors-substitution-9982718.php - https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/How-Warriors-Mike-Brown-found-his-golden-state-11153991.php  Not sure if those are behind paywall...I've posted some relevant bits:  &gt;A numbers whiz, Brown developed a substitution pattern in training camp that ensured that at least two of Golden State’s four core players — Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green — would be on the floor at any point in the game. Having Brown, rotation sheet in hand, monitor the times for players to check in and out freed up Kerr to concentrate on what he does best: Relay his message to the team.  ---  &gt;“I’m pretty anal,” Brown, the Warriors’ new top assistant coach, said with a chuckle.  &gt;That meticulous approach has come in handy this preseason. Tasked with revamping Golden State’s substitution pattern, Brown uses a handwritten sheet to chart the moments players come on and off the court.  &gt;He evaluates the data, and depending on the results, makes necessary tweaks. The hope is to iron out a blueprint by the Warriors’ season opener against San Antonio on Tuesday.  &gt;A numbers whiz whose favorite subject in school was math, Brown relishes the job’s complexities: Head coach Steve Kerr wants to ensure that at least two of his four core players — Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green — are on the floor at any point in the game. But unlike many of his NBA peers who employ eight- or nine-man rotations, Kerr prefers 10.  &gt;“You’re trying to make it flow so guys don’t get disjointed,” said Brown, who — in head-coaching stints with the Cavaliers (2005-10, 2013-14) and Lakers (2011-12) — favored a nine-man rotation. “Getting a good rhythm can get tougher the more guys you play in a half.”  &gt;Basketball teams, of course, can’t be treated like calculus. Because people are involved, there is inherent subjectivity. What if an All-Star would rather check out of games after the first quarter than midway through it? What if a certain rotation forces a ball-dominant scorer to play a complementary role? What if the opponent makes an adjustment that nullifies the game plan?  &gt;Therein lies Brown’s biggest challenge: Craft a substitution pattern with built-in flexibility. The handwritten sheet, a tool he picked up from working under Rick Carlisle at Indiana more than a decade ago, allows him to track every adjustment he makes. If Brown sticks with his visual aid, he won’t accidentally leave his best player cooling on the bench too long.  &gt;“It’s pretty easy and natural for me,” Brown said. “I get a few ideas, and then I just start plugging things in.”"
"Walt Frazier, Wes Unseld, Wilt Chamberlain...and Wardell Stephen Curry I and II."
[they rested him the prescribed amount and they even won without him...](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/4/25/11502176/stephen-curry-injury-warriors-rockets-game-5-sprained-mcl)
"&gt; Leading in a statistical category isn't all that meaningful without good efficiency.  So if he's averaging 8 assists, it's not meaningful because he's shooting 48% TS? What the hell is the logic actually?  &gt;Rebounds - Bogut and Thompson were the top two players in REB% though,   Don't care about REB %  &gt; Assists - Lebron with 8.8 APG leading Curry with 6.3 APG. They generated about equal number of assists for time they had the ball in their hands, Lebron just had a 40%+ usage rate for that finals.  Assists aren't even calculated in usage rate  &gt;Steals - Draymond Green - &gt; Stephen Curry -&gt; Iman Shumpert -&gt; Andre Iguodala -&gt; Lebron James  I was wrong  &gt;Blocks - Mozgov -&gt; Bogut - &gt; Green - T. Thompson -&gt; K. Thompson -&gt; J.R. Smith -&gt; Shumpert -&gt; Ezeli -&gt; Barnes/Lebron  I was wrong  &gt;2016 was the year Lebron led all major statistical categories. He was great that year, but he shouldn't get credit in 2015 for what he did in 2016.  I was wrong again but I still maintain that LeBron was the best player that series"
"This is the point. Leading in a statistical category isn't all that meaningful without good efficiency. If Lebron scored his volume on his normal efficiency, then the Cavs would have won. He didn't, so they lost.  Going down the list:  * Points - Lebron was 1st with 35.8 PPG to Curry's 26.0 PPG, but took 12.3 more shots per a game than Curry. * Rebounds - Lebron was 1st with 13.3, edging out teammate Tristan Thompson with 13.0. Bogut and Thompson were the top two players in REB% though, although Lebron was 3rd out of rotation players, and this is actually one of his best points for this finals. Him and Tristan killing the Warriors on the boards is part of what made it so close. * Assists - Lebron with 8.8 APG leading Curry with 6.3 APG. They generated about equal number of assists for time they had the ball in their hands, Lebron just had a 40%+ usage rate for that finals. * Steals - Draymond Green - &gt; Stephen Curry -&gt; Iman Shumpert -&gt; Andre Iguodala -&gt; Lebron James * Blocks - Mozgov -&gt; Bogut - &gt; Green - T. Thompson -&gt; K. Thompson -&gt; J.R. Smith -&gt; Shumpert -&gt; Ezeli -&gt; Barnes/Lebron  Breaking it all down, Curry was probably the best scorer in that series when you take into account efficiency. Lebron and Tristan Thompson tied for best rebounder. Bogut was the best when on the floor, but had issues staying on the floor. Lebron was the best passer, followed by Curry. Iguodala / Green / Tristan Thompson were the best defensive players in that series.  2016 was the year Lebron led all major statistical categories. He was great that year, but he shouldn't get credit in 2015 for what he did in 2016."
"Curry and KD are probably the only two established guys with a shot.  I don't see how we elevate KD to GOAT status when he played at the same time as Lebron, and no one except KD ever had the thought KD might be better than Lebron.  Maybe he goes to New York or Chicago and rails off three championships or something and this changes, a good 30s could change everything.  Curry is probably the closest of an active player, since he's the only one to make people think Lebron was no longer the best player for a bit, has three, possibly four championships after this season, and already won 1 without another superstar.   He would need KD to leave to really make his case, assuming they win this year to put him to 4 championships, he probably would need to win 2 more championships, and 1-2 more MVP's to get placed over Lebron (with Lebron not winning another championship, as that would move the goalposts), and might need to win 3-4 more championships before people put him over MJ.  Of the younger players, Giannis Antekoumpo has the best chance. For some reason some stupid argument has come up that Giannis is too old to do it, and got started too late, but he's only 24 years old.  Through their 24 year old seasons, Lebron had 0 championships, went to the finals once, and won 1 MVP.  Through Jordan's 24 year old season, he had 0 championships, 0 finals appearances, and had not even made a conference finals. He won 1 MVP, and 1 DPOY.  So if Giannis wins MVP (he looks like the favorite right now), he will match Lebron in terms of awards, and if he also wins DPOY, he will match Jordan through their 24 year old seasons.   He has 3 seasons AFTER this one to win a championship to keep pace with where both Lebron/Jordan were at. Both Jordan/Lebron won their first championship in their 27 year old season.  I would also make an argument for Giannis having the best body in NBA history.  Outside of those three, Harden is probably the only other guy that deserves a nod, but he would have to start winning playoff games ASAP, and then not stop winning, otherwise he won't have the championship cred people expect from a GOAT.  There might be a rookie or something that deserves to be in the discussion later, but it's not worth starting to talk about any of them until they show they're at least an MVP caliber player.  So overall, I would rank the challengers as:  1. Giannis Antekoumpo 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. James Harden"
Stephen Curry had the highest TS% in the history of any volume scorers before last playoffs
Stephen Curry nods.
"Who hates charity more, Charles Barkley or Stephen Curry?"
"If KD didn't join the 73-9 Warriors, his career would end up like Tracy McGrady's. Without a ring and without any FMVPs.   He is clearly not the best Player on the warriors, Stephen Curry is.   "

He's been generally good in mid range[\(from last season](https://clutchpoints.com/warriors-news-stephen-curry-pace-best-mid-range-shooting-percentage-last-decade/))  He's lead the league or in the top 10 at the rim % for the past 4-5 seasons and the not even debatable fact that hes the greatest behind the arch ever.

Every great player needs help to win but no team wins without the great player.   Lacob didn't draft Curry and tried to trade him away, which would have torpedoed everything they've built.   They would have been stuck as mid-tier playoff team, never getting into the draft lottery but missing that key piece to actually contend.   It all literally hinges on Curry and the ownership shouldn't get **any** credit for having Curry or keeping Curry. Hell, Lacob even tried to get him to take less on his last deal.   https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2017/10/5/16431660/warriors-joe-lacob-stephen-curry-max-contract  People give Lacob too much credit sometimes. He's been a good owner and he's helped turn the franchise around but he's also made some mistakes. He also wanted to trade Klay Thompson for Kevin Love, something that Jerry West had to threaten to resign over for him to give up.   Just imagine this team in the 2015 season with Monta Ellis, Brandon Rush, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Love and Andrew Bogut as your starting give. That team is eating a first round exit. "

"[Myth, according to Tim Kawakam](http://blogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami/2016/03/22/shutting-warriors-urban-myth-no-not-ready-trade-either-curry-ellis-bogut/)i &gt; No, despite persistent suggestions (and even a blurry Joe Lacob quote from 2012), the Warriors never considered putting Stephen Curry into this deal and in fact Milwaukee never asked, anyway. &gt;  &gt; -New information: In fact, there was a young Warriors guard the Bucks asked about–and the Warriors declined to put into the trade–but it was then-rookie Klay Thompson, not Curry, according to multiple league sources. &gt;  &gt; I’m not sure why the Curry stuff keeps getting repeated–and has filtered through to some fans who now sort of take it as fact–but it probably involves Curry’s MVP ascension, the Warriors’ quest for back-to-back titles and the insistence that they could’ve blown it."

They cared about his finals winning shot though.  People were legitimately putting him in the same sentence as Stephen Curry for best PG in the league until at least the 2017 finals.  Kyrie got mad love for his finals performance.

But when you extend the list to 20 or 25, things start to get complicated.   BTW, the reason why I rank Bird and Magic a bit low is their longevity. This is purely about being the better basketball player. If you think like what he's done for the game, Jordan-Bird-Magic, these 3 would be the top 3.   Another side note, Kareem's college record makes me think about the list because this is mostly about NBA play. Entire career? Kareem dominated the all levels. "
Wouldn’t say he’s being hyped just because he’s white. But that his race AND ethnicity is a factor in his popularity.   He has more all star votes than Stephen Curry. Forget rookies - his popularity eclipses that of established stars.

"The Golden State Warriors unironically broke the NBA regular season record with 73 wins, came back from a 3-1 deficit against the Oklahoma City Thunder, gained a 3-1 lead on the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals, and then lost 3 games in a row and did not win the championship. Stephen Curry unironically won unanimous MVP, back to back MVPs, and exclaimed ""We not goin' home!"" during a game, before being blocked by LeBron James a record 7 times in one series and indeed going home. Klay Thompson unironically said in a post game interview after going up 3-1 that basketball ""is a man's game"" and LeBron James ""got his feelings hurt"", LeBron proceeded to average 36pts/12ast/10reb and won the next 3 games and the championship. Draymond Green unironically avoided suspension for kicking Steven Adams in the balls twice, then STILL continued to play dirty and finally got suspended during the most important series of his life and ultimately cost his team its once historic and now infamous season.

I wake up smiling every morning knowing that the Warriors genuinely went 73-9 and choked a 3-1 lead in the Finals. That even if time is a nonlinear fourth dimension, going to back to stop it from happening will simply create another universe where it happens again. That the state of ass-blastedness emanating from the city of Oakland is eternal and infinite, it crosses countless dimensions of the multiverse and its unending torment knows no bounds. I gaze into the endless cosmic wonders around me, still in disbelief that it actually happened, but knowing that my purpose in life was to be born just in time to see LeGod get one for da land."

The Kobe defense will be, ""It's unfair to compare a player in their prime to someone whose not playing any more."", but you can just look at their playoff stats, in which Steph crushes Kobe, where that argument doesn't matter since Kobe never had to play in the playoffs post-prime.  The finals stats are even more lopsided in Curry's favor.  As far as accolades go, Steph has 2 MVP's to Kobe's 1.   All Kobe has is his 5 championships to Steph's 3, but that probably becomes 4-5 this summer, and might be all tied up after next season.  If you want to say Kobe had better longevity than Steph, sure. As far as impact in their prime, Curry is way better than Kobe. "
"I just have a hard time processing Stephen Curry sometimes.   Like, I still remember the fanfare when Joe Dumars tied the single-game record for 3-pointers with 10 back in the 90's. That was one of his career milestone moments.   Yet, here's Steph Curry giving a little in-and-out dribble into a 28-footer with plenty of time left on the shot clock in a tie game with 44 seconds left and... his teammates walk to the time-out huddle like it's just another day.   He's eclipsed Joe D's mark seven times over now. I can't believe the sorts of things he's normalized in basketball. I always tried to keep an open mind as to what was going to be possible on a basketball court moving forward but I'm not sure I ever saw this kind of shooting being possible. "

"It’s in the background of a lot of conversations you have with Warriors figures these days, right after all the talk about how DeMarcus Cousins is fitting in, how well Draymond Green is playing, a few moderately notable pending free-agent decisions and the maintenance of this historic team heading into the attempt at a three-peat this June.  Eventually, when the tape recorders are off and chatting is a little looser, it almost always winds around to this fundamental question (well, after the Kevin Durant Question, of course):  What’s Joe going to do?  The question isn’t about this season and this moment, of course. Everybody in and around the Warriors knows that owner Joe Lacob (and the rest of the organization) is dead set on winning immediately and winning as much as possible, which means focusing everything on getting this roster to peak for the upcoming playoffs.  That part is settled Warriors fact. They’re not doing anything to mess around with their best chance to win their third NBA championship in a row and fourth in five years and if anything they’ll try to add around the margins by adding a veteran center or a wing in the buyout market just for postseason flexibility.  The curiosity, though, is about the longer-term view — with the move to San Francisco’s Chase Center coming up next season, Durant and Klay Thompson both set to become very, very, very highly sought-after free agents, the core group moving toward NBA middle age and a whole slew of opponents clearly not only set up to try to challenge the Warriors for league supremacy but also to try to pluck Durant and/or Thompson and then maybe Green, too, when he’s scheduled to hit free agency in July 2020.  The Warriors have put together one of the greatest rosters ever. But keeping it together for another three or four years would potentially cost Lacob and his ownership group upward of $300 million a year in salary and luxury-tax costs … while most of the main players age past their primes.  And the Warriors don’t even know if Durant or (less questionably) Thompson will re-sign with this team in July or the long or short term.  Well, actually, the Warriors know Durant is at least thinking about leaving or else he would’ve signed a much longer deal last July, when he wouldn’t take anything but one year plus an option. It’s possible, maybe probable, depending on the moment and the latest report, that Durant is enticed by the idea of moving to the New York Knicks, who just opened up a massive amount of cap space last week.  So, with this unsettled dynamic, is Lacob thinking that this is a last stand and ready to redo a huge chunk of his roster over the next few summers and break up the core to try to land a younger superstar … or is this notably antsy owner relatively content to ride this out for as long as possible with the stars he has?  All important questions. Which I asked him a few days ago after a recent game. The main theme of Lacob’s answers: There are no plans to tear the roster apart and if it costs huge dollars to keep this group together, the Warriors are very capable and willing to pay that cost.  “We can do whatever we want (financially),” Lacob said. “And you should expect that that’s not going to be a reason this team … doesn’t stay great going forward. We have the capital to pay our players what they deserve. And we will.  “That’s not really the issue. The issue is more about people have to want to play here and it’s on us to make it a great environment.”  This is a slight change in tone from Lacob from recent years. In past moments, Lacob has always said he wants to keep all his best players, but he’s cautioned that there might not be unlimited resources to do so, that ownership at some point has to make some fiscal decisions.  That isn’t what he’s saying now and I think it’s a product of several factors:  1) Chase Center was always set to provide the Warriors with an unprecedented influx of cash and that money is now a tangible part of how Lacob and Peter Guber can operate;  2) The Warriors, almost inescapably capped out for years to come and without valuable young trade pieces, don’t quite have the capability of adding a major new star even if Durant leaves, so Lacob is determined to play the Durant negotiations out until the end;  3) If Durant leaves, the Warriors’ winning culture probably will put them back at the top of the line to chase another available superstar in a few years; and  4) The main long-range focus is to maintain the core of Stephen Curry, Green and Thompson, which means a full commitment to paying Thompson (probably the max) and Green (something close to the max) when they are due to land new deals.  If the Warriors offer Thompson his maximum allowable contract in July, he’ll almost certainly re-sign, even with his hometown Lakers eager to bring him in. And I expect that the Warriors will offer the max to Klay.  And Marcus Thompson reported that Green was offered and turned down a three-year extension (which would start with the 2020-21 season) worth $72 million last summer, but those talks could easily restart this July.  So all around the Warriors, teams are positioning themselves to win in a potential post-Warriors universe: The Knicks trying to set up for Durant and possibly Kyrie Irving and a top draft pick; the Lakers chasing Anthony Davis; the Clippers and Denver have lots of young talent; Dallas now has Kristaps Porzingis to team with star rookie Luka Doncic.  “Of course, that’s the role we’re in right now,” Lacob said. “Twenty-nine teams are all trying to get better. That’s what they’re supposed to do. Our job is to do that, too, to continually get better and I think we’ve gotten better pretty much every year. This is probably our best roster ever. So we’re going to continue to do that.”  Are the Warriors concentrating on those looming challenges beyond this season — specifically the teams that seem to be targeting Durant and Thompson?  “I mean, theoretically yes, but I’m not really worried about it,” Lacob said. “All we can do is be the best organization we can, treat players the best we can, provide the best environment, have the best management, have a great arena. I mean, all the things we do. The culture of the organization, I think, speaks for itself. Then the chips fall where they may.  “I think we’ll continue to have a good team if not a great team and try to hopefully be a title-contending team for as long as we can. We’ll be aggressive. Nobody’s going to outspend us. Nobody’s going to outwork us.  “I can’t control what a free agent might do. Logically, I know what they should do, which is stay with us, but I can’t say what they’re going to do, so they’ll do what they’re going to do. And we’ll have contingency plans; if somebody leaves, we’ll do what we’ve gotta do.”  There have been summers when the Warriors clearly were happy with their roster and wanted to do everything possible to keep everything together — in 2015, after their first title of this era, and in 2017, after their first season with Durant when they first and foremost wanted to and did re-sign veterans Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston.  And there have been summers when the Warriors knew they were likely to do a lot of shuffling— in 2016, to clear the way for Durant, and last summer, to try to get younger in the last five or six spots of their roster.  This July seems likely to find the Warriors straddling the two modes: They’ll try to keep everybody together, but if they lose somebody, they’ll have to get imaginative or lucky or both. But in order to have any shot at keeping Durant, they have to put all their chips in on him … until he makes a decision.  Which freezes the Warriors’ financial and personnel plans this July. They’re OK with that; though they would’ve loved to get on Anthony Davis’ short list, the dynamics of that situation seem to put him out of their reach right now.  Down the road, in two or three years … that’s when the Warriors can try to get seriously aggressive again, when it’s possible great young players like Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Porzingis and Karl-Anthony Towns could be available.  Until then …  “The best thing for us to do is keep our great players together as long as we can, as long as we should, and then develop on the margins players in (G League) Santa Cruz that can help and be smart about the guys we do sign to add to the roster,” Lacob said. “And maybe we’ll get lucky and get a DeMarcus Cousins again next year, somebody who wants to come here for less. We’re open to doing that and keeping the roster moving forward. …  “I do think we have to continue to reinvigorate the team and the roster with youth. You saw — we’re trying this year; we’re trying very hard to develop our young players and to hopefully bring them into the mix and play them more and to try to stay somewhat young as we go forward.  “But nobody’s really old on this team. They’re kind of right in the middle of their careers. So I don’t think it’s something that we worry about every day. … Let’s see how the season winds up. All I can say right now is I think we love our roster with all our players, the coaching staff. I think we’re in a really good spot. I can only say, we’ll evaluate at the end of the season and sort of see if anything’s changed from where we are today. Right now, it looks pretty good.”  So that’s what Joe Lacob’s thinking, or at least what he told me. For now, the Warriors are at the peak of a dynasty and they’re not going to mess around with that this season and probably into the next one, too."
Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant are both genuinely good and admirable people imo

"I had Rockets fans trying to explain how this season is so much more impressive than Curry's unanimous MVP season, and I just can't buy it.  First, Harden plays more minutes because Curry was blowing teams out and not playing a lot of fourth quarters. As is, Harden averages exactly 6 PP more than Curry. If you convert Harden's numbers to Curry's minutes, than he would be averaging about 33.3 PPG. Still great, but the gap is much smaller when you equalize the minutes.  Second, the efficiency gap is ginormous. James Harden is at 61.1 TS%. Stephen Curry was at 66.9 TS%, the 2nd best TS% in NBA history for 20 PPG scorers (only out done by himself in 17-18), and the best 30 PPG TS% season in NBA history. That's a 5.8% difference between Curry and Harden, which is huge.  Not surprisingly, Curry's impact was larger as a result. Harden's team is on pace to win 52 games per 538. Curry's team won 73 games, which some people might not know, but that's the most in NBA history.  The difference between Curry and Harden in scoring efficiency is the difference between Harden and a 55.3 TS%, or about a league average efficiency scorer, or basically the difference between Harden and Kemba. the difference between Curry and Kemba is essentially the difference between Harden and Wiggins.  Harden is having a great season, no doubt, an all timer, but people keep trying to elevate it beyond what it is. "

Also, in 2006 Wade was the NBA finals MVP, he was in the roster.   2014 Roster :  Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, Anthony Davis, Derrick Rose, DeMarcus Cousins,  Andre Drummond ,  DeMar DeRozan,  Rudy Gay (in his prime) and Kenneth Faried    2016 : Durant, Kyrie, PG, Cousins, Klay, Carmelo Anthony , Jimmy Battler , Demar DeRozan , Kyle lowry , Draymond Green, DeAndre Jordan   Those are actually starred filled squads "
"Those *shitty warriors* include Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and DeMarcus Cousins"
"I think the problem is there's too much talent in the NBA. We look at Anthony Davis, and think he's this generational talent, but he's really not.  Just going down the standings, the list of superstar talent in the league:  Giannis Antekoumpo, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Bradley Beal, Kevin Love, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, James Harden, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Karl Anthony Towns, Lebron James, and then Anthony Davis way down there in the standings.   When you have a superstar class that big, Anthony Davis is only going to impact winning so much, as there is too much talent in the league.  This doesn't even count all the superstars in training that will be on the come up soon like Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum, and Lauri Markannen, or guys like Kemba, Al Horford, Tobias Harris, Lou Williams, Jrue Holiday, etc. that are also as good of what we traditionally think of all stars.  The league is fucking stacked right now, and it's only getting more talented every year."

"Stephen ""Ironman"" Curry. "
Well it's one thing for Curry himself to ask about a possible discount. But for the team to suggest it after having him on probably the biggest bargain contract of all time is another thing. According to Marcus Thompson:  https://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-contract-offer-joe-lacob-warriors-2017-10  
"Olympic selection was made on 91 summer.  By then Isiah Thomas was the starting PG on back-to-back championship team with a Finals MVP and a All-Stars MVP to his name. He led his team against MJ, Magic, Kareem, Bird and prevailed. He talked the talk, but also walked the walk.  &amp;#x200B;  By 1991, John Stockton was a 3 x All-Stars, whose team had never made the WCF (WCSF in 90/91, 1st Round in 89/90, 88/90). Arguing John Stockton was better than Isiah Thomas in 1991 is as likely as saying Kyle Lowry is better than Stephen Curry in 2016. And I am one of the biggest homer for that phat-ass."
"He moves the goalposts, going from ""the game was way more physical back in the day"" (which he provides plenty of video evidence to show that) to equating this with the handchecking enforcement at the beginning of the 2004-05. These are two separate topics.  His argument that the handchecking rule didn't have an impact is easily disproven. League ORtg went up 3.2 points per 100 possessions. Free throw rate jumped to it's highest point in ten years.  The argument that some of today's players wouldn't be as successful under 1990s rule enforcement as they are now is valid, but it's not necessarily a criticism. Stephen Curry wouldn't be the same player without a three-point line. The game has opened up for different kinds of players, and (imo) more entertaining types of players. You can only judge them by the rules they had to play with."
"I'm still here baby! Let's have some banter, in what disappointing way will the Rockets lose in the playoffs this season? Another Chris Paul injury? A second round exit based on a terrible Harden performance in an elimination game? Or losing 4-1 to a Stephen Curry-less Warriors in the first round? I guess the seeding wouldn't work out for that.  OK, now you go. "

This post is honestly hilarious to me.   There is no way in hell Kawhi is better than fucking LeBron James or Stephen Curry.   Do you watch basketball?
" https://www.si.com/nba/2015/12/01/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-kobe-bryant-stephen-curry-dwyane-wade  &gt;LeBron James gathered close friends in a suite on the 58th floor of the Wynn hotel in Las Vegas on July 10, 2014. “I want to put on a coat again,” he told them. “I want to grind again.” To James, the Heat was a Fortune 500 company, the Cavaliers a sentimental startup with talent and resources. “Coming back has been everything I thought,” he says, 16 months later, “only a lot harder. I can’t tell you it’s been comfortable. But that’s O.K. I don’t really like to be comfortable.”   &gt;**Failure is a poison, and when James reentered the Cavs’ headquarters last fall, he found an organization infected. “Great young players but part-time pros,” says swingman James Jones, who followed James from the Heat. “They’d be locked in for an hour before practice, an hour after practice, but the discipline and commitment weren’t there.” Players rolled in late for treatment sessions, bagged extra shooting, left plates of food sitting around the cafeteria. “Leniency,” James says, “which was very different from the structure I’d grown accustomed to.”**   &gt;There was no individual to blame. The coaching staff was new. The front office was revamped. When James bolted in 2010, the Cavaliers wisely shifted their priority from contention to player development, and the moment he returned they had to reverse course again. **James fumed every time he saw a one-on-one dribbling exhibition, a contested jumper, a smile in a losing locker room. “He was kind of sizing everybody up,” Thompson says. “You could tell he was frustrated.”**   &gt;**James, in his first turn as a sole leader, searched for the most effective approach. “First, I tried to be patient and kind of measure them,” he says. “But you experiment with different styles. ‘This doesn’t work. S---. Well, maybe that will work.’ Sometimes you think it does, and then the next day you realize that it doesn’t.”**   &gt;**On Nov. 4 at Portland, James stood in the corner, letting Irving lose a senseless individual duel with the Blazers’ Damian Lillard. The following night, in Utah, Irving scored 34 points without an assist, and James warned him that he could never finish a game without an assist again. He deployed multiple methods to teach the same lesson, hoping one would resonate.**   &gt;On Nov. 17, James missed a shootaround before a game against the Nuggets because he was sick, and the Cavaliers acted as if their teacher ditched school. They tossed dirty gear onto the locker room floor, ignoring the hamper in the middle of the room. Equipment manager Mark Cashman took a picture of the slop and after practice the next day showed it to the group**. “I’ve worked here 15 years,” Cashman says, “and that was the maddest I’ve ever been.”**   &gt;After Cashman tore into the team, James provided a graphic exclamation point. Cashman was transported to 2003, when James was a rookie and Cleveland played the second night of a preseason back-to-back in St. John’s, Newfoundland. The Cavs landed in St. John’s at 5 a.m. and were scheduled to face the Raptors in front of a sellout crowd that night. But shortly before tip-off at an arena that housed a minor league hockey team, officials noticed condensation from the ice on the court. **The game was canceled, the Cavs were sent to their bus, and irritated players flung jerseys and shorts in Cashman’s direction. James handed him a neatly folded uniform. “I didn’t have a lot growing up,” he explained to Cashman then. “I have to take care of it.”**   Fast-forward to 2014, when James became the custodian of the franchise. He took postpractice ice baths alongside Jones and swingman Mike Miller, another running mate from Miami, and discussed what elements of Heat culture could migrate north. But Jones and Miller were role players. James had to be the conduit. **“Leading takes energy, and you can’t get tired of it,” Jones implored. “You can’t do your work at home. You have to do it here. You have to show them what it looks like.” James tried to demonstrate how he trains and recovers, but his knee and back wouldn’t let him. “That was the toughest thing,” he says. “I was teaching and preaching—telling them how hard I’m going to work, how I’m going to bust my ass—but I couldn’t really do it because I was hurting.” He fretted for the team but also for himself. “Why can’t I get to that spot anymore?” he asked Mancias, his longtime trainer. “I used to get to that spot.”**"

Even role-players can have high impacts on an overall team performance level. Nobody is saying Lonzo is a generational player....  Since LeBron came back from injury he has an outrageously high **+25.2 ON/OFF** net rating. And the Lakers are still *-2.5* when he is on the court. Think about that. Paints a pretty good picture about the state of the team. You think anyone currently in the league could offset that kind of abhorrent level of play?   James Harden is having one of the craziest seasons in NBA history and has absolutely carried his team for large stretches of the season without his 2nd and 3rd best players and yet Rockets are *+3.1* with him on the court and *+3.7* without him.   Just for the record. Stephen Curry had a  **+23.2 ON/OFF** net rating during his unanimous MVP season.

"Wardell Stephen Curry II (/ˈstɛfən/ STEF-ən; born March 14, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A six-time NBA All-Star, he has been named the NBA Most Valuable Clipper Fucker (MVCF) twice and won three NBA championships with the Warriors. Many players and analysts have called him the greatest shooter in NBA history.[1] He is credited with revolutionizing the game routinely buttfucking the clippers by regularly employing the three-point shot as part of their winning strategy"

TS% of .64, .64, .63, .61, .59 for the top five and .50 for Westy.  He's only shooting 43% overall.  I'm not saying this makes him bad, but it does mean he's not in the god-tier.  Everyone in the top five is putting up more points AND much better efficiency than Russell.  Add to the fact that I don't think his rebounding is as impressive as it looks (most DRBs in general are 'replaceable' by other players and especially in his case) and it's pretty solid.  An interesting point to note is that he's noticeably declined since his insane MVP year.  Actually quite a lot I think.  His usage was 41% that year (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) with a TS of 55%...  which is hard to even process.  With Paul George joining the team he's now only using 30% of possessions, but rather than getting more efficient he's declined to 50% TS%.  Crazy but true."

"According to Forbes' Kurt Badenhausen, superstars LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant — the top three total earners in the league this season — will all make more money in endorsements than they will from salaries and bonuses in 2019."
"Aside from Stockton which is overrated by many due to his career totals but only once or twice top 10 in the league, the others are pretty comparable.      It's easy to have a debate about top 10-12 ever because the set criterias work for them even though you have a different weightings. But then, the things get hazy.      Moses Malone, Oscar Robertson, Julius Erving, Charles Barkley, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Karl Malone, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett, John Havlicek, David Robinson, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry.   14 names. These 14 names are top 25 ever. Top 30 at worst and when you rank these names you should be able to keep the consistency with your top 10. So, it's not easy.

"Counter my argument then? Curry beats Kobe in every statistical category in the playoffs (except for blocks, due to height difference). So much for that “killer instincts”. Curry is just statistically the better player, has had greater peaks than any of Kobe’s, and will retire with more rings than Kobe.

" Is Dirks championship more impressive? Obviously the answer has to be yes. If the Warriors were to not win a championship was Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant and multiple other all stars all on the same team it would be a huge upset. Dirks legacy changed because of that championship. You never hear people complain about Derek being a huge flopper or that he was soft as butter which was what he was known ass until the championship. He was known for settling for jump shots rather than driving and never really played aggressive or effective defense. His reign changed how people remember him as a player and how people talk about him at the time.  The same thing has happened with Ginobili even though he wasn’t the focal point of the spurs, they won five rings with him is one of their top three players and his legacy has changed from obnoxious flopper that really started the whole concept of flopping in the NBA to champion and crafty scorer.  I think when you have a team with a ton of talent it takes several rings for people to really give you the full credit. Of course Kobe and Shaq won three rings together they had Kobe and Shaq. Of course Jordan and Pippen 16 rings they had Jordan and Pippen. The assemblage of talent on the Warriors  is unlike anything we’ve ever seen in the league probably better than the prime Celtics. I think if they win enough brings 6+ rings then the critics will be silent. They’ll simply remember the team for its greatness. Even the individual players will be looked at favorably like in the spurs instance."

"Stephen Curry iso is entirely manageable if you don't guard him like a SAP, stay close and let him try and run past you.

"First, thanks for giving me the benefit of the doubt. It was legit an honest mistake. Agreed it’s different positions but this whole debate is apples and oranges then. You’re saying he’s better, well Jimmy plays his position well enough to be all nba twice and all defense 4 times.   I’ll admit, when I watch Denver I definitely focus on Jokic more because he’s fucking awesome to watch. I will make an honest effort to watch him more. I have watched them at least 5 times this year though.   You saying ask the guys in the video room has no more logic to it than mine. We are both speculating out our asses haha. I do think Jimmy is a little overrated on defense, but I still can’t get over how you can say significantly better. You’re really not backing down from that claim? It’s really hard to take this seriously when you claim that. It’s just disingenuous.   First Top 50 players I clicked into: Jimmy 15, Tobias 35, Millsap not listed. https://start.att.net/news/read/article/gannett-the_top_50_players_in_the_nba_for_20182019-rgannett/category/sports?lang=en-us  That one was preseason so I got one from late January.

Let me know if you want me to keep going. So I’ll reiterate. It’s hard to take you seriously when a guy who at best was double that of Jimmy in rank, and in most cases a good bit more, is considered significantly better. The reason I said 99/100 and the 1 being you is this. One person had him 23 spots away and that’s assuming no one in between missed the playoffs. So yeah, I think I’m done here."

"Fun playoff story - in 2013 when the Nuggets were playing the Warriors Iguodala started going to chapel with the Warriors and became chummy with them. Then Mark Jackson accused the Nuggets of trying to intentionally hurt Curry. Then George Karl clapped back that there was a mole in his locker room and accused Iguodala of sharing info with the Warriors.  Then of course Andre goes to the Warriors that summer.  &gt;This is fine. Hell, if I was Lacob I would be jumping for joy. Yet, there is something extremely unseemly with Iguodala's acolytes soliciting the owner of the team he is playing against in the playoffs about free agency. That's Alex Rodriguez territory. Couple this with the circumstantial evidence that Iggy was ""The Mole"" that Mark Jackson was referring to for ""targeting"" Stephen Curry in game five. Plus Iguodala's cavorting and going to prayer meetings, again DURING the playoffs with the Warriors ... well, you can't blame Nuggets fans for feeling a bit of righteous indignation toward Iguodala.

"They used the exact same logic for the Warriors as well though. They did not make a determination that Ariza was fouled on that play. They used the information a third party had compiled and simply assigned a point value to it, both in favor of and against the rockets.   From a statistical standpoint, the methodology they used is reasonable. And every decision that was subjective, was made by the NBA, not them.   &gt; The Rockets appear to have incorporated all such instances in the report, including those that benefited the Warriors. For instance: with about 6:10 remaining in the first quarter, Stephen Curry drove on the right side of the floor. Gerald Green, the Rocket defending Curry, placed his right arm on Curry's hip as Curry rose for a layup. There was no call. The NBA flagged it as a ""potential infraction"" -- inconclusive, according to Houston's analysis. The Rockets counted that as a mistake that cost the Warriors 1.8 points -- a figure that appears to have been derived from Curry's career free throw percentage."

"Found the [Last Two Minute report](https://www.nba.com/article/2019/04/29/l2m-report-game-1-warriors-rockets).

Per the NBA Last Two Minute report, that call was incorrect and instead should have been a personal foul on Stephen Curry.

"You have to protect yourself. The organisation is pretty much obligated to stand up for their players, they should get slandered for doing so as it is something nearly every org and coach will do.   That being said Steph really doesn’t complain as much compared to his teammate or his peers, looking at harden mostly but also Westbrook is another one that likes to get caught up with the refs.   I would really doubt if Stephen Curry is anywhere near leading the league in techs received, draymonf KD are obvosouly different people and different stories, but Steph kinda doesn’t do that if we’re being honest."

"Like Mark Cuban (on twitter) was saying, you sometimes have to make a public spectacle of things to get the league to finally stop looking the other way.  &gt;**The league provided Houston** with what is essentially a full-game version for Game 7 of the last two-minute report it releases after close games.

With about 10:40 left in the third quarter, Eric Gordon lost the ball when he dribbled it off Curry's foot. In the game, it was a live-ball turnover. The league deemed it a ""potential infraction"" kicked ball on Curry, according to Houston's analysis -- meaning it might have been a kick, but there is no way to tell conclusively. The Rockets counted that as 1.1 points lost, using what appears to have been an estimate of their average half-court points per possession, according to league sources.

He's very opinionated and can be critical but I'm not sure about the bias. He loves Stephen Curry and his former players and they liked him. He had a problem with management not the players.

THE BRILLIANT SHOOTING OF STEPHEN CURRY CONTINUES!
"He must've watched The Castle. If you haven't seen it, it's an Australian film with Stephen Curry as one of the actors."
"Of course, any contact to shooters, even not letting them land properly will be called a shooting foul. Great shooters. like Stephen Curry, can make shots with defenders flying towards him without compromising his mechanics."
"Are you a ""hater"" if you think the following are better than Kyrie? (Not in order)  &amp;#x200B;  Giannis, LeBron, Harden, Embiid, Jokic, Durant, Anthony Davis, Kawhi, Stephen Curry, Paul George. He is roughly equal to Dame who I also have just outside the top 10."

"Wanted to add this section from a Zach Lowe article that might help explain why this happened. I think people may be surprised by how well Boston actually matches up with the Bucks. The whole thing is a really good read.  &gt; With Sterling Brown starting in place of Brogdon, Boston will have an easier time hiding Kyrie Irving in a series in which Milwaukee might go Kyrie hunting -- treating Irving the way Irving's Cavaliers famously treated Stephen Curry. Without Brogdon, Milwaukee has one fewer quality wing for small-ball lineups featuring Giannis Antetokounmpo (or one of Ersan Ilyasova/Nikola Mirotic/D.J. Wilson, depending on your positional taste) at center -- groups Milwaukee will need more now. &gt;  &gt; **They need them because of Al Horford. He has always defended Antetokounmpo well. No one can stop Antetokounmpo -- not this souped-up version with more sneering confidence, and an emerging jump shot. But Horford makes him work. He is one of the only defenders alive capable of playing off Antetokounmpo, girding himself for the coming assault, and staying in front of the likely MVP without conceding a parade of dunks. &gt;  &gt; Scoff if you like. Antetokounmpo averaged 25.7 points, 9.6 rebounds and 6.3 assists per game on 57 percent shooting against Boston in last season's first round. Horford clearly did not stop him.** &gt;  &gt;  &gt; But Boston has a history of outscoring Milwaukee with Horford and Antetokounmpo on the floor, and that extended into this season. (The sample size is tiny, obviously.) Something about that matchup troubles the Bucks. &gt;  &gt; Boston is probably not much worried about anyone beyond Antetokounmpo. Even without Smart, they have enough rangy wings to throw at Middleton, Eric Bledsoe, and the rest -- and to switch a lot. This series might come down to Horford and Antetokounmpo -- at both ends."
What if the 2x MVP Stephen Curry shot a 3 point shot?
"&gt;We don't like the Warriors because they have too many good players?  They were already very good with a 2 time MVP Stephen Curry , title in 2015 and Finals in 2016 before Kevin Durant (arguably the 2nd best player at the time) decided to sign with them in the summer of 2016.

"Hello, eagle20 you must be a professional coach. Let me give you some advice, doubling KD will not hinder his ability to pass the ball. Why? Maybe because he is 7ft and moves like a guard. You see, when you double the ""gravity master, stephen curry"" he is about 6'2 so, passing is difficult and it is difficult for him to shoot."
"Wish we had a Stephen Curry, or a Klay Thompson, or a Kevin Durant :("
Lol our franchise player is Stephen Curry
"""and honestly Dame's shooting motion and greater strength make him slightly more efficient on 30+ footers""  Lol. Nope. Steph Curry's seasonlong effective field goal percentage from 30-34 feet was 57.4% this season. Dame's was 52.2% from 30-34 feet. That's a 5.2% difference, if you can't do the math yourself. If you knew anything about basketball, you'd know that's a big difference, but since you don't, let me tell you: that's a big, very relevant statistical difference that's puts these 2 players in entirely different categories.   Dame is a great shooter. Steph is the GOAT shooter.   You know what's not a good look? Making claims like ""and honestly Dame's shooting motion and greater strength make him slightly more efficient on 30+ footers, and the numbers bear that out"" when the numbers don't ""bear that out.""

"Exactly. If you look at his relative efficiency it's high.  If he played in this era, he would've adapted to the 3-ball, but that wasn't his era. His era was dominated by bigs and points. He was the ONLY beast SG from his era. Wade was a little after Kobe's prime, and Ray Allen was off-ball/spot-up practically his whole career, not exactly ""beast"".  Shaq, Garnett, Duncan, Nash, Kidd, Iverson. Those were the best players from that era not named Kobe. The game was about PGs who could 1) create their own shot, and 2) drive and dish underneath to bigs, who were unstoppable. Kobe could do both those things, and he had the length and strength to challenge bigs in the paint, which made him almost a super point guard.  So yeah, by today's standards, he is considered ""inefficient"" when compared to Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, but anyone who watched him knows he had ice in his veins. Also, anyone who says Klay was a better player because he was more efficient has no fucking idea what they're talking about.  In my life, Tom Brady, Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Michael Phelps, and Kobe Bryant are the only true killers I've witnessed in sports. They didn't care about efficiency, they cared about winning. Somehow, in today's sports, winning has become underrated. Lmao that's the whole point of the game."

Posts like these showcase why Lillard is probably the best and most underrated point guard in the league. If he leads his incomplete cast past the Thunder on a miraculous buzzer beater he’s the man. But of he can’t close it out in the final seconds against the Nuggets he’s overrated.   Lillard is one of the very few point guards in the league who actually have to carry a team. If he has a bad game everybody on his team has a bad game and you’re doomed to lose. Whereas someone like Stephen Curry can rely on their teammates if they have a bad night and still get away with a +20 win.

"I'm not gonna lie, I've actually wanted Curry to be the best player on Earth since the 73 win unanimous MVP season. I've hated Kevin Durant and tried to validate Steph being the best player on the Warriors based on regular season performance. You're right, tons of people have rationalized it the way I have.  But this post-season I've slowly been finally reaching the breaking point until tonight. Kevin Durant is flat out a better basketball player than Stephen Curry, and Steph is good in the playoffs but Warrior fans really misconstrue how good he is and they know it.  Steph is always a clear step down in the playoffs compared to his regular season, even if hes still good. Steph is absolutely inconsistent in the playoffs, he just has a team that can pick him up when he inevitably has 1-3 off games per series."

Let me clarify. I don’t mean it in a way that he was bad vs the Clippers but he definitely had a couple of bad games. In general he just hasn’t been the Stephen Curry all of us are used to seeing. KD absolutely has been carrying up to this point. Honestly both Steph and Klay have been playing below their standards.
People like you are making it really annoying to be involved with the NBA community. Can we focus on something other than the fucking refs? Can we focus on how shitty Stephen curry played? Can we focus on Steph's ridiculous play at the end of the game? Stop bitching and be happy your team won for once. They're both playing with the same fucking refs for crying out loud.

"All great time great teams are tricky to make outside of MJ and Lebron.  So many great pgs, pfs, and centers.  Guess the best thing to do there is fix the team to fit those 2 guys.

At pf you can either go with an awesome gritty defender like Dennis Rodman or add more another sniper/more range aka Dirk.  Center you cant really go wrong with Wilt, Kareem, or Shaq."
Stephen Curry   Klay Thompson   Joe Ingles   Draymond Green   Marc Gasol
Stephen Curry took the backseat on this team and had absolutely no reason to. Adding KD was like adding nos to a Lamborghini
"Listen, it’s hard to compare different eras, especially some like the 90s bulls, but in today’s NBA landscape what he’s doing is truly amazing, which is very Jordan-esque. Is it a hot take? Maybe. But Stephen Curry could’ve easily had 2 finals MVPs out of 3, he’s one of the best of all time and definitely deserves to be talked about as a pure winner. And who would you put above him as the best winner since Jordan? That statement isn’t wrong at all. He’s about to have 4 rings, and was a major collapse away from being 4-0 in the finals."

"No man, it is not joking.  When Dame got a trap , his ability of dealing with the ball is not a same level compare to Stephen.  It's not question about stats. And it doesn't means that he can't handle the ball when he gets a trap. It just means he can do better.  Green and IGGY don't have a stable shooting ability, Curry just pass a nice pass to them. And they just play easily."
Stephen Curry is like the main character in a basketball anime.  He just goes around beating teams and making their best player join him.  Beats the nuggets?  Iggy joins.  Beats OKC?  Durant Joins.  Beats the bucks ....

They should run a pick and roll with Dame or CJ as the ball handler and screener every single damn time. They cannot trap this and it puts Stephen Curry in a position to defend.

"GSW were hot garbage back then with a couple toxic personalities (cough Stephen Jackson). It just was a dysfunctional organization. Plus, him and Ellis were both undersized guards.  Ellis famously said it wouldn’t work out with him and Curry playing together, and this was before Curry has even played a game. But even before that, he wanted to be drafted by the Knicks (who even know why)"
"I still can't believe Minnesota had the 5th and 6th picks and decided to use *both of them on point guards* while Stephen Curry was taken with the 7th pick.  Obviously hindsight is 20/20, but mannnn that back-to-back miss has to suck.  And it's not like they already had a PG and decided to draft a center instead... they used them both on PGs."
At least they didn't draft 5 PGs NOT named Stephen Curry in that draft...
"Depends on how you interpret ""basketball activities"" no? According to reports, Durant hasn't done any basketball activities yet in the interview today with Rachel Nichols and Stephen Curry, Durant is on camera sneaking around the gym.

"""League sources"" can literally be anyone. Owner, GM, Coach, player himself, ball boy, part-time towel boy, security guard, janitor, pop corn guy (Hey, dude knows Stephen Curry on a 1st name basis), r/nba, and anyone related to anyone working in the NBA.  Stephen A Smith however doesn't have sources. Dude has DEAR FRIENDS."
"I think it is underappreciated how great at basketball you have to be just to make it into the NBA. Seth Curry is an incredibly talented basketball player and is much closer in ability to Stephen than it looks but rather small differences can make the difference between being an NBA MVP and being a good role player. It's just that being in the greatest league in the world amplifies every flaw a player has.  &amp;#x200B;  Steph is better because he is an inch taller, is a bit stronger, is a superior defender, has much better handles, and has a higher bball iq. They are both elite shooters but that's about the only thing Seth is NBA elite at."

"&gt; “A different light goes off,” Stephen Curry said, “when you see your brother across from you.”  The end of the article...   I want to know what light, what does that mean Stephen!"
"From 2009, [before the draft](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/scott-fowler/article213371369.html):  &gt; In the past two months, though, Curry’s draft stock has risen like the outdoor temperature. The Curry family would prefer to see Stephen get chosen by the New York Knicks at No. 8. They believe the fast-paced system run by coach Mike D’Antoni in New York would be a perfect fit. &gt;  &gt; If Curry, 21, is taken by a team other than the Knicks, he promises he won’t be a holdout. Quarterback John Elway once forced his way out of Baltimore by refusing to play for them in 1983 after getting picked No. 1 overall (he was traded to Denver instead). But Curry insisted he will do no such thing. &gt;  &gt; “I’ll make the best of whatever happens,” Stephen Curry said. “I’d love to go to New York, but I’m going to show up on time and give my best effort for whatever team that drafts me.”"
Nuggets Legend Wardell Stephen Curry II
"Patrick Beverly @ $1, Klay Thompson @ $5, Kawhi Leonard @ $6, Al Horford @ $4, Marc Gasol @ $2.  First off, Marc Gasol probably has the best value out of all the players listed here, it's nuts. So I obv wanted to build a team that wants to contend, I also wanted players who played a ""*clean*"" or ""*smart*"" brand of basketball, players that doesn't have negative label on them unless they've seemingly overcome them in my eyes—players like Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan who would get criticized for underperforming when it matters most. Playoff experience was big for me as well, I need guys that knows how to adjust accordingly asap. I also heavily considered the defensive prowess of the team seeing as it's half of the game. I also considered longevity, how well could these guys' game translate as they age?  I **really** wanted Stephen Curry as the primary ball handler, but building the team with him as as one of my more expensive players proved to be tougher than I expected. So I actually think with the team I want to build that Mike Conley would have been perfect, but I was a $1 short (when I had Paul Millsap instead of Al Horford) and wasn't super thrilled with the players listed so I picked Patrick Beverly. He's proven defender in the league, and actually shot 43% from deep this post season. One of this team's weaknesses is the playmaking, again Mike Conley could've been nice here, but I have Marc Gasol, he'll have a healthy dose of playmaking opportunity, Klay Thompson and Kawhi Leonard are willing passers too given their duty in this team. I thought about Ricky Rubio, but I haven't really been paying too much attention to him to know whether I'd really like him with these players, also the fact that he doesn't have as much playoffs experience as I'd like, not bad, not necessarily what I want. I think Goran Dragic would have had a chance in this lineup if I knew more about his game too.  With the shooting guard position I was really underwhelmed about the options, so I ended up taking the premier two way player in Klay Thompson. If I really so I desired I could have cheated and grabbed a ball handling point guard (à la D'Angelo Russell/Stephen Curry/Damian Lillard/Kyrie Irving) to to assign as my shooting guard, but none of them was really that appealing. Nothing much to say about Klay Thompson, he can go ballistic any night, scores at a relatively high clip, and one of the league's better defender. And a dangerously good catch-and-shoot shooter. He'll ofc be taking the second most amount of shots in this team.  Kawhi Leonard is actually pretty similar to Kevin Durant in that he's so good, it'd be hard to resist not to just let him iso. The difference being that Kawhi is one the league's *best* defenders. He's not a playmaking offensive threat like James Harden is, but he scores enough in those possessions where he shoots it himself rather than sharing the sugar that I don't mind too much.  Al Horford fills the role of spacing the floor, and using his experience to rook guys trying to go at him in the low block. I improvised last minute—I had Paul Millsap because I recall him being an All-Defensive level defender in Atlanta, and he also spaces the floor, but I don't know how well that achievement holds, whereas Al Horford was All-Defensive just the previous season. Also Paul Millsap only made 31.6% of his threes this playoffs whereas Al Horford made a whooping 43% of his threes in the playoffs in his three years with Boston, yes they're probably different shot selection, but that stat alone leads me to believe that he'd shoot as well if not better at those shots Paul Millsap took.  Marc Gasol rounds it out as my center. As stated earlier, his playmaking ability will be showcased again, just as he did before Jokic popularized it. He's probably not the rim runner that would score at will, but give him an advantage and I'd imagine he'd capitalize on it. On the other end is a former Defensive Player of the Year. An older player, but still smart enough to contest effectively without fouling too much. A savvy veteran that's just an all rounder overall.  This was actually super fun entertaining myself, I cheated but what the hell, Houston has P.J. Tucker as their fifth for a large portion of their fourth quarter in the playoffs. The biggest thing I'm worried about with this team is transition defense, while I have a very good defensive team in my eyes, having an older, slower front court might just be the hole that this team doesn't cover. I'd imagine the pace wouldn't matter, I'm confident this team finds the right shot to take even if it means draining the clock."

"There's bad and then there's stupidity. Of all players in the league to leave wide open for three, Stephen Curry is the one person of the whole list you don't leave wide open. Even it's he's 0/27, you guard that man"
"Then they need to ""git gud"" as an organization. From scouting, drafting, development, medical, coaching, and everything else.  TBH drafting is very important but not everything. Spurs haven't drafted a #1 since Duncan. Clippers have had 2 #1 picks since Duncan and 0 rings to show for it. Clippers have had 2 #1s too. Also no rings. Wizards had 2 #1s also. 0 rings.   Kobe wasn't drafted #13. Neither was KD #2, Stephen #7, Kawhi #15, or Giannis #15. OKC's big 3 of  KD#2, WB#4, and Harden#3 weren't able to form a dynasty yet GSW's Curry#7, Klay#11, and Draymond#35 were.  I think it's better for the league as a whole since it will stop teams like Cleveland or Philly from tanking years on end to abuse the lottery system designed to help the weaker teams. It should incentive teams to be better overall and not tank as much or as blantantly."

"\&gt;  Dude cant create anything for himself or teammates on offense    Lol. This notion that people have of Klay is awful. He's not Mr. Fancy doing insane crossovers and shit, but he has really strong fundamentals and is definitely above average at creating opportunities for himself. He absolutely creates for others because he's literally one of the best shooters in the world. He moves a LOT off the ball and opens the floor. You better believe if Curry or KD isn't on the floor, a lot more focus is on Klay.  Klay holds multiple top ten all-time shooting records. He's number 1 of **all-time** for 3 pointers made in the playoffs -- tied with Stephen Curry. He holds the #8 all-time in a single season. He holds the #1 spot of all-time for in a single game."

"I don't agree with SAS on a lot of issues, but this time he hit the nail on the head  #THANK YOU STEPHEN A SMITH  I fucking hate the awards show at the end of the season.   It's so much more iconic when you have them presented during the first round of the Playoffs. I'm so glad a big talking figure like SAS is shitting on the awards show.   At the moment, we'll never be able to experience these moments ever again because of the stupid format and it's despicable.   - Steph Curry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA2iTTRWdVw  - Derrick Rose: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyMEZ4TQ4b4  - Kevin Durant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX0eoh7CVUg"
Stephen Curry wouldn’t have won MVP if he didn’t play basketball
Couldn’t you consider Stephen Curry ahead of his time? He was ahead and the strategy of nba basketball changed to accommodate his talents.
"Team C (6) vs Team G (22)  Team C -Curry, Stephen -Capela, Clint -Conley, Mike -Cousins, DeMarcus -Collins, John  Team G -Gasol, Marc -Gobert, Rudy -Griffin, Blake -Green, Draymond -George, Paul  OUTCOME: Team G wins  I don't know how you came to this conclusion."
He would have to be insanely efficient on offensive end like Stephen Curry efficient to make up for his team having only 4 defenders while hes on the court.

Stephen Curry = Crush Teen Pry
"&gt;It seems like everyone is trying to draw suspicious fouls on 3-pointers in the NBA these days. Chris Paul, **Stephen Curry**, Damian Lillard… the list goes on.  Seriously? You put Steph up there but leave out the beard? I didn't read another word after that sentence."
Stephen Curry shoots like Dion Waiters thinks he shoots
"and your father, Stephen Curry smh"
Wardell Stephen Curry shoots 3-point basketball shots.
"True, but how did he win those titles? Look again at the 2015 Warriors, whose title run went through the New Orleans Pelicans, the Memphis Grizzlies, the Houston Rockets, and the Cleveland Cavaliers. While Golden State guard and Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry was relatively healthy during the postseason, opposing starting point guards were not: injuries to Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley, Patrick Beverley, and Kyrie Irving, respectively, meant huge postseason minutes for backups Norris Cole, Nick Calathes, Pablo Prigioni, and Matthew Dellavedova. Delly even got the nickname the curry stopper!! and the first ring has an asterisk. while not winning the finals mvp. After that he was carried by kd to his next 2 rings."
"Jordan Bell used to take his pit bull, Prince, and his husky, Koba, to the dog park, and let them run around with other canines. But now he takes them to a regular park and plays catch with them. He isn’t babysitting anymore but spending quality time with them.  “I just started enjoying them more,” Bell said.  He’s also taking walks now, something he’d never do previously. Instead of heading straight home from the gym, he might just venture off on foot, follow the warmth of the sun, and let the ambient sounds be the background music for his thoughts. Another thing he does now, after not doing it much before, is pray. More than ever. He’ll bless his food and break off into a conversation with his higher power. Sometimes, the pouring out of his heart goes on long enough for his food to get cold.  Oh, and Bell is reading. He credits Andre Iguodala, who put him up on “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” among other literature. Bell eagerly awaits Iguodala’s book, which he preordered immediately: “The Sixth Man: A Memoir”, scheduled to drop in June.  All of it is part of Bell’s plan to deal with what’s been thrown at him this season. He fights back against frustration, against impatience, against dejection by occupying his mind with better thoughts and simple pleasures.  “I’ve found other ways to enjoy life,” Bell said. “I stopped letting basketball control so much of my happiness.”  This is Bell giving it all he’s got. This is a 24-year-old trying his best to grow in the shadows, prepping for his turn to blossom. The NBA can be brutal for youngsters. Potential can morph so quickly into disappointment while the highs come with the frequency of rest stops on a dreary highway. Enduring the journey requires mental toughness.  Bell, most of his life, has conquered sports with sheer athleticism. He’s a 6-foot-9, 224-pound physical specimen — chiseled, fleet of foot and springy. But this won’t be solved with corporeal prowess. So Bell has been doing work upstairs. Reclaiming his mind from the obsessive grips of basketball. Erasing negative thoughts and persistent worries by tallying blessings and prioritizing peace. That’s how he has survived this season. That is how he can make the emotional roller coaster these last two years have been pay off.  Tuesday came as a reward, more evidence he is on the right path. In Game 1 of the Western Conference finals, he was called upon to hold the fort off the bench, ensuring the Warriors get a proper start to this series. Bell played 10 minutes, 49 seconds, totaling three points, four rebounds and three assists in the Warriors’ 116-94 win over the Trail Blazers. This came on the heels of Game 6 in Houston, when the Warriors needed him to help close the series and he did not disappoint. He played 10:52 and came through in the biggest game of the season.  Yet not a single number on the stat sheet can illustrate how big this was for him. Bell hadn’t played 10 minutes in consecutive, meaningful games since March. But these small victories matter. They are validation for a young player trying to make his home in this league.  “He helped us win games against Houston last year. He helped us beat the Cavs last year,” reserve guard Quinn Cook said. “So for him, he could easily feel bad about himself, make excuses and not be consumed with winning. But he’s the best teammate you could ever ask for. If you watch him on the bench, he’s excited for everybody. He claps for everybody. He comes in the gym, works hard, stays after. And anytime he’s called on, he delivers. I was happy for myself, happy to beat Houston — but I was more happy for him. He hadn’t played at all in the playoffs. So for him to do what he did, that says a lot about his character.”  Bell went all out this summer.  “Just killed myself in the gym all day,” he said. “Lifting two to three times a day. SoulCycle every day. I was doing everything to prepare myself.”  This was supposed to be his breakout year. As a rookie, he averaged 14.2 minutes in the 2018 Western Conference finals. The taste had him salivating over what was to come. So he worked hard to be ready for the increase.  But by December, around Christmas, he started reaching his low point. In January, he played in just nine games and averaged 9.1 minutes. What was happening? Usually working hard shows up in practice, and that leads to more minutes. He went all out and was getting the opposite results. Bell was struggling to process why his plan was failing.  And then there was the matter of his contract situation. He is a pending restricted free agent.  “It was just depressing to me,” he said. “You start questioning things. I never thought about the contract thing before. But I’m like ‘I’m not playing it all. What if next year I don’t have a contract and I’m out of the NBA?’ That’s one of my biggest fears. You see it happen all the time.”  Making matters worse, he couldn’t escape to basketball. He could escape to drills and film study. But basketball felt so far from him, the byproduct of the NBA’s lack of practice and rare scrimmaging.  In his eagerness to meet expectations, he forgot where he was and who he needed to be. Bell wanted to show how his mid-range shot had improved, but Draymond Green would remind him the Warriors have shooters. Bell was expecting more minutes and struggling with being in and out of the lineup, but coach Steve Kerr would regale Bell with stories about his early career struggles dealing with spotty minutes in Phoenix and Cleveland.  Eventually, Bell said, after his malaise to start the calendar year, he figured out the source of his problem. He recognized his impatience and conceded the goal for him, what the Warriors are working towards, is a 10-year plan, not a two-year. But he was already buried in the rotation when he had his epiphany, behind DeMarcus Cousins and Kevon Looney. So he couldn’t show he got it.  He started working on his mind. Diving into the cerebral elements of the game. Being intentional about discipline, preparation and commitment. Taking captive the thoughts that are counterproductive.  He watches Stephen Curry closely and even took the time to digest Curry’s Facebook show “Stephen Curry vs. The Game.” Bell said Curry is the most confident person he’s ever seen. Bell notices how consistent and unshakeable the two-time MVP is no matter what he is going through or how his performance went.  “He’s become a way better pro,” Cook said of Bell. “How hard he attacks his rituals and routine and pregame stuff and post-practice stuff. He’s more attentive in film. You can just see him getting better and better. Obviously, this is one of the greatest teams ever so the opportunities are not always there. But he’s always staying engaged. He’s always upbeat and positive.”  In the meantime, the Warriors hone his mental game by recreating game-like situations in private work with the coaches. He’s done a ton of drill work getting down the offensive actions the team runs, using staffers as defenders to keep him guessing and force him to make quick decisions.  Again, the physical part, he’s got that. Even in drill work, he goes at game speed.  “He’s worked on his game every day, so he’s going to have confidence when he plays,” Warriors assistant coach Chris DeMarco said. “I think he’s become a better decision-maker offensively. He is a good passer when posted and in the pick-and-roll. Defensively, he needs to stay disciplined on ball fakes but he’s very good with his verticality at the rim. He’s one of the fastest bigs in the league, so when he is sprinting both ways he’s at his best.  “We know he has the tools. But it’s also about preparation and focusing on the details.”  That’s why it felt so good to take the court again. He especially appreciates minutes now in this adjusted mindset. He used to look over his shoulder, wonder if his mistake would end his stint. Now, he appreciates just being on the court, relishes the chance to make a play.  Those moments, like his second-quarter post-up Tuesday that led to a dribble-hand-off to set up a Klay Thompson jumper, or his fourth-quarter drive-and-kick to Cook in the corner for a 3, feel even better compared with the sting of his name being dragged through the mud.  He’s been labeled a disappointment after being hailed as a 2018 draft steal. His basketball IQ is questioned, his maturity rendered wanting. He was suspended in late March for a prank involving a candle, fodder for his reputation as juvenile.  “That was some bullshit,” one of his teammates said about how Bell was cast. It’s water under the bridge for Bell. It has to be.  He wants to remain with the Warriors. He wants to re-sign this offseason and continue growing with this franchise, continue learning from these Hall of Famers. Bell said he doesn’t want to go to a lesser team so he can get more minutes. He knows what he has right here.  That only happens if he masters the mental. Being back in the mix, having his number called again in the Western Conference finals, is proof it’s working.  “It’s like a weight lifted off your shoulders,” Bell said of getting back on the court. “It’s like, ‘Ah. There it is.’ One dunk. One block. One steal. All that questioning, all that doubt you had, it immediately goes away. It’s like, ‘I can still do this. Just stay with it.’ It’s a learning process.”"
"Honestly I have no idea but it's true, at least the Warriors trainer was on record saying Steph was 2nd on the trap bar deadlift behind Festus in '15.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/stephen-curry-can-deadlift-400-pounds/"
Kellerman and Stephen A are clearly trying to convince KD to stay by saying Curry needs him!
most of that list is pretty solid; but yeah I'd replace guys like Horace Grant with guys like Stephen Curry.

What if next year I don’t have a contract and I’m out of the NBA?’ That’s one of my biggest fears. You see it happen all the time.”  Making matters worse, he couldn’t escape to basketball. He could escape to drills and film study. But basketball felt so far from him, the byproduct of the NBA’s lack of practice and rare scrimmaging.  In his eagerness to meet expectations, he forgot where he was and who he needed to be. Bell wanted to show how his mid-range shot had improved, but Draymond Green would remind him the Warriors have shooters. Bell was expecting more minutes and struggling with being in and out of the lineup, but coach Steve Kerr would regale Bell with stories about his early career struggles dealing with spotty minutes in Phoenix and Cleveland.  Eventually, Bell said, after his malaise to start the calendar year, he figured out the source of his problem. He recognized his impatience and conceded the goal for him, what the Warriors are working towards, is a 10-year plan, not a two-year. But he was already buried in the rotation when he had his epiphany, behind DeMarcus Cousins and Kevon Looney. So he couldn’t show he got it.  He started working on his mind. Diving into the cerebral elements of the game. Being intentional about discipline, preparation and commitment. Taking captive the thoughts that are counterproductive.  He watches Stephen Curry closely and even took the time to digest Curry’s Facebook show “Stephen Curry vs. The Game.” Bell said Curry is the most confident person he’s ever seen. Bell notices how consistent and unshakeable the two-time MVP is no matter what he is going through or how his performance went.  “He’s become a way better pro,” Cook said of Bell. “How hard he attacks his rituals and routine and pregame stuff and post-practice stuff. He’s more attentive in film. You can just see him getting better and better. Obviously, this is one of the greatest teams ever so the opportunities are not always there. But he’s always staying engaged. He’s always upbeat and positive.”  In the meantime, the Warriors hone his mental game by recreating game-like situations in private work with the coaches. He’s done a ton of drill work getting down the offensive actions the team runs, using staffers as defenders to keep him guessing and force him to make quick decisions.  Again, the physical part, he’s got that. Even in drill work, he goes at game speed.  “He’s worked on his game every day, so he’s going to have confidence when he plays,” Warriors assistant coach Chris DeMarco said. “I think he’s become a better decision-maker offensively. He is a good passer when posted and in the pick-and-roll. Defensively, he needs to stay disciplined on ball fakes but he’s very good with his verticality at the rim. He’s one of the fastest bigs in the league, so when he is sprinting both ways he’s at his best.  “We know he has the tools. But it’s also about preparation and focusing on the details.”  That’s why it felt so good to take the court again. He especially appreciates minutes now in this adjusted mindset. He used to look over his shoulder, wonder if his mistake would end his stint. Now, he appreciates just being on the court, relishes the chance to make a play.  Those moments, like his second-quarter post-up Tuesday that led to a dribble-hand-off to set up a Klay Thompson jumper, or his fourth-quarter drive-and-kick to Cook in the corner for a 3, feel even better compared with the sting of his name being dragged through the mud.  He’s been labeled a disappointment after being hailed as a 2018 draft steal. His basketball IQ is questioned, his maturity rendered wanting. He was suspended in late March for a prank involving a candle, fodder for his reputation as juvenile.  “That was some bullshit,” one of his teammates said about how Bell was cast. It’s water under the bridge for Bell. It has to be.  He wants to remain with the Warriors. He wants to re-sign this offseason and continue growing with this franchise, continue learning from these Hall of Famers. Bell said he doesn’t want to go to a lesser team so he can get more minutes. He knows what he has right here.  That only happens if he masters the mental. Being back in the mix, having his number called again in the Western Conference finals, is proof it’s working.  “It’s like a weight lifted off your shoulders,” Bell said of getting back on the court. “It’s like, ‘Ah. There it is.’ One dunk. One block. One steal. All that questioning, all that doubt you had, it immediately goes away. It’s like, ‘I can still do this. Just stay with it.’ It’s a learning process.”  — Reported from Oakland  (Photo: Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images)"
"Stephen Curry is a system player. 5th is a reasonable spot given LeBron, Durant, Giannis and Davis exist. Idk whether AD is in the playoffs or not. If you’re great you’re great."
\[It was mostly during his unanimous MVP season.\]([https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/06/02/adam-silver-three-point-stephen-curry-klay-thompson/85326812/](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/06/02/adam-silver-three-point-stephen-curry-klay-thompson/85326812/)) They also talked about adding it during ASG. Don't know where they would put it.
"&gt;5: Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)  &gt;Sexton can score, and 40% from 3 point land as a rookie is an incredible sign. He also has a coach now who is excited to develop him. The only other rookies to average 16 PPG, 40% 3 PT, 80% FT in NBA history are Stephen Curry and Larry Bird.  Sexton made 119 threes last year. While that is way better than expected, pump the breaks.  750 3pt fgas are just when you start to reach the threshold of borderline acceptable sample size for strong correlation to predicting future three point performance.  Sexton took 296 3pt fgas last year.  Honestly though I was excited for this topic but not understanding how to analyzing the most important shot in basketball turned me off. Furthermore I am a Cavs fan, and can assure you that defenses rolled out the red carpet to allow Sexton to shoot wide open threes. That lack of spacing from your ball handler will tank your Team Offense. His percentage could easily be in the 28-32% range next year."
"u/dydodechamp can't handle that his favored player, ""greatest all time"" (behind MJ everyone knows) didn't win a bunch of rings hopping from stacked team to stacked team because of Stephen Curry and the Warriors.   And I love how much it bothers him."

"Stephen Curry, he creates a good chemistry and locker room for the team, he doesn't create any drama, he doesn't stop the ball from moving around from everybody. The style of basketball with him is just beautiful."
"Look again at the 2015 Warriors, whose title run went through the New Orleans Pelicans, the Memphis Grizzlies, the Houston Rockets, and the Cleveland Cavaliers. While Golden State guard and Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry was relatively healthy during the postseason, opposing starting point guards were not: injuries to Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley, Patrick Beverley, and Kyrie Irving, respectively, meant huge postseason minutes for backups Norris Cole, Nick Calathes, Pablo Prigioni, and Matthew Dellavedova."
Best Player in the NBA:  1. Kevin Durant  2. Stephen Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. James Harden  5. Anthony Davis
"Mike Conley played and played well that series, New Orleans wasn't going to beat them anyways, Patrick Beverley would not have stopped Stephen Curry as Steph has historically destroyed him and Kyrie is the only legitimate argument you have. And what about Steph's injury in 2016 that affected his lateral movement? What about his dislocated finger this year? What about his sprained MCL last year? So what if he faced some injured PGs, it's not like that would have made a difference (except Kyrie)."

Curry: *brings the ball up the court*  KD: Hey Stephen Curry ;) You have something for me?
"For those who aren't aware, he said [this back in March](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-andre-iguodala-considers-stephen-curry-second-best-point-guard-of-all-time-behind-magic-johnson/), either Thompson is referring to that quote or Andre just doubled down.   This is a non-story, but even if it wasn't, it's not ludicrous either. Steph is that good."
"Okey ;) Time will tell ..when he retires. But in your example, curry is the jordan in warriors, durant is pippen even if he has 2 fmvp. Its stephen gravity again, durant as best man in his team lost against steph and never won nothing . Its just my opinion. Durant is awesome and unstoppsble ofensive force, a mvp, but i think curry is even better."
"#The Golden State Warriors, featuring unanimous MVP Stephen Curry, blew a 3-1 lead in the 2016 NBA Finals to LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers."

"It would be as hard for Steph to reach Magic level as it is/was to Lebron to catch Michael level, Magic is a top 5 player of all time and i don't hink that Stephen curry would end up in that company."
"Thank you Iggy. Watched the NBA religiously for 20 years and as amazing as Kobe Bryant and Duncan were, Stephen Curry in 2016 is the best I've ever seen a person play basketball in real time."
"Oh yeah. I was more talking about the loaded comment I usually see with ""If more young people spoke out xyz would be better"" but you can easily tell they mean ""if there were more Democrats xyz would be better."" Which is just absurd.   1. Young people vote Republican too. 2. While having only a 2 party system is one of the flaws of this country (there should be more) - Having only 1 party dictate everything (Dems or Reps) would turn us to the shitter faster than a Stephen Curry release."
Patrick Beverly with the green light of Stephen Curry
I’m glad that you mentioned this because it is 100% accurate. When you think about the absurd number of offensive Boards that McKinney and looney pulled down This change the whole atmosphere of the game because then you were giving Klay and Stephen Curry  two or three tries. Add that to the compounding of the inability to guard pick and roll and Kanter And Leonard  being slow and not able to contest shots at all and allowed them to get in a much greater rhythm than they would have otherwise

&gt; just needed KD out of OKC  Getting KD out of OKC definitely made their cruise to the Finals that much easier but it's really more than that. KD is absolutely necessary for GSW when Stephen Curry gets the sandbag treatment on offense without getting any calls from the refs and their entire offense suffers because of it.

"Fair point.  The only Curry that made any impact on the series, Stephen Curry.  He was losing his shit."
&gt; Stephen Curry has eliminated...future Rivers in-law Seth Curry   Paul George sends his regards.
Stephen fucking Curry just averaged 37 points a game in the WCFs. I don't want to hear anybody tell me he's anything other than amazing in the playoffs. Any other dude averaging that much would be crowned the undisputed best player in the NBA. He's closing in on a decent argument for best PG ever.

Stephen Curry = Stephen A Smith
"I want to see Steve Kerr coach a team without Stephen Curry and not what the current GSW roster has. I want to see what he can make out of a team like the Orlando Magics, Phoenix Suns, Sacramento Kings."
"Well, they’d be wrong. I know there was a bunch of talk about lillard being the best pg after he hit that series ending shot against the thunder, but was under like no pressure when making that shot.

Nope. Stephen Curry exists.

Their salary hits at about 81 million dollars while the cap is set for 109 million. The max salary is around 33 million so they wouldn't be able to sign a max player.   If you only sign one year deals and let Draymond walk next year too the Warriors would have 3 players for about 49 million dollars. (Steph is set to earn 43 million in 2020)"

Stephen Curry gave him a good time the other night and he forgot who he is
"Both of them make the players around them better.  &amp;#x200B;  However a system built around Stephen Curry, for the team that drafted Stephen Curry, should have Stephen Curry having a greater impact on his team.  &amp;#x200B;  Steph isn't a ""system player"" and don't twist my words into that what so ever. This is Stephen Curry's team and he's been their systems focal point so its natural that while keeping that system intact Steph has a greater impact.   &amp;#x200B;  Great players make their teammates better. That argument hasn't changed around KD, I just can't judge him against his own current team. The Celtics played better without Kyrie Irving but i'm not gonna call Terry Fucking Rozier better than Kyrie Irving."
"He WAS the best, but was never considred clear cut. I don't see anything wrong with that.  Deron Williams, Derrick Rose, Tony Parker, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry were all being debated as being better."
Exactly what I was thinking the whole time lmao just one future where Stephen Curry can shoot 81 consecutive and we’re just apart of that timeline.

Pollin dies in November. Leonsis comes in, we now have that issues.  December does around. Javaris Crittenton is up to no good and started making trouble in the neighbord. Do I think Gilbert is an idiot? Yeah. But he's our idiot. I don't think it was that bad but it was confusing and Caron Butler is a snitch. Even at the time, it was still confusing as to what the punishment would be. If you actually look into things, the real fuck up was him doing the shooting guns on a basketball court. Stern drops a hammer, I still think it was too much and we got fucked.   So now, we're in a spot where we have to figure things out. Our most impactful player in our history just got suspended. Grunfeld had to make some difficult choices and we made the choice to tank. We made trades to open up a new generation and honestly, Grunfeld did a good job at it. We can say the Gilbert Arenas contract is bad but he was such an impactful player and 'our guy.'"

"Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins.""  Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer.  ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game."
"Being 2016 Stephen SKYFALL Curry for 5 straight reg and post seasons, winning at least 2 chips in that stretch and FMVPs to go with it. Dominance is the key to be hailed as the best in the world. MJ dominated the 90s, Shaq, Duncan and Kobe split the 00s, Lebron has dominated very late 00s and 95% of the 2010s."
Stephen Curry doesn’t have a Finals mvp despite being in the Finals 5 straight years.
"This is literally what the article sounds like: “The warriors are a good team.  Other teams aren’t. This is because Steph is really nice to his friends like Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant.

"Or a Kawhi Leonard, or a Joel Embiid, or a Stephen Curry, or a Bradley Beal, or a Kyrie Irving, or a dozen other guys who were once seen as injury prone, but have gotten deserved max contracts?   Thomas was an extreme outlier for a number of reasons. No one expects that for Durant, nor should they."
"Yeah Curry wrote an article about it: https://www.gq.com/story/my-rookie-season-stephen-curry-hangs-at-lebrons-pad  Lebron still likes Steph just like he likes Durant, Draymond, Westbrook, Kawhi etc. Only the media created the narrative that he doesn't like Steph. Lebron is rivals on the court with all these guys but not off of it. Lebron even traded Westbrook for the all-star game and now they're hanging out in the summer."
"And in this year's playoffs when Lebron tweeted ""never underestimate the heart of a champion"" in reference to Steph when he was scoreless in the first half against the Rockets.   And then last summer when Lebron was on CNN praising Steph.  They have a long history Steph has hung out at Lebron's house before too Curry wrote an article about it: https://www.gq.com/story/my-rookie-season-stephen-curry-hangs-at-lebrons-pad  They're rivals now but it's the same way Lebron and Durant are rivals or Lebron and Draymond. They're rivals on the court but not off it."
"&gt;LeBron and Steph    They are not friends, but they respect each other. Growing up, LeBron was Curry's biggest role model and maybe even favorite player. LeBron's old jersey is still hung up in Curry's childhood room  &gt;  LeBron called the President ""a bum"", coming in defense of Curry.. publicly. You don't need to hang out every night and go to dinners or some shit. No player has that kind of relationship with each other, except for teammates.   &gt;  I really don't know why so many people, even Stephen A Smith.. badly wants LeBron and Curry to hate each other.. but that has never been the case. LeBron is a role model for almost everyone in the NBA right now, and outside of the NBA. That's bigger than just being ""friends"" or some shit. Don't be a fool"
Lebron's father is Stephen Curry facts are facts
Stephen Curry agrees
"Nothing more ""vulgar"", than **Ayesha whining on national TV about not getting enough male attention** and Stephen being bad in bed..  All this while Curry was in the middle of a heated playoff series against the Rockets. Ungrateful, much?  &gt; “Which one? SF, Houston, Miami or San Diego?”  Yaas you slay! Don't come for the Queen!  Same shit as **Vanessa Bryant screaming ""Which one of my properties (I proudly bought with Kobe's money) do you want to see?""**  You think **a 30-y.o no name actress** can open multiple high-end restaurants with celeb endorsements, start foundations, get spots on major TV networks w/o.. fucking Stephen Curry?  But this moon face says..  &gt; ""He hasn’t invested a dime in my restaurant business.”  Speechless.  How many years should this moon face get in Canadian prison for all these delutional comments?   Yay, so proud to be Canadian."
Curry now renamed Stephen Carry
"   **It seems to me that if you go back ten years, a lot of former players were really skeptical about the increasing reliance on the three-point shot. And now we are in a place where basically everyone thinks shooting lots of threes is good. There may be some debate about whether you want to shoot as many as the Rockets or the Bucks do, but basically everyone thinks you should take threes. And if you can take a shot from twenty-three feet that is worth the points, that is better than a shot from nineteen feet worth two points. Why do you think that people were so slow to adopt this idea?**  So, you ready for this?  **Yeah.**  I don’t agree with that either.  **O.K.**  And by the way, I love \[the Rockets general manager\] Daryl Morey, for example. I have had this conversation with him. I have gone to \[Morey’s\] Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in Boston. I am not anti-information at all. As a founder of a charter high school, I understand that young people are judged by their G.P.A. and I understand that should represent their will. They are also judged by their SAT and ACT scores, which should represent their skills. When John Thompson was walking off of games [protesting](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/gtown/longterm/1999/thompson/archives/thomp011589.htm) things like Prop. 48, people felt like he was overstating that the test was culturally biased—but now we are coming full circle to realizing that there was some truth there. \[*In 1989, Thompson, the head basketball coach at Georgetown, walked off of the court to protest an N.C.A.A. rule that tied athletic scholarships to a formula that included standardized-test scores*.\]  It’s the same with analytics and the three-point shot. I remember watching your Houston Rockets play and you guys had—and please help me with their roster—you had Corey Brewer, you had J.R. Smith—  **Josh Smith.**  &amp;#x200B;     Josh Smith. You had a bunch of guys surrounding the three-point line, but that clearly wasn’t the strength of their game. But they had to adjust to the system, not the other way around. And so to answer your question, basketball has become homogenous because people follow, not because it is the right thing to do. Other than the Splash Brothers \[Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, of the Warriors\], I haven’t seen a team win a championship that primarily shot threes, and, in the Rockets case, shoot more threes than twos.  **O.K., we can argue about that, but it doesn’t seem—**  Whoa, whoa, let’s argue about it. Who has?  **The Cavs shot a fair amount of threes when they won. And this has only happened in the last decade, really, and the Warriors have won three of the last four titles.**  That’s what I mean by the tool and the toolbox. When you were watching Game 2 \[against the Raptors\], and things got really close, and Draymond Green, Shaun Livingston, DeMarcus Cousins, Andre Iguodala were standing around the three-point line, were they even thinking about shooting?  **Uh—**  No! That’s why they were playing a box-and-one against. The Splash Brothers make volume threes. That’s unique to them.  **But it doesn’t seem that controversial—and correct me if I am wrong, because I am not an expert—but you are not going to shoot that much better from nineteen feet than from twenty-three feet, and you get one and a half times as many points for taking one and a half steps back. That’s common sense, no?**  And you could be a basketball expert. Don’t dis yourself. You could be running a team, you could be running your magazine. I want to give you credit. But here is what you are missing. What you are not taking into account is the flow of the game. What about taking a contested three versus pump-faking, going in and getting an uncontested two, or driving to the basket and getting fouled?  **Fouls and drives are good; I don’t think anyone is arguing against that.**  The reason to me why the Rockets can’t get over the top is that when you play against them in the playoffs, all you have to do is suffocate the three-point line and contest at the rim.  **Aw, c’mon, Jalen.**  I am trying to tell you.  **They lost in seven games last year to one of the best teams ever. I don’t know that there is a lot of shame in that.**  That’s different. I didn’t say there was any shame. Here is what happens: the further you get—high school, college, pro regular season, pro postseason—the tougher the scouting gets, the tougher the defense gets, the harder it is to get a high-quality shot against the best minds in the game that are coaching and the best athletes to ever do it. If I only have to guard you in two places, this is what gives me an opportunity to actually succeed versus if I have to guard you in five places. And, by the way, this is a healthy debate. Don’t feel any hesitancy to come back at me. I love this. The other thing you don’t do when you are shooting all threes is get the other team in foul trouble. That is part of the game, too.  **Before we drop this, do you think the people who are doing this advanced-stats work are doing anything consciously nefarious, or you just think it disregards history and racial dynamics that you think are at play?**  I don’t want to diminish what they do. I love and respect the game and want all of the information possible. I don’t want to just see the grade on the report card. I want to see all the tests that were taken, all the exams. I want all of the information. But this idea that I am so smart because I know the stats and this now elevates me and puts me in a position of power and/or puts me in a position to get a job solely for that reason, that is where the blowback has come from. This is what all players know: numbers can be manipulated. If you are going to judge me on my assist-turnover ratio—I think it was Moe Harkless who had to shoot thirty-five per cent from three to get a bonus. I am watching the game with a remote in my hand saying he isn’t going to shoot it unless he is wide open. \[If Harkless had shot and missed a three in his final game of the season, he would not have received a five-hundred-thousand-dollar [bonus](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/12/15273142/moe-harkless-500000-bonus-three-point-percentage-trail-blazers).\] Players are smart enough. If you are going to judge me by the numbers, let me flip it on you and manipulate the numbers.  **You remember what happened when they gave players some of the All-Star voting? There were all kinds of crazy votes.**  Stupid votes. They didn’t take it seriously. I agree. And, by the way, I am not anti-information or anti-analytics, or anti-giving really smart people who study numbers opportunities. I am just saying that that should be a wrench, that should be a hammer, but it shouldn’t be the toolbox."
"I mean yes. The lead story from Stephen A. Smith was immediately about the stupidity of JR Smith. Obviously Lebron got praise, but yeah.  &gt;Look at all the “Now Curry knows what it feels to be BRON” posts here and on twitter.  That's just obvious. We've all been watching Lebron go through what Curry just did for years."
"&gt;You mean the team that won 73 games, had an improved Curry and lost against a vastly better team by 4 points in game 7?  In the post-season, Stephen Curry was better by every metric in 2015 vs. 2016. Every single one.   &gt;So the Celtics were playing elite defense in these playoffs?  Given the fact that they were elite in the regular season and continued that into the post-season, yes."
Will Stephen Curry outscore the Raptors? Will Klay or KD return? Have Golden State's Finals hopes been dashed? Find out next time on Steph vs. The Raptors.
"I mean, some of it is also the team you're on. Stephen Curry is a generational talent, but he couldn't single handedly win a championship."

Fun Fact: Dell Curry and Steph Curry are both named Wardell Stephen Curry.
"How about 3pt shots while being right handed and named Stephen Curry and playing for the Golden State Warriors?  - some ESPN journo, probably."
"Stephen Curry has never been a secondary character in the nba finals nor in any other stance in the warriors, the guy's a legend like it or not"

Stephen Curry not playing with his usual superstar team makes me kinda appreciate Lebron a little bit more. Damn.
Max Kellerman tomorrow: StEpHeN CuRry ChOkED aNd HiStOrY wILl rEmEmBeR iT tHaT wAy. I’m so glad SAS called him out over his shit today. On the bright side for ESPN whatever brute doing is working lol
"We are but men, drawn to act in the name of revenge we deem to be ""justice"" -Stephen Curry tonight probably 🤣"
The warriors lost but stephen wardell curry won my heart
Curry has always played with the second best shooter of all time not named Stephen. LeBron would have killed for JR Smith to have instead been any of: Klay Thompson. Kevin Durant. Draymond Green. DeMarcus Cousins. Andre Iguodala. Shaun Livingston.
"So is fouling Stephen curry on every shot, apparently"
"Based on your logic, stephen Curry is 2-6 also without me playing. So, guess they need me."
"Reggie: ""Stephen Curry, WELCOME TO YOUR LEBRON MOMENT!"""
Stephen Curry vs The Toronto Raptors.
Hats off to Stephen Curry
I can hear stephen smith blaming the warriors bench by not helping curry lol
"Stephen ""Lebron James"" Curry w/ 50+ points in a losing game"
Stephen Curry is really good at basketball and its pisco g me off
"**Congratulations Stephen Curry!** You have just completed your trial run of the *LeBron James Finals Experience.* If you would like to renew your membership, please confirm below."
"Before the overreactions start.  Let me say congratulations to the Toronto Raptors for winning the Finals. They absolutely earned it and deserve it for being the best team in the NBA.  Second, I have gained so much respect for Stephen fucking Curry. He played the best offensive and defensive team with no real help to help carry the load from his team. He gave it his everything every game and you can see that in his stats and game. You can tell he just gave up when Kawhi made that easy up in a Game 3 Away game.  No Klay Thompson, No Kevin Durant.  I honestly do believe these Finals could have ended differently in 7 games had the Warriors had a healthy team. Until then, I will see you guys [next season!](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3a4h3t/post_game_thread_the_golden_state_warriors_defeat/cs97cys/)"

stephem curry more like stephen camry running 80mph half tank carryibg his kids to school while dad kd and big bro klay are out lmao
someone get me a photo of that kyle lowry stephen curry ball hug I'm going to write some fanfic
"Stephen Curry is helpless without Klay by his side, that's why it's funny when I hear people saying Curry can carry a team like LeBron. Steph Curry makes great teammates looks elite, Lebron makes scrubs look good"
Stephen Curry? More like Stephen Barbecue Chicken
Stephen curry must be so mad. He about to drop 50 and still lose
"Stephen ""James Harden"" Curry"
Warriors might lose but this game is really helping the legacy of one Wardell Stephen Curry
Fuck Stephen Curry!
"No Thompson, no Snek, out of shape Cousins, and a bunch of other injuries,....and they're still in this game because of one man. And one man alone.   If this were a band it would be **""Stephen Curry and the Screensetters""**."
"Typical fucking Stephen Curry, making shots nobody has any right to make."
Did I hear Stephen Curry as a producer for a weird game show?
Stephen Curry Executive producer!
Stephen Curry is Now an Executive Producer?
"It goes unnoticed because of how stacked the Warriors generally have been, but Stephen Curry is an elite one-man offense."
"Stephen Curry remains quite good at basketball. Now, will he get any help in the 2nd half?"
"I find it so weird that in 2004 the Nba decided to ban hand checking in the NBA, for everyone except dell curry's 16 year old son Wardell Stephen Curry"
Stephen Curry has 58% of the Warriors points.
Stephen Curry is not appreciated enough

"I’m not “changing narratives” I’m calling you a fucking nutcase  I made a “beautiful mind” reference, because it’s a movie about a guy who tries to use game theory/mathematics to explicate the whole world and becomes a batshit recluse  I’m done with this shit, dude  I’ve seen you go on an on about “impact metrics”  I’ve seen you openly talk shit about Ben Taylor, presumably because he doesn’t think Kobe is as good as you do  **Cite your sources.** Show your work. You go on and on about impact metrics, here are 12 players, arranged by BPM, cutting off late career bullshit like Wizards Jordan and post-Achilles Kobe  Everything about this list makes intuitive sense—Steph’s elite OBPM, his mediocre (but not terrible) DBPM; Kawhi and Pippen being great at both; Jordan and LeBron at the top; Melo at the bottom, giving up whatever he adds on offense  Cards on the table, I want two things from you:  1) tell me where you rank Kobe all-time, overall and peak  2) tell me why this list is wrong, because it says Pau was good as fuck.

"not surprised. at all. stephen ""kobe"" curry is shooting 40 times tonight"
"It's a middle school defense that completely neutralized the only unanimous MVP Stephen Curry, holding him to a grand total of 0 points."
"Pretty sure Warriors at home is still favored even with Klay out.  Even with all those injuries, Warriors starting lineup still includes Stephen Curry, Demarcus Cousins, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala. That’s insane."

"Here is what Kerr said when he heard those reports.  &gt;""Nobody has said anything about Steph being 70 percent to me,"" Kerr said. ""Training staff, relatives, friends, sources with knowledge of the team's thinking — nobody has told me he's 70 percent. Evidently they told the media but not me.""  &gt;He added, ""Is he bothered a little bit, perhaps by the layoff when he went three weeks without a game? He may not be quite where he needs to be, but it's not an injury, and that's the important thing. ... It's the playoffs, and nobody cares. Everybody has issues and injuries.""  [Heres a source](https://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-struggles-2016-5)  I would be interested to see quotes of what the Cavs training staff had said about it."
"I don't want to rank them but I do have ten players that I believe are ""the best"" in my lifetime.  - Kobe Bryant  - Stephen Curry  - Kevin Durant  - James Harden  - Allen Iverson  - LeBron James  - Michael Jordan  - Karl Malone  - Dirk Nowitzki  - Shaquille O'Neal"
1) Kevin Durant  2) LeBron James  3) Kawhi Leonard  4) Anthony Davis  5) Stephen Curry  It's honestly a very defensible list
"I know Stephen A is usually a hot take guy but I feel like these rankings are actually something he believes.   I agree with them mostly... I think Lebron, KD, Kawhi are my top 3. But after that it has to be some combination of Curry, Harden, and Giannis."

Give me a Stephen Curry and four Jacobs and I'll take my chances.
"&gt;""The pitch meeting, according to Steph's father, Dell, who was present, kicked off with one Nike official accidentally addressing Stephen as 'Steph-on,' the moniker, of course, of Steve Urkel's alter ego in (the TV show) Family Matters. 'I heard some people pronounce his name wrong before,' says Dell Curry. 'I wasn't surprised. I was surprised that I didn't get a correction.'  &gt;It got worse from there. A PowerPoint slide featured Kevin Durant's name, presumably left on by accident, presumably residue from repurposed materials. 'I stopped paying attention after that,' Dell says. Though Dell resolved to 'keep a pokerface, throughout the entirety of the pitch, the decision to leave Nike was in the works.'""  from: https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/the-14-billion-man-why-nike-lost-nba-superstar-stephen-curry-to-under-armour.html"
Yes... [\[Please do this\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/wizards/the-time-stephen-curry-was-held-scoreless/2015/05/29/5ebb8fd2-061e-11e5-93f4-f24d4af7f97d_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.36dd1b108811).
His defense was also a train wreck that series. Curry has been a better defender than he's been given credit for his career but that series was the one in particular he just sucked.   As the series went on it became impossible to ignore the elephant in the room that LeBron had just put a big giant bullseye on Steph putting him in every pick and roll possible. And [Steph just couldnt manage it was more and more obvious as that series went along](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/6/17/11962114/stephen-curry-defense-nba-finals-2016-warriors-vs-cavaliers)
"Those are all cases where a player draws defenders to them and away from their teammates. Just because a lot of off-ball gravity goes unappreciated doesn't mean it's suddenly the only kind there is. For example, [here's a Golden State of Mind article talking about Steph's gravity which includes his on-ball play.](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2018/9/17/17862874/nba-2018-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-system-video-play-breakdown) Defining gravity to only be off ball would leave you pretty lonely and miscommunicating with most people."
"The pullup jumpshot is a subset of all jump shots. Whereas many jumpers might come from a fadeaway or turnaround (where you are moving in the air as you shoot), or a standing position or quick catch-and-shoot (with no dribble), a pullup jumpshot generally involves the player moving up the court dribbling the ball towards the basket before setting his feet and going directly into shooting. It was not traditionally a common shot because coaches did not think it was a good decision, but Mr. Wardell Stephen Curry II happens to have a very lethal one and pullup jumpers have become more and more common in recent years as shooters around the league have become more effective with it and coaches have thus been more accepting of it.  Steph also has my vote for the greatest pullup jumpshot of all time, in what was a hotly contested overtime game against a rival team a few years ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEMVGHoenXM  Also, if you see anything about a ""hesi pullup jimbo"" - don't be confused, it's a joke based on an unintentionally hilarious Kevin Durant tweet that never gets old."
"It always confused me how he was ""Stephen Curry II"" when his dad is ""Dell Curry"".   Then I see they're real names are ""Wardell"". I had followed Curry since Davidson and had no clue Stephen was his middle name."
"""Get fucked sky"" -Stephen Curry"
"oh so now youre just a hater. 14 foul calls is half of what stephen curry should be getting, or are you actually not watching him play or his offball plays?"
"wtf do you mean no excuses. 5 all stars was always a luxury. 3 all stars in steph dray and boogie is still enough talent to get it done, or at least play evenly with the raps.   stop acting like we're done. we have the better coach and the best player on the floor in stephen curry. the warriors still have every reason to win this series. it's the Warriors' to lose, not the Raptors' to win"
"Title is inaccurate, did not specify if it is Wardell Stephen Curry II or Wardell Curry the first. /s"
"i would give the ball to Durant. You've got to love Curry though, and he has a big shot too. He's an amazing player and he should be in the MVP conversation again next week for sure.   Who does you think won the biggest shootout? It would just have to be Steph vs. KD, Klay vs. James or KD vs. Love, but Love has really developed a lot, James really has developed a lot, and Love is just so underrated. For me it'd be Stephen, though I personally prefer Klay over Steph, as he has a lot more to offer both offensively and defensively.   Who do you love the most in the NBA? There is something so special about Kawhi Leonard right now. He has the ability of being a true superstar, a guy that everyone would be proud to play at some point in their careers. He also makes a great team, so everyone who isn't playing or watching on TV can admire him every game he plays at any venue. He makes me laugh every time he comes on our basketball team. He just looks so amazing.  Thanks for taking the time to read! I love it!"
"&gt; There haven't been further signs of strife since. However, according to members of the Warriors, Stephen Curry played a key part in stabilizing the team following the incident. Curry wasn't at that game because he stayed in Oakland, California, to rehab a groin injury. In the Facebook documentary ""Stephen vs. the Game,"" directed by Gotham Chopra, who also made Tom Brady's ""Tom vs. Time,""    &gt;   &gt;Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Curry was ""integral"" in helping the team. ""When we returned to the Bay, he was an integral part of trying to repair our spiritual injury,"" Kerr said. ""Every good team has to have kind of coalition builders, guys who can build bridges and bring people together, who have the respect of everybody. And that's what Steph represents for us,"" he added. Warriors general manager Bob Myers said in the documentary that Curry is great at knowing what to focus on and what to ignore.    &gt;   &gt;Mark Medina of The Mercury News reported in March that when the team got back to Oakland, Curry went to Green's house to meet with him privately. Medina also reported that Curry met with Durant privately. On November 15, just days after the verbal altercation, Curry sat between Green and Durant on the bench and often shared laughs with both. Green told Medina that Curry played ""an important role"" in settling down the situation, saying, ""He was tapped into the situation from the beginning."" Klay Thompson told Medina that Curry is a ""great voice of reason during times of turbulence."" It all traces back to Curry's personality.   &gt;   &gt; **Curry isn't always considered a vocal leader, but he knows when to speak up. Perhaps more importantly, he's light-hearted, funny, and keeps things loose. Green said in the documentary: ""This whole entire organization has taken on Steph's joyful basketball, his demeanor and presence, just the carefree way he goes about things.""**  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-saved-warriors-kevin-durant-draymond-green-fight-2019-5](https://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-saved-warriors-kevin-durant-draymond-green-fight-2019-5)  Draymond isnt the leader just cause he says shit. The whole team rallies behind Steph - time and time again they get sick of Draymond's shit when they're not winning."
"Joe Lacob probably saying to Steve Kerr we need you just for one corner bucket at the of the game, because Stephen Curry gravity will draw 2 defender, and someone will pick off a Raptor player for Kerr corner 3"
Nav Bhatia has a Stephen Curry tattoo????
Warriors. It would really be great if Stephen Curry can overcome the great adversity and do some spectacular things without KD and Klay around.
"I remember being in college (2008-2012) as a surface-level fan of the league and hearing all about Steph Curry's reputation as mr [""glass ankles](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14750602/how-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-got-best-worst-ankles-sports)"" when they warriors were miserable and running out like the Monta Ellis / Curry backcourt.    &amp;#x200B;  Now, he's looked at as one of the greatest shooters ever and the best 3pt shooter ever.   Point is, you never know the path a player's career arc will follow. Trae definitely is showcasing the most Curry-esque shot selection. As for efficiency, we'll see! Here's to a healthy career with a trajectory his Rookie year is implying (greatness).   &amp;#x200B;  Ice Trae is a fierce nickname though - he's got that locked up."
"&gt;Lebron is a playmaker who can score- Messi,  You can say this about soooo many players. [Here's Messi comparing himself to Curry.](https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/05/24/lionel-messi-stephen-curry-copa-america-golden-state-warriors)"

"In his 2009 draft diary:  Trust me: It’s the worst draft class since the infamous Kenyon Martin Draft in 2000. If I had to bet my life on any 2009 prospect becoming a top-three player on a championship team, I’d bet on Blake Griffin, Ricky Rubio and Stephen Curry. That’s it. You’d remember this draft as Suckapalooza 2009 someday if it hadn’t happened on the same day we lost Michael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett. Only the Clippers could have the No. 1 pick on a day like this, right?     Only had 2 MVPS, 4 making all nba teams, 6 all stars....

It may be just the guy who's been through enough of the sport to know it's all about looks.  When Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry has to wear make-up while he plays, he's trying to look like the NBA's favorite movie star. He wears a wig, a black-and-white suit, black shoes, and black gloves. He even wears a pair of red, gray, purple, and pink socks."

"Curry has missed a combined 42 games in the past two seasons. Durant missed 18 and has only played 4 80 game seasons in his career. Draymond missed 28. Not the most durable players in the league by far. Besides, injuries are injuries and your team's fortunes were definitely helped by injuries to the opposing team's key players. Doesn't matter whether they were injury prone or not (Love and Kawhi were definitely not)  Klay played 39 minutes in game 1, which Raps won by 9. Game 2, Klay plays 32 minutes, Warriors win by 5. Game 3, Klay is out, Raps win by 14. Game 4, Klay plays 42 minutes, wins by 13. Game 5, 42 minutes, Warriors win by 1. Game 6, 32 minutes, Raps win by 4. Even if Klay averaged 42 minutes a game, that wouldn't have made that much of a difference. With 0 minutes played by Klay in game 3, Raps won by 14. The next game he played 42 more minutes and the Raps still won... this time by 13. He didn't make much of a difference in game 1 either, despite having played 39 minutes. The two games he was injured for the entire 4th quarter, the record was 1-1 with GS having an aggregate lead of 1 point. If Klay played 56 more minutes in this series, I doubt he would've been the one to take it to 7. The Raptors were definitively the better team.   All your arguments are basically ""What-If"" scenarios, devoid of any empirical evidence. Even in your hypotheticals, you're not comparing how the lineups match up with each other. Who's doubling teaming Kawhi on Houston? Tucker and Gordon? Tucker and Capela? Paul and Tucker? He wrecked Simmon/Butler &amp; Embiid, Giannis &amp; Middleton, Iggy &amp; Klay. What makes you think Houston would've done better defending him? What about Siakam? Are you really trusting Capela to lock him down, prevent him from getting to the rim, especially as he's trying to stretch to the perimeter to contest Gasol's 3s?  More importantly, how does Houston score 110-120 points against Toronto, the best defensive team in the playoffs, the team that was able to lock down Stephen Curry, the team that significantly cut down their opponent's season scoring numbers in each and every round? If they were able to gameplan for Giannis and Curry, you think they'd be stumped by Harden and a washed up Chris Paul?   Sorry, dude, but your contempt for the Raptors has broken your brain. Just accept the L and move on."
Oh wow I got him confused with his personal trainer.

Stephen Curry.   Always pick the sure thing.
"It's tough to be in the West as a PG when there is Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Tony Parker, and Steve Nash all at the same time.   For as good as Baron Davis was with the Warriors, he never made an All-Star game with them because the West was that tough for PGs."
Exactly this is why I dont get excited by shooters or 3 pointers. I can just go to the local gym and watch people make 3s there. I watch the NBA to see the best athletes do things you won't see anywhere else. Like someone Brown blocking a dude with his forearm while having his head at the rim. Or a dude jumping right over someone and putting them on a poster. Fuck this Stephen Curry dribble around and shoot a 3 shit I can go watch a random pick up game and see people doing the same shit.

"It really isn't a separate argument. You were talking about composition: nobody picked the Raptors to win with the roster that they were fielding. Most analysts conceded that they'd win one game, MAYBE two, but NOT the championship. They had one superstar in Kawhi Leonard, yeah? With Klay and KD out, that leaves Warriors with Stephen Curry still - one superstar - and yet there's no shortage to the excuses that you're giving the Warriors. Without Klay and KD, the Warriors could still field a team of Cousins, Draymond, Iggy and Curry. That lineup is NOT a joke whatsoever.   Nice try, but I have no resentment built up from the Raptors' past failures. You're the one here who can't accept the fact that the Raptors with one superstar played amazing basketball over the Warriors. I've been watching the NBA ever since I could remember, and coming from a country outside North America, I don't owe allegiance to any team, but it seems that you do. I enjoy basketball for what it is, but you're the one who's too far gone if you think that the Warriors ""pretty much handed the Raptors the championship"" when both teams fought tooth and nail for it. Stop giving the Warriors excuses when they themselves never gave any."
"Lol illegal defense AND the Bulls don't shoot threes, give the team with Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry."
"I mean Stephen curry believes in the same shit Kyrie said, about the government not telling us everything, nasa lies and not landing on the moon.  To this day they say they don’t know how to get passed the radiation belt on the way to the moon and keep humans alive through it.  Not saying for certain we didn’t reach the moon, but there are a lot of loopholes, and when curry publicly stated his beliefs, you’d think ahh w.e.  But no, even government officials quickly responded and media scientists were quick to try and turn Curry’s thinking around."

"Just want to provide a little more context re: percentage and counting stats, with some bonus advanced stats:    Player | FG% | FG3% | FT% | eFG% | PPG | FGA | PER | WS ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- James Harden | 44.2 | 36.8 | 87.9 | 54.1 | 36.1 | 24.5 | 30.6 | 15.2 Stephen Curry | 47.7 | 43.7 | 91.6 | 60.4 | 27.3 | 19.4 | 24.4 | 9.7  I would classify Harden's percentages as impressive, especially considering the volume he shoots at. Sure, Steph outperforms him at every percentage stat, but Harden had almost 10 PPG more than Steph on roughly 5 more FGA per game. With Steph missing key teammates next year and needing to shoulder a larger offensive load, I can't honestly see him maintaining his efficiency while somehow matching, or even coming close to, Harden's counting production.

"I was talking about you not being a fan of the team and how your post read in my mind like the kind of thing I see on many team subreddits when some players get hurt to improve the fans' spirits, that's all.  As for how I feel about Stephen Curry, not that it mattered when I was posting before: I admire his efficiency, I am perhaps conflicted about his impact on the way basketball is played both in the NBA and worldwide, and personally I am annoyed with some of his mannerisms. I was glad they didn't win that year because I didn't want to hear that that team was the greatest of all time and I think it would have misled some into thinking that way.  I think that the best reasonable hope is for an individual performance similar to, but not clearly surpassing, those of recent MVP winners/candidates. He has to stay healthy, and if GSW re-signs their injured stars, they'll have to figure out who to put around Curry for a lot of minutes. As a result of the three-point revolution that he helped bring about, it's likely that it'll be harder to get good deals for/discover 3&amp;D players that they'll need to put next to Curry to hold things over until the stars come back. If there's almost no one else who can shoot, Stephen Curry can be as good as humanly possible and both he and the team will struggle because others will always be able to double and send help."
"Of the superstars that started their careers in the 2000s or 2010s so far:  T-1. Stephen Curry - 3 championships T-1. Lebron James - 3 championships 3. Dwyane Wade - 3 championships T-4. Kevin Durant - 2 championships T-4. Kawhi Leonard - 2 championships  I think we will likely see players fizzle out around 3 championships these days. It will be rarer to see players get to the amount that Kobe, Duncan, Jordan, etc. got to.  This is by design. We now have not only the luxury tax, but also the repeater tax, making it difficult to sustain stacked teams in this era. Curry, James, Wade, and Durant were all part of super teams (or multiple super teams in the case of Lebron), and none of them have gotten past 3 rings yet.  Because the CBA is designed for every increasing parity with the repeater tax in there now, I would guess people probably need to re-assess how many rings they expect players to win in their careers."
"Wardell Stephen Curry, #30 for the Golden State Warriors, born of one Sonya Alicia Curry is also better than AD."
"Stephen Curry is a conservative evangelical Christian (his brother played at Liberty!) who probably would be Republican if the party wasn't totally beholden to Trump.  It is worth noting that the three main issues he talks about are race relations, guns, and the death penalty.  Those are probably the few issues that Curry is progressive."
"Fuck that. This is loser talk. Warriors got cheated out of a threepeat why should they congratulate a team that didn't beat them fairly? Not only that, this full-page ad is a picture of Stephen Curry. Doesn't even show Kawhi (and hides Lowry's number/face). This is a massive troll job if anything!!!!   Dubs dynasty lives on baby."

*Stephen Curry has left the chat*
1. It's in the excerpt: &gt;Stephen Curry. At this moment — taking into account the franchise’s plan to move off Shaun Livingston’s contract before July 10 — Curry is the oldest Warriors player. He’s the only one left who was born in the 1980s.  2. Shaun has been around a very long time in the NBA and I didn't think his nickname would be that unknown
"2005 Kobe was 3rd Team All NBA.  He didn't finish top 15 in NBA MVP voting.  Lakers missed the playoffs.  Stephen Curry was a more effective player in 2015, 2015 was LeBron's worst year from 2008-2018 when we went back to Cleveland.  It's probably close though"
They literally won shit with Stephen Curry you dweeb
"Interesting part for all you lazy folk:  &gt;The Warriors enjoyed having Durant, and he enjoyed playing in Golden State. Still: They never found a permanent comfort zone together. Teammates and coaches looked for hopeful signs. When Durant and Stephen Curry sipped wine together for hours after a team dinner in Denver during Durant's first preseason with Golden State, coaches smiled. The two stars were getting to know each other, getting over the awkward stage. &gt; &gt;But Durant would withdraw. He grew so quiet during the middle of the 2017-18 season that coach Steve Kerr summoned him to lunch in Portland before the All-Star break. ""I don't want to lose you,"" Durant remembered Kerr telling him. &gt; &gt;""He had been drifting a bit,"" Kerr told ESPN after the 2018 NBA Finals. ""He's vulnerable. I felt the need to reconnect."" &gt; &gt;There was a natural tension -- ""stylistic tension, not personal tension,"" Kerr said then -- between Durant's approach and the Warriors' beautiful game, even if Durant had the savvy and skill to meld them. That tension came to a head during the 2018 Western Conference finals, when the Houston Rockets' switching defense jammed Golden State's motion and coaxed the Warriors into more one-on-one play. Durant slumped. Critics howled. The Warriors almost lost. &gt; &gt;But they didn't lose. On the flight back from Houston after Game 7, Durant sat next to Bob Myers, Golden State's president of basketball operations, and declared, ""I have never felt more a part of the team,"" Myers recalled last year. &gt; &gt;Maybe some of it was baked into the unique four-star construction of the team. The Warriors were too good for observers to discuss anything but their internal dynamics. Even well-meaning attempts at that discussion could grow grating for the subjects of it. Maybe it was hard for Durant to feel a part of the Warriors if all anyone could talk about was what he had done to the Warriors -- to the team's style, to its identity, to the legacy and standing of its stars. &gt; &gt;It surprised almost no one that he left. Some within the team worried during parts of 2017-18 that he would depart after that season."

"Pg did not have a top 3 offensive season. Hanes Harden Stephen Curry, LeBron James and Giannis at the very least all had better offensive seasons and then I would also say jokic.

"[Thompson] Stephen Curry flew straight to the New York area from Shanghai, China. But he wasn’t going to pitch Kevin Durant on why he should stay with the Warriors. It was already too late. And Curry didn’t turn the jet around or cancel the trip.It was about respect. It was about butt fingering."
"Most analysts do not put durant over bird, so there’s that.  There’s something called deductive reasoning. If he attempts less 3s and scores the same points on similar FG pcts, what does that tell u about inside to mid range scoring.   U know what breaks down a double team?(box and 1) great playmaking. Double teams would not work on a top tier facillitator, duh. Lebron and bird would feast on a box and one lol. They took advantage of the fact that curry is just going to shoot 3s and exploited it. U do realize that box and 1 defense leaves people open right? And that’s why it’s not typically used on nba teams? U do understand that that’s not some ultimate defence that can’t be broken? It’s not used because it’s not useful in most cases. The fact that all raptors needed to worry about is curry chucking 3s is what made it useful. Using a box and one against an elite passer is not going to work.  If u actually watched the games, you would see that curry is not as clutch as ppl like kobe and bird. But then again u wanna talk pcts. Haha.  I agree that Steph is an anomaly that defences need try very hard to contain. Just don’t think that makes him better than bird.  Bird had injuries. He produced much less in his later years. Career stats should help Curry’s case.  Being the best guy on a team who won numerous championships is a very weird and arbitrary thing to rate someone on? Ok then. I guess it does not speak to ones legacy at all.  Ur gonna sit here and act like teams could play more defense on bird, but didn’t, and ended up losing. Obviously teams tried to shut down bird, it doesn’t work.  As previously stated, u can look at stats all u want. They beat a broken down cavs, lost to a cavs team they should have beaten. If the warriors are a better team than the cavs, and curry is the leader of the warriors, isn’t the responsibility on him when they lose? Does that not mean he didn’t play as well as he should have if the better team lost? What about Curry’s 3pt pcts in numerous games against the raps? On one half I remember he was like 1/8 or some shit.  On a side note, I don’t watch max Kellerman and Stephen a. I watch undisputed because it is hilarious tho."

Ever heard of a man named Stephen Curry?
No way in hell Stephen Curry is ever getting traded. Gonna get the Dirk treatment.
"&gt; He wrote the definitive autobiography for Stephen Curry  Autobiographies are self-written biographies, so unless Marcus Thompson is secretly also Steph Curry, he wrote the definitive *biography."
"Because that's such an outdated way of looking at the league. There are ball handlers, wings, and bigs. Curry and D'Lo are ball handlers, Klay is a wing. Period. The max really doesn't mean anything to us but Lacob's pockets. Beyond that, we aren't retaining anyone above minimum unless we have their bird rights and our FO is willing to pay the tax on them?  Where we gonna trade D'Lo for a solid 6th man, AND multiple defenders/shooters. And on top of that have their bird rights, and have our FO be willing to pay the tax on each of them.  That's far to idealistic, we have a 23 year old all star, who looks up to our franchise player and wants to be here. You don't pass that up trying to get the perfect bench for 1 year, before you have to blow it all up again. It's silly, and unsustainable. The only thing that leads to consistent championships is having a core set of players.  Not to mention it isn't just ""Run TMC again."" It's Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson man. Backed up by a legit DPoY. And with a young and up and coming all star to boot. We can contend right now and have a bright future with D'Lo. Or we can trade D'Lo for a few pieces and pray we win a chip in the next year or two, before we lose those roleplayers.  I don't want to see Curry, Dray, Klay spend the twilight of their career on a trash Warriors squad because we tried to go all-in and traded a promising young player."
"And you know...draft Klay at 14 instead of Derrick Williams at 2, and Stephen Curry at 6 instead of Ricky Rubio at 4 (god bless that face)   And then sign dudes like Durant, instead of maxing a dude like Wiggins."
He covers the Warriors professionally. He wrote the definitive autobiography for Stephen Curry and another for Durant from a distance.
"&gt;What does that even mean? The other two had a lot more Euroleague seasons. This was like Melli's 7th or 8th Euroleague season, of course his ""overal performance"", if you mean body of work during t heir careers, will be far more impressive.  well obviously, without taking into account prime length.   &gt;That wasn't the point though - my point was that if Saric played in the Euroleague next season, he'd be better than Melli ever was (like Melli this season).  Maybe. Hard to say.   &gt;You must be feeling very angry to turn  Huh? lol  &gt;Here's the thing: you said something completely absurd  Buddy, have you ever watched sports?  Why does Stephen Curry not shoot like 2015-16 every bloody season? Why does 2017-18 LeBron James passes better than 2013-14 LeBron James? Why does 2017 Roger Federer had a better backhand than 2008 Roger Federer? That's how performance works.  Why was Tim Duncan a better defender in 2006-07 than 2005-06?   You are quite unbelievable, you don't know the first thing about performance assessment in sports, I have absolutely nothing to gain from a discussion with you."
I threw Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry on this list simply because I was curious.
"For those on a budget....  ———  Stephen Curry flew straight to the New York area from Shanghai, China. But he wasn’t going to pitch Kevin Durant on why he should stay with the Warriors. It was already too late. He was on the plane when the news broke that Durant was leaving for Brooklyn.  And Curry didn’t turn the jet around or cancel the trip. Because it wasn’t about recruiting. It was about respect. It was about thanks.  It was easy to presume that if anyone could sway Durant, Curry would be the one. The point guard has been the Warriors’ biggest magnet, drawing the key pieces to the dynasty, including Durant and Andre Iguodala and coach Steve Kerr. It was Curry’s mojo that built this. It was his stamp of approval that sealed Durant’s arrival. His trip to New York was seen as a last-ditch effort to keep Durant.  But Curry went to have one last moment with Durant as teammates. To tell him one more time how much he appreciated him for the three years they had. They’d won two championships together. Dominated the league together. Made history together. He was there to wish Durant happiness and peace, express his support for his decision. And when Curry got to Durant’s apartment in Manhattan, Durant confirmed to Curry his decision that their time together was over. Face to face. Man to man. Friend to friend.  Neither Curry nor Durant responded to requests for comment. But what was probably unsaid, though, was what could have been. This moment illustrated one of the reasons, perhaps a significant one, Durant left — because Curry and Durant never really got to become Curry and Durant. It might have been the only thing that truly could have kept Durant in the Bay.  “He wanted that type of relationship,” said one source friendly with Durant. “It just didn’t work out like that.”  Durant had so many options in free agency, it was nearly impossible to know what he wanted. He made sure of that, too, by keeping his desires close to the vest and challenging anyone who presumed to know what he coveted.  But since he has decided, accepting a free-agent contract offer to play for the Brooklyn Nets and the teams later working out a sign-and-trade that sends D’Angelo Russell to the Warriors, some of the mystery has been uncovered. It wasn’t about money for Durant. He turned down the most he could get, which was $221 million from the Warriors, even with an Achilles injury that threatens his future earning potential. It wasn’t about the best opportunity to win a championship. While Brooklyn will now be a major player in the East, the Warriors were a proven championship contender on the cusp of a three-peat before injuries. An argument can be made that the Nets are younger and the Eastern Conference is an easier route, but those advantages pale in comparison to the experience and chemistry the Warriors core had already developed.  And this, clearly, wasn’t primarily about validating his legacy either. Undoubtedly, Durant has some critics he wants to rebut. But the biggest answer to his naysayers, the sure-fire way to make him the most legendary figure he could be, was to revive the Knicks. He passed on that, too.  Multiple sources have said for months Durant and Kyrie Irving planned on being teammates. Durant wanted them to join the Knicks together while Irving preferred they take over Brooklyn. They are now both Nets.  The decision by Durant revealed what he valued most: friendship. That DeAndre Jordan, another of Durant’s close friends, is also joining them in Brooklyn, reportedly, underscores exactly what was most important in Durant’s heart.  The money? He has plenty of it and will get plenty more. The winning? You can bet he is sure they are championship-worthy. The legacy? Like he said before, y’all know who he is.  It seems the real driving force was the opportunity to play with his good friends. It’s not surprising that such an opportunity matters to Durant. It always has, since he was a kid on the PG Jaguars AAU team. Camaraderie, fellowship, loyalty — truth is, these things have always been preeminent for Durant, even if some other desires and determinations tend to get in the way sometimes. He’s still a guy who wants to hoop at high levels with his homies.  If that was his greatest desire, it makes sense why he’s leaving — that was the one thing the Warriors couldn’t give him.  Durant came to the Warriors in search of a bond. Three years ago, when they met in the Hamptons, the visible unity the Warriors displayed stood out to him. They were four dudes who enjoyed each other and let that connection infect their play. Durant especially wanted that bond with Curry. That’s what drew him, according to many behind the scenes.  On paper, it made perfect sense. They are two humble guys, two players with a reputation for being selfless and easy going, two players who poured themselves into the game and have legendary work ethics.  But it never happened, not in the way that would keep Durant with the Warriors. To be sure, they got along. There was no behind-the-scenes fighting to speak of between the two. Ask Curry about Durant, he will rave about his talent and his heart. Ask Durant about Curry, he will lavish him heavily with praise. They were cool with each other. Still are. But their relationship could only go so deep because of their circumstances.  The biggest issue was timing. Durant arrived when Curry was 28 with two young daughters. Curry’s emphasis on being a family man cuts into his ability to be especially close with new people. Plus, Curry keeps a familial hedge around him. His entourage is mostly blood relatives, in-laws, close friends, business partners and employees. While his teammates are usually welcome, being with Curry requires being with his family.  Durant came to the Warriors a single man, new to the area and a free spirit. Their lives were in completely different spaces. Their hobbies were different. Durant, too, had his family and close friends around him. But as they faded from the forefront — his mother, Wanda, his brother, Tony, and his childhood friend Charlie Bell were far less visible in the Bay the last two years — Durant was left with his business partner Rich Kleiman and longtime friend and trainer Randy Williams, along with his Nike reps.  Durant is not the type to force his way into situations. If he meets too much resistance, or doesn’t feel the vibe, he is much more inclined to fall back.  They were friendly when together. They laughed incessantly. They supported each other. On many occasions, Durant used his platform to be supportive of Curry, buck back at his critics. Curry went out of his way to make Durant feel welcome. They both tried.  However, another reason they couldn’t bond fully was because they were often being pitted against each other.  Definitely by the fans, and in the space Durant frequents: social media. Even when Durant announced he was signing with the Warriors, on Independence Day 2016, while many Warriors fans celebrated, others contended the Warriors didn’t need Durant. Many fell in love with the 2015 and 2016 Warriors and scoffed when the team gave up its depth for Durant.  When the Warriors struggled, those struggles were pinned on Durant. His style of play was criticized. And Curry was the light under which Durant was scrutinized.  It wasn’t just fans. The media was complicit in presenting the Curry vs. Durant narrative, nationally and locally. The debate of who was the team’s best player continued in the background. How the team performed with either Curry or Durant absent was under constant watch.  And then there was the offense. Who runs it? Who has the ball in his hands? Who ends up iced out while the other gets fed? This discussion never ended.  Systemically, they had some issues. The Warriors preferred to move the ball, create offense by creating seams with motion. While Durant could play that game, that wasn’t his preferred style, especially when paired with players who couldn’t take advantage of the openings. And, invariably, Durant would get frozen out while Curry and Klay Thompson jacked up shots that would be ill-advised for others but were the foundation of what the Warriors built. And when the offense ran through Durant and it didn’t work, Durant took the heat.  All of it was fair game. Criticism, analysis, opinions — it’s part of the basketball landscape. It could be argued Durant should have been able to block it out, handle it better. It could be argued the Warriors should have adjusted the offense, adapted to its players. But the greater question is what was making Durant feel connected when everything else was trying to pull them apart?  That’s where friendship comes in. That’s where chemistry and the bond of players become valuable. The Warriors and Durant couldn’t build in three years, under the most intense of heat, the kind of bond that would survive all this. It was probably too much to ask from the beginning if that’s what indeed mattered most to Durant.  The original Warriors core isn’t as connected off the court as it may seem. None of them are inseparable away from the game. Each of their lives pulls them in different directions. Curry has his family. Draymond Green became a dad in 2016, altering his life significantly. Iguodala, who is also now on his way out with a trade to the Memphis Grizzlies, and Shaun Livingston also have their own families. And Thompson did his bachelor thing.  Probably the players who spend the most time together, away from team events, are Curry and Iguodala on the golf course."

"And the new ownership group started out his history with Stephen Curry and he got hurt shortly before the gap ballooned up. 10 million a year is really good. I don't want to say these owners are similar in anyway but I bring them up just because I am familar with them but Robert Sarver (the Suns owner) got the Suns in 2004 and got Shawn Marion, Steve Nash, and Amare Stoudemire. Suns had the second best record since the 2000's until last season and were pretty damn good. Now Robert Sarver is seen as one of the worst if not the worst owner in the NBA. Now the success the Warriors got is way ahead of even the 7SOL suns and one of the best of all time but they had some draft picks and some lucky signings (right after the cap increase) go their way and now we shall see how they do from here on out."

"I thought it was because [Nike didn't pitch him correctly](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15047018/how-nike-lost-stephen-curry-armour)?   &gt;The pitch meeting, according to Steph's father Dell, who was present, kicked off with one Nike official accidentally addressing Stephen as ""Steph-on,"" the moniker, of course, of Steve Urkel's alter ego in Family Matters. ""I heard some people pronounce his name wrong before,"" says Dell Curry. ""I wasn't surprised. I was surprised that I didn't get a correction.""  &gt;It got worse from there. A PowerPoint slide featured Kevin Durant's name, presumably left on by accident, presumably residue from repurposed materials. ""I stopped paying attention after that,"" Dell says. Though Dell resolved to ""keep a poker face,"" throughout the entirety of the pitch, the decision to leave Nike was in the works.  &gt;In the meeting, according to Dell, there was never a strong indication that Steph would become a signature athlete with Nike. ""They have certain tiers of athletes,"" Dell says. ""They have Kobe, LeBron and Durant, who were their three main guys. If he signed back with them, we're on that second tier."""

"George Jefferson is clearly reaching now as New Balance never said that shit especially since Kawhi's brand under New Balance is selling super well up in Canada why would they complain about that? They would be in big trouble if Kawhi went to LA competing against two global Nike superstars, see Steph Curry with Under Armor on in the Bay Area. Kawhi can do big business in Toronto because he's the main sports star up north so Stephen A. Snitch needs to go sit his reaching Canadian hating ass down somewhere and be salty after Kawhi stays with the Raps."
"The Warriors’ meeting with Kevin Durant will include a surprise guest in addition to president and general manager Bob Myers. Stephen Curry, according to multiple league sources, is heading to New York as well.  Curry, coming back from his Under Armour tour in Asia, is planning to stop and visit with Durant on the eve of Durant’s free-agent decision — with the official window for all teams to negotiate with free agents opening on Sunday at 3 p.m. PT.  Three years ago, Curry was part of a four-player contingent that showed up to pitch Durant during free-agent meetings and, with Durant, became known as the Hamptons 5. The other members of the Hamptons 5 aren’t expected to attend. Klay Thompson is set to have surgery on his torn ACL and has his own free-agency business to handle. Draymond Green has already visited Durant in New York this offseason.  But it could potentially be a big deal that Curry is going. Even though the Warriors have several All-Star-level championship players, Curry and Durant would be the pillars of the Warriors if Durant decides to stay. They would be the faces of the franchise and their relationship figures to be the most important.  Even in 2016, Durant said the key thing he wanted to know was whether Curry wanted him on the team.  Curry making a surprise visit to Durant seems to be a major gesture to show that he still wants Durant. Of course, Curry could be just stopping by to visit his friend and not necessarily pitching Durant, who has said he doesn’t want to be recruited. But the timing of his visit certainly seems to point to Curry putting his bid in to keep Durant.  Durant’s three years with the Warriors has included an undercurrent about whose team it is, with Bay Area fans loving Curry endlessly and Durant trying to garner the fan base’s appreciation. But Durant’s Bay Area love has never been higher and signing a max five-year deal would certainly endear him to the locals even more. What’s more, the offense on the court began leaning toward Durant as a facilitator and main hub near the end of the season and into the postseason, a trend that didn’t seem to bother Curry at all.  Whatever Durant decides will have a huge impact on the Warriors’ future. (He is reportedly also scheduled to talk to the Brooklyn Nets, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Clippers.) An alliance between Curry and Durant would ensure the continuation of the Warriors’ status as championship contenders, when healthy, for years to come. That is on top of the Warriors being able to pay Durant more money than anyone else and the Warriors opening a new arena in San Francisco, a perfect opportunity to rebrand the Warriors into a new era."

"I was thinking a while back if the NBA allowed players up to ten designated games for rest. For example Stephen Curry almost every year misses time due to an ankle or knee injury. What if the NBA allowed him ten games every season to treat himself and rest? Would it prevent another injury? Possibly. Would it be beneficial to him? Possibly. It's really just something we'd have to see to know if it works. Guys like James Harden could save their energy for the postseason, and hit peak performance in their quest for a ring."

"No he didn't...  &gt;After the Warriors' loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday night, Curry made no excuses. He did not take the easy way and say that he clearly wasn't himself, or say that if he was healthy, everything would have been different. He owned it.  &gt;""There isn't any surgery or anything in my future this summer. I need to get healthier, but there is no excuses for what happened on the floor,"" Curry said.

Just because they have Kawhi at #4 and PG at #10 or some shit like that doesn't mean that Kawhi is twice as good as PG.   Really there's very little separating the top players.

"Why do people call Stephen Curry ""Steven curry"" when he’s the most Stephen Curry named  person in nba history?"
How? Russ literally won’t move off ball. He stands at the top of the key when the ball isn’t in his hand every possession. So how is he an elite cutter  Also just because Russ can dunk doesn’t make him an elite finisher. He’s average to good in that regard. Elite would be Stephen Curry or James Harden or LeBron James.
"The only people who call him Only Unanimous MVP Stephen Curry are doing so because they think that puts him at a level above everyone else who has ever played.   ""LeBron had 4 MVPs but he shoulda had more.""  ""Yeah and he never once was unanimous. Unlike Steph Curry :)""  stop acting like you don't know what we're talking about"
"Dude his flare is Andris Biedrins.  He was here during the dark times when we thought that dude might be our first decent big man and maybe we’d actually have a respectable defense.  This man was raised on we believe.  There are thousands of bandwagon fans, but not this goddam hero who watched the dubs get shit on for 20 straight years.  This man watched us waste Antawn Jamison’s best years.  This man watched us trade away Gilbert Arenas.  This man watched us pin our hopes on clueless drafting every year until Stephen Curry.  Put some fucking respeck on his name."
“They do have a timeout.. decide not to use it.. CURRY WAY DOWNTOWN! BANG! BANG! OH WHAT A SHOT FROM CURRY.. WITH SIX TENTHS OF A SECOND REMAINING! THE BRILLIANT SHOOTING OF STEPHEN CURRY CONTINUES!”
"https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/stephen-curry-s-five-50-point-performances-sstl  There's Steph's 5 50+ point games over his career. All of them have at least 8 three pointers made, and 4 of the 5 have at least 10 threes. Drop the points from threes to twos and he doesn't break 50 a single time. Steph's lethality is from his shooting. His scoring is from his shooting. He doesn't actively look to drive the lane and create contact and efficient close-range buckets, he is just so unbelievably amazing at shooting the ball that he doesn't **need** to be great, only good, at those two things. Which you seem to be thinking me calling him **good** at those things is somehow a slight.   I don't think you watched Pete play very much if you don't think he'd try for 100 at least once. He is still the NCAA Div1 leading scorer by a mile and he did it with no 3 point line, AND having only three of his seasons count.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_career_scoring_leaders  We are talking about a guy who **averaged** 40 points a game 4 times in college. All four years. And only three of them counted; that link is the list of all time NCAA Div 1 scorers, and Pete is only one of 4 with less than 100 Games Played. In fact, he has the lowest amount of games played at 83 and STILL holds the NCAA record for points by over 400. I'd also like to direct your attention to what school each player on that list attended and note the difference between him and the next 9 players on the list (Ending with Hersey Hawkins). They all played for schools in mid-major conferences... except for Pete.  Speaking of which, Steph has played 10 NBA seasons, Pete Maravich played 11, so it's actually pretty easy to compare them side by side right this minute, and right this minute Pete Maravich still has a higher career scoring average than Steph Curry.   You can say whatever you want to about the defense, but there is a significant amount of NBA analysts that talk about Pete saying he was born into the wrong era and would be absolutely perfect for today's NBA, and he would be. He was quick, crafty, also had great range, and very deceitful with his passing game.   But, the entire point is still this: Pete Maravich would not need to be better than Steph Curry at 3s to get 100 points. The only time it has ever happened was because Wilt's teammates fed him the ball with the **explicit** purpose of getting 100 points, so it's pretty pointless to talk about the hypothetical and not assume that anyone else trying to reach that mark would not have the same thing done for them. I also explicitly stated I do **not** at all think Pete Maravich WOULD obtain a 100 point game in today's NBA, because if he did get the ball fed to him like Wilt did, he'd just get triple-teamed and be forced to give it up."
"1) Stephen Curry is black. Black people are capable of being light-skinned.  2) Never said white people can't be great basketball players.  3) Yes, black people are *generally* genetically predisposed to be more athletic than other races. They can generally run faster and jump higher than members of other races."

"I always imagine Brreen wildly falling back in a circular motion away from the mike on the first bang, quickly swinging back to say the second bang before jumping up and down to say the rest. And after gathering himself, he then dusts himself off, wipes the drool off his face, sits down and finishes with, ""The brilliant shooting of Stephen Curry continues!"""

"It bothers me more than ""Stephen"" Curry is pronounced different than other Stephen's."
"I'll do the Warriors, with how Stephen Curry has played in the playoffs, alongside a worse roster, they shouldn't be a lock for making it past the second round."
I think it’s more misleading because rest of the league includes all the below average guys as well. For example [Dame](https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/The-NBA-s-best-shooter-from-30-feet-Stephen-13852304.php) apparently shot 34.8% and 58.3% for 30-34 in the regular season and playoffs compared to 38.3% and 16.7% for Curry last year.

whats the deal with Stephen Curry? I've never seen him miss this much
Y'all know who i am cant finish at rim   Klay thompson forgot how to score just playing defense and Stephen Curry looks like he is in cruise mode
are the rockets fans here really trying to convince us that stephen curry exaggerates contact more than james harden? i don't know what to say.
Curry and Ellis got off to a really bad start. Ellis says he eventually quashed the beef though:   https://www.slamonline.com/archives/monta-ellis-looking-to-squash-beef-with-stephen-curry/
"People seem to forget how difficult a start Curry had in the NBA. He went straight into a team where the franchise player shitted on him before he even made his debut and criticized the FA for drafting him, saying that he couldn't play in a backcourt with Steph:   http://blogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami/2009/09/28/monta-ellis-on-pairing-with-stephen-curry-we-cant-not-going-to-win-that-way/  Imagine being on one of the worst teams in the league and then having to deal with being shunned by the team's star before you even played a single game.  Not only that,  but in Steph Curry's biography (Golden: The Miraculous Rise of Steph Curry) it details how Steph would reach out for a high five whenever he checked into the game for Monta but Monta would never reciprocate."
Alright but on the other hand Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry
The difference is Steph can be drowning in A-listers as well. A fringe NBA player will be drowning in hot instagram girls who don't have much beyond being extremely attractive. If Stephen Curry became single any A list celeb movie star who dates him would be like the biggest story in the media.

"    Baseball was the first sport I started watching as, like your parents and grandparents, I grew up watching with mine. It has been ""America's Pastime"" for the last century, and to the majority of average sports fans, baseball is boring. Just this past week, the Rays played the Royals and it looked like the stadium was empty (pretty sure Stephen a just mentioned this). Yes, it was an afternoon game, but the Rays are currently the best team in the AL East. The problem is that even with one of the best teams in the MLB playing, there is little to no marketing advertising this.   Major League Baseball has gotten some slack for the way they have marketed Mike Trout. He is undoubtedly the best player in the MLB, and on top of that, he plays in Southern California. He has 1.5 million followers on Instagram. Paul George, who plays in Oklahoma and is not even the most popular player on his own team, has 7.7 million followers. People don't notice how unbelievably good Mike Trout is, because he is not marketed as much as he should be, therefore nobody watches his games. He is the baseball equivalent of LeBron or KD, and is not even remotely as popular, let alone PG13.  We are gone from the days of the steroid era, and Ken ""The Kid"" Griffey Jr. This was when baseball was fun. MLB is trying to recreate those days, thus with the advertising motto ""let the kids play"". There are also rule changes being in place to make the game faster, a big reason why it isn't popular. However, so far this season, the MLB has not gotten nearly enough attention as the NBA or the NFL. You could make the argument that it's the NBA playoffs and the NFL draft just happened, which is true, but this happened last year and will more than likely happen again this year. By the time the MLB dog days of the summer start to start, around the time of the NBA summer league, people will want to watch the newly drafted college players: the Lonzo Balls, the Markelle Fultz's (at the time), etc. This year, ratings will be off the charts with the Zion attention. His summer league games will be packed to the limit. At the same time, baseball will not be talked about on the big sports shows (First Take, the Herd, Undisputed, etc). Also, the biggest sports Social Media accounts (Bleacher Report, ESPN, Sportscenter) post much more about basketball that they do baseball.   The best comparison, I feel, is how much attention the respected championship series of the two sports get. The World Series last year, between two of the most iconic franchises in the entire sport, averaged 14 million viewers. The NBA finals, featuring the same two teams for the FOURTH straight year averaged 17 million viewers. There is more interest in watching stars like LeBron, Curry, and Durant perform in the championship than Mookie Betts, JD Martinez, and Clayton Kershaw.   Wow, I just wrote a mini-essay."
"Baseball was the first sport I started watching as, like your parents and grandparents, I grew up watching with mine. It has been ""America's Pastime"" for the last century, and to the majority of average sports fans, baseball is boring. Just this past week, the Rays played the Royals and it looked like the stadium was empty (pretty sure Stephen a just mentioned this). Yes, it was an afternoon game, but the Rays are currently the best team in the AL East. The problem is that even with one of the best teams in the MLB playing, there is little to no marketing advertising this.   Major League Baseball has gotten some slack for the way they have marketed Mike Trout. He is undoubtedly the best player in the MLB, and on top of that, he plays in Southern California. He has 1.5 million followers on Instagram. Paul George, who plays in Oklahoma and is not even the most popular player on his own team, has 7.7 million followers. People don't notice how unbelievably good Mike Trout is, because he is not marketed as much as he should be, therefore nobody watches his games. He is the baseball equivalent of LeBron or KD, and is not even remotely as popular, let alone PG13.  &amp;#x200B;  We are gone from the days of the steroid era, and Ken ""The Kid"" Griffey Jr. This was when baseball was fun. MLB is trying to recreate those days, thus with the advertising motto ""let the kids play"". There are also rule changes being in place to make the game faster, a big reason why it isn't popular. However, so far this season, the MLB has not gotten nearly enough attention as the NBA or the NFL.

Do you know what assists are?  Because you are implying that durants assists are harder to come by while passing to stephen curry and klay thompson and cutters in the most lethal offense the world has ever seen.
"1-10 seems pretty good.. 11-25 is a bit off.. I would put Beal and Towns closer to top 15 over CP3 and Gobert.. also Irving and Embiid over Butler easily..   If I were to rank the top 35 players I would go...  1 Kevin Durant  2 LeBron James  3 Giannis Antetokounmpo  4 Kawhi Leonard  5 Stephen Curry  6 James Harden  7 Anthony Davis  8 Damian Lillard  9 Nikola Jokic  10 Joel Embiid  11 Paul George  12 Kyrie Irving  13 Karl-Anthony Towns  14 Jimmy Butler  15 Blake Griffin  16 Klay Thompson  17 Bradley Beal  18 Rudy Gobert  19 Russell Westbrook   20 Kemba Walker  21 Devin Booker  22 Victor Oladipo  23 LaMarcus Aldridge  24 Donovan Mitchell  25 Ben Simmons  26 Al Horford  27 DeMar DeRozan  28 Luka Doncic  29 Jrue Holiday  30 Mike Conley  31 D'Angelo Russell  32 Pascal Siakam  33 CJ McCollum  34 Tobias Harris  35 Chris Paul  &amp;#x200B;  Mentions.. Nurkic, Vucevic, Lou Will, LaVine, Randle, Middleton, Green"
"1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry (I know he’s not playing the best, but if his team didn’t have 4 all stars he’d probably be scoring a lot more) 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden (I don’t like him as a player, but he’s a good player) 6. Giannis"
"&gt;  Look at how badly kyrie cooked the warriors in 2016, you have a learning disability if you think they were better off without him.  Kyrie never needed to fit in, he is an iso scorer to give LeBron plays off.  I brought up K Love for a reason.  &gt;  Plus the Cavs were arguably the best team in the league post all star break that year. Lebron destroyed the warriors those first 3 games and just needed a second option, if kyrie was healthy the whole series I have zero doubt they win.  You know Kyrie got injured in game 1, right?  LeBron did cook us in games 2 and 3.  Harrison Barnes could not guard him and even when we put Iggy in the starting lineup to guard him, all we did was making him slightly less efficient.  Although that effectively ended the series.  &gt;  At the end of the day if you’re going to say you only lost 2016 cause of injuries then you don’t get to act like 21015 was some clean victory that your team deserved.  They lost game 1 with Kyrie going nuclear.  They legitimately played better in games 2 and 3 with just LeBron because we couldn't stop him.  We didn't, even when we won, we just slowed him.  But that Cavs team was a much better team in 2016 than they were in 2015, despite LeBron coasting hard during the 15-16 season.  And what happened with them playing much better basketball against a GSW team that had serious injuries to 5 players including - Stephen Curry, Bogut (our defensive stopper who made it harder for LeBron to drive) and Iguodala (who was guarding LeBron).  They had every advantage, their whole team healthy, and they barely won in a close 7 game series.  It's not some outrageous presumption that they might still lose in 2015."
Stephen Curry is a good shooter.
"To be fair, the actual report did allegedly include the Warrior's calls.   &gt; The Rockets appear to have incorporated all such instances in the report, including those that benefited the Warriors. For instance: with about 6:10 remaining in the first quarter, Stephen Curry drove on the right side of the floor. Gerald Green, the Rocket defending Curry, placed his right arm on Curry's hip as Curry rose for a layup. There was no call. The NBA flagged it as a ""potential infraction"" -- inconclusive, according to Houston's analysis. The Rockets counted that as a mistake that cost the Warriors 1.8 points -- a figure that appears to have been derived from Curry's career free throw percentage.  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26634745/rockets-audited-18-game-7-say-finals-bid-taken"
*Stephen Curry has entered the chat*
Jamal Murray is now a card-carrying member of the Stephen Curry Society
Sources say Stephen Curry has punched Steve Kerr during a practice.
"Jimmy Butler (Fire GarPax), Stephen Curry, Tim Duncan (RIP), Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard."
Yeah because he has Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry as help
Stephen Curry: The Pareto-efficient scorer
"KD absolutely could average 35+ ppg with enough touches. So could Stephen Curry, who averaged like 40 points in a month back in 2016. That doesn’t diminish Hardens feat at all, I’m just saying that with enough opportunities, and not many other options on the floor, a few other stars could elevate their game to crazy numbers."
"I was more fatigued by the Bulls and Lakers than anything else. By '98, it was kind of like, ""Of course, another nationally televised Bulls game. Bleh."" Yet by Game 6 of the Finals, I was back to appreciating the moment. We all kind of knew there was a good chance this was Jordan's last run, so different moments took on special importance  - [like his final game at MSG when he wore his Jordan I's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWLMir7yyCk).   I should also note that, as a Pistons fan, I hated Jordan prior to his first retirement in '93 then came to appreciate him quickly upon his return - perhaps in part due to the humanization of his brief underdog status.   The early 2000's Lakers on the other hand... I had no real qualms with them aside from the same old winning fatigue. I did, however, take pride in my franchise's part in dismantling a dynasty in spectacular fashion in 2004.   It seems I have a pattern in growing bored with dominance, yet I've loved watching Stephen Curry and the Warriors play all the way through. Go figure."

"Lmao I can’t state my point any more clearly but I guess I’ll try.  Draymond Green, Wardell Stephen Curry, and Klay Thompson, are all vital to the Warriors Dynasty. Without each of them, the Warriors Dynasty would have never gotten off the ground. The Warriors would have never won a ring, and the Warriors would have never been able to acquire KD. Stop trying to act like I’m saying something that literally nobody has said.  I’ve given you his post season WS stats, his DPOY, his all stars, his rings. If you don’t think all that isn’t proof he’s an irreplaceable cog in the Warriors dynasty, I’m wasting my time."
"Smh, they might as well give us Stephen Curry and take Reggie"
sigh... stephen curry
I am inevitable - Stephen Curry.
"Curry was 7. Just draft the next Stephen Curry, lol"
"Actually, tell it to Dell's granddad. Dell's dad was also Wardell Curry, but not Wardell Stephen Curry, which is why Steph's a II and not a III."
"/#1, #3, or #30?  #1 - Damion Lee, GSW  #3 - Damion Lee, SCW, formerly Seth Curry, SCW  #30 - Stephen Curry, GSW"
I never got the II vs jr.  It would be cool to have Wardell Stephen Curry Jr.
Why would you even suggest there is shame in the name Wardell. Literally no one thinks that. It's disrespectful for you to not honor the name Stephen Curry chooses to go by.
&gt; I feel like we should be comparing him to Stephen Curry   really
"I think in this system with this personnel makes a combo guard like Curry valuable. Go back a decade and teams were hesitant to draft a combo guard to slot in at the PG position because you need a system or the right personnel to set them up. At the time of Curry's draft, there were only a handful of personnel that had point skills outside of the PG position. Off the top of my head, I can remember Lebron, Iguodala, and Stephen Jackson as possible options (kind of a dream come true to have Iguodala sign with us, tbh). So, you still need someone on the team with good point skills to take the load off the combo guard."
"why is it that we only rank players based on their offense or their shooting percentages? there is much more to the sport than scoring, and so i think metrics like ""the top 10 players"" should reflect that. we only look at defense as supplemental, and use it to boost a player's case, like Kawhi's.   but a player's defense, if that is their role, is just as important as a player's offense, if that is their role, and their IQ is just as important if their role is to facilitate. Does Draymond Green's defense become more impactful than say Lillard's offense, from which we derive his ranking? Yeah, his defense is better than his offense. Are Draymond Green's IQ and facilitation more worth than Westbrook's offense and facilitation, from which his ranking is based? 100% Westbrook's stats are empty comparatively.   When it is all said and done, this Warriors team will have 5 Hall of Famers: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green. Take away Kevin due to injury and you're still left with, on paper, the greatest core of all time in the sport, the 73-9 core, the 3 time champions core, the 16-1 core, two mvps, dpoy, 6 man and finals mvp, 2nd greatest shooter of all time. Just like the Celtics that dominated with 5 HoFers, this Warriors team needs more respect put on their name, on Dre's name, and on Draymond's name.  You just don't do what they are doing right now with one top 3 player in the game today. You do it with **historically** great players. you become a dynasty with **historically** great players. Steph is a Top 15 player of all time right now, if not top 10. Klay Thompson is a Top 10 player right now because of his offense and defense comparatively to any other traditional Top 10 pick in today's game. Draymond Green **is a top 10 player** in today's game because of his defense and facilitation. System or not, these guys execute and these guys get it done. You just don't dominate like they have been for **5 years** by having system players. Nah, don't disrespect this all time historically great team like this, especially with Kevin Durant out due to injury, accomplishing what they're accomplishing.   When Steph, Klay, and Draymond are on the court together, that's a lineup with 1 top 2 player and another 2 top 10 players in the game today. That is why when Kevin Durant became injured, this Warriors team is still the best team in basketball. And with Kevin Durant, they're on paper the best post season team off all time. you just don't get to that level with role players, with system players..."

"Yeah it's like he's a Stephen A Smith type character instead of a (supposedly) unbiased commentator. He doesn't even talk about the game, just waits for some situation that he can work a tangential rant into.  Jackson pisses me off too though. There was some exchange like:  &gt; Breen: Curry is an underrated rebounder.  &gt; Jackson: No, Curry isn't a good rebounder. He's a guy who wants to win. And when you want to win, you get rebounds.  Wtf?"
That applies to every star. Stephen A. Smith was saying Curry doesn't have enough help in Game 1. This whole playoffs people have been saying Kawhi has no help. This simply happens when the supporting cast underperforms. They get criticized.
"Coach was a joke. This is what he said   [""Anybody else ever hold him scoreless?"" Patsos asked. ""I'm a history major. (Are people) going to remember that we held him scoreless or (that) we lost by 30?""](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/86207-stephen-curry-held-scoreless-but-davidson-routs-loyola-anyway)"
stephen curry
"There's an idea that goes around in fiction writing circles, that each great, world-shattering story happens once in concept and then someone will come around and perfect it. As an example, Stephen King said that the Blair Witch Project was the concept version, for which Paranormal Activity was the perfected version of the archetype of making horror films using ""live action footage.""  I guess the shooting revolution could've already been happening in full swing, and Curry came in and perfected it and made everyone realize how good it actually is. Now I'm ready for the team that is gonna do this with passing 1st and 2nd downs in the NFL."
They treated the Warriors lineup as Stephen Curry and 4 G league players
"Nike didn't saw the superstar potential in him just like they didn't saw it in Stephen Curry.  Obviously in retrospective im sure, they would have re-signed them both."
"It's a lot of eyetest and also interviews from opposing players. Many players have stated their gameplan against steph is to rough him up off ball. That's not the case for players not named stephen curry. No other shooters get roughed up like curry. JJ reddick does not get held and roughed up as curry. Neither does Kyle Korver. No other star players are grabbed, scratched, and bumped like stephen curry. Unless you're telling me that stephen curry has the most delicate skin the nba and that's why he's scratched up way more than any other superstar or even just normal player.  Just because there's no stats doesn't mean it doesn't happen. It just means noone's tracking it. Idk, maybe because it's very obvious just from watching the game."
That’s because he treated his stallions like workhorses. He wanted to have a tough backcourt and he was “stuck” with the greatest shooters of all time. Kerr came in and realized that he had gold including Stephen Curry which is basically the same name as Steve Kerr. He treated him like a son and they won 3 championships.
"If Klay is good to go I definitely favor the Warriors at home. The bench tends to play better at home, opposing benches to struggle on the road, and Boogie is looking ready for prime time.   The Raps *could* definitely take 3 of course but right now I'm favoring the Warriors. Now if Klay's not available I would definitely favor the Raptors. We saw just how much defensive attention they were able to give to Stephen Curry once Klay was out and there was practically no shooting on the floor with him."
"Are you condsidering Nash the best *pure* point guard, or simply the best point guard? Those are two different categories, but your comment seems to imply you have Nash being better than Magic. And what's the definition of pure? [Nash has even said Curry is on another level than he is.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/steve-nash-on-stephen-curry-hes-taken-what-i-did-to-another-level/)  All this says to me is that you don't know much about Magic or John Stockton."
"Also, most fans can’t tell when defense makes a difference. They always talk about “choking” and the deficiencies of players on offense as if defense has nothing to do with it. Both teams didn’t go cold at the end of the game. They were both playing their hearts out on defense.  I believe the reason the Raptors were called for so many fouls in the first half was for this reason as well. The game plan against Stephen Curry for YEARS in the postseason has always been to hammer him. The Raptors came out with that mindset for the whole Warriors squad, as everyone always does. The fact that they get called for more fouls while using that tactic shouldn’t surprise anybody."
"Gasol deserves so much criticism. They left him wide open and he *refused* to shoot the ball, that is unacceptable. The entire point of a stretch big is that he will punish you for leaving him open, and you know, stretch the floor.        Gasol in 2018-19 is a 38% 3P shooter when left 'wide-open' (closest defender 6+ feet away). Steph Curry is 32% when the defender is 2-4 feet away and 33% when 'open' (closest defender 4-6 feet away). He's an absurd 62% when tightly defended, but my point is this: Marc Gasol with a defender 6+ feet away this year is a better shot from 3-point range than Stephen Curry with a defender 2-6 feet away. Why the hell are you not taking those shots?        Without being a perimeter threat, you've entirely neutralized Gasol and turned him into a very low-budget Draymond Green. Gasol has decent defending down low, but much much slower and offers nothing in the way of driving or running transition like Draymond.       The worst part is it's not like they did this by tightly defending Gasol. They dared Gasol to beat them. And for some reason, a veteran player who shoots nearly 40% when wide open just refused to shoot the basketball. It absolutely killed the Raptors offensively."
"We all know about it, it's obvious. The fact is: people on r/nba don't like Stephen Curry.  Why? They say it's KD joining, Green kicking but we all know they hating on Curry. ""He's small, he's a bad defender, he's arrogant"". People find every excuse in the book to bash him.  This sub would make you think Steph isn't even a top 100 player."

"OAKLAND, Calif. — Kevin Durant gets his ankles retaped. Zaza Pachulia changes into a fresh jersey. Draymond Green removes his sneakers.

Their explosive third-quarter runs have become a phenomenon, and nobody knows quite what to make of it. The players themselves are mystified.  “I honestly have no idea,” Stephen Curry said.  We are not about to solve that riddle, either. Entering Game 1 of the N.B.A. finals on Thursday night, the Warriors had outscored their opponents by an unprecedented 130 points in the third quarter this postseason. It defies easy description. But a closer examination of their halftime rituals may provide some illumination.  [Game 4 Live: Follow Marc Stein and Benjamin Hoffman’s updates]  The 15 minutes between the end of the second quarter and start of the third are a carefully choreographed production, featuring clips of game footage, wardrobe changes and managerial strategies straight out of business school. Coach Steve Kerr, based on interviews with players and coaches, has worked to create an environment of inclusion. This is not a place for Lombardi-esque rah-rah speeches. Rather, the Warriors’ halftime locker room is a high-speed 360-degree team review.  “Everybody is a leader here,” said Pachulia, the veteran center. “At least you have a feeling that you’re a leader.”  The Warriors actually begin preparing for halftime as soon as the game begins. Assistant coaches will identify plays that the team may want to review at halftime by signaling them to Willie Green, an assistant and 11-year N.B.A. veteran who sits one row behind the bench. Green is in charge of keeping track of the time and score for each of the plays in question.  “Put that on edit!” the coaches shout. Or simply, “Clip that!”  Periodically throughout the first half, various other members of the staff — including Samuel Gelfand, the team’s analytics guru, and Kyle Barbour, the strength coach — run portions of the list back to the locker room, where James Laughlin, the video coordinator, assembles the clips on a computer.  Laughlin also has the freedom to pull clips that he thinks should be included. He aims for a total of eight to 10 for the halftime reel — but that number tends to stray into the 15 range in a high-pressure playoff game.  Once the first half ends, the coaches spend three or four minutes talking among themselves. At home, that happens in the coaches’ office adjacent to the locker room. On the road, they improvise. For example, when they were in Houston for Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, they met in the hallway outside the visiting locker room because the coaches’ quarters were so cramped.  Bruce Fraser, an assistant coach, described these sessions as think-tankish: Kerr solicits input from his staff, then listens. Sometimes, though, he takes advantage of the opportunity to vent, which is partly by design. By ridding himself of his frustrations, Kerr can act like a more rational human once he appears in front of his players.  “He’s got a fiery side to him,” Fraser said, “and he’ll be screaming and yelling in the coaches’ room for 30 seconds.”  Many of the players spend that time attending to their various health and equipment needs — in addition to checking their phones.  “We have time until Coach walks in to do our little things,” Pachulia said.  (As an aside, nobody in franchise history had a more curious halftime ritual than Gilbert Arenas. He famously used that time to take a shower — including once in his uniform.)  OKay, ill PM the rest..."
"&gt;More fouls should be expected to be called - part of the home court advantage  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  This would be true if the man's name wasn't Wardell Stephen Curry  Honestly, I wouldn't even be shocked if Curry got fouled out on some ticky tacky fouls at home."
"Woah... well if we believe one coach (a sonic coach at that) then Jackson was complaining about this:  &gt;	Where does this all stem from? It seems likely this ""mole"" accusation originates from Mark Jackson accusing Karl of sending ""hit men"" to play Stephen Curry physical during the series. Iguodala didn't agree with the tactics and it's likely he expressed this to Jarrett Jack during Game 5, according to Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News  So crazy if we take this at face value for both hit men and mole sides"
"That's basically the Steph Curry at Davidson experience, though. The ""one good kid"" offense and getting face-guarded [(or in one instance, doubled)](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/86207-stephen-curry-held-scoreless-but-davidson-routs-loyola-anyway) all game."
"He was the ""mole"" on the Nuggets that leaked the Nuggets were intentionally targeting steph with dirty play  &gt;Was Andre Iguodala a ""mole"" for the Golden State Warriors during their first-round series against the Denver Nuggets in the playoffs last year? George Karl has ""no question"" about it and briefly touched on the subject in an interview with Denver sportswriter Dave Krieger:  &gt;Q: Do you think Andre Iguodala was Mark Jackson's ""mole""?  &gt;A: No question.  &gt;Q: Does that bug you?  &gt;A: I just think that's media hype. I mean, that series was not a physical series. Everybody wants to be more aggressive with the guy kicking your ass, so ...  &gt;Where does this all stem from? It seems likely this ""mole"" accusation originates from Mark Jackson accusing Karl of sending ""hit men"" to play Stephen Curry physical during the series. Iguodala didn't agree with the tactics and it's likely he expressed this to Jarrett Jack during Game 5, according to Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News:  &gt;Iguodala probably said a few things to Jarrett Jack during Game 5 suggesting he wasn't pleased with some of the Denver tactics, as Iguodala admitted back in July, and Jack passed that along to Jackson.  &gt;That's my best read on what happened back then, and it all makes sense. Iguodala wasn't ""a mole,"" but he respected the way the Warriors were playing and wasn't thrilled that his teammates were a little extra-tough on Curry.  &gt;And he wanted Jack and Jackson to know he didn't agree with it.  &gt;Iguodala telling members of the Warriors know he wasn't interested in playing ""dirty"" despite Karl instructing the team to do so lines up with this quote from Jackson during the playoffs as well:  &gt;""I got inside information that some people don't like that brand of basketball and they clearly didn't co-sign it,"" Jackson said. ""They wanted to let me know they have no parts in what was taking place. Let the best team win. And let everybody, with the exception of going down with a freak injury, let everybody leave out of here healthy. That's not good basketball.""  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/12/1/5162790/andre-iguodala-mole-nuggets-warriors-george-karl-playoffs"

Stephen Curry
"It doesn’t matter of the personnel as long as you have a Stephen Curry capable of running and cutting, and no he doesn’t have to make shots as contrary to people’s beliefs."
"Stephen ""James Harden"" Curry"
It's up there with football and I'd argue maybe even bigger. Stephen Curry is just as big of a name as Brady and overall the biggest celebrities in the NBA are bigger than the biggest celebrities in football.

Obama is good friends with Stephen Curry.
"Although there are numerous other examples of better defense on certain plays or in certain games, I will never forget Kevin Love defending Stephen Curry in the final minutes of Game 7 of the 2016 Finals. That moment seems to always get so overlooked in the defining plays of that game considering there was Kyrie’s dagger and Lebron’s chasedown, but it was really something special IMO. Its also worth mentioning that K Love, a power forward who was having one of his worst slumps ever went out on the perimeter and locked up the league’s MVP in one of the games most crucial moments."

"Okay he's a backup point guard on the best team because everyone wants to be in Golden State, hell KD went there, and DeMarcus Cousins, I don't really blame him he hasn't even been on a playoff contending team. Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green. Get the picture? These guys won the 3 championships, even before Kevin Durant GS's big 3 won it. Shaun is a real ass dude because his leg should be absolutely fubar. And he's a decent bench player but he shouldn't of been 4th overall, he's a bust, do you guys need the definition? When you draft a high overall player and they don't fulfill expectations."

"TORONTO—Midway through the fourth quarter of Game 1 of the NBA Finals, a crisis erupted on the court. Drake spilled his drink.  This was no minor spill, either. The famous rapper, Raptors superfan and back masseur suddenly had to take on a new job: janitor. Drake was not a very good janitor. He eventually had to plead for help.  How exactly do we know this? During the Raptors’ 118-109 win over the Warriors, The Wall Street Journal kept a pair of eyes off the actual basketball and on the spectator who frequently interferes with it. We trained our binoculars on Drake to answer: What exactly does the most famous fan in sports today do the entire game?  The Journal counted how often he leapt to his feet and kept a stopwatch on how long he stayed there. We took note on who he trash-talked. We noticed when he mysteriously missed parts of the third and fourth quarters. We documented the spill in harrowing detail. The Raptors’ playoff run has placed the Canadian artist’s polarizing antics in the spotlight. From his courtside seat near the Toronto bench, he celebrates with the team’s players. He jaws at opposing players. He has a penchant for wandering on the court. During the Eastern Conference Finals, he gave Toronto coach Nick Nurse a back rub in the middle of a game—and the NBA had to have a little chat with Drake about that.  “We don’t want fans, friend or foe, contacting an NBA coach during a game,” Adam Silver said. But the NBA commissioner conceded: “He is viewed a little differently than any fan sitting there.”  When Drake entered the arena, it was clear much of the night would belong to him. He wore a Dell Curry Raptors jersey that appeared to be signed by the former star and father of Warriors’ star Stephen Curry. Before the game started, the PA system played his hit songs, including “Big Rings.”  From tip off to the final buzzer—a total of 2 hours and 25 minutes—Drake stood up and sat down 65 times. That means once for every 44 seconds of game time, he got up from his seat. He was on his feet for a total of 40 minutes.  Yet for nearly half an hour, Drake was out of view. He clearly had super important business during halftime, because he didn’t return from the tunnel until there was 8:45 left in the third quarter. It took him another 55 seconds to return to his courtside seat because he had to awkwardly climb over people to get there with the game live. He also missed the beginning of the fourth quarter.  Each time he stood up, he spent about 38 seconds on his feet, according to The Journal’s analysis. He got up for almost all of the Raptors buckets. But sometimes he stood up in anticipation of a big celebration only for a Toronto shot to miss, and then quietly sat back down.  This changed late in the game. For long stretches of the fourth quarter—minutes at a time—Drake stayed standing as his team closed out the win.  But the difference between Drake and other fans, other than that he’s one of the most successful musicians in the world, is his interactions with the key figures on the court. He fist bumped the Raptors when they subbed in and out. He managed to keep his hands off Nurse on Thursday night.  Still, he clearly drew the attention of the referees, one of whom had a long talk with him with 3:25 left in the third quarter after he appeared to be yelling. Maybe this was because he got in the face of the Warriors. A lot.    Midway through the first quarter, he began trash-talking at one of the NBA’s most famous trash-talkers, Draymond Green. That’s when, with 3:05 left in the first, Golden State took a timeout and Stephen Curry took the first part of that break to have a few words with Drake. But Drake didn’t let up, later going after Curry when he missed a three. (Drake has tattoos of the numbers 30 and 35, for Curry and Kevin Durant, respectively. He covered those with a strategically placed armband.)  Green was clearly his favorite target throughout the game. Drake yapped at Green again at the end of the first quarter, and giddily waved at him when he had to go to the bench in the second quarter with three fouls. He taunted Green twice more in the third, including after he missed a three with 25 seconds left in the quarter. All of that spilled over after the game’s conclusion in a brief confrontation in which Drake appeared to call Green “trash.”  “We barked a little bit,” Green said afterward, “but I wouldn’t necessarily consider that a scuffle.”  Not everything enthralled Drake. Frequently, he stared at his phone. He got up to cheer when Raptors legends like Charles Oakley, Muggsy Bogues and Tracy McGrady were introduced, but he was glued to his phone and didn’t clap when a group of kids performed an elaborate dance routine. One of the only times he wasn’t loud was when the stadium specifically asked fans on the jumbotron to get loud with a noise meter.     Then there was the spill.  The mishap began while Drake got up and celebrated Kawhi Leonard’s 3-pointer with 6:21 to go, and it came shortly after someone appeared to hand him a fresh drink. Seated at his chair, he attempted to clean it up himself for more than 30 seconds. This didn’t work. Reinforcements were necessary. So with 5:18 left, he frantically motioned down the Toronto bench for assistance, and a staffer frantically hurried from the baseline to dam the flood. One towel wasn’t enough. This was a two-towel spill.  And as someone attended to the mess beside him, Drake could return to his primary function. With 5:08 left, Thompson was called for a technical foul. The undetermined liquid was still being cleaned up, but Drake was back on his feet celebrating the moment—and Toronto’s imminent Game 1 win."
Why do I feel like this is gonna come back to bite the Raptors in the ass. Especially when I saw Stephen curry smiling in the clip lol
"""Stephen Curry shoots 3s, give me karma now"""
Whoa! Wardell Stephen Curry I is Wardell Stephen Curry II’s father?? No way! Get outta here!
[One also averages near double the FTAs the other has in the playoffs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id2_select=LeBron+James&amp;player_id2=jamesle01&amp;idx=players)  The issue with curry getting mauled isn't that it doesn't happen to other guys. Its that for his volume and usage his FTAs have always criminally underrepresented this in comparison to other 1st options on other teams
Cmon man.  Im no Curry fan but in the words of the great Stephen A. Smith thats blasphemous
"Stephen ""James Harden"" Curry"
Death  Taxes  Stephen Curry breaking more 3 point records

"Stephen ""James Harden"" Curry"
"&gt;I'm just saying that kd doesnt have as much of an impact on winning basketball games as Wardell Stephen ""Skyfucker"" Curry II.  If you look at the numbers and the context its close imo.  Regular Season  KD: 528/847 62%  Curry: 463/694 66%  If you ignore KD's first 2 seasons and compare them KD won 491/693 at a 70% win rate. This is also makes them the same age when looking at first seasons.  I didn't include playoffs since its tough to account for OKC's injuries with Russ and Ibaka where as the Warriors didn't have major injuries during their run besides Curry."

Executive producer Stephen Curry?   Ok I ain't mad at that
"Yeah I mean I never said that kd was just a mindless iso scorer. I'm just saying that kd doesnt have as much of an impact on winning basketball games as Wardell Stephen ""Skyfucker"" Curry II."
Steph has wanted to play with Rudy Gay for a while now.  Rudy would fit in perfectly plus that jersey would be sell like hotcakes in SF.      http://www.warriorsworld.net/2010/03/29/monday-morning-fresh-qa-with-stephen-curry-pt-2/
been saying stephen curry is the fucking MVP...he's easily the heart and core of the GSWs
"&gt; Stephen Curry specifically destroys Houston basically almost every chance he gets.  Really?  I watched 4.5/6 playoff games this year where he didn't do anything close to that.  If anything, it's KD who consistently does that.  KD is consistently great agains the Rockets.  Steph has a lot more variance.  Sometimes he's the best player on the floor, sometimes he's not even the fourth best player on the floor."
Stephen Curry specifically destroys Houston basically almost every chance he gets. James Harden and CP3 will never beat Stephen Curry in the playoffs while being led by mike dantoni
"Curry's an all-time great player, but the real question though:  &gt;*Are the warriors +4131 in FUN when Stephen Curry is on the court over the last five years and are they -447 in FUN+/- with Stephen Curry on the bench?*  Maybe? Maybe not? I'm sure Curry's splash at parties, but I know he ain't [THE FUN GUY](https://streamable.com/osq3j)."
