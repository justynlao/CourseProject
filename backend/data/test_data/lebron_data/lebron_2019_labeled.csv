He didnt have James worthy that season an all time great I just told you Steph won a chip vs LeBron with one all star He averaged 26 in the finals too btw,1
I agree except slightly better outside shooting Lebron James is an exceptional shooter He isnt of course a Steph curry or Thompson but if you gave lebron the amount of room to shoot like they do Giannis hed average 50 points a game,1
Every shot of the 4th wasnt an iso for OKC either   gtAlso LeBron never plays hero ball  Got it so Billy just needed LeBron James to beat the Warriors Sound strat This is also wrong LeBron has entered hero ball stretches in his career,-1

No thanks Lebron James and Steph Curry Ill take Kemba Walker and Jayson Tatum instead because they showed up last year,-1
There is no reason to assume anything otherwise  After 15 years of dominance and 58 straight wins we suddenly dont know who is better  Were not allowed to assume anything based on that  No LeBron James and Kevin Durant are better than everyone at this tournament  We know that,1
Yeah and LeBron James was 16 once and probably could have started in the NBA  Whats your point,1
Kevin Durant not LeBron James has been Team USAs best player whenever hes showed up over the last 10 years,1

No No No No No James Harden is to Steph Curry what Kevin Durant is to lebron,-1
I wouldnt put KD over lebron but as a scorer James Harden is better than Lebron in just that aspect The guy has scored more points than Lebron in the 2010s decade and thats coming off the bench the first 3 years of that and just had a 36 ppg season,1
There is no chance he had the same 40 time as a 28 YEAR OLD LEBRON JAMES,0

Its funny because all the stats people try to use to say Kawhi locked up Lebron actually show the opposite From your source  gtLeonards defense on James in the series was key James shot 576 percent against him but he wasnt always able to get his shot off or even get the ball,1

There is no chance he had the same 40 time as a 28 YEAR OLD LEBRON JAMES,0

Lebron James,0
From my position as a basketball aficionado i would be happy to concur that there is indeed not a chance to be stood whilst competing against both Lebron James and Anthony Davis,1
Fuck LeBron James fucking hypocrite From today tank mother fucker tank to the bottom,-1
LeBron James may break his assist record in a game this season,0
Its because it doesnt affect me and I have a zero percent chance of affecting it   Lebron james and the NBA clearly have affected the conversation Get your foot out of your mouth  LBJ is just out for his money accept that and walk away People do care about what happens to Hong Kong,1
But remarkable implies surprise It shouldnt be surprising at all to anyone that LeBron James and Anthony Davis of all players work amazingly well together I dont even think anyone can envision anything better out of current players if they wanted a dream duo,1

What OP did was basically the equivalent of LeBron James dying before his first NBA game and saying Why arent the Cavs better this year They got the 1 pick in the draft  How can you possibly knock the Celtics for being bad during an era where 2 of their franchise players died,-1
now while i realize that if lebron is on the floor he is probably controlling the ball a lot But is it also possible that the matchup kept James out of the play and essentially had the other guys play a more team oriented brand of basketballgt,1

Point is it was Riley picking those surrounding pieces not James LeBron has had basically full control of the roster hes playing on since leaving Miami In Cleveland it was LeBron who insisted on keeping JR Smith and Tristan Thompson around which wound up being a massive drag on the team,0
Nah not at all Im just saying Michael Jordan said Kobe Bryant is better than LeBron James at basketball,1
Absolutely James Harden has also passed Lebron James in the all time rankings as well,1
Marcus Smart yelled There you go Brad Stevens gave a look of pleasant surprise Gordon Hayward belted We got a fucking squad now And before Jayson Tatum hit the locker room door exEastern Conference star LeBron James hugged him amp said Ill trade you too for Anthony Davis,1
He wins it over rose in 11 and probably curry in 15   Also you dont have to be the winner to still be mvp level Harden is a perfect example and so is Durant   Also not theoretically winning it over lebron James Curry and Durant doesnt necessarily mean this season is not mvp level ,1

NBA Superstar LeBron James praises bench warmer James Jones Hes grown and he understands that he needs to sit at the last bench spot Leaders around him that will allow him to have comfort knowing that he have gotten 3 free rings out of it,1
No James Jones He went to the finals 7 consecutive years with LeBron,-1

the timeline where LeBron James beating  steph curry in 7 games being the peak moment of his career is still mind boggling to me  ampx200B  imagine telling that to someone in 2013 Lebron is good now but wait til he beats STEPH CURRY KLAY THOMPSON and DRAYMOND GREEN,0
Probably the system overall if you have to rely on refs and only one or two ISO players youre just begging for trouble unless one of those guys is named Lebron James,-1
If you solely compare rosters then were in a very similar place to the Kings but also with LeBron James  But until the both of us convert our potential into actual wins then that dont mean shit,1
Lebron james tho,0
Its become that way because of guys like Harden and believe it or not lebron James In my opinion,1
Well when you get arguably the greatest player of all time and LeBron James together you Ha,1

Its funny you mention them Cause in 20162017 season the top 3 mvp candidates were 1 Russell Westbrook 2 James harden 3 Kawhi Leonard  Literally no one you mentioned was brought into the conversation of mvp except maybe lebron at 4,1

There is no chance he had the same 40 time as a 28 YEAR OLD LEBRON JAMES,0

I hope the LeBron James dominate the NBA for another 20 years Bring it on Bron,1
Skip Bayless  LeBron James has no heart  Michael Jordan wouldnt have smiled all summer after not making the playoffs  This just shows how unclutch LeBron is  SAD,-1
One big difference is Lebron had to pick up the slack for his team being awful He shouldnt have to put up those totals His run was really impressive because the Cavs were basically Lebron James the basketball team,0

You hate the dude because he is close friends with Curry Klay and Durant and roots for his friends in the hopes they find success  If LeBron James considered you a close friend like he does Drake would you not root for LeBron if you attended a regular season Lakers game,1
Yes thats why he isnt LeBron James He isnt perfect,0
This is what I was thinking Not everyone is little kid voice LeBRON James,0
People really forgot that the Raptors are an elite team and only lost to Lebron James last year but Kawhi comes and makes it to the finals and hes literally the second coming of Michael Jordan,0

I dont think you get to compare regular season on a LeBron James led team  20162017 was the best iteration of Cavs and they wouldve won if KD didnt go full on snake mode,1
Youve won the lottery 4 times more than any other team and got luckier than any team in history except the magic when you jumped despite having only a 17 chance Additionally you won the year Lebron James was the first overall pick,1
chris paul and lebron james colluded to manipulate the cap to force kevin durant to join the warriors so now there is a team so stacked that they could lose to them in the playoffs and not have it hurt their legacy all while durant has to deal with wildly unfair scrutiny,-1
