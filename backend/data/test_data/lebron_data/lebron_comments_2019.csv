They’re all going to sign LeBron James. And he’s taking them all to the eastern conference finals.
LeBron James:    “Yall got anymore of them available superstars?” *scratches neck*
"Warriors lose, LeBron James with another All star would have dominated those series, he got 2 wins with Dellavedova as his 2nd best player lmao"
"To be fair, Golden State Warriors are significally much better compared to that Miami Heat team.  I mean, LeBron James' status in all-time list elevated tremendously after beating that 73-9 pre-KD Warriors.   But if James Harden somehow beat Warriors (this time with KD), it'd be the same effect for him."
The NBA is scripted...by LeBron James. 
"OAKLAND, Calif. — Yes, there was damage done to the relationship between LeBron James and Kyrie Irving.  Also yes, it was repaired by Irving’s call to James last month to apologize.  “Yeah, we’re in a good place right now,” James told The Athletic Saturday night. “Me and Kyrie are in a good place right now. I love the man that he’s becoming, I love the challenges he’s accepted and I always wish the best for him.”  These were James’ first public comments about the call he received to his cell last month from Irving, his former teammate on the Cleveland Cavaliers who buzzed to apologize for the hard time he gave James as a younger player.  In a twist of fate, Kevin Love, the third member of Cleveland’s Big 3, was with James at a Los Angeles pizza place the night Irving called.  James said of that call: “We talked and it was a great conversation,” but wouldn’t divulge what he said to Irving. “He told y’all what he said,” James said.  More to the point, Thursday is the NBA’s trade deadline. At first glimpse, it looked like James and Irving’s teams were fighting each other over the Pelicans’ Anthony Davis, who wants to be traded.  But on Friday Irving took a gas can and a match to the entire NBA when he backed way away from a previous, public commitment to sign a new long-term contract with the Celtics this summer.  Speaking to reporters in New York, where Irving, should he decline Boston’s five-year, $189 million offer in free agency, could wind up, maybe with Warriors star Kevin Durant, Irving said “ask me July 1” when asked about his past commitment to the Celtics.  Guess what? James approved of Irving’s comments Friday.  “He handled it great,” James said. “His post interview was great as well. Just a lot of things that’s going on in our league right now, and the one thing you want to focus on is getting that team to place where he wanted it to be, and that’s competing for a championship.”  After Irving said Friday morning — again, at Madison Square Garden — that “I spent the last eight years trying to do what everybody else wanted me to do in terms of making my decisions and trying to validate through the media, through other personnel, managers, anybody in this business … and I don’t owe anybody shit,” he was serenaded throughout the game that night by Knicks fans. He was also aware of the media buzz over his earlier remarks.  On Jan. 16, Irving said he called James to, in his words, apologize “for “being that young player that wanted everything at his fingertips, and I wanted everything at my threshold.” Irving, a proclaimed leader on the Celtics now, said he was dealing with the same things from Boston’s younger players that James saw from Irving and other youngsters in Cleveland. Sources said the pains Irving’s experienced with some teammates is a reason he’s considering leaving the Celtics.  James and Irving won a championship together, beating the Warriors in 2016 in seven games, but the following summer Irving demanded a trade out of Cleveland, for among other reasons reportedly no longer wanting to play on James’ team. In November, James told The Athletic that trading Irving to the Celtics was “the beginning of the end” of Cleveland’s Eastern dynasty.  The Celtics were picked by many to win the East (now that James is gone from the Cavs) and are currently tied for fourth in the conference with Indiana.  As for James and the Lakers, Irving and the Celtics, and the Davis sweepstakes in New Orleans, the Lakers are trying to put a package together now for the star center. The Celtics cannot trade for Davis this season because they have Irving, and both are on designated rookie extensions — which are limited to one per team.  Boston is believed to be able to put together the best package to acquire Davis, but it would have to wait until this summer. Davis, who is represented by James’ agent, Rich Paul, wants to be traded to the Lakers and not to the Celtics, in part because he is not confident Irving will stay beyond this season."
Lebron James: DNP due to signing fan sleeves 
Why is this downvoted? Pretty much all truth. Yeah its cool to have Lebron James but theres no denying it invites toxicity (not that that cant be created without LBJ).
LeGM seems always to be in the last year of his contract because he is the personification of a win-now-mentality. So this would be the first time LeGM was planing anything long term. LeBron James on the other hand ... man this dude got his shit together!
That's called having LeBron James on your team.
I dunno.  I just don't see a team with Lebron James getting swept by the Warriors in the post-season.
I don't so much mind him being traded as much as I hated the way Magic treated him on his way out. That shit was low.  I was always of the belief that D'Lo would hamper the growth of Ingram (who I still believe has a higher ceiling than D'Lo).  Now we have Lebron James doing that lol.  
"Yes harden has bribed the refs despite him having roughly the same free throws per drive as lebron james. he has clearly gone and bribed the refs, i am delusional for not seeing this sooner. "
Or did you ever think New Orleans just doesn’t want to send AD to the team that he’s trying to force his way to? The team that has LeBron James &amp; is in the same conference? that’s playing a big part. 
Y’all won a shit ton of ECF champions and a ring with LeBron James. It would take years for you to build around zion and knowing his size his body wouldn’t be able to handle the load of carrying G-Leaguers. 
"You called it  [More Sources say Michael Beasley called Luke Walton, “a goddamn cracker” before spitting at him. Several other Lakers, including LeBron James, started laughing at Walton, who ran out of the locker room crying.](https://twitter.com/SportsTalkBarry/status/1091942602281312256)"
Coaching problems tend to happen everywhere LeBron James plays lol if they can Luke I can only think they’d can the next guy just as quickly 
"&gt;	Agent Rich Paul has notified the Los Angeles Lakers that All-NBA forward LeBron James has no intention of signing a contract extension if and when presented and that he has requested a trade, Paul told ESPN on Saturday."
"IT was trade for Irving and sent to fucking LeBron James and went to the NBA finals. How that all gets lost in the shuffle astounds me. They didn’t trade him to the Antarctica for a conditional 1st. They sent him for an upgrade to the team with the best player on the planet and a shot at a ring. I get the whole playing hurt and giving everything he had after his sister died. He was emotionally invested in this franchise and I understand that, but the other half of the equation gets no coverage. "
"Exactly 0.0 NBA teams would have done anything different than the Celtics did. Have a chance to get a player of Kyrie’s talents for IT? Yup, they’re doing the same thing. As the players love to constantly say now, “it’s a business. “  But by all means, keep acting like IT is comparable to Kobe. Mamba was an all-time NBA great. IT was an undersized player approaching 30 who relied on his quickness to score the majority of his points. Guess what happens to that type of player after 30? They’re not as effective. Add in the uncertainty of his injury and all these hypocrites pandering to Rich Paul and LeBron James by feigning being appalled are being intentionally dishonest and deceptive. "
He would have fit perfectly on the roster too.. Plenty of 3pt shooting. Multiple other ball handlers to take the pressure off LeBron. Deep roster with plenty of youth. *King* James where you at? smh
"I’ll admit the branding would be really good, King of Kings, ~~Triple H~~ LeBron James"
"Jimmy Butler: “.... and you say you have ‘general soreness’, and they just let you sit out!”  LeBron James: “You serious? Man I wish I thought of that years ago!”  Jimmy: “You know, if this whole AD thing doesn’t work out...”  LeBron: “Ahaha erm, I’ve gotta go.... uh.... film Space Jam 2 now, see ya!”"
Y’all really think the nba and refs would allow a lebron James team to miss the playoffs ? Cost themselves that much money?

He honestly reminds me more of James Harden than LeBron... and that's not a bad thing. 
"There is a guy on ESPN comment sections who impersonates LeBron James and makes several comments a video like “I’m 3-6 in the finals”. Until it gets to that point, I’m fine"

Conference finals is a reach considering how deep the West is this year. You’re forgetting majority of Lebron James teammates have zero playoff experience.
Where did I say he would take us to the finals? He won’t with this current squad.  But conference finals isn’t a reach if we don’t meet GSW earlier than that. This is Lebron James you’re forgetting.
They have lebron James 
Yeah and the lakers got fucking Lebron James the guy who’s taken worse to the finals
"We won 2, do you even watch basketball? And besides if you wanna start talking about the past lakeshow wins every time. And you wanna talk about the future?

Luka Doncic just showed the Cavs a glimpse of LeBron James
"James Harden, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Steph, Giannis, LeBron James, Kyrie, Anthony Davis, Kawhi.

I wonder if Luka could be comparable to Lebron James.

I think the debate on who's better between Bobby Portis and Lebron James is a ridiculously pointless and unneccesary one. Portis is a clear winner
Lebron James is listed as trying to manage all these loads 
Im too confident about a team 2 games behind a playoff spot with Lebron James will make the playoffs?
"He's been solid as a catch and shoot player at about 38%, but he's definitely best with the ball in his hands. A lot of Lakers and Nets fans talked about him needing to be an off ball guy for some reason, but the kid is at his best when he's running pick and roll most of the time coming down the floor. That's where he can best get his points and show off his passing. The Nets have him over 30% usage out there running pick and roll, making the passes to Joe Harris coming off screens or just standing around waiting to get the ball back.      if the Lakers didn't let Russell run the show a good amount, I don't think he would be as well regarded right now. And it would make sense that they wouldn't let him do that because they have Lebron James. I do buy him as a fit as a shooter next to him and a guy who could maybe attack closeouts and be staggered with Lebron. He would struggle less than Ingram has next to James. "
You guys have lebron fucking James lol
"The reason I brought up Westbrook is to make it abundantly clear that majority of the blame falls on him when looking back on why OKC lost. Players miss shots all the time, what they don’t do is senselessly throw away huge ball games with consistently terrible decision making and a lack of urgency. KD wasn’t perfect but he was by far their best player and he gave it his all on both ends.   Except that’s not how team basketball works and this is a very common misunderstanding that a lot of people who don’t understand NBA basketball on fundamental level have. You could be micheal Jordan or Lebron James but if your playing in an offense that is focused on you scoring out of iso against the likes of Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, or Harrison Barnes then I’m sorry but you’re not going to be efficient. This isn’t to say that KD couldn’t have made better decisions but it’s clear that the organization and coaching staff didn’t put any effort into creating an offense predicated on ball movement and player movement.  This is something that was killing OKC all season long so it was to be expected that these guys wouldn’t shoot efficiently because their offensive system isn’t designed for success on the highest level. Why do you think KD was so eager to play for GSW? Because they play beautiful basketball and as a result his effectiveness has dramatically increased.   Also blaming players for missing shots only makes sense if it’s bad shot selection, if he’s missing make able shots then I have zero issue with that because that’s just part of the game, great teams and great players know how to persevere through bad shooting nights by making sure they are doing all the little things to get the win which I think KD was doing. What’s unacceptable is the kind of nonsense that Westbrook was doing throughout the game that made it seem like he either didn’t want to be there or he just didn’t want to win( I’m not saying this is the case but it did feel like it at times). Westbrook is probably the only star player in recent memory that has actually contributed to his team losing, most the time when players play poorly they just don’t have the impact that is expected of them but Westbrook was actually hurting his own team which is tragic for OKC.   Durant was better in game 3, game 5, game2, game 6, and game 7. Is say he had a better overall series, while consistently playing suffocating defense which is something Westbrook was not doing."
"They don’t have to trade him for to the Lakers, they could sit his ass next year also and lebron will have wasted 2 years in LA and be older.  Plus they could get a better deal elsewhere, there is only 3 good players on the lakers, James, Rondo and kuz. The rest either past it or haven’t lived up to the expectations. "

He chose to play through the injury in the playoffs and said playing was one of the only things that took his mind off it.   He’s said he’s fine with Danny, and has never wavered in his love for the city and fans. "

"Cardinals? I think, I don't know.  I'm trying to join in on these ""Could Dr. Manhattan and Lebron James beat the Warriors?"" hypotheticals."
"The article:  Get out those tea leaf readers, NBA fans: The free agency frenzy came early this season — sort of.  While some of the league’s biggest stars still can’t decide their hoops fates until July 1, the blockbuster trade that sent Kristaps Porzingis from the New York Knicks to the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday came with all sorts of potential ramifications and one central question.  Can the Knicks turn this KP deal into a free agency KO by bringing Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to town?  It has never looked more possible.  All around the league, executives who are paid handsomely to track this sort of thing had the same takeaway: The Knicks, who have been widely known to be targeting Durant for so long now and whose general manager (Scott Perry) was part of the Seattle SuperSonics front office team that drafted him out of Texas in 2007, must be very confident that they’re going to get the Golden State star. Some rival executives even reported that Knicks officials themselves have been expressing a very high level of optimism on this front.  The Oklahoma City Thunder are on Line One, by the way, wanting to discuss the dangers of Durant and premature free agency speculation. But I digress.  Trading Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee and Trey Burke to Dallas gives the Knicks the salary cap runway for the two max salary slots they would need, all while coming at the cost of a franchise centerpiece player in Porzingis who is the only one who might have yielded a superstar like, say, the disgruntled Anthony Davis via trade this season. Translation: This is the kind of gamble that leaves everyone saying, “What do they know that we don’t?” And, no, the two first-round picks coming New York’s way weren’t enough to quell the noise about what this move truly meant.  This KD-to-NYC storyline has been front and center for quite some time now, with Durant’s business manager, New York native and lifelong Knicks fan Rich Kleiman, pouring kerosene on this free agency fire last February when he tweeted, “Imma run the Knicks one day.” Durant’s early-season rift with the Warriors’ Draymond Green took it to yet another level, with video of that infamous Clippers game on Nov. 12 appearing to show Durant saying, “That’s why I’m out.”  Add in the growing concern from rival teams that the Knicks will offer Kleiman a job as part of their plan, and the fact that Durant and Perry are known to still have a good relationship, and you start to understand why New York had everyone’s attention even before this monumental move. But if this truly is in the works, if Durant is planning to bounce from the Bay and take on that yeoman’s challenge of bringing glory back to the Garden, it’s just the sort of thing that will keep the Boston Celtics brass up at night from now until this summer.  Let me explain.  For all the talk of Irving’s recent apology to LeBron James and the idea that Irving might renege on his October promise to re-sign in order to reunite with his former Cleveland Cavaliers co-star with the Lakers, a source with knowledge of the Celtics’ thinking said there is little to no concern about that prospect within their green walls. A source close to James said he would be open to the possibility of playing with Irving again, and even highlighted his well-chronicled history of reconciliation with Cavs owner Dan Gilbert as empirical evidence that he doesn’t hold grudges.  Nonetheless, the Lakers are not seen by Boston as a serious threat to steal Irving away.  What’s more, Davis might be the one filling that co-star role soon in Laker Land if Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka can strike a deal with Pelicans general manager Dell Demps before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. That is, of course, if the Celtics can’t convince New Orleans to wait until this summer to send Davis their way (as we discussed here, Boston can’t trade for Davis until Irving is a free agent because of the league’s Rose rule).  As I reported on Tuesday, a source close to Irving said there’s no reason to believe he has changed his view from that fateful fan event where he said he was there to stay. But in light of all these developments, and with Irving’s well-chronicled locker room dynamic with his Celtics teammates leaving so many to wonder if his view might have changed, maybe it’s time for him to speak up again.  And talk about timing: The Celtics just so happen to play in New York on Friday. Irving, the 26-year-old whose transparency in October set a tricky precedent, is expected to address the media for the first time since suffering a hip strain against Golden State on Saturday.  Yet even before the Porzingis deal cleared the way for the two max slots in New York, and with all these superstar puzzle pieces jumbled together in the kind of way that makes the overall picture so tricky to see, there was a belief in Celtics circles that the prospect of the Knicks getting Davis or Durant could spell trouble for Boston’s chances of holding onto Irving. Davis is unofficially off their blue and orange table now, but the prospect of landing Durant appears very much in play. And then maybe — just maybe — Irving too.  Never has such an awful team looked so dangerous."
"I don't care what anybody says, MJ might be the most dominant player of all time in finals but LeBron James is the most dominant player of all time in playoffs."
"""Allllll byyyy myyy seeeeelllllff"" -LeBron James"
[Tom Brady asks Lebron to join Patriots](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/09/07/tom-brady-lebron-james-patriots-tight-end-gronkowski-nfl-nba/)  &amp;#x200B;  Now what?
LeBron James' what?
This is how you tamper when you are not LeBron James.
I love me some LeBron James but this is similar to what he did with the Cavs. In our case we signed a bunch of middle of the road guys to huge deals to get 3 years of finals appearances and then he pulled the chute and we're stuck in a rebuild. It'll be the same thing with the Lakers if this happens - you'll mortgage the future for LeBron's four year contract and when he leaves or declines you won't have any assets. 
"1) Trading picks is kind of like gambling. If a team has a poor record and appears to be on track for continuing to have poor records for the next few years, it is a relatively safe bet that they'll have a high draft pick for the current year and maybe the next ones too. This means their pick could be quite valuable if a team were to trade for it.   For instance, the Knicks currently have the worst record in the NBA, meaning they have a very good chance of securing a top 3 pick in the upcoming draft. However, their precise location in that draft won't be known until May. So, in the meantime, teams can only assume that the Knicks will likely be picking very high, which means that pick has a lot of value right now.   2) In terms of future draft picks, the same logic applies. However, this can be a little bit more risky, since as you stated, teams won't know where that pick will actually end up until that year's draft gets closer (that pick is still dependent upon the performance of the original owner).   Example: The Detroit Pistons acquired a future first round pick from the Vancouver Grizzlies in 1997 for an aging Otis Thorpe. The Grizzlies assumed they'd be a good team by the time that pick would be used by the Pistons. However, when 2003 rolled around—when the Pistons would finally receive their draft pick—the Grizzlies were still awful and as a result, the division champion Pistons were also able to pick second in the 2003 draft, using the future draft choice they received from Vancouver in '97.   3) Regarding protected picks, we'll use the Pistons-Grizzlies example again. That 1997 trade called for the Grizzlies to give the Pistons a ""future first round pick"". That pick had certain protections that got more specific as the years went on.   For instance, the first protection on that pick, for the 1998 draft, may have be ""Top 20 protected"", which means if the Grizzlies landed one of the top 20 picks, they'd be able to keep their draft choice that year instead of giving it to the Pistons. In 1999, it could have become ""lottery protected"", meaning if they picked in the Top 12 or so, the Grizzlies would be able to keep it. Then perhaps 2000 was Top 10 protected, then Top 5, then Top 3 before finally, in 2003, the only protection left was Top 1, meaning the only way the Grizzlies could keep their pick would have been to win the lottery altogether (which, for that year, would have meant winning the rights to LeBron James).   The Grizzlies landed the No. 2 pick in 2003, meaning it was no longer protected, meaning the Pistons finally got their pick they traded for six years earlier (they drafted Darko Milicic).   4) Currently, draft eligible players are those who have played at least one season of college basketball (for American players) or be 19 years of age (international players). (May be missing some details on this one.)  5) The NBA has two rounds of drafting. Generally, this means everyone gets a chance to draft a player in the first round. Then, using the same order, everyone gets a turn to draft again in the second round. The NBA used to have upwards of 10 rounds before it was shortened to two in 1989. "
"Not really about “changes” as in free agency or trades, more so in the sense of role configuration.  So look at the Bucks, your team:  you’ve got Giannis, and he’s *that dude*, the team revolves around him, and everyone else plays a complimentary role to Giannis.  It works perfectly, everyone’s happy because they understand their place.  Then you have Toronto, who revolve around kawhi.  You’ve got great complimentary players like Ibaka, green, and siakam.  A good secondary guy in Lowry, and everyone knows their roles, so there’s no confusion as to who the ball defers to.  Then you have us.  We have two young players(ages 21/22) who just got off from averaging 18 ppg in the playoffs, and took Lebron James to 7 games in the Eastern conference finals, while carrying the scoring load essentially by themselves.  Skip to next season, kyries back and we all know what kind of player he is, he scores.  Then you add Hayward, another ball dominant wing.  Then you look at the bench, and you see terry rozier and Marcus Morris, two guys who(you guessed it) are also iso happy ball dominant players.  So you’ve got a situation where almost every player playing significant minutes for a team is used to being *that* guy in some way.  It’s a strange situation, and they are starting to figure it out, but it’s been tough.  I hope you understand what I’m getting at here. "
it's not dumb if it builds up a reputation that attracts LeBron James and Anthony Davis

Lakers fans talk a lot for a team that has the best player in the world and is only one game above .500. But I guess you have to be delusional to reconcile with the reality of failing Lebron James worse than the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
"He wanted to be near Hollywood and he wanted to be somewhere that would maintain a high profile. If Lebron wanted to go somewhere to win, he never would have went there. He's 34, he could decline at any point in the next 3 or so years. He went to a team that he knew would be in rebuild mode and that he knew would have a much tougher route to the Finals than any team he could have went to in the East. He went to a team that just dealt with the craziness of the Ball family saga, and he went to the one team whose President is a big enough deal in the city that being Lebron James isn't going to be enough to take control the narrative.   It wasn't a basketball move. If it was, there were so many other teams he could have went to that would have made way more sense where he'd be competive, where he wouldn't be waiting around hoping pieces come to him like he is now, where he wouldn't have to worry about Golden State blocking him in the Finals, where he'd be able to exercise more control.   I really don't know how anybody thinks this is anything but him trying to be in LA and positioning himself for his post NBA career. "

"You’re correct, I don’t know what their potential is, but I’m basing it off of probability; you’ve got three nba prospects, two of which are only like 20/21(Lonzo and Ingram), were picked #2 in their drafts, and have shown star ability at times, but have struggled to find their place on the team/injuries/and just being young players in a huge market.  Then kuzma, who is putting up nearly 20ppg already playing with Lebron James(there are a short list of players who can claim that accomplishment), who is a bit older than the others, but has also looked very good and is still much younger than Siakam even as the oldest of the lakers core.  Siakam is going to be 25 this year.  I love siakam, I think he’s everything a playoff team could wish for, but I just don’t see how he’s gonna transform into a star who can lead a team at 25 already."
"&gt;With LeBron officially agreeing to sign with the Lakers, it’ll be fascinating to monitor what type of leverage the Spurs can create for Kawhi Leonard, who still desires to play for the Lakers, according to multiple league sources—all of whom say offers to the Spurs have been underwhelming. One executive said the proposed packages have gotten worse with each round of negotiations, while another said they’re flat-out unacceptable.   [Source.](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/7/2/17524398/lebron-james-lakers-offseason) Of course they made an offer."

"To me the Jazz are the 4th best team in the west, but right now you're in 7th place in possibly the deepest conference ever, and LA is in 9th only 2.5 games back and they just got LeBron James back... I like the Jazz, but they're definitely not a ""lock"" with 30 games left and that small of a gap. Much crazier shit has happened."
So the Pels are gonna move him this summer. We can agree thats basically guaranteed right? His value just decreases if they wait.  So tell me who is gonna offer more and call Davis’s bluff when Davis says he wants to go to LA?  Raptors? Nuggets? Boston (prob out now right?)  LeBron James basically owns the Agency that’s representing AD this time. 
"That's why it is really hard to compare Jordan/Kobe and Lebron, because Jordan was up against really good teams in his first few years and for Kobe, for the past 2 decades the west has been brutal. Whilst for Lebron james, he has had a cakewalk in the east for his entire career.  But if you really put Lebron in Kobe Jordan situations, they may have consistently gotten further, but not the peaks Kobe and Jordan had"
For one I’m pretty sure LeBron James has an iron clad no trade clause ... he ain’t gonna let himself get traded like a piece of real estate... he is the NBA no matter how good these younger guys are ... 
IT played because he wanted to play. He knew the risks. If he didn’t want to play he didn’t have to. See:Kawhi Leonard. He also got traded to the Lebron James Cavs who ended up beating the Celtics and going to the finals. Huge punishment!   IT was saying just months before that the Celtics better drive a Brinks truck to his house or else. Where’s the “loyalty” in that? Sports is a business. Everybody knows the stakes and is responsible for looking out for themselves. Were the Celtics supposed to give IT a max deal just because? 
"you were 20-14 before lebron got hurt, this team is 35/1 to win the title with lebron james..that's unheard of"

"&gt; decode the rules  You mean flop. Harden was never an all-star until he started shooting 10-11 free throws per game. Call it ""drawing questionable calls"" if you want, but's not basketball. It's theater.   For reference, here's the players that shoot the most free throws per game this season:  1	James Harden.

The next Hughes guard on the list is Damian Lillard at 6.62 ft/game."
"Let's talk about a professional environment while we're on that topic. Toxic employees are also let go. Even employees who start small gossip that effects other employees or employees who make crude gestures are all also let go. Depending on the business, if you show signs any disgruntled attitude you are essentially fired on the spot. All that I just listed are signs of Lebron. I think you're trying to take some high road route to belittle my opinion and honestly I think you're a lot younger than I am.  Let's talk about the players now that have been let go or shadowed while playing with Lebron's second tenure at Cleveland.   Derrick Rose  While on the Roster: Still had signs of flashing lights, was starting to get his head back into the game after leaving NY, he choked a little bit but this was expected for someone who was out for a while and still had some mental issues with his ability due to the injuries. After a few games of showing signs of struggle, he was effectively benched and only showed up on the court in random spurts when Cleveland had no idea what they were doing.  After Cleveland: The dude goes to Timberwolves and starting putting up stats he has never accomplished in his career. He became their goto point guard and is struggling a little bit after the Jimmy Butler mess but essentially is still very capable.  Rodney Hood  Before Cleveland: He was upcoming middle tier star, very capable of being a starter or high tier role player. Was utilized quite a bit in Utah  While on the Roster: Also showed signs of willingness to play, he actually got a lot of minutes but the next game after he has a bad one would be benched. Sometimes he would be benched for 4-5 game stretches. Randomly benched in the playoffs.  Channing Frye  While on the Roster: In 2016, as a veteran he was becoming a threat from 3 with around 40% 3P%, played tons of minutes that year and lead to many successful runs that gave Cleveland wins. Next year during the huge roster change when Lebron was upset, this lead to Channing Frye getting benched. Still capable and putting up decent numbers for a role player he was delegated to at the beginning of 2017.  Tristan Thompson  While on the Roster: Contributed to their successful season and was probably one of the bigger reasons they won a title that year they did. The following year, minutes were shortened and he was benched while being in/out of the roster. He was also mocked constantly giving him emotional baggage which lead to even more inconsistencies in his game.  Deron Williams  Before Cleveland: He was a top tier starter for a guard with a high IQ for basketball, scoring, passing and shooting. He was very good for a very very long time.  While on the Roster: He came in strong did a lot of work and slowly got less touches. Cleveland utilized him poorly as they had no offensive strategy outside of Lebron's ball handling. They went to Deron Williams to just do whatever while Lebron was on the bench which led to a poorly utilization of this guy. He ended up retiring because of all the ridicule he received while he was on this roster.  Kevin Love  I don't think I need to explain the story here, it's the bigger news out of all of their roster troubles. This dude was a beast on TWolves in the paint. Then he was delegated to spot up shooter (WTF?) for his entire tenure with Cleveland. He had to play a new style of game that he wasn't comfortable with, he constantly had to deal with rumors in the backroom about him being soft when it was the organizations fault to delegate him to a spot up shooter (double WTF?). This guy was amazing for that team and still doesn't get the respect he deserves. He had probably the biggest hit to him emotional wise but he stood pretty solid regardless of that fact.  Here's a few more shout outs that I won't bother with that were effected by Lebron James attitude and play making style: Kendrick Perkins, Mike Miller, Richard Jefferson, Dahntey Jones. Keep in mind this list is just the short 3-4 year span he was back in Cleveland, if I went further back to his first tenure, his Miami stint and now his LA stint, this list would be remarkably insane especially with the potential AD trade that almost went down.  Lebron puts little to no effort into defense for the last 4-5 years, does that make him expendable? No, because he's Lebron and his name alone will grant him a pass to the end of his career, I'm pretty sure most of the people I listed wish they were in Lebrons shoes. They all know they are replaceable so why the fuck would they put 100% into working with Lebron when they know they can get uprooted any time the org feels like.  I am also a software engineer, graphics designer, musical composer and audio engineer and trust me the people that live and breathe the industry are the ones that have the biggest emotional baggage. With a fake face, these people constantly wonder why they are still doing what they are doing, how long they will continue doing it and if they will ever have the courage to leave the company to find a new venture to apply their skills to. They are capable of doing their job and looking composed on the outside, but on the inside they are just rotting away at stagnate corporations that don't give two shits about them. Companies that grow stagnated with tough guy attitudes puffing out their chest thinking they are the only people on the planet with no emotions dragging them down are the the worst to work with and lead to a horrible product that cuts corners constantly. Later on these tough guys are usually struck the worst with depression and have a hard time cooping with life in the long run.  "
"Just stop with your nonsense. Naturally the player that ultimately wins the award usually comes from a team with one of the top records. That makes sense that the best individual performance would lead to a winning record. But we aren’t talking about the best individual performance here, we’re discussing the ~10th best individual performance. That may not necessarily correlate to a winning team record, especially when considering other injuries. I cannot stress this enough, the MVP is an individual award, not a team award. Players aren’t automatically disqualified from being ranked because they’re on a losing team like you’re making it out to be, it just makes it slightly harder for them to advance in the rankings. Now taking into consideration that Lebron James is just head and shoulders above Mitchell as a player it’s very fair to say he has been more valuable than Mitchell this year, thus putting him higher on the rankings. It’s a simple concept"
You guys got Lebron. A generational player and in the conversation for top player all-time. Not because the Lakers are a well run franchise. It was because of the aura and legacy of the Lakers brand. The Lakers are in the biggest market with the most advantages as an organization. Lakers games are constantly on primetime regardless of how well they do. The Lakers live in the past and constantly try to swing for the fences for a superstar every offseason despite the ability to buid through the draft with owning a top 2 pick 3 out of 4 years.  Ya'll are literally deciding to tank with Lebron fucking James. Teams salivate at the amount of resources the Lakers have and the fuck up time and again. No accountability and no leadership.
Nonexistent because LeBron James is a fucking headcase who thinks that he runs whatever team he's on.
If LeBron James had Harden’s season we’d call him unanimous MVP
"&gt;no professional basketball coach would draw up a play to attack Lebron fucking James  Your argument is emotional, guys have absolutely been attacking him this year"
"Alexa, play highlights of Lebron James against the Raptors"
"Not actual defense of course, because no professional basketball coach would draw up a play to attack Lebron James... but yes.   This is a perfect example of how a guy with notorious for doing nothing besides running is seen as better than a guy notorious for iconic defensive plays and being a floor general on defense. The power of the stepback-meme is impressive on nephews."
You're also matching the amount of NBA coachs and schemes that try to attack Lebron James on defense instead of literally anyone else.  Team's still go after harden though   You should get a coaching job I guess you know the secrit
"I hate this post because it shows zero awareness about how Lebron works as a player. Give him something to play for and we'll be talking about his 9th prime.   Lebron is an all time great two way player. He is extremely athletic, hard to move and has all time great bbiq. James Harden is one of the worst defensive superstars of the modern era and has improved to be average with the help of a whole system built around him conserving energy for offense.   "
"Lebron has a lack of intensity but that dosn't change the fact that Harden has improved from poor defense to average defense with loads of help/switching.  Lebron even just last year in the playoffs, when he was focused, was the same monster he always was guarding his entire half of the floor and yelling at teammates to go places he saw plays developing.   Lebron on the Lakers with zero intensity is still a better defender than James Harden trying. "
"lol the narrative that Harden is now good on D is because of advanced stats that still aren't that great and the idea that he can guard the post, Lebron James has way better advanced stats and guards the post much better.  You can't drag Lebron on D to prop up Harden  "

"&gt; The fact you think that data without priors is literally unusable is already dumb. Priors help create more accurate outlooks on lower amounts of data. 14 year RAPM correlates too well with identifying good players for me to say it's totally worthless the same way you nonchalantly so.  It's unusable because we have great data WITH priors that seem to be far more accurate. Why would I not use the better data?   &gt; Also your selective interpretations of RAPM are too annoying to debate. One minute you're spouting off about how poorly it captures a certain kind of impact, the next minute you're noting that Kobe's 0.3 superior RAPM over a small window is a massive gap when that clearly falls into the margin of error you're prescribing for multi year RAPM.  Dude, at this point you seem too delusional to hold this conversation:   1) Yes, DRAPM is not nearly, NOT NEARLY as accurate or predictive as orapm. This is objectively true. There's no way you are trying to deny that drapm is very noisy.   2) I was arguing about YOUR comment saying Kobe's impact was marginally higher when looking at that specific data. It's just not true when accounting for the difference in possessions.   &gt; Also interesting you're telling me to read when you went out of your way to pull what I said in another discussion where the contention was Kobe's elite defense. I assumed that since you wanted to drag my words in from another argument, you wanted to defend the point I was contesting there.  Kobe was an elite defender at times. I don't think he was ""elite"" from 05-07, but he was most certainly not the reason the Lakers sucked on that end. WHICH IS WHAT YOU ARE CLEARLY IMPLYING WHEN YOU ARE USING HIS DRAPM.  &gt; Also Duncan having great impact metrics because of scheme isn't a reason to punish him. Everyone's impact metrics are conflated with external factors. Might as well argue Kobe's impact metrics are inflated thanks to his genetics.  The problem with this your trash logic is that players transitioning TO the spurs typically get such boost in impact. I mean, Pop coached the best defense in the league with Aldridge as the starting five immediately after Duncan's departure. Even during Duncan's tail end, Spurs' were absolutely amazing defensively.   &gt; Also I'm very hesitant to buy your eye test when most eye tests in general on the defensive end seem suspect. Backpick's combination of eye test, recording of eye test via stats, and statistics is far more compelling.  Sure: Let's go over some of Ben's ""great eye test"". I'm just going to dissect the videos on that page.     &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=8&amp;v=tULGVCuvyBk  Absurd. This was a horrific offensive series for Kobe, (Ironically a good defensive series) but he uses this film? Out of the many, he could've shown?  Lakers had an off-ball screen for Kobe to get open, Kobe was not able to get open. Lakers COMPLETELY stops moving when Kobe catches the ball. Interestingly enough, he surveys the floor for a post up and such, before shooting the shot. That was not Kobe's fault.  Also, take account for two other defenders trying to stop Kobe's drives.  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&amp;v=j2ANBFdDIX0  Kobe was clearly fouled. LOL.  The guy he wanted Kobe to pass off of was Horry who was 0/3 from the three prior to that play and was 0/18 in that series. He was also a 29% shooter from the three in the regular season.  This was 100% the most efficient outcome.  Give me a break man.  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1k64NHCpIQ  Garbage.  First, Kobe waited for the double to commit.  Second, this caused Lamar to be open.  Third, the pass from Kobe to Lamar, that he wanted, would be a very difficult jump pass against a much longer defender.  Come on.  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUVl-zha9BY  This okay defense, nothing bad or good. Kobe shaded him to an angle where help was supposed to be there; The help wasn't there from Atkins. This is something you can live with and how team defenders are suppose to play. This possession was a successful defensive possession btw.  To give you an example of an actual poor defense:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J7XX0TGfsQ   Skip to 0:48.  James Harden lets his assignment go to the MIDDLE of the floor instead of the baseline where help is located; The defense collapse because of this. Kobe's defensive play allowed help to contest. Kobe recognized help; this is why guys like JJ Redick was relatively decent defensively.  &gt; Duncan had several years over Kobe. If we use 97-14 RAPM the gap between them is far less than the supposed significant gap between their peaks that you cited. Once again a selective interpretation of RAPM on your side.  But honestly, be honest. Do you really think Duncan was as good as that impact implied? Because Duncan is only really getting separation from Kobe in 11-16. Do you really think Duncan was THAT much better than the data suggests? Because that's also a hard no for me dawg lol.  11-13 Would be close tbh, but even in 14-16, during Duncan's tail end. There's no way Duncan didn't hugely impact from his supporting cast and coach.   &gt; But I'm really not interested in continuing this conversation when you like to insult other people constantly while being hypocritical about how you use stats. You draw conclusions by cherrypicking windows then reject the same stats when they say something different.  You are seriously debating me while refusing to read. I am simply countering YOUR OWN POINTS that I highlighted before commenting.   &gt; I also have no problem saying Kobe was decent on the defensive end, it's just that his defense over his career does not grade him out as one of the greatest defensive guards of all time which is what his selections mean to many people.  Once again, from 00-10, his defensive impact was LARGELY positive. 05-07 hugely drops his impact. (Clearly wrongly from looking at actual data.)  I am super high on Duncan, but I just value offense more than defense. Kobe was the best offensive player in his generation who could inflate insane offense out of ANY roster. You can't even say that about Lebron.  "

&gt; Lmao Lonzo wasn't in half those previous 12 games either.  Six games isn't a significant enough sample size to draw any conclusions from. The fact is Bron came back Feb 1st. Lonzo has been out since end of January. Lonzo has a defensive rating of 103.5 putting him among the top 25 defenders in the league and easily the best defender on the Lakers.  &gt; To me Lebron's decline is why they missed the playoffs. Give the current Lakers (bad roster construction and all) with age 30 Lebron and they have a top 4 seed  &gt; To me Lebron's decline is why they missed the playoffs. Give the current Lakers (bad roster construction and all) with age 30 Lebron and they have a top 4 seed    With LeBron James at 30 the Cavs had a defensive rating of 105.3 which put them in the bottom half of the league. So that version of Bron's defense would have been good enough for the Lakers to make the playoffs is what you are saying? In a stacked Western conference like this year?

When you've got 34 year old LeBron James you're kind of forced to go into win now mode, but with so many young players that isn't going to happen overnight, and you get left in this weird half-all-in mode which doesn't work too well.   I think it kinda all hinges on this upcoming off-season. If the lakers manage to get some FAs and compete I think all will be forgiven, if not I think in 5 years or so it'll look real bad. "

"""Rajon Rondo defends fellow LA Laker teammate Lebron James from criticism in the media""  2009 Celtics Fans - Is this an Onion headline?"
"I'd be happy to:  1.  Michael Jordan:  I think most would consider MJ a better scorer than Durant (especially if you include the playoffs), but even if they are even MJ was a better playmaker.  I don't think you would disagree with me on this so I'll move on.  2.  Lebron James:  Pretty comparable scoring wise with KD (especially again if you include the playoffs).  However, for the sake of fairness I'll say KD is a slightly better scorer.  Lebron's playmaking though is so much greater than KD's that this put Lebron's offensive impact as clearly higher than KD's.  3.  Magic Johnson:  The GOAT playmaker.  KD might be the greatest scorer ever, but Magic Johnson is clearly the greatest playmaker ever.  Additionally while his scoring wasn't super elite, it was still very good (his career average was 19.5 ppg at .610 TS%).  If you have any doubt of Magic's supreme offensive impact look at the Lakers offenses from 1980-91.  Every year the Lakers were the #1 offense or damn close every year despite some of those later Laker teams lacking great offensive supporting talent.  They also fell off immediately when Magic retired.        4.  Shaquille O'neal: Absolutely dominating offensively.  Especially come playoff time no one could stop his combination of scoring and playmaking.  Do you remember how people were freaking out over how unstoppable 2016 Curry was?  That was how people thought about prime Shaq.  If you truly disagree with this I can get into more detail.  5.  Larry Bird:  Sort of a similar argument as the Magic Johnson one.  Bird has as strong of an argument as anyone for being the 2nd greatest playmaker behind Magic, and while his scoring wasn't at KD's level (mostly because he never got the free throw line) it was still great.   I think those 5 are clearly above KD.  That's not even including guys that have had higher offensive peaks than KD, but with much shorter primes (Curry, Harden) or guys that are hard to compare because they played in much older eras of basketball (Kareem, Wilt, Oscar, Jerry West).

"That one featured Rodman though. Who was in the 88-90 and 96-98 finals. By getting someone else instead of Jordan there, you can get a player who played in the first three-peat while also playing in some other finals. Like Horace Grant who also randomly played in the 04 finals. For which Robert Horry didn't play, while still taking part in the Lakers three-peat of 00-02, 94, 95, 05 and 07. And so on.  You could get just a few players for a good span of a couple of decades.  Like I said yesterday, every NBA final since 1980 through 2018 featured at least one of Kareem, Parish, Rodman, Grant, Horry, Kerr, Scalabrine, DJ Mbenga, or LeBron James. That's 39 consecutive finals with just 9 players.   Since 1982: Kareem, Olajuwon, Rodman, Grant, Duncan, Kobe, DJ Mbenga, LeBron.  That's 8."

By getting someone else instead of Jordan there, you can get a player who played in the first three-peat while also playing in some other finals. Like Horace Grant who also randomly played in the 04 finals. For which Robert Horry didn't play, while still taking part in the Lakers three-peat of 00-02. And so on.  You could get just a few players for a good span of a couple of decades.  Like I said yesterday, every NBA final since 1980 through 2018 featured at least one of Kareem, Parish, Rodman, Grant, Horry, Kerr, Scalabrine, DJ Mbenga, or LeBron James. That's 39 consecutive finals with just 9 players.   Since 1982: Kareem, Olajuwon, Rodman, Grant, Duncan, Kobe, DJ Mbenga, LeBron.  That's 8."
"""What the fucks the point of going to the playoffs when you're getting your ass kicked by the dubs""-LeBron James"
"So in other words you are just making excuses for Kobe? Kobe missed the playoffs in his absolute prime. He demanded a trade in his prime. LeBron left teams after he finished his contract, he never tried to run away in the middle of his contract.  The only reason Kobe stayed was because they got Pau gasol for Kwame lmao Name a player the Cavs got in his first stint that is anywhere close to Pau? Exactly, you cant.  &gt; when he is clearly better than say a lebron james  Lol probably shouldve stopped reading there. You clearly have an agenda here. But Ill dig deeper.  &gt; You know why? Because lebron can't hold kobe's jockstrap. And you know it lol.  Is that why he has like a 17-7 record in head to heads against Kobe? lmao be honest did you even watch the beginning of LeBron's career?  And really? You are posting all star game highlights? lmao what does that prove? Like here you go, I can post random videos too:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mgiXKcXn1E  &gt; Lebron on the other hand? Quits, isn't willing to play that hard  This is how I know you havent been watching basketball for that long. Kobe quit in **GAME 7** of the playoffs. Not a regular season game, not just a playoff game, BUT A GAME 7. Elimination game. Were you unaware of this? Or was this another thing you were trying to sweep under the rug? Thats pathetic."
"Yeah and if he didn't the lakers would have probably never gotten pau gasol, shaq was also to blame for that feud, phil jackson and kobe buried the hatchet, went on to win two more championships.     Lebron james didn't demand a trade, he left his teams in the dust on 3 separate occasions. It's ridiculous for you to criticize kobe for demanding a trade, kobe stayed with the lakers in his prime with no other all star on his team, if he didn't put pressure on their franchise, if they didn't get pau they may have never won another championship and even in this situation where he did win 2 more championships, people like yourself are still critical of the guy's career, when he is clearly better than say a lebron james. And that's okay, lebron doesn't have to be better than kobe, kobe wasn't better than jordan.    Yeah kobe lost in the first round, he went head up against the second place team in the league with a two time mvp with nobody on his team.     Jordan picked kobe over lebron when asked who was better, pointed to championships, the most difficult achievement in the game, which kobe has more of playing on one team in a far tougher conference than lebron.     You know what happened next? Kobe as a veteran proceeded to embarrass prime lebron the next day at the all star game.     You know why? Because lebron can't hold kobe's jockstrap. And you know it lol.    ""Kobe Bryant shuts out LeBron James as things get testy""    https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2013/02/18/kobe-bryant-lebron-james-nba-all-star-game/1927339/    ""Kobe Bryant Embarrasses LeBron James During All-Star Game""     https://www.nbclosangeles.com/blogs/triple-threat/All-Star-Kobe-Bryant-LeBron-James-Chris-Paul-Lakers-191629221.html    I explained how it's chasing milestones, kobe played as hard as he could and injured himself ended his career for the sake of the team, for winning. Lebron on the other hand? Quits, isn't willing to play that hard. And it's not that he's not capable, lord knows he has all the physical capability in the world, he just doesn't have that mentality. Somebody on here was talking about how all of this doesn't matter because he planned to film a movie or something during the playoffs, and didn't plan to play hard this season, that had upvotes on this sub.    How pathetic is that? To give up before you even try to do something?Even if it was somehow the plan to fail like this."
Remember what LeBron James did to them baby dinosaurs? Regular season success =/= deep playoff run. Also...^(73-9)
You are gonna have a worse record than last year potentially after adding Lebron James 
"Wasting my time replying to this bait but you got me!  All-NBA isn't everything. Also worth noting that Vince had injuries early on in his career. Since media values games played he lost out for 2 years he arguably could've made at least third team.  By the time he was healthy again there was a new crop of players (2003 class) and the media are always looking for the next new thing to hype up and promote (in this case LeBron and DWade) You see this every year with, which NEW player should win MVP this season?  Vince was still putting up great stats but the media is also inconsistent with their voting. Do they value the best 3 players for each position in the entire league based on stats? Or do the teams with the best records automatically get a representative&gt; (usually the best player on the team but not necessarily an objective top 15 player in the league in terms of talent)  Since you're clearly a nephew and only understand modern examples Demarcus Cousins was named to All-NBA despite never making the playoffs (before this season) yet you have James Harden missing out in 2015-2016 being a playoff team.  Vince also owns and shares several NBA records but I'm guessing it was too hard to google those specific achievements in 5 seconds."
"This is horseshit.    6 years ago:    The Lakers were 25-29 in 2013 when kobe guaranteed they'd make the playoffs, kobe went crazy, they made the playoffs.    The lakers are 30-35 now and have lost 3 or 4 straight since lebron said he activated his ""playoff mode"" maybe even were above 500. at the time.     Lebron himself has been playing badly, sure he stuffs the stat sheet but when you actually watch the game you see how unimpressive he's been, particularly on defense, but lackluster fourth quarters, not pressing the issue in a loss against the clippers, losing to one of the worst teams in the league, bricking two free throws in a row at the most important point in the game for the loss.     It's so bad that people have resorted to saying you just shouldn't mention what's happening because it's rude to. This is a monumental failure of epic proportions. This lakers team after adding lebron james is looking the exact same way they did last year and the sport of basketball is not about his individual milestones. "
"Well this one will be a bit more. If you get two big stars you guys will be fine. If you strike out completely, this is probably the last year of Lebron as King James, and the year after he's already 36 and well declined, but on a supermax deal, so it's like Kobe's final years. "
"This guy has been a disaster in the NBA. It's quite a shame since I really like him too, not many rookies stands up against LeBron James under the bright light of New York. I doubt he becomes a starter in this league so I hope he goes somewhere that can utilize him effectively."

"A few arguments:  Marketability - less appeal than even Kobe in his era.  MVPs - The GOAT candidates all have 4-6 MVPs, Duncan has 2.  Too similar to Bill Russell in terms of GOAT candidacy - people who would submit Duncan into these debates, they are instead submitting Russell who accomplished a similar effect with an unreal defensive dynasty.  And specifically on Lebron versus Duncan:  Greatest floor raiser of all time - Lebron's impact on many teams has been pretty unparalleled. When he first left the Cavs, they collapsed on nearly the same level the Bulls did when they lost MJ, Pippen, and Rodman.  Unreal advanced stats - more trendy stats like RAPM/RPM highlight Lebron's massive team impact.  Duncan team stability and coaching - Lebron is seen as elevating a historically bad franchise while Duncan seems to have lucked his way into a historically good franchise. The franchise's coaching and continued excellence without Duncan make crediting him less easy. The Cavs collapsed into an utter mess without Lebron while the Spurs continue even despite losing Kawhi as well.  Wade and Bosh regression/underperformance - one Thinking Basketball podcast discussed this when it came to the Lebron vs Jordan debates. Had Wade and Bosh not regressed during the Heatles, it would be harder to appreciate Lebron's excellence simply because of the nature of superteams (see: Durant and Curry right now). However, because the two regressed, it really gave Lebron a chance to shine especially with impact metrics. 2014's RPM had Lebron as a +9.08. Contrast that with runner up Chris Paul's +7.98, or 3rd place Iguodala's +6.63. James was putting up insane impact metrics on very strong teams which is abnormal. Contrast this with Curry and Durant who are failing to even come close to James' RPM once they paired together.  Also side note, I [greatly enjoy the Backpick's top 40 careers ranking where Ben Taylor gives more comprehensive evaluations of players](http://www.backpicks.com/2017/12/11/the-backpicks-goat-the-40-best-careers-in-nba-history/). This particular list ranks Duncan 7th and James 3rd."
"I bet a ton of you agree with this headline but these people would have careers if Lebron James never existed, they would just have a different subject to talk about.  And their job would probably require more work."
"He’s ranked high in his class, has the best training in the world, insane genetics and his name is literally LeBron James Jr. It’s not a lock, but it’s likely."
"Honestly. No respect to LeBron right now. He's a great player, second best all time. But he's mostly contributed to this steamer of a season. If people are giving him a hard time so be it.  Ditto Lakers organization. Here's there plan for the franchise prior to getting Bron.  1. Get LeBron James 2. Win Championship  It's air tight. "
"I don't know how well Raptors fans digested Lebron ""Daddy of Toronto"" James memes."
"Kyrie Irving, along with LeBron James, led a historical comeback against a historical team on the biggest stage of basketball. Dame got swept in the first round last season. "
"I have no idea what’s going to happen in the Eastern Conference this year. The Raptors always struggle in the playoffs, then again, no Lebron James to worry about. The Celtics look bad now but are very capable of turning it up later. If the Sixers can stay healthy then I can see them dominating the playoffs. The Bucks have an MVP candidate and a really good team behind him so who knows.  The West: Warriors (... possibly, if by some miracle the Rockets)"
"Even Iguodala has won finals MVP during 2015 for guarding LeBron James like Kawhi did...  Spurs relied mainly on their big 3, although Tony Parker was the best player between them."
"Here's a better thought experiment--would Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, LeBron James, or James Harden be able to go a single possession with the basketball without turning it over in 1960? Between strict carry rules and strict travel rules, I doubt it."
"Even Iguodala was the finals MVP for guarding LeBron James like Kawhi did...  Spurs relied mainly on their big 3, although Tony Parker was the best player between them."
"&gt;Honestly, it's true, are we really pretending like they would have as lucrative of a career without discussing LeBron James?      They probably can, we're in the hot take era that hating on the next big thing might get them a lucrative career. Let's say we take LeBron James out of the equation they'll just do this thing again on the next best player probably hating Durant on how he can't be better than MJ lol"
"As the door to the cryocasket closed, NBA legend Lebron James turned his head to the AI called “Magic” and said,  “Wake me, when you need me...”  *A.D. 2553, as the Lakers approached the NBA All Star break with a record of 28-29*"
"...and he got all of that because he started his career talking about nothing other than Lebron.  Which would make the statement ""made a career out of discussion Lebron James"" 100% true."
"Which team did Nate Thurmond play for at the end of his Career? That's right, Cleveland Cavaliers. Who was from Cleveland? LeBron James.   * Looks like LeBron  * Also has a cyborg body  * HAIRLINE????  LeBron Thurmond "
"Actually won multiple series, vets with a lot of experience, Kawhi Leonard. Raptors have only lost to LeBron James. "
What the fuck does that even mean? Except in Miami Lebron never had anything close to someone trying to put him in a winning system. His first stint with us our management was shit and did nothing to make a winning team besides drafting Lebron fucking James.
"Real talk.  As a huge fan of the Big 3 era Celtics back when, I still can't wrap my head around a photo of Laker Rondo high fiving his team mate Laker LeBron James, but fuckin real talk."
"The media doesn't love Lebron James or hate Lebron James which is something people fail to comprehend. Just last year Colin Cowherd said Ben Simmons was better than Lebron while the Cavs were on a losing streak in October. Once the Cavs were winning again, Lebron was back to being the GOAT.  The media uses Lebron James. He is a source of employment for them. People cannot stop talking about him. Lebron James understands this that's why he doesn't fall for his fans or his haters in the media. They don't really care about him. Even his media supporters will turn on him when he fails.  Everyday on national tv Lebron James's 'killer instinct' is more talked about than the Denver Nuggets or the Milwaukee Bucks or the Golden State Warriors. The same debates are had every day about Lebron and the GOAT debate or clutchness and in other ways in which he compares and differs from Michael Jordan. And people can't stop clicking on those videos. They can't stop watching. They can't stop arguing the SAME arguments almost every damn day.  Lebron James will forever be trashed until he wins another championship. And even then, in the days that follow, even that will be critiqued."
"Biggest free agent signing in decades. Historic franchise adds a top 3 all time talent, and you call him a trash player. You don’t deserve the lakers history and you don’t deserve lebron James "
"As someone who has tickets to a Lakers game that is the second leg of a back to back, and only bought the tickets to see Lebron James(lose) I am very dissapointed"
I'm picking Tim Duncan over LeBron James in an all-time draft.
Lebron James has made the Finals for 8 consecutive years. He's about to not even make the playoffs this year because he signed with a terrible team in the offseason.
Lebron James has rice krispy dick he not legend.

I don't think James harden could get us to the playoffs even the way he's playing this season. It's over. We're out. Hopefully LeBron gets enough rest that next season isn't a repeat of this...
"At some point even for you guys it's gonna stop being funny and just be sad.   If Magic doesn't own up to his shit, I can guarantee you that we will not come close to a championship in the Lebron James era. "
"So you’re saying Lebron James is weak-minded? Go to bed, nephew. "
I'm way down to listen to the nonsensical ramblings of 90 year old Marv Albert while LeBron James Jr dunks all over Xanadu Goldstein-Hathaway. It'll be nonstop hilarious. We just gotta ride this out. 
The NBA changes so rapidly dude. Imagine someone saying 5 years ago that the Warriors would start a new dynasty that rivals the 90s Bulls. Or that LeBron would win a championship for Cleveland. Or that James harden would become one of the most elite offensive players in history. Or that the Nets have actually managed to rebuild despite Billy King's fuckup. 
Fucking joke. Shouldve kept his loud mouth fucking shut about playoff mode and focused on next year. Kobe fucking bryant would not have been celebrating stats while his team lost amd missed the playoffs. Lebron james the most gifted player ever but a bitch and nowhere near the competitiveness of MJ or Bird or Kobe or Shaq or Duncan or Magic or Isiah Thomas.  
"""The lakers are a dumpster fire that even LeBron James can't put out"" just made my day. That and the fact the article was from an English paper."
"Honestly, facts, are we really pretending like half the people on undisputed would have a career without discussing LeBron James?  Not to mention Jason Whitlock who has overtly said he dislikes LeBron because of his left-leaning political views. And guess where the majority of the negative media coverage of LeBron is coming from? Fox Sports shows like Undisputed, Whitlock's Speak For Yourself, etc "
"That’s really all dependent on what western team he played on at what time (assuming that their rosters at the time remain the same with the addition of James). It took Lebron a while to even reach his first finals because of how terrible the 2000’s Cavaliers rosters were. Assuming he went to an established contender out west, it’s hard to not have whatever James team would be on as the favorite out west (up until 2015 Warriors become established, assuming James wouldn’t be on GSW)"
&gt;Rondo defending his *Lakers* teammate lebron james. 
"1. Lebron James Jr. likely never makes the NBA, and if he does there is no guarentee he is going straight to the NBA out of highschool.   2. I’m implying that Lonzo will be traded this offseason, I’m not implying that it is AD or bust, other options will come up. "
Imagine tanking with LeBron James on your team
"I don't know if you heard, but Lebron James returned to Cleveland and won a championship."
Man could you imagine getting high with lebron james? That'd be insane 
"How involved LeBron is with his new team. From what I know, the community of former players around the Lakers is pretty close. Quite a few of them work for the team, or covering the team, and although I'm sure they don't keep in touch day-to-day, they all touch base from time to time. James not doing that is somewhat of an anomaly."
Bc the shit this sub hates on James Harden for is the same shit they make excuses for when it’s Lebron who does it. And ppl take notice. 
Tank Commander LeBron James
"Given his personality, Lebron did what he did mostly because of himself and his legacy. Cleveland and the people came as a consequential effect. If you are fan of Cleveland, to a degree you may respect what James did for the team but being grateful is just waste of emotion ... if you ask me.  "
"The fans put up with this shit though.  The NBA got so fucking soft, the refs are a joke, teams try to lose games, stars just choose up their own teams, and now they're not even coming into work anymore.  But people eat up all the social media shit and follow it like a soap opera so who needs basketball when you can just watch the NBA reality show?  Will Lebron James play basketball tonight?  Edge of your seat drama."
"Lakers should change their slogan to ""LMAO WE HAVE LEBRON FUCKING JAMES AND WE CAN'T MAKE THE DAMN PLAYOFFS"""
With lebron missing 30 games in a tougher conference. Y’all are in the lottery because you lost James. you’re a shit ass team this year
"LeBron as a player and person is great  His fans just make him much more fun to root against  Look at this subreddit, LeBron's not even in the playoffs but there's posts about him everyday  Every one of his accomplishments are attributed to him alone, and every failure is attributed to his teammates  It just gets old over time, in fact the worst one is when some 19 year old posts ""God, I just CANT FATHOM how ANYONE could root AGAINST LeBron James, they MUST BE HATERS""   Like really bro, is it that surprising, christ"
"Hey don't forget about us! The Grizzlies have never selected first overall.  2001: Fell from 4th to 6th after being leap frogged by Clippers and Hawks  2002: Fell from 3rd to 4th after being leap frogged by Rockets. Rockets got Yao Ming and we got Drew Fucking Gooden.   2003: Jumped from 6th to 2nd. BUT, we owed that pick to Detroit. If we had gotten 1st, we would have kept the pick and got Lebron. So we got nothing out of that jump up.  2007: Fell from FIRST to fourth as we were leapfrogged by Blazers, Sonics, and Hawks. Seriously?! Best odds in the draft with both Oden and Durant and we got jumped 3 times. We got Conley at 4, but Durant clearly would have been better.  2008: Fell from 4th to 5th as the Bulls won the lottery and got D-Rose.   2009: Jumped from 6th to 2nd. FINALLY! We have a chance to do something good! We didn't have the sure-fire Blake Griffin, but this was a good draft! Steph Curry, James Harden, Demar Derozan are all available! What's that!?!? HASHEEM THABEET COME ON DOWN!! FUCK ME  2010: Eh, we had 12th odds and stayed there. About right.  2018: Fell from 2nd to 4th. Once again we are the bridesmaid and not the bride. I'm not mad because I think JJJ is a really good player, but having Luka would have been better.   So yes, you know what, I think Memphis deserves it."
Bro. Dirk was just really good and Lebron James was mentally soft at that point.
"I love the self proclaimed 'king' part that Skip Bayless uses with Lebron, just to make it seem like Lebron is the only one who uses the term. Lol, everyone calls him King James, come on Skip."
"""By the end of Lebrons tenure in Miami""  Who said I am talking about the end of his tenure in Miami?  In 2010 Wade averaged nearly 26 points a game, good for 7th in the league, and that is with Lebron as the #2 scorer. He also averaged basically 7 rebounds and 5 assists a game. He shot at at 54% clip , good for the highest number in his career, and maintained a similar statistical level the following season.   If you want to argue he wasn't a top 3 player those years, you are probably right, but if you want to argue he wasn't a top 5 player you are probably wrong, as least to the point where we are arguing over whether Wade was # 6  or #4 in the league, especially when differences in positions etc.. make the argument a moot point. Only Kobe scored more in those years at SG in a much less efficient manner. Either way, with every concession I could make, Wade was a top 10 player, Lebron was the consensus #1, and Bosh was a top 3 PF in the game, and I would say going into 2010 was viewed as a top 10 player in the league, hard to say where Bosh was league-wise during his tenure in Miami, as of the of the big 3 he took the back-seat much more than the other 2.   Anyways, the crux of my argument is that saying that Lebron didn't play with immense talent, more so than Durant did prior to his time in GS, is completely wrong. If you are saying that 2013 Wade wasn't as good as 2010 Wade, sure, but you can't then say ""Well Durant played with Harden in OKC"" because Houston MVP James Harden was not the level of player in OKC he is today."
Wiggins was constantly called “the surest thing since Lebron James” and look at him now
"Again, I like competition. True competitive excellence is mastering the game, while taking down the best of the best. Not losing a bunch, then saying “fuck it, can I join you guys”.  And you stop it lol. The moment he signed in 2016 everyone knew how the next couple seasons would play out. If you add the best player, from the second best team, to a 73-win team obviously no one else has a chance.  I said the 2016 Cavs championship was *one of* the hardest of all time, not the hardest. James beat the greatest regular season team of all-time, who were defending champions, in the only 3-1 comeback in NBA history.  Could you imagine if LeBron joined the Warriors after losing to them in 2015?"
Sorry where is LeBron James in this scenario? On the Knicks? Oh wait he's in LA.
"Yeah, at least LeBron created his own legacy in Miami (which was also a weak move, not to the same degree though).   Two years before James went to Miami, they were last place in the nba. Two years before Durant went to GSW, they won a championship while revolutionizing basketball.   And yeah, not everyone can be Dirk. Durant certainly isn’t."
"&gt;According to NBA.com, Lowry has defended a total of 65 post-up possessions this season. Opponents have scored 48 points against him for an average of 0.74 points per post-up possession.  &gt;That ranks Lowry in the 82nd percentile in terms of how efficiently he defends those plays, putting him ahead of Kevin Durant, Ben Simmons and LeBron James to name a few.    Technique and leverage matters a lot in post defense, and for whatever reason there are shorter guys like Lowry who do surprisingly well in the post.    For comparison Kawhi allowed 1 point per possession on postups, which is not good."
There is a reason why the Cavs traded Wiggins for Love even when everyone was saying Wiggins was the next Lebron James. You go with the proven entity over the “what if”
"Offensively great regular seasons you mean, the goal is to win in the playoffs. NBA playoff basketball is a practically a different sport from NBA regular season basketball. And I'd say no, it does not outweigh it.  He's had his chances to prove hes worthy of being built around, he didn't have to beat the warriors to that. Worst single game playoff performance of all time. That is on James Harden's resume and it came at home against a team without its MVP candidate. Damn sure didn't look worthy then. That was the year after he got shut down by Wes Matthews in a first round upset. Not worthy then. Horrible season/horrible playoffs in 1016, sent home in first round as 8 seed in 5 games. In 2017, in maybe the second worst playoff performance of all time by an mvp candidate, gets dragged by Corey Brewer and Josh Smith to the conference finals after getting benched in the fourth quarter of an elimination game 6 where he was the only player on his team to have a negative +/-. It was -20. I'm not underrating him, you're overrating him and regular season significance.   His offensive ability is not top 30 for the purpose of winning championships in NBA history, no. Top 40, maybe.    The bottom line is Harden is just on the other side of the fence, he always has been, and he's not getting over it. You simply need to be on the other side of the fence to win championships as the best player. The fence representing top 4 player in the league status. Of the last 35 seasons there are only three teams win championships that debatably didn't feature a top 4 player in the world at the time. Those were the 2014 Spurs, 2011 Mavs, and 2004 Pistons. Spurs had Leonard who would soon basically ascended to the top 4 in the finals that year. Mavs had Dirk who spent many years of his career in the top 4 but might not have been that year. Every other team had Steph, Kobe, Shaq, Duncan, Lebron, Jordan, Magic, Bird, Olajuwon, or Zeke. Does or has Harden ever seemed like he belonged on that list? Obviously not, in fact Harden has never been a top 4 player in the world at any moment of his life. He emerged in 2015 at the same time as Steph, while Durant, Lebron, and Kawhi were already occupying the other spots and its been the exact same since then. Those are tough four to compete with, but it's not as difficult as say the 2000's that Shaq, Kobe, Duncan, and Lebron occupied."
"Oh yeah, I missed him off. So that's six guys. Who else is getting in ahead of LeBron James lol"
"Why don’t you just look up his stats and find out yourself before you come on here and look like a fool again   No, obviously not.  He’s a 6’8” playmaking wing, lebron fucking James has never had a 20 and 10 season, he’s not Dwight Howard."
"lmao alright, so [here's a comparison of their stats this year](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1_select=LeBron+James&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Ben+Simmons&amp;player_id2_select=Ben+Simmons&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=simmobe01&amp;idx=players)  LeBron: 27.4/8.5/8.3 on 58.8 ts%  Simmons: 16.9/8.8/7.7 on 58.2 ts%  LeBron has the lead in OWS, WS, WS/48, OBPM, BPM, and VORP. Simmons has the lead in DWS and DBPM.  Also you could just watch the two of them play and consider how each one affects the game. LeBron is much better than Ben Simmons."
"It's not embarrassing at all. Not only is it not a key part of the article or in it's headline, it's literally prefaced with ""one Western Conference executive brought up a name that could be a Simmons trade target: LeBron James."" It's literally explained as a distant whatif."
I guess that’s cool. But imagine ball dominant Zion on the knicks playing LeBron James style. GO KNICKS!!!!
"Skip is clearly trolling, but it isn't too far fetched to think that they'll be pretty close very soon as Lebron continues to age and Simmons improves. Very hard for a 35/36 year old player to outperform a 23/24 year old.   They aren't as far as you would think       https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Ben+Simmons&amp;player_id1_select=Ben+Simmons&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=simmobe01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id2_select=LeBron+James&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=jamesle01&amp;idx=players#stats-advanced::none"
I heard this wild theory trade offer on TV today about Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons for Lebron James.
Yeah ONE CHIP with a young and prime LeBron James are you serious if he spent the majority of his career with the Spurs or Miami Heat he'd have won 6 or more because those franchises aren't a walking dumpster fire that's constantly picking top 5 and constantly drafting busts.
"You're being spectacularly combative.    I asked where you read it, you said the Game 3 PGT, and I accepted that yeah, I didn't really look after the game so that explains it.  Are you so sensitive that somebody can't even ask where you read something without getting defensive?    &gt;So you are telling me Steph Curry is even greater than he really is because not only did he shimmy his way to 3 championships in 4 years, but he did that beating not just any LBJ, but a MOTIVATED LeBron James.  [Remember this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxvpmbFyfEM)  What happened after that?  And again, you're being incredibly defensive and I don't understand why.  I'm not saying ""literally every single time a person has taunted the other team, they went on to lose the series.""  I'm saying athletes are human beings, and sometimes a little ""This is now personal"" motivation can push players just a little bit further.  Emotion is a funny thing like that."
Skip Bayless: Lebron James hate... a noble cause.
"Irving is the wrong PG for Brad Stephen's system.  And one of them main issues has to be that it's hard for a coach who has enjoyed success, to totally acquiesce to an unproven leader in Kyrie.  Rozier, on the other-hand, is amicable to whatever the game plan is, there's no push-back from him. Is he better than Kyrie, hell no. Does he fit this team better, Yep.   Yes, Kyrie won a championship, but he did it with LeBron James powering the operation and in a different (shooter's) roll."
"&gt; Where did you see our fans being sensitive about it? I didn't read or hear anything about it after Game   &gt; Maybe it's just that I personally didn't care and after that game the last thing I wanted to do was visit the sub's post game thread.  Jesus Christ man, you question me where you see Raptor fans being sensitive about it and it's because you didn't read or hear about it. There is a world outside your bubble man.   &gt; there's a reason you don't celebrate like that in the middle of a playoff series, you're just asking for trouble.  So you are telling me Steph Curry is even greater than he really is because not only did he shimmy his way to 3 championships in 4 years, but he did that beating not just any LBJ, but a MOTIVATED LeBron James."
Any team that has him starting isnt winning a championship unless Lebron James is there.
"I was really hoping this would be a sequel to ""why every team will land LeBron James"" and have ""the Grizzlies will not get Zion Williamson"" for Memphis like last year."

"Impacting a team. Hmmmm. How about maybe the greatest small forward of all time? James. More rings than both of them combined? James. Dragged a sorry ass Cavs team to the finals TWICE.   Please don’t argue nephson shit. Sure giannis and kawhi are better defenders, but Lebrons ability to get every single teammate in the floor involved is unmatchable. And his offense his better than both. And you talk like Lebrons some defensive liability when he played the warriors. Did you even watch any of the 4 series dude?   Just because your a warriors fan doesn’t mean you have to try to knock lebron.   I love watching golden state play. I watch them almost everytime I get, but I’m not delusional."
"Lebron James said, and I quote, ""don't donate to noble causes""."
"You're not rational. Not in the slightest. I could sit here and pick apart your entire reply but I don't have it in me anymore. You're probably just like every causal Laker fan I've ever met whose not really a Laker fan but a fan of Kobe. Pissed off that they got LeBron James and aren't exactly standing behind him because they don't want him to eclipse the career of their Hero. It's cool, I get it. I'm actually a fan of my team. You see the handle by my name? That's my team. Where's your team? Or are you still looking for a handle with just Kobe Bryant's name on it?"
"And that’s how you end up missing the playoffs, losing your president of basketball operations, and firing your coach with Lebron Fucking James on your roster."
"Raps lost G1 &amp; 3 by a combined 3 pts. Open brick by FVV and missed JV bunnies (also missed K Love foul) and a ridiculous shot by LeBron.   Raptors lost because they choked and faced LeBron James, who, by the way, did show up with a legendary 17 assist performance in the regular season against us.  But I also think the Bucks are a historically great team and will beat a KD-less Warriors."
Shannon Sharpe: LeBron James...noble
"Getting clowned just as much as the 17-65 Knicks when you have Lebron James on your team says all you need to know about the situation, but go off."
Lebron James last finals appearance: 11 months ago  Houston Rockets last finals appearance: 1995
I don’t see how signing LeBron fucking James is considered an experiment?
"How good is Zion supposed to be? I hear the best prospect since LeBron James, but I heard the same thing about Ben Simmons and Anthony Davis. While both are great players, neither are that close to LeBron, and AD is on an entire different level that Simmons."
"No, Miami is a big market.  Cleveland's market doesn't mean shit. LeBron could have played in China and they'd have been pulling in ratingins similar to NBA teams.  The NBA game broadcasts reached a four year high average of 1.2 million viewers. LeBron had a game televised on ESPN2 while he was a fucking high schooler that pulled a 1.9 rating with 1.6 million viewers.  This fucking guy pulled more viewers as a high schooler than the average NBA matchup does. LeBron James isn't an example for anyone else, he is a literal once in a lifetime, one of a kind human being."

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"It would have never been a *problem* per say but Lakers in the playoffs alone would have had a ratings draw probably second to any Warriors games and then you add Lebron James on top of it, the numbers they could have had would blow these away."
But what about LeBron James then?
Well I guess since you didn’t understand . LeBron James is listed at 6’8” which is below the needed qualification of 7 feet tall which OP mentioned in the post
""" In 2017, Marcus Thompson of The Athletic, author of the book ""[Golden: The Miraculous Rise of Steph Curry](https://www.amazon.com/Golden-Miraculous-Rise-Steph-Curry/dp/1501147838),"" explained to ""[ The Big Lead with Jason McIntyre](http://foxsportsradio.iheart.com/media/play/27729010/)"" that Curry was not all that popular with some of the league's biggest stars, including LeBron James. """
LeBron James and Luka Doncic. 2 manufactured stat whores who take looking good and losing over looking ugly and winning.
"Kevin Durant and Lebron James. They had to form super teams in their primes to save their legacy, otherwise they'd be useless like Harden.  Kareem Abdul Jabbar is similar. Magic Johnson saved his career.  Stockton and Malone were dirty players and I am glad they never won a ring.  How the hell did Steve Nash win 2 MVPs?"
"Tbh, I’d really meet James Jones, Lebron couldn’t win without him, so he’s clearly the GOAT."
"Nah, nah son. Harden flat out folded in game 5. Their best player and primary defender on you is out in the 4th and you have three points? And where was Hardens signature “MVP” performance? All we heard about during the regular season and him dropping 40-50 all the time, he should have had at least 50 this game 6. They already knew hose Golden State was gonna okay, and he knew what he should have done.   If this was LeBron, he would be getting crucified for this. 35 is good, but against this team, who we know what they can do without KD? Have we forgot 73-9? Yeah they lost, but the core formula is still there. Again, if LeBron was Harden and lost, he would be getting ripped a new one and James should. Especially for being called the “best offensive talent of all time,” the last two years. He should have gone to a different level. Kobe did, Bron did, MJ did. He didn’t and I don’t want to ever hear him in the conversation of these men ever.   Even if I give him game 6, playing well enough. Game 5 loss is completely unacceptable. The Warriors lost their best player. That’s momentum, moral, and mindset all changed when KD is out for the game with at the time an apparent achilles injury."
[Go BLAZERS!!!](http://lomotif.com/video/watch?v=lebron-james-pre-game)
His perfect spot is running off screens in a Lebron James offense. Just sayin
"Lebron's defense is much worse and his team success is much worse. It's pretty obvious to anyone who's not just a fanboy that he's not as good anymore. Plus he's also proven he has injury risk that he never had previously.  &gt; Do you think Zion will ever have a season where he comes close to averaging what James did last season  Do you think this is a fair way to evaluate trades with no context?  Will anyone the Pelicans get for Anthony Davis ever average his numbers? No, but they should still trade him.  Lebron is rapidly declining and probably can't be the best player on a championship team unless he has a GREAT roster around him. Their championship window is slamming shut and they'd be dumb not to take this chance to open another one."
He has.  2014-2019.  Klay Thompson 102 games.  Lebron James 101 games.  There goes your theory down the toilet!
"Curry's weakness is agile perimeter players, he's a good post defender however.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/6/8/17441998/lebron-james-steph-curry-mismatch-2018-nba-finals"
"derek fisher played 259 playoff games in his career.  the difference between derek fisher, klay thompson and lebron james is that one of them is the superstar.  and youre also wrong.  even taking in the 12 games this year. klay has played 114, since 2013 lebron has played 124.   imagine being that stupid, that you cant do simple math with a calculator."
In addition look at Klay Thompson the last 6 years:  Klay Thompson 106 playoff games  Lebron James 101 playoff games
"Hey, we have a rich history of top tier free agent signings. Like, Lebron James, Larry Hughes, CJ Miles, Iman Shumpert, Anthony Parker, Mo Williams and Kevin Love!"

Honorable mention to Odom who won 6th man that year  - Oklahoma City Thunder 4-1 who had 2 All NBA players: Durant (1st team) and Russ (2nd team).

"[interesting read in restrospect](https://www.sbnation.com/2019/4/8/18299012/nba-playoffs-2019-no-lebron-james-lakers)  &gt;As for the NBA, not only did it not get to see the full potential of a star as bright as LeBron under lights as bright as they are for the Lakers in L.A, but the league now doesn’t even get its biggest star in the playoffs at all. The Eastern Conference playoffs haven’t always been super compelling in the past decade and a half, but the league could always sell fans and casual viewers on the presence of LeBron. Just watch, and you could be a witness to something glorious.   &gt;The NBA has other exciting superstars to put on a pedestal. Many of those exciting superstars will be in the playoffs. Perhaps this postseason without LeBron can be — instead of a drag on profits — an opportunity to continue to build up the next LeBrons.  &gt;Giannis Antetokounmpo, given his incredible talent, shocking physicality, and golden personality, seems to be the obvious successor for LeBron’s Golden Boy of the NBA title. Giannis plays for the East’s top-seeded Bucks, a team without a ton of recent success, but one with a fairly storied history in the earlier decades of the league. Antetokounmpo has a global fan base, and he’s much like LeBron in the sense that he has captured the hearts of the casual fans who experience him as well as the hardcore basketball fanatics. Like LeBron, Giannis is for everyone (except the haters in Boston or Philly)."
"We're talking about a team trading Lebron James, lol. Anybody who seriously follows basketball knows that isn't happening."
Giannis is about to take his mask off and reveal he's actually been LeBron James the whole time and beat the Raps in 4
If you have Lebron James you got a pretty damn good choice on what you get back.
"So she put AD who definitively quit on his team and tried to force his way out,  and also can't even pick his own clothes over Lebron James? Lebron must've pissed in her cereal cause that's ridiculous."
The only team that has the luxury of exploring a Lebron James trade is the Lakers. Who gives a cares if the Sixers want to trade Simmons for Lebron? No fucking shit they do
"I’m a LeBron James fan. As I can’t pick just LeBron James, I choose to rep where I liked him the most."

"I actually think that was the most surprising thing about the interview was just how critical she was of Lebron James.  &gt; *The thing that I admire most about LeBron James is how he empowered players. To me, that will be his legacy, and it’s a great one. But, for my thinking, this year, he took that player empowerment and abused it. He opened a grenade, threw it in the locker room, and walked out. He literally and figuratively separated himself from the team when things went bad, as if to say, “This isn’t on me.” He showed up for a game with a glass of wine! To my mind, there has to be consequences for that. But the media, in general, because he’s so difficult to get access to—what people will do to curry favor with him makes me nauseous.*"
Lebron James isn't getting traded
Yeah and it gave us LeBron James?????? What are you on about.
I can sleep just fine with LeBron James max cap space and a promising young core. We've been in A LOT worse

"Blake scored less, rebounded less, assisted less, stole less, blocked less. Turned the ball over at a higher rate. Was less efficient (negligible, 59%TS vs 58%).

"You literally got embarrassed two years in a row. He eviscerated your team who was the heavy favourite just 12 months ago and because of injury he’s not #1? Lmfao with the recency bias. Until LeBron James gets outplayed in a series (and lets not act like he won’t be in the playoffs next year), he is still the best player. You earn the best player title and it isn’t stripped with the “What have you done for me lately narrative” which is still 28/8/8 on a “down year”."
"If you turn down $10 million, you would be a fuckin idiot. If LeBron turns it down, that's different. He's LeBron fuckin James, and he knew what he's really capable of, before the whole world. So of course he had to bet on himself. It's like betting on this GSW team to win the championship. I mean, no shit"

"The only real coincidence is that Bosh happened to be from Toronto.

The Dubs were FAR more consistent, but the Cavs would rip off these stretches (fairly often tbh) where they looked every bit as dominant as the Warriors. The national media doesn’t have time to watch the Cavs play the Grizzlies on a random night in December though, so most overestimated the difference between the two teams, and LOTS of people (several of the most popular podcasters that year were personally close with Steve Kerr and/or the Warriors organization) overestimated the difference between LeBron James and Steph Curry."

LeBron wasn’t in the Finals this year, so it’s pretty obvious why nobody outside of a few fringe Canadian fans have any interest in talking about the Finals.

Ratings over at ESPN prove that people are far more interested in talking about LeBron and LeBron wining than basketball nuts and bolts or small market teams."
Imagine getting downvoted for saying a dude who has yet to play a single minute in the NBA isn’t the next LeBron James.

[Wojnarowski] LeBron James tested positive for HGH. More to come.
"AD/Bosh: $15  Ray Allen/Kyle Korver/Shane Battier/Matthew Dellavedova: $10   James Jones/Shawn Marion/Joel Anthony/Rashard Lewis: Free.99  STARTERS: Delly/Allen/Bron/Bosh/AD  ROTATION: Korver off the bench for Ray, guard rotation is those two and Delly with Rashard Lewis providing a few mins at the 2, closing lineup is Korver+Allen and the frontcourt. Battier backs up LeBron, play a big lineup when needed with Battier at the 2, Bron running point, Marion/Bosh/AD. The Warden is the backup big but one of Bosh/AD must always be on the court. James Jones to wave towels and be a good luck charm, ez ringzzz."
"I think Kawhi would take less money to play alongside AD and LeBron. He seems like a guy who wants to finally get some recognition, and despite experiencing both individual and team success in San Antonio and Canada, the general public still has no idea who this guy is.   How do you change that?? You play with the King and you win with the King.   A big 3 of King James, AD, and Kawhi could win 75-80 games."
"If AD can’t win with LeBron James as a teammate, then the problem is clearly AD.   He was cut a lot of slack for not winning anything in New Orleans because New Orleans is a dumpster fire of an organization, but if you pair him with the 🐐, a guy who dragged scrubs like JR Smith and Tristin Thompson to the Finals, and the team still doesn’t win, at some point you have to think that maybe AD was the problem in New Orleans all along."
"I mean LeBron is a good reason but the skill gap is quite considerable between Derozan and Leonard that if James was with Cleveland, Leonard would've bounced his ass out. Leonard was sensational. Also guys stepped in a big moment at the right time."
"“Lebron James is ready to retire”   “...in a couple years after he’s won a few more chips and feels he’s ready to retire, probably.”"
"See, what did I tell you Shannon, No. 2 quit on Toronto just like he quit on my Spurs last year like I predicted. He just doesn't have what it takes to be a leader. I'm sorry.   You know what, I hope he signs with LA because clearly he's shown us he can't carry a team this year. He *needs* a guy like LeBron James and Anthony Davis to coddle him. Jason Kidd will probably massage his quad during timeouts! Talk about load management!  I've said it before and I'll say it again, he's got no clutch gene. He's had the luckiest playoff run in the history of the NBA. He dodged a bullet playing a hobbled Embiid and a gutted Warriors team who would've won in 7 games if it weren't for Klay getting injured *twice*. If he ends up joining Doc's Clippers, he'll get exposed and you'll see what he can really do in the West."
Comments going so fast nobody will know I love Lebron James
[Wojnarowski] Lebron James has announced his divorce from Savannah James and will talk about his 6 year affair with Mario Chalmers in an exclusive interview with Doris Burke
"Just in time for the big 3 of Alex Caruso, AD and Lebron James."
"Stephen Curry is currently 31, and he'll turn 32 towards the end of this upcoming regular season.   He's only 3 years younger than LeBron James, and he's 6 months older than Kevin Durant even though those two had been superstar MVP level players for years and years before Steph broke out into one himself.   I still find all of that pretty surprising.   Another classic one is Amir Johnson, who just turned 32. He played on the Pistons with Chauncey, Rip, Prince, Sheed, and Ben during the season when they won 64 games and lost to the eventual champion Miami Heat in the Conference Finals."
...LeBron James and Anthony Davis?
“Lebron James has opted to retire effective immediately in pursuit of his acting career post space jam 2 success”
LeBron James
"\[Wojnarowski\] Lakers, under pressure from Lebron James, have decided to send Anthony Davis to Boston for Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, and the Memphis 2020. James added ""I can't get boomed again."" then he said the letter X and the number 4. Cryptic."
Da fuck? That makes no sense. Every superteam has its own story behind it and different circumstances. GSW didn't need KD. They lost to LeBron James heroics in game freaking 7 down to the wire.
They have an extremely gifted head coach in LeBron James and a great assistant coach with Vogel
"Lebron James is a Professional Basketball player from Akron, Ohio."
"He'd be 2 at best. LeBron is LeBron James, he's gonna be the alpha on that team no matter what"
&gt; How can you people take 2011 LeBron over current LeBron?   Wtf. I’ll trade current Lebron for 2011 Lebron any day of the week. We need more years of Lebron James.
This is the paradox with trading / not trading.  Trade - Lol you gave up too much he would have signed in a year for free!  Not Trade - Lol you get Lebron James and spend his remaining top years not making the playoffs.  I like the trade option and being really really ridiculously good ~~looking~~.
The Lakers has traded LeBron James for cap space to offer Kentavious Caldwell-Pope the Supermax.
Lebron James demands trade.
"Lakers would be fucked, but it's not happening. LeBron James and Anthony Davis is one of the best teammate duos ever, and they're probably going to add a third star. If so, this will be the best superteam LeBron's ever been on. It would be absolutely shocking if they somehow didn't win a single ring."
"Lebron 'Rent-a-champ' James, the greatest INDIVIDUAL to ever play a TEAM sport."
"Lebron James is using the city and fanbase to pursue his own personal business interests, and they just gave up their entire roster and 7 years of draft control for a player.  30 out of 30 teams could have accomplished what Pelinka did if in the same situation.  The result is a team that has a 2 year window to win a chip before they end up as the worst team in the league for a decade"
Lmao he was able to sign LeBron James and trade for AD in back to back seasons
"And even more astonishingly, 9/9 NBA finals since 2010 have occurred with either Lebron James or Marcus Derrickson on the roster."
[Wojnarowski] The Los Angeles Lakers have traded Lebron James to the Golden State Warriors for Kevin Durant. More details coming.
You'd be the most hated man in LA if you held this up trade. Can't imagine culver/Garland/etc would have the balls to force their way onto the Lakers by refusing to sign on time.   No way any agent would advise an incoming rookie to try to upstage LeBron fucking James like that. Not to mention Garland is a rich Paul client. Don't know about culver or whoever else may get drafted with this pick.
&gt;lebron james bringing the heat OoHOoOOHooohHh 🍆
"Since July 2010, 8/9 NBA finals have occurred with LeBron James on the roster."
Who else picked up stars bigger than LeBron James and Anthony Davis?
Man i think this is just flat out wrong. We are talking about completing a team that already has Anthony Davis and Lebron fucking James. No team is gonna field 3+ all stars next year. You can maximize Lebron and AD just by surrounding them with solid players
"[Wojnarowski] The Wizards' imminent hire of Barack Obama as their next President of Basketball Operations has LeBron James interested in a move to the District, according to sources."
"“Good to see my Los Angeles Lakers acquire a top level talent, to pair with LeBron James, who is also very good at basketball. Lonzo Ball is a talented player, but he just doesn’t have that leadership quality.”"
Thanks to r/nba I now realize that having LeBron James and Anthony Davis on your team is a bad thing. I clearly didn't know shit about basketball!
"https://247sports.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/Article/How-much-cap-space-do-the-Lakers-have-after-Anthony-Davis-trade-13290291  Player	.............Salary LeBron James	$37,436,858 Anthony Davis	$31,156,972 Moritz Wagner	$2,063,520 Kyle Kuzma	$1,974,600 Alex Caruso (cap hold)	$1,443,842 Isaac Bonga	$1,416,852 Dead Salary	$5,000,000 Incomplete Roster Charges (six)	$5,382,948 Total	$85,875,592 Projected Cap Room	$23,124,408"
"I don't follow the nitty gritty of high school athletic recruiting, what exactly are the odds of him being drafted high? Or is the Lebron James name powerful enough to make that irrelevant?"
"Yeah, I don’t understand how that looks bad lol Haters are just blinded by the hate. If we can’t get that 3rd star, so be it. We’ll build a nice roster around LeBron James and Anthony Davis."
You should feel bad that you have Lebron James and Anthony Davis on your team. I almost feel sorry for you.
"""you could not live with your own failure, and where did that bring you? back to me."" lebron 'thanos' james probably"
"They would’ve had two concerns: 1) LeBron James: He’s not getting any younger, the championship window is closing, and closing fast. You need to capitalize off whatever years you can for a title 2) The PG13 effect: The same way the Lakers thought they had PG in the bag, AD may come to love whatever city/team he gets traded to, and the lakers will have nothing to show for it"
"35 year old LeBron James, injury prone ad and inefficient kuzma"
https://fox8.com/2018/06/26/his-own-words-what-lebron-james-has-said-about-cleveland-free-agency/  “I’m not going anywhere ever again… I don’t have the energy (for free agency).”   HE LIED.
"Chris Paul, Paul Pierce and Scottie Pippen beat Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and Lebron James.   Tough league."
"I'll admit when this whole saga started, I didn't know who to believe.I still don't know.  I took it as the uncle making the moves and kawhi obeying his uncle because his uncle raised him.   The uncle throughout all this seemed shady but now looking back at it, I think he always had kawhi's best interest at heart.   Recent things I'm reading and inferencing is that he wants to build kawhi's beans and make him power player like LeBron James. Read somewhere his uncle was instrumental in him telling the Tahoe and teaching him too have money. Also read his uncle wanted to start a similiar manner group as levels lrmr group.   I can't really blame him for that if true. He left Nike because they wanted to play him like Blake Griffin instead of giving him money similar to the top athletes. Now he's getting paid like a top by new balance."
"So if a team had lebron James, traded for AD, signed Kawhi, and signed Kyrie, and then Giannis decided to take the minimum to sign there, would you say “oh they didn’t win 73 games the previous year so they weren’t as stacked”?"
Kyrie is one of the best teammates LeBron James has ever had. He proved you can win with him as a point guard. I don’t think there would be any questions there.   But this can be the team that KD creates. GSW is the team Steph built. This can be KD’s team
Lakers had Lebron James and wasted him
"I’d definitely rather compete for a championship playing under guys like Lebron fucking James and AD. And I’m the 4th pick so I’m actually already good and may get decent playing time in a huge market. As long as I train hard and put the work in during the off season, it’d be a great place to play"
LeBron James from small market Cleveland &amp; made cap room to sign him
"[Wojnarowski] The Los Angeles Lakers have agreed to trade LeBron James and Kyle Kuzma to the New Orleans Pelicans for JRue Holiday, Julius Randle and the 2019 1st Overall pick in the NBA Draft."
Yes it’s a contender this season baring one major injury. Lebron James doesn’t play defense at all during the regular season either. Davis is also injury prone. You have zero bench and have to decide between a mid level guy now or filling in your bench since Pels fleeced 12 mill of your cap space lol. That being said you more than likely outside the first round have home court advantage. You better pray to the basketball gods that Lebron drank from that fountain of youth. Bulls timeline is completely different so not relevant to bring up at this time. Our window for seriously competing is 3-5 years. I’m just gonna sit back and enjoy the shit show in the meantime.

How? They have Anthony Davis and LeBron fucking James lol
Your salary cap and an aging Lebron James says otherwise 🤫
Pelicans do have a bright future that’s for sure. But no matter how you slice the cake having LeBron fucking James and Anthony Davis on your team (and 23.5 million of trade go’s through on 6th to get other players) is pretty fuckin sick
Thanks. I’m very happy that LeBron fucking James wanted to come here
LeBron James has taken his own life
I’m LeBron James
"He never had a choice with any of those teams he was drafted to the Spurs and traded to Toronto, and you're either a complete idiot or disingenuous to compare the ""star power"" of an old Gasol, Siakam or Kyle fucking Lowry to LeBron James and Anthony Davis"
You’re telling me the 2011 Dallas Mavericks had some magically elite defence that held LeBron fucking James to 17.8 PPG? They had some defensive strategy that elite defensive teams like the Bulls and Celtics and Warriors and Spurs couldn’t figure out? Come on. LeBron choked so hard that series
*Lebron James does a dunk contest*  *Loses said contest because of generic dunks; game dunks=/=dunk contest dunks*  *Get embarrassed all over social media and the internet for his failure and made a meme for being a loser*  **The End**
"So you mean all the people from that team at their current age? No not even close. That was peak Lebron, and a huge part of that team was their defensive identity. Wade is pretty washed up. Bosh would be old even without the health issues. Ray, Chalmers, Battier, Birdman, Mike Miller, James Jones, and I’m sure others are out of the league. So you’d have Bron and old ass Wade and Bosh."
"Oh damn you were being serious? Watching Lebron James, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony cheer for Dwyane Wade is better than anything they were gonna see. Who the hell is this hypothetical Nets fan who's buying courtside seats while simultaneously worrying about the playoff price increase, then getting mad that instead he has to watch 3 of the best players of all time cheering on another of the best players of all time?"
"They straight up pussied out.   And yes, this is a direct shot at LeBron James.   Unwilling to risk having his reputation tarnished and it's a pretty weak move to be honest.   I would have loved to see LBJ in his prime in the dunk contest. Anyone who says they don't are lying to themselves."
"I understand that the Thunder have an easy route but I don't even thik they should be favoured over the spurs let alone the Nuggets as young as they are. I saw a good argument the other day, and basically it was addressing why we overrate OKC so much. The toronto raptors catch so much shit for having been beaten by Lebron James THE player of this generation every playoffs, but at least they have regular season success. The Thunder not only fall short in the playoffs, but they don't even have regular season success to back it up. Essentially they are a 6-8 seed team, and their seeding is reflective of their ability which is proven by their continued lack of success in the playoffs. Id be happy for them to prove me wrong but I don't think other than PG, Russ andAdams they have a decent enough roster construction maybe outside of Schroder."
"Demar Derozan.  There are 396 players with over 1,500 minutes in the postseason.  Among them, ranking in Win Shares Per 48 1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kawhi Leonard ---- 391. DeMar DeRozan"
Yeah they should be like the Lakers and have all this crazy FO turmoil and miss the playoffs with LeBron Raymone James
"Forreal hes Lebron James, he doesn't need LA to build his brand. He literally made a movie while he was in Cleveland lmao, were people complaining then? People just say shit like that because they hate the dude and want to see him fail"

"What are these offers exactly? I believe you'd have 2+1 left on LeBron who just had the first major injury of his career this year. You have 2 years to maybe contend and if you're trading assets to get James you won't have as many to trade for help. Plus you'll be crushed in cap wise.   I'm in no way saying teams shouldn't try to acquire one of the best players of all time I just don't see who trades what to get him. You have a tough balance here and teams don't know what they're gonna get. I think LBJ will stay in LA, he knew not being competitive was a possibility and still inked a 4 year deal."
what if paul pierce got shaq or lebron james in their primes?
"&gt; LeBron James is only other player in NBA history to have done all that.   No need to outshine Wade on his retirement day. LeBron is just absolutely unfair, we don't shpeak on dat right now"

"Because, be didn't say ""I think it might be good"" he said it's GOING to be good because it has LeBron James staring. That's just dumb."
"And....Harden dropped 30+ points a game for over 20 games a row. Something only Wilt fucking Chamberlain has been able to do.Breaks Oscar Robinson's record, breaks Kobe Bryants record, Had 3 50+ pt games in 1 month including a 60+ pt game which nobodies come close to doing since the 1960's. Has recently become the only other player then MJ himself to finish a season with 2500 pts, 500 rebounds and 500 assists. The guys averaging 36/7/8. Much better and more efficient then last year which was, oh wait... his MVP season. Not to mention a huge portion of the season he was doing all this pretty much by himself, literally willing his team to victory Lebron James style. No Paul or Clint."
"*After LeBron James reaches out to all his NBA friends, it becomes apparent he and the Looney Tunes won’t have much help. To make matters worse, the Monstars have retooled in the most terrifying way possible, they stole MIchael Jordan’s talent.

Follow along as LeBron James and Kobe Bryant face off against MJ in the final battle to decide who the GOAT is*"
"[Lombardi] Lonzo Ball on who’s more of a father figure to him: Lavar or Lebron James. “I don’t compare my father with anybody,” Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo of a glass of wine. “I’ll let you interpret that however you want,” Lonzo said."
Luke Walton movie &gt; lebron james movie
"No, but calling it a ""good film"" is different than ""I want to see it"". It having LeBron James doesn't make it a ""good film""."
Laker legend LeBron James
"That's not what I said. That guy said Lonzo ""needs the ball to be effective"" and I was just telling him that's not true. Lonzo sometimes has *huge* impacts on games where he rarely shoots it or touches it much on offense, and a big part of that is because he's such a great defender.  Like you're a Sixers fan, so Ben Simmons needs the ball to be effective, and that's partially because he's not great off-ball, but it's also because he's the kind of guy you can run your whole offense through. You just give him the ball and he'll make it work for himself and everyone else. LeBron is that kind of guy, as is James Harden and many other players.   But Lonzo is not and never has been that kind of player. And just because he's not a ball dominant guard, that doesn't mean he's an incredible off-ball weapon simply by default. It's not like in this league you're either Ben Simmons or you're JJ Redick on offense, cause you might instead be someone who doesn't run the offense nor represent an off-ball scoring threat.   Lonzo is great at making passes, especially quick passes, and even ones that are like ""hockey assists"" rather than always to the guy who's gonna immediately score. But he's an unreliable shooter, while also not being someone who *ever* dominates the ball. He's still finding his way in an NBA offense, and was starting to establish himself before his season ended with his ankle injury in Houston. But to say he's someone who ""needs the ball to be effective"" is just flat out untrue, and is not something *anyone* who has watched him play would ever say about him."
"It's probably LeBron honestly. Either that or it's incredibly easy to get other players to leak you shit about LeBron James if you're a reporter.  I think it's LeBron doing it most likely because the more he is in the news the more people hear about him, like him, and buy his shit or support him as fans or whatever. The news is addicting, it is fun to learn new news. It’s fun to google ‘lebron’ Because there is always a story. Same with someone like Trump even if you hate him. It's a fucking horrible story or a stupid story, but you're interested. It works for both the media and the players as well. Publishers directly make money on clicks and watches. People make reputations on it. It's most likely been LeBron's camp and probably LeBron himself leaking everything on the Heat, Cavs, and now, Lakers."
"""Lebron James willing to trade little brother for AD"""

You forget bagley was out 2/4 and we didnt have Barnes for 3/4 lmao  Make all those excuses for replacing randle with Lebron james and winning less games than the Kings who didnt add anyone other than Barnes 50 games into the season.  LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLakers
"It would be more interesting if BEFORE the season, you said ""yeah Lakers are making a mistake signing LeBron James, they should tell him there's no way cause it's more important to stomach Luol Deng's contract and develop Ivica Zubac""."
"They’ve already made irreversible mistakes but they still have a chance to right the ship if they finally stop fucking around and hire someone from OUTSIDE of the organization that knows what they’re doing.   They have enough cap space to get a max or put together a competitive team. They have Lebron James for the next 2-3 years. They have assets like Ingram, Lonzo, Kuzma, Hart, lottery pick in this years draft.  The right guy can turn this ship around, but if they hire the wrong guy they’ll probably destroy all the assets they have left, panic and waste the cap space which would destroy Lebrons last productive years."
"They’re not in a bad position, they have 4 great players that are still young (same position Russell was in not so long ago), they just need time to develop. And they have LeBron James, one of the best players to ever play. They also have a ton of cap space and a lottery pick. With everything they’ve gone through, they’re still in a great position. Now if they mess up, trade all their young players, let LeBron go, and fire everyone they might be in a bad position. But hey, they aren’t doing that. It seems like the media is trying to get them to do that though."

"Like I said, I know every team goes through injury. I really wouldn’t complain about if it were just the usual kinds of injuries. We see today that laker management agrees, as they’ve now fired the head trainer. This season was just something else when it comes to injuries. Our entire starting lineup and their backups have missed games. Yes it’s a disappointing season, but this is so overlooked. I mean, we didn’t even have guys playing together consistently. As an example, Ingram came into the year trying to adjust to James. Then he gets hurt.  Then he has to work back in. Then James goes down. Then Lonzo goes down. Then James comes back. Then Kuzma gets hurt. Then he gets hurt. I think team chemistry is a big part of how much success you have. Not just the kind of whether you like one another or not, but understanding where you like shots, when to cut, when to pass, etc. This laker team had no time to do that. We were fantastic when all of our guys were playing, but it was rare.   I also agree that rondo, Stephenson, and beasley aren’t great. However, they were what we had. The FO didn’t do a great job signing them, but again, it’s not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. They are walking out the door right behind LeBron. They didn’t hamstring our future. This isn’t like the Mozgov or Deng signings. We don’t have to worry about these guys’ contracts coming to bite us in the future.   I think BI is really special. I think he has the potential to be much better than Lonzo. He can guard 1-4. His long arms make him a pest on defense. His midrange and pull up game are special. He’s a surprisingly good finisher. He still needs to extend his range, but he’s slowly gotten more confident in that as well. I agree that Knox and Kuz are pretty similar, but for now I think Kuz is much better. Yes he’s older but he was also the 27th pick.   Yeah, those are all tough questions to answer. However, I don’t think things are that dire. That’s pretty much my whole point. People are making it out like we’re in such a hell hole. Why are Ramona shelburne and David Griffin on tv talking about how they’ve received calls about people wanting the lakers job? I don’t think they’re lying. Zach Lowe’s podcast today talked about how bob Meyers might be interested - how the lakers are the only team he’d ever leave GS for.   And sure, the other end of that is being stuck with Jason Kidd. But I think that possibility shrunk massively with Magic’s departure. Magic would hire someone like Kidd. I think Jeanie would rather keep Walton. Listen to her interview with Zach Lowe and with Howard beck from a while back. You can tell she cares about him a lot and really is not comfortable firing him.   My whole point is and has been that we’re not in a terribly dire spot. People live too in the moment. Just a couple years ago, our starting lineup was Jordan Clarkson, Wayne Ellington, Wesley Johnson, Ryan Kelly, and Jordan Hill. Today it’s better at every position, including HC. This season didn’t pan out the way I would’ve liked for sure, but I’m not so down that I think our future is a disaster. We’ll be fine, and we’re in a lot better of a position than most teams."
"Jeanie​ Buss​ was ready​ to let the​ Magic happen –​ again.  The​ Lakers​ owner​ knew that Luke​ Walton’s​ fate​ was​ hanging in​​ the balance, how her front office that was led by Magic Johnson truly believed that much of what ailed them in this disastrous debut season with LeBron James fell at the young coach’s feet, and that was just fine by her. The final choice, as she had told Johnson and others in the days leading up to his stunning resignation on Tuesday, was theirs to make.  She wouldn’t intervene. She wouldn’t push back. If that’s what Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka wanted, then so be it. They had earned her trust by landing LeBron in the first place last summer, and maybe that chasm that existed between Walton and the men who controlled the roster was too big to bridge. She had total confidence in the people who held the most basketball power.  End-of-season meetings would be had. Important decisions would be made. That was the plan.  And then, before that hammer actually fell, Earvin headed for the exits.  What an embarrassment.  There’s no other way to describe Johnson’s choice here, this move that will cost the Lakers so dearly after these past two years of brand rebuilding. He didn’t have the heart to tell Jeanie before going to the media.  “Somebody is going to have to tell my boss, because I know she’s going to be sick,” Johnson admitted to reporters. “But I know I couldn’t face her face to face and tell her, even though I was just with her yesterday and we had a three-hour meeting about the direction of this great organization. So today, Rachel, I’m free my love.”  He was talking to ESPN’s Rachel Nichols, who later followed up with Johnson during a one-on-one near the Staples Center loading dock.  “So you told us first because you didn’t want her to talk you out of it?” Nichols asked Johnson.  “Exactly,” he replied.  He didn’t have the professionalism to tell LeBron, a source close to James confirmed, forcing one of the greatest players of all time to learn about Johnson’s decision through the media. Never mind, as the source also confirmed, that LeBron had met with Johnson, Pelinka, and his agent, Rich Paul, on Saturday to discuss the future of the franchise without even a hint that this was coming. Three days later, Johnson was engaging in a 40-minute public therapy session with reporters that only sparked more questions about what he had done.  So let’s get this straight. You wanted to congratulate Russell Westbrook on his recent 20-20-20 night, and to retain the freedom to say things like that to non-Lakers players without fear of tampering charges from the NBA, so badly that you decided to dive off the runway that was cleared for you in Feb. 2017 when Jeanie fired her brother, Jim Buss, and longtime GM Mitch Kupchak? That’s about as believable as the idea that Walton was the one who inspired all the curious roster moves last summer which led to this mess.  In the days leading up to Johnson’s departure, this was a real story that was floating around Laker Land. Despite Johnson having told the world otherwise at NBA Summer League in Las Vegas last July, where he sat for nearly 20 minutes on ESPN describing why and how players like Lance Stephenson, Michael Beasley and Rajon Rondo became Lakers, history was being re-written in some circles.  Walton, some people of Lakers prominence had suggested, had wanted to play LeBron off the ball and thus sparked all those moves that didn’t pan out. Sources with knowledge of Walton’s thinking pushed back vehemently on this suggestion – as if the public record wasn’t enough to quell the notion on its own. Walton, quite clearly, was being made out to be the fall guy.  The re-framing of it all was as big a red flag for Walton as he had endured all season long, which is saying something considering the context. After all, this is the same coach who was read the riot act by his bosses seven games in.  “Shut the fuck up,” Johnson had told Walton when he tried to interject during their infamous Oct. 30 meeting that also included Pelinka, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.  Five months later, Johnson tried to downplay the severity of his early message.  “I think everybody blew that up,” he told reporters. “They over-blew it. Sometimes as a president, you have to have a tough meeting with a coach. We had a tough meeting. And after that, it was fine. And it’s been fine. I haven’t had any problems with Luke. People think we’ve had problems, but we haven’t had any problems. Just because I want us to be better and I want him to be better? If I had come back, we all had to be better, right? I’ve made mistakes myself. But also too, everybody had to be better. And that’s what it’s all about. But that’s my job, to demand that.”  While Johnson didn’t claim to know what Jeanie might ultimately decide about Walton, it’s safe to say his exit improves the odds of him continuing as Lakers coach. He signed a five-year, $25 million deal in late April of 2016 that is guaranteed through next season.  “It’s the right thing to do, the right move to make,” Johnson said of his decision. “And then that way, (Walton) can stay in place, hopefully build the team, coach the team the right way, and also, all the – what I didn’t like was the backstabbing and the whispering. I don’t like that. You know, I don’t like a lot of things that went on that didn’t have to go on. And so I hope that after tomorrow, the Lakers can head in the right direction – which we are.”  And then, of course, there was the ESPN elephant in the room. For months, there had been rumblings that the Worldwide Leader was working on a story which would be extremely unflattering for Johnson and that focused on his mistreatment of employees. When asked by The Los Angeles Times if that entered his personal calculus, he denied that it played a part.  “An article would never make Magic Johnson do something he don’t want to do,” he said, according to our Lakers beat writer, Bill Oram, who was there during the interaction. “I know me. Ask people who deal with me – ask them. They’ve been around me for 40 years. … Same dude I was when I first got off the bus. Never disrespected nobody, never did anything bad. Now, am I tough? Hell yeah I am. You work for me, I’m demanding. That’s who I am.  “But at the same time, I’m fair. (Is) an article going to stop – make me do something? No. I’m good. They’ve been talking about that article for how many months? (Laughs) Everybody run up, ‘Oh they writing an article.’ OK. Great. I’m going (to) say ‘Why didn’t you interview everybody at ESPN? You know how many times ESPN hired me? Twice. If I was doing something wrong to employees, disrespecting, you think they would have hired me twice? No. I know that article is not an accurate article. I can tell you that now. …Now it’s some disgruntled, former Laker employees (talking to reporters). Yeah, they gonna say (what) they gonna say, ‘cause they wasn’t doing their jobs. So what is a person going to do? Point the finger bad about the person who fired them. I’m good. I’m a big boy.”  It wasn’t the first time the media had become part of the internal conversation.  As The Athletic reported on Tuesday morning, the report from ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith in early February that Magic had been overruled by Jeanie on the June 2017 decision to draft Lonzo Ball second overall out of UCLA instead of Kentucky’s De’Aaron Fox was enough to cause consternation between the owner and the team’s top executive. Magic had made it clear to Jeanie that he wasn’t the one spreading that message, but the mere fact that they were expending energy on these sorts of situations was not a good thing when it came to the interpersonal dynamics that are always so crucial.  As for the Lakers’ (still) uncertain future, here’s what we know for sure. First and foremost, a decision must be made on both Walton and Pelinka.  “That’s a decision that Jeanie has to make,” Johnson told reporters about Pelinka, who is the former agent of retired Lakers great Kobe Bryant who had no previous front office experience before his March 2017 hiring. “I worked well with him. I had no problems with him. …Jeanie has to make all the calls.”  If you’re Jeanie, it’s time to make lemonade out of lemons. Leverage the Lakers brand – battered though it might be – to recruit the best in the front office business heading into this crucial summer. There is still time to send the right sort of message to this latest free agency crop, with stars like Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and all the rest watching closely here like all the rest of us.  Elite players want to be in Los Angeles, and to wear the glorious purple and gold. What they don’t want, and what they have every reason to fear after seeing the latest Lakers saga, is to join a storied franchise that has lost its way again."
"Is this the beginning of the Lebron James-Aaron Rodgers comparisons?  ""coach killer"" ""un-coachable"" ""passive-aggressive"" ""ostracized"""
"Saw this the other day from The Athletic:  Howard Beck recently examined the relationship and rivalry between Dirk and Dwyane Wade. He included this quote from Pat Riley, which was fed through the aggregation machine for a few days:  *For about a three-year span Wade was, in Riley’s view, “the best player in the world.”*  *“Dwyane was better than Kobe at that time,” Riley says. “He had a better year by having the impact on winning—in the Finals, in the biggest moments, on the biggest stage. And you get that moniker.”*  That’s not necessarily crazy. If we consider 2004-05, 2005-06, and 2006-07 to be the three year-span in question, Wade actually does compare favorably to Kobe in some of the catch-all, cumulative statistics. In Player Efficiency Rating (PER) during this timeframe, Wade checks in third (26.2), just a couple of spots ahead of Kobe who sits fifth (25.9). In Win Shares per 48 Minutes, Wade is 10th (.210) while Kobe sits at 13th (.192). If we use pure Win Shares without factoring in minutes, Kobe is seventh (36.5), while Wade is 11th (34.1). When you compare this specific portion of these two careers using all-in-one statistics, it’s clear Wade actually was neck-and-neck with Kobe. Maybe Riley was on to something.  Here’s the caveat. *Would you like to guess who was first in every single one of these categories?* **Dirk. Dirk was.** Every one of them. If you prefer a stat like Value Over Replacement Player, which attempts to control for a player’s teammates, Dirk trailed only Lebron James and Kevin Garnett during this time. There is a real case to be made that Dirk was the best player in the league during this stretch, and you never hear anyone say this."
"I mean, he did get us Lebron James as a piece.   People hate Lebron, but with only so many star people to build around. I’d rather Have Lebron than not."

now what makes you so credible? Why do you think you know more than Lebron James? Or any coach/GM that's had lebron james?
Magic's job was always to be the face to sell free agents and he fucking delivered LeBron James. What exactly is Pelinka doing?
"""THBPBPTHPT!"" - The LeBron James Experiment"
"cavs was also trash. Odom alone was better than anyone other than LeBron, and we all know that LeBron is way better at making players around him better than Kobe.  i might put kobe slight above just because of the crazy run from 05-07 but it's all james after it.

"&gt; He didn’t have the professionalism to tell LeBron, a source close to James confirmed, forcing one of the greatest players of all time to learn about Johnson’s decision through the media.  Star players get star treatment only because people want to keep them happy and motivated. Magic Johnson no longer cared so he had no reason to keep sucking up.  LeBron may be one of the greatest employees of all time but he's still an employee. There is nothing unprofessional about not informing your underlings that you are leaving. It's very common."
"If I say ""I think LeBron James is better than Magic"" is that the same as ""I'm guaranteeing LeBron James is better than Magic""?   Because please fucking find me where I guaranteed they win and I didn't just say I THINK THEY WOULD WIN"
"Chemistry isn't built overnight, their record before the injuries doesn't mean shit in the grand scheme of things. They were looking like they could make the playoffs if the injury plague didn't occur but now we're stuck with the what-if. I don't think we should be writing LeBron James off because of this season due to the context. Injuries, the AD clown fiesta that ruined any chemistry they'd built, front office issues."
Lebron James
"Ahh, so injury is a valid excuse for Steph Curry but not LeBron James? Because that had been one of the go-to excuses for Warriors fans about the 2016 playoffs."
How did they fall short last off season when they got LeBron James in free agency?
...and LeBron James isn’t in the playoffs. That’s all that matters
&gt;Cause he destroyed a young core  This same young Lakers core won't suddenly change to the Harlem Globetrotters next year because their President of Basketball Operations is gone  &gt;failed to make the playoffs with LeBron James  It's not like he's on the court as their starting point guard. The team failed to make it to the playoffs. Not their front office executive.  &gt;quit  If he stayed in the position then you'd all call him incompetent. He decides to leave and now... he seems incompetent? Didn't he say he'd step down anyways eventually?
&gt;  failed to make the playoffs with LeBron James  So Magic is responsible for our injuries?? Or are we just going to play the lets forget about that.
"Cause he destroyed a young core, failed to make the playoffs with LeBron James and quit.   How are you not getting any of that"
"Jeanie​ Buss​ was ready​ to let the​ Magic happen –​ again.  The​ Lakers​ owner​ knew that Luke​ Walton’s​ fate​ was​ hanging in​​ the balance, how her front office that was led by Magic Johnson truly believed that much of what ailed them in this disastrous debut season with LeBron James fell at the young coach’s feet, and that was just fine by her. The final choice, as she had told Johnson and others in the days leading up to his stunning resignation on Tuesday, was theirs to make.  She wouldn’t intervene. She wouldn’t push back. If that’s what Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka wanted, then so be it. They had earned her trust by landing LeBron in the first place last summer, and maybe that chasm that existed between Walton and the men who controlled the roster was too big to bridge. She had total confidence in the people who held the most basketball power.  End-of-season meetings would be had. Important decisions would be made. That was the plan.  And then, before that hammer actually fell, Earvin headed for the exits.  What an embarrassment.  There’s no other way to describe Johnson’s choice here, this move that will cost the Lakers so dearly after these past two years of brand rebuilding. He didn’t have the heart to tell Jeanie before going to the media.  “Somebody is going to have to tell my boss, because I know she’s going to be sick,” Johnson admitted to reporters. “But I know I couldn’t face her face to face and tell her, even though I was just with her yesterday and we had a three-hour meeting about the direction of this great organization. So today, Rachel, I’m free my love.”  He was talking to ESPN’s Rachel Nichols, who later followed up with Johnson during a one-on-one near the Staples Center loading dock.  “So you told us first because you didn’t want her to talk you out of it?” Nichols asked Johnson.  “Exactly,” he replied.  He didn’t have the professionalism to tell LeBron, a source close to James confirmed, forcing one of the greatest players of all time to learn about Johnson’s decision through the media. Never mind, as the source also confirmed, that LeBron had met with Johnson, Pelinka, and his agent, Rich Paul, on Saturday to discuss the future of the franchise without even a hint that this was coming. Three days later, Johnson was engaging in a 40-minute public therapy session with reporters that only sparked more questions about what he had done.  So let’s get this straight. You wanted to congratulate Russell Westbrook on his recent 20-20-20 night, and to retain the freedom to say things like that to non-Lakers players without fear of tampering charges from the NBA, so badly that you decided to dive off the runway that was cleared for you in Feb. 2017 when Jeanie fired her brother, Jim Buss, and longtime GM Mitch Kupchak? That’s about as believable as the idea that Walton was the one who inspired all the curious roster moves last summer which led to this mess.  In the days leading up to Johnson’s departure, this was a real story that was floating around Laker Land.

"So your argument is based on a single play in regular time in 2006 game 7.  Right.    So based on your logic, terry rozier was lebron James primary matchup because he guarded him once during game 7 of last years WCF.    You have provided no stats to support your case, you are clearly biased, and refuse to be objective."
"But he isn't that LeBron anymore.  He will be 35, former champion LeBron James. Who still carried the diva baggage but can no longer carry a team."
I don’t think the Lakers problem is that people don’t wanna play with Lebron fucking James.
"Not really any bias going on. I’ll tell you where I think our guys are ass and where they aren’t.   The Lonzo shoe thing is a bigger deal than most people know. He said he was scared to play in them because there was no ankle support. He said he felt a lot safer in Kobe’s. So now we have a guy who’s afraid to make basketball moves because the shoes he’s in aren’t sturdy. On top of that, his dad put a bullseye on his back the minute he entered the league. Just look at how Beverley hounded him in his first game - what other rookie got that? But he got better when the next line of shoes came out. He was almost averaging a triple double as a rookie, and did the same thing as a second year player. I think that’s pretty damn impressive.   Bravo for sweeping us. You guys played great in those games. Mario blocking James was sad for me, but it was impressive. At the same time, the lakers beat the warriors, Jazz, rockets, clippers, spurs, trailblazers, and Celtics this season - does this mean we are better than those teams? We were in those games, but I’d say no overall. Just cuz we play the warriors hard every year when they come to LA, and often win at that, doesn’t make me think we’d beat them in the playoffs.   Individual matchups in the regular season rarely mean that much to me honestly. The bulls swept the Heat in the regular season I believe when the big three were there, and then summarily got beat 4-1 when LeBron and co. turned it on for the playoffs.   I think kuz is better Knox. I don’t think Hart is, though at times he’s shown to be because of his effort on both ends. At the same time, Knox is a high draft pick. Kuz and Hart are back of the first round kinda guys. They aren’t the type of guys who should be contributing this much this soon, but they’re definite gems.   But I’m not really gonna knock Knox. He’s really young and I think he’ll be a good player in time. At the same time, I think I’d take both Lonzo, BI, and Kuz ahead of him in a mock draft. I think Knox would go fourth. He still has a long way to go, so like I said, can’t really knock him.   Are we worse than last year? Technically no. We won 35 games last year and won 37 this year lol. But if I’m not being facetious - we also suffered some crazy injuries this year. I think people gloss over it way too much. I know every team gets injured but we had some intense injuries this year. Lonzo’s been out since January. BI missed time due to suspension, a blood clot, and another injury earlier in the season. Kuz missed some time with a leg injury. Hart has knee tendinitis that got worse because he tried to play on it. LeBron had a groin injury that kept him out 18 games. Javale McGeec, who already has asthma, missed time after getting pneumonia. He came back a different player, and wasn’t nearly as athletic. Rondo missed time due to suspension and a broken hand. KCP and Lance both had leg injuries that kept them out for some games. Tyson Chandler had injuries fiddling his body. Muscala got traded to us, and had to immediately miss a handful of games due to injury. Michael Beasley’s mom died, and it sent him into depression. He wasn’t with the team for most of the season while she was in the hospital. One of our d-league call ups, Jonathon Williams, had an injury that kept him out. Am I missing anyone, or is that basically the whole team? We’re rumored to be firing the training staff, so that’s good. But that is a lot of injuries for one team - basically the entire 10-man rotation. It shouldn’t surprise anyone that we struggled to play well this season. Hell, our starting lineup played a grand total of 23 games together I believe. That’s sad.   As for the AD trade, we’ve since heard that those rumors were false. Jackie MacMullan and Brian Windhorst reported that the lakers didn’t actually offer all those things. Jeanie buss went to Sloan and said it wasn’t true. I’m sure the lakers offered all the players in different packages, so that translated to “the lakers have offered all players.” While technically true, they mean two different things.   Yeah I saw magic step down. I saw the conference and was shocked. But again, I don’t believe everything right away. Windhorst again reported that Magic had told Jeanie that it was possible he’d be leaving soon. Ramona says different. I think it’s too soon to start saying we definitely know what happened.   In any case, I agree it’s not a good look. However, it’s also a blessing in disguise. Magic was an absent GM. David griffin was on NBA tv last night saying he knows a bunch of presidents and GMs around the league who are ready to quit and take the Laker job. Hell, I’m sure he’d love to take it the way he talked about it yesterday. I think it was a rude awakening for Jeanie, but I’m happy Magic moved himself out of the way without forcing Jeanie to fire him. He wasn’t as bad as people make him out to be, but he wasn’t great either. We move on.   Finally, the FA question. What happens if the Knicks don’t get KD, Kyrie, or the first pick? How long do you continue going without the playoffs? LeBron still put up 28, 7, and 7 this season. I think he’ll come back better next season because he feels the pressure of this year. I think a smart gm would first build us a bench before getting us any major FA. Our bench was awful this year. There are a lot of great role players in this FA class, and I think a smart gm will make sure to target them just as much as they do someone else.   In any case, we’re talking in a bunch of hypotheticals. We don’t really know what’s gonna happen. Y’all could end up with all three of KD, Kyrie and Zion. Boston could lose in the playoffs and Kyrie walks somewhere we don’t expect. The Celtics don’t trade for Davis, and a new GM comes in - what does he think of a trade with us? Where does our pick end up? I think magic would be ready to trade all of the young faster than most other gm’s. There are a lot of rumors that we’ll reach out to Jerry West, whose contract with the Clips ends this year, and I’m not sure he’d push for us to trade the young guys. I think we’ll see. At the end of the day, I think our young core isn’t the most talented young core out there, but it’s definitely better than quite a few (including the Knicks). I think having LeBron is a plus. I think having him locked up for multiple years is an even bigger plus. Y’all are trying to feign worry for the lakers, but I’m really not that worried lol. We’ll be fine. We’re in a much better position today than yesterday, and I think letting go of Pelinka and the training staff may be the next move. All good things."
He was a bad hire from the start and it ended as poorly as one would expect. All of the roster moves made outside of Lebron James show that Magic or his chosen GM had no clue what they were doing.  He did the Lakers a favour by leaving prior to the draft and FA
"for the rest of your life, whenever you're reading lists of top 10 players of all time, LeBron James will always be up at the top....and there's nothing you can do about it lmaoooo  sorry man but it's time to face reality.  4 MVPs, 3 rings...beat a 73 win team in the finals in legendary fashion  will be the all time leader in points scored AND top 10 all time in assists.  it's over man. your nightmare is reality"
"Have people not realized not to take Woj seriously on Laker stuff? Magic stepped down 12 hours ago, what as the chances Jeanie started the search? What are the chances Jeanie already has sources leaked about who she’s targeting?   Or is it more likely that Woj is doing someone a favor by getting him a raise or just straight up setting the Lakers up for failure?

What do you mean his movie career isn’t looking too hot? Did you forget LeBron James is Gwangi?
"That playoff run as a whole was absolutely crazy. The number of superstars he had to defeat on his way.  LaMarcus Aldridge, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Chris Bosh, Dwayne Wade and LeBron James. That’s a crazy list of hall of famers and two of the teams he played had THREE each."
"The Clippers were in the first seed at the time, is Tobias Harris &gt; LeBron James? /s"
"I have a feeling he will express regret years down the road when it’s auto-biography time. It didn’t pay off at all. He tried to force his way out during the season, and he had to stay with the Pels for the every single day of the rest of the season, essentially not getting to play NBA basketball for the last couple of months: No accolades, a throw-away season in the early window of his prime.  In another timeline, waiting until the off-season to try and force his way out would’ve likely netted the same end result, but without all the wasted time and burned bridges with the franchise, the city, and its fans. In my opinion, the decision to end his relationship with New Orleans this way was all about LeBron James’ timeline and not his own. It’s not a stretch to perceive it this way, either, especially with all the criticisms of James’ first year with the Lakers being a monumental failure...something one Anthony Davis would have likely helped change.  The only upside I can think of is avoiding injury by not playing. This needs to be added to a list of “bad advice” by Klutch Sports, along with Nerlens Noel changing representation and declining a $70M contract from the Mavs"
"No it isnt. How is this upvoted?  Youre comparing Michael having control of his own body or Lebron looking at the bodies of other players before making a pass to James Harden knowing where the *eyes* of officials are. Especially an official he couldnt see, when he started the move. I know the hate boner for Harden is strong but we're literally going out of our way to say hes capable of things that he isnt.   Its amazing to me that this sub believes that Harden is the smartest player of all time, literally saying hes capable of calculating the anglr of the refs vision in a minute fraction of a second while not even seeing the ref."
"**By TANIA GANGULI APR 09, 2019 | 11:10 PM**  Magic Johnson lingered behind a crowd of reporters surrounding Luke Walton during the Lakers coach's pregame news conference Tuesday at Staples Center.  When Walton finished speaking, reporters began to shuffle around. Johnson didn't move at first. Then he pushed through the throng of reporters as a member of the Lakers public relations   *Magic Johnson announces he’s stepping down as Lakers' president of basketball operations. Magic Johnson lingered behind a crowd of reporters surrounding Luke Walton during the Lakers coach's pregame news conference Tuesday at Staples Center.*  When Walton finished speaking, reporters began to shuffle around. Johnson didn't move at first. Then he pushed through the throng of reporters as a member of the Lakers public relations staff tried to stop him. Johnson acknowledged her, but disregarded her concern. He had something to get off his mind.  ""Today I'm going to step down as the president,"" Johnson said.  He said it without any warning, and almost as little planning.  Just like that it was over. Johnson no longer runs the Lakers' basketball operations, a job he took on Feb. 21, 2017, when Jeanie Buss fired her brother Jim and the Lakers' long-time general manager Mitch Kupchak.  ""It's a difficult decision,"" Johnson said, as he began to cry. ""I cried before I came here; I'm about to cry now. But, it's hard when you love an organization as much as I love this organization. It's hard when you love a person like I love Jeanie. And I don't want to disappoint her. I don't want — we love Luke. So I've got to make a decision. ""And that's a tough thing.""  Johnson attributed his decision to several factors. He said he didn't want to have to ask Jeanie Buss to fire Walton, someone for whom Buss has a great deal of affection. He said he was tired of the ""backstabbing and the whispering"" but never explained exactly what he meant. He said he was tired of not being able to talk to players on other teams and mentor them without the specter of tampering.  Johnson was asked if he would like to see Walton remain the team's head coach. He was also asked if he believes Rob Pelinka is the right general manager for the franchise. He said both were decisions for Buss. A person familiar with Buss' thinking said Johnson's decision did not guarantee Walton's job was safe.  ""There is no greater Los Angeles Laker than Earvin Johnson,"" the team said in a statement released about 2 ½ hours after Johnson's impromptu news conference. ""We are deeply grateful to Magic for all that he has done for our franchise — as a player, an ambassador and an executive.""  Nobody saw the end coming. Not LeBron James nor any of the players. Not coaches. Not other executives in the building. And certainly not Jeanie Buss.  ""I couldn't stand to tell her,"" Johnson said.  He later admitted, tears filling his eyes, that he knew if he had talked to her she would have convinced him to stay.  ""We would've cried; we would have been in there crying for an hour,"" Johnson said. ""Because of that, I would have probably stayed in the role. But you gotta be happy. I gotta be happy. The Lakers are going to be fine.""  It's the same reason he said he didn't call Pat Riley, his former coach, to discuss his decision.  Buss posted a message on Twitter that ended with two hearts in purple and gold.  Earvin, I loved working side by side with you,"" she wrote. ""You've brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you.""  As word spread through the Lakers' organization and the NBA, several people wondered whether Johnson's departure was related to a yet-to-be-published article by ESPN that is said to address allegations about Johnson's conduct with employees.  ""That story is wrong,"" Johnson told the Los Angeles Times.  He later added to a group of reporters: ""Never disrespected anybody. Never did anything bad. Am I tough? Hell, yeah! You work for me, I'm demanding. But at the same time I'm fair. They've been talking about that article for how many months? Everybody running, 'Oh they're writing an article.' I'm gonna say, why didn't they interview anybody at ESPN? If I was doing something wrong to employees disrespecting, this or that, think they would've hired me twice?""  Buss did not attend Tuesday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers, the season finale for a Lakers' team that finished 37-45 and missed the playoffs. She normally sits behind a row of courtside seats. As Johnson left Staples Center, through a gust of wind burst through the loading dock, he said he planned to find her for a chat. If not Tuesday night, then on Wednesday.  Their relationship spans decades. They met before Johnson's rookie year when he showed up at the house of her father, longtime owner Jerry Buss, and announced that he would be leaving Los Angeles as soon as he could to play for the Detroit Pistons in his home state.  He didn't, of course, and became one of the most beloved Lakers of all time. Johnson won five championships, three most valuable player awards and three NBA Finals MVP awards during his time with the Lakers.  ""My concern was really my relationship with my sister, and that's Jeanie Buss,"" Johnson said. ""That's all I care about. All the rest of the stuff doesn't really matter.""  She hired him as an advisor at a time she was struggling to trust those around her. Her relationship with her brother Jim, then the team's executive vice president of basketball operations, had been strained for years. She thought Kupchak and Johnson, former teammates, would communicate well. When that didn't happen, she fired her brother and Kupchak. Not long afterward, she sued her two older brothers for attempting to oust her as the team's controlling owner.  Through that instability, Johnson offered comfort. Together, they hired Pelinka, Kobe Bryant's former agent, and both men were tasked with returning a stumbling franchise to glory.  They cleared salary cap space by ridding the team of Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov, players who'd received bloated multiple-year contracts from the Lakers in 2016. D'Angelo Russell was packaged with Mozgov in 2017. Deng was released after last season. Russell became an All-Star this year and his Brooklyn Nets are headed to the playoffs.  The Lakers drafted Lonzo Ball in 2017, and Johnson introduced him as the face of the franchise.  Along the way, the Lakers got fined for tampering twice — once when Johnson praised Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo and said he would bring a championship to Milwaukee.  There were missteps for sure, but Johnson had one major victory. The crowning moment of Johnson's time as a Lakers executive came on June 30, 2018, when he sat outside James' Brentwood home waiting for 9 p.m., when free agency opened and they could talk.  Johnson and James spent three hours discussing plans for the future on and off the court. The next day, James agreed to become a Laker.  ""You know what I love?"" Johnson said. ""The recruitment of LeBron. Because you get me in the room with somebody, it's over. I know how to close deals.""  Pelinka, Buss and Johnson got on a three-way phone call to celebrate the news. They screamed, they cried, they laughed. The Lakers were back, many people thought.  Instead, the Lakers are missing the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season. Walton's job is in question. Pelinka's might be, too. And their lead executive decided he had enough.  ""I'm good with where I am,"" Johnson said Tuesday as his time with the Lakers came to an end. ""I'm happy. I want to do the things I used to do. So I had to weigh both situations. So, this is better for me.""  Times staff writer Broderick Turner contributed to this report."
"And we beat the warriors, nuggets, Celtics, Thunder, trailblazers, Jazz, Spurs, clippers, and rockets. Does that make us better than those teams? In those games yes, but no on the aggregate. Is that really that difficult of a concept to grasp?   And again, where did I refuse to admit it? You keep adding words I never said. I simply said we’re in a better position because we have LeBron James on top of a young core. You pray to get someone like LeBron on your team, any team would. We have him already. We have him locked up for a couple more years. We have a couple options going forward. We have cap flexibility. Every other FA signing this past summer was a one-year deal - they’ll be following Magic out the door. Our situation really isn’t that dire."
This all ends with LeBron teaming up with his friend James Jones in Phoenix right?
"Mate, your whole future is riding on people you don’t have yet. Y’all are hoping KD comes. Y’all are hoping Kyrie comes. Y’all act as if Zion is already yours. Your entire future is based on hope. Speaking of picks, what exactly are you gonna do with them? Draft busts? Ntilikina is the second worst player in the lottery of that year’s draft behind an injured Fultz. Trade them away? The most exciting knick since Carmelo got his ass shipped out because he didn’t want to stay with y’all anymore. Can’t blame him.   As for us. If we keep our young guys, great. They have a lot of talent. If we trade them for Anthony Davis, great. That’ll be two top-ten guys on our team. I’m fine either way.   And did I say anything about us being better than other teams? I know we sucked this year. I also know we had a lot of injuries. You think missing LeBron James for 18 games in the middle of the season isn’t going to have some impact on the team? Foh man"
Fun fact: you can't spell Paul George without leg gore.  And Lebron James rearranges into Male Boners except with an extra J. J'Male Boners
"He would never do such a thing, he is not an idiot. LeBron is still great and Jerry West knows that pairing him with Lance, JaVale, Rondo and Beasly isn't exactly ideal. West said recently that James is most effective when he has the ball in his hands so you surround him with shooters. That's what he would do lol. Under no circumstances would he trade of player of his caliber who is still by all means great."
"Luke: Mr. President, you asked to see me?   Magic: I know you’re busy.   Luke: what do you need sir?   Magic: I want to give you a word of warning.   Luke: sir, I don’t know if you’ve watched our games, but whatever it is, Lance did it.   Magic: LeBron James announced he’s shutting down this morning.   Luke: ha! He’s shutdown! You can finally run this team!   Magic: he’s stepping down so he can be team president.  Luke: good luck defeating you sir.   Magic: I’m stepping down, I’m not returning as team president.   Luke: I’m sorry, what?"

Ty Lue on coaching Lebron James: it will be great. The only thing that was hard was Luke is hurt.
"It seemed like yesterday he was bragging about landing LeBron James and promised another superstar.  Cool job magic, you signed LeBron the guy who was coming to LA for his kids and space jam 2.  You won by default because Jerry West wanted nothing to do with a 34 year old “star” who runs offense how ever he wants and doesn’t listen to a coach.   Just like space jam 2 nobody wants to play with LeBron.   The beautiful rumors now of Tyron lue is a good fit for the Lakers. Oh you mean the same guy who LeBron wouldn’t listen to and had no idea what run to play, yeah that’s exactly who the lakers need.  With LeBron it doesn’t matter who you bring in, LeBron is going to do whatever he wants.   How about this:  Trade LeBron back to Cleveland for señor khloe and top pick.  Then you go get tony Bennett as the next coach, a coach who believes in movement and defense.  With all these young guys it’s perfect."
"&gt; But there was initially some pause from Buss, who was sensitive to the likelihood that the pursuit of Lue and Jackson would be perceived as James and his agent Rich Paul running the show and spearheading the coaching search, sources said.  It wouldn't be ""perceived."" It'd be downright treated as such. And it should be. How can you look at those 3 candidates and not see it as being an obvious ploy to satisfy LeBron?"
"Going into the season, which trio did you think would all have triple doubles.  Lebron James, Rajon Rondo, Lonzo Ball.  Even Turner, CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic.  It's a tie!  3 guys we all knew could get TDs and 3 guys no one guessed would get one..."
"im sorry, but lebron james retiring it wont matter who he plays for, itll be a celebration of his entire career..  generational talent"
"That’s honestly better, the new GM gets a fresh slate with room to sign a max player, no bad contracts besides a few mil of Dengs dead money, a solid young cheap core and Lebron James. This was the best thing that could’ve happened for the Lakers."
[Wojnarowski] The Los Angeles Lakers have signed All-Stars John Wall and Bradley Beal in a blockbuster trade sending LeBron James (including young assets for salary) to Washington. Wow.
"Absolute, he's fucking LeBron James."
LeBron James is a GOAT contender who's been on a handful of really bad teams. Had to carry teams kicking and screaming into the playoffs/finals multiple times.
"Dude survives how many years with HIV, but can't survive more than 9 months with LeBron James."
"Jerry West, Lebron james etc"
"Keep convincing yourself.  You have contracted generational talent  during the period of its decline, which runs out of sync with its ego causing all sorts of issues. Your young talent doesn't trust the organisation, neither will free agents, who know they will be trading chips if things don't go well.   The post Kobe era has been a disaster because the franchise has zero patience. Feeling it's forever entitled to be contending. Yet becomes the franchise that couldn't even get LeBron James to the playoffs.  Ye, that's currently the lakers. The franchise that got spoiled with more picks then good luck would discern, yet couldn't make the playoffs with reigning  modern goat."
-	DWade scores big in final game -	AD wears Looney Tunes shirt saying he wants out of NOLA -	Magic resigns as Lakers president   LeBron James probably just fainted out of excitement
"Lonzo Ball yelled, “There he goes!” Luke Walton gave a look of pleasant surprise. Brandon Ingram belted, “We need an [expletive] squad... now!” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-Lakers president Magic Johnson hugged him &amp; said, “This is your problem now.”"
"I know LeBron James. He's the best. The best. I was telling- my uncle- I was telling my uncle- my, my uncle, he went to Cleveland, you know, where LeBron went. My uncle went to Cleveland. He was on the Cleveland team, and I told him, I did, I told him, ""This kid. This LeBron James kid,"", now I said this before anyone else did, ""This LeBron James kid is good. He's real good. I'm glad he's going to Cleveland."" And I did, I did say it, believe me, and my uncle, my uncle agreed."
"D’Lo wasn’t the player he is now. He partied everyday and was super unfocused. There wasn’t much progress in his game. I think leaving the lakers was the best thing that happened to his career. I think he’d say the same thing - in fact I know he has. He’s said getting out of LA allowed him to focus more on basketball.   Randle didn’t want to come back. He tweeted about wanting to move on from the lakers a few hours before LeBron signed. Do we lock up that cap space just to keep a guy who doesn’t want to be with the team?   Zubac was a bad trade, but let’s stop pretending like Zubac is some goddamn all star. He’s a good, serviceable big man. He’s a solid player, but people are acting as if we sent off an NBA legend or something. It was a bad trade, but it’s not “franchise breaking”.   The young guys who were still able to play because they weren’t too severely injured, namely Kuzma and Ingram, played better after all that reporting came out. The guys who sucked for us were actually guys like KCP, Rondo, and Stephenson. Ingram was perhaps our best player for a bit even though we had LeBron fucking James on our team. People keep saying magic alienated these guys, but they all stepped up. Stop with that nonsense.   What about our good trades? Trading Lou Williams for a first round pick was a good trade. Trading away Jordan Clarkson and Nance for a first round pick in a draft where we had none and an expiring contract was a good trade. Clarkson’s $12.5 mil per year came off our books.   Those are good moves. Our young core isn’t blown up lol. The most important pieces are still here. We have LeBron locked up for a couple seasons - a sort of comfort he never granted the Cavs once he became a FA. The worst players on our team were the other free agents we signed last season not named LeBron James, and all of them are on one year deals. They’ll be gone in a couple days. You’re really exaggerating how dire our situation is lol"
Would Mr. West Blake Griffin LeBron James?!?
There's something deeply unsettling about James Lebron.
"""shouldn't the last name and first name be switched around?""  LeBron James would like a word"
Me on the bottom of LeBron James as he posterizes
"My only gripe is why is LeBron James not picked for the ""Shouldn't The Last Name and the First Name Be Switched Around?"" Team?"
"Dude the Rockets were sitting at 11-14 with injuries all around the roster. Remove James from the starting lineup with that record and tell me where we finish. I was literally worried we'd barely get into the playoffs with the way the west was looking and our shit start to the season  He was definitely the ""most valuable"" to his team given his situation with all the injuries and changes to the roster(picked up Rivers and Faried in the middle of the season)   Also nothing against Giannis but if the Bucks don't win 60 games that award was going to Harden. Embiid put up almost the same stats as the Freak and AD (albeit on a shitty squad) was putting up monster numbers too before that whole trade fiasco.  Bron, Curry, Durant or even Giannis put up a statline of 36 freaking ppg with 7 ast/reb and 2 steals to top it off, we'd never hear the end of it. They would 100% be the MVP and the storylines would be ""Omg Lebron/steph/kd absolutely carried that team and put up Jordan-esque numbers while doing so"""
"Saying ""Lebron James is the best basketball player in the World"" is having an opinion - saying "" Lebron James is a soccer player and all footage of him in the nba is fake"" is factually wrong.  People are upset at Curry because we are living in a time whereby the parents of murdered children are being harassed because scumbags believe ""they know the truth"". There are outbreaks of diseases happening in America because parents believe they are better informed than qualified doctors on the topic of immunisation - I could go on...  The point I'm making is that Curry adding to the noise of "" I know better than actual, qualified experts because i saw a Youtube video/read a Facebook post"" is why people are upset with him."

"I side with CP3 player from the last 4-5 years mention LeBron as thier Idol and if there is one thing they should know about him, it's that he keeps himself in shape and plays for longevity like no other.   Maybe it was a bit ahead of the curve but you can definitely expect big body players like James, Giannis, Kawhi, KD and more to be worth their end of the max compared to before if they manage to not have career injuries."

While LeBron has him beat in terms of combining raw strength/frame with incredible speed, quickness, reflexes etc, I do believe Jordan has him beat both in vertical leap (48” to LeBron’s reported 40”, bases on quick google searches) and in raw straight-line speed."
"If you are to win against LeBron James in a basketball game, you can't be fresh, you have to play dirty."
Because you can only go so far for so long with no J?   Ben Simmons has attempted 17 3 pointers in 160 games.  Lebron James attempted 525 3 pointers in his first 2 seasons (159 games).

"http://www.webcitation.org/5u6WgX5XH  &gt;	 No one could stand James as a 19-year-old in the 2004 Athens Olympics, nor the 2006 World Championships. Officials feared James could become the instigator of everything they wanted to rid themselves for the ’08 Olympics. For as gifted as James was, Krzyzewski and Colangelo subscribed to a belief that with Kobe Bryant(notes) joining the national team in 2007, they could win a gold medal in ’08 with or without LeBron James. Behind the scenes, officials had taken to calling James’ inner circle, “The Enablers.” No one ever told him to grow up. No one ever challenged him. And yet, James was still a powerful pull for his teammates, and everyone had to agree they could no longer let his bossy and belittling act go unchecked. These weren’t the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Team USA wasn’t beholden to him.  After the NBA witnessed the behavior of James and his business manager Maverick Carter during the 2007 All-Star Weekend, the commissioner’s office sent word to USA Basketball the league wouldn’t force James on them for the Olympics. Before Team USA gathered for the 2007 Tournament of the Americas in Las Vegas, an unmistakable message had been delivered to James through Nike: Unless you change, we’re serious about leaving you home.  “Legacies were on the line,” one league official said, “and they weren’t going to let LeBron [expletive] it up for everyone in China.”  Through Nike, James ultimately heeded the message and became more tolerable to coaches, teammates and staff. Team USA assigned Jason Kidd(notes) to babysit him at the Tournament of the Americas in 2007, to try to teach him something the Cavaliers never had a veteran to do: professionalism."
"Jordan never delt with teammates being injured like lebron thou, James would have more championships if his teams would have always been healthy."
"The Hummer thing is a bit different though.  There was nothing wrong about it IMO. His mom put up collateral for the car in the form of, ""My son is Lebron James...you will get your 50k."" (Or however much a Hummer cost at the time."
"this is off topic and I'm obviously biased, but why isn't this narrative the same for Ben Simmons? Obviously he's not as good as LeBron but people act like it's impressive James put up those numbers with no shot (which I agree with) but shit on Ben's number with a worse shot?"

Neither did the Lebron James led Miami heat
But the Clipper made the playoffs with a record of 48 and 34. The lakers were 1 game over .500 with Lebron playing.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-injury-update-were-not-on-nobody-elses-timeline-says-agent-rich-paul/  Above is a quote from Rich Paul where he says the main concern is Lebrons health and he isn't coming back until he is ready to come back. He also states that best case scenario is 3 weeks and worse case is 6 weeks. Lebron missed 6 weeks and then came back. Going by what Rich Paul said Lebron took the full time off and was going to be READY when he came back. The injury isn't an excuse for going just 1 game over .500
LeBron took a year off last year so perhaps LeBron James?

"Gonna come back to this thread when it's a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes and gets nominated for best screenplay. You are massively underestimating Ryan Coogler, Malcolm Lee, and LeBron James."
"I think people on here are underestimating the chances Space Jam is monster critical + commercial hit.   Look at Ryan Coogler's filmography. Everything he touches is gold. He's won Sundance. He rebooted Rocky (Creed) and created the highest RT score in the franchise. And obviously Black Panther - the highest RT score for a Marvel movie ever, broke box office records, and got nominated for the Best Picture Oscar. All at age 33. He's the LeBron James of Hollywood. A prodigy put on this planet to make amazing movies.   And Malcolm Lee is a hitmaker too. Just look at Girls Trip. 90% on Rotten Tomatoes and the #1 comedy of the year at the box office. A+ CinemaScore.   LeBron James isn't too shabby either in the entertainment industry either.   Don't bet against this movie!"
"Really puts this whole Zion thing in perspective. As in, Zion is nowhere near the prospect LeBron was. James was already sinking fadeaway corner 3's at 17 and was far more athletic than Williamson is. The only facet where Zion is close to LeBron as a rookie is sheer power. LeBron was lightyears ahead of Zion in passing, handles, and shooting though. I'm keeping my expectations muted for Williamson this year -- looking at something along the lines of 14Pts/8Reb/3Ast/1.5Blk/1Stl."

"[The interactive version of this graph can be found here.](https://aka09.github.io/clutch_3pt.html) As you hover over points, you can get precise information about a specific player: name, clutch 3PA/game, and clutch 3P%.  **A few notes:** *** * ""Clutch"" is defined as the last 5 minutes of a game and a point differential of 5 points or less. * Only players who have attempted 80 3-pointers in such a situation are included. Relaxing this condition to 50 or 60 three pointers yields similar results. * Russell Westbrook is a historically poor 3-point shooter in the clutch. His combination of low shooting efficiency and high volume in the clutch is unique. He is 7% behind the second-worst clutch three point shooter with at least 0.9 attempt/game (Damian Lillard, surprisingly enough).  * In the clutch, 30.8% of Westbrook's field goal attempts are 3s, compared to 24.3% overall. He is one of the few star players whose free throw rate (i.e. the # of FTAs per field goal attempt) stays relatively stable in the clutch (.38 overall, .39 in the clutch). By comparison, the players who took the most shot attempts in the clutch between 2014-2019 generally saw their FTr increase dramatically in the last 5 minutes of a close game (shoutout to James Harden with a .82 FTr in such situations). In fact, among the 15 players with the most clutch shot attempts between 2014-2019, Westbrook is **dead last** in free throw rate. Surely, part of the explanation might be intentional fouls, but still.  * Steph Curry's exceptional shooting prowess is obvious here and very impressive.  * Even the best shooters tend to struggle in the clutch as defenses become laser-focused. Curry, for instance, is shooting threes at a 38% clip, which is far below what he usually averages. The same can be said for Lillard, Harden, Irving... * The ""LeFuckYou 3"" does seem to exist! LeBron is shooting clutch 3s at a 34% clip, which is similar to his overall 3P% and exceeds the performance of many top shooters.   This graph was made in R using the package nbastatR and ggplot2."
This just in... LeBron James is a great passer.
"[Here's his scouting report.](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/lebron-james)  They don't even mention his scoring but they fawn over his passing and body. Everyone knew he would be a good scorer, and had the potential to be a very good scorer, but nobody would have bet on him win scoring titles or becoming one of the absolute greatest scorers of all time."
"My god, Memphis was 1 pick away from drafting Yao Ming, then the very next year, was 1 pick away from drafting Lebron James."
Imagine playing high school basketball with LeBron James and now you work at a Walmart stocking eggs
"[Here's his scouting report](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/lebron-james), which absolutely lavishes praise on his passing and body. Everyone thought he would be a good scorer and knew he had the potential to be well above average or better, but I don't think anybody would have bet on him being one of the top scorers of all time."
"[this is one draft profile on him. they don't mention his scoring at all, people were just enamored with his magic-esque playmaking](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/lebron-james)"
"Alright, since it seems you like to think this stat is bullshit.   Avery Bradley was ranked 423th, Rajon Rondo was ranked 436th and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope was ranked 484th. You can check it out [here.](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/page/1/sort/DRPM)   Keep in mind LeBron was ranked 51st in the whole league. Just a cherry picked stat, right? Must be a coincidence.  [Here's another comparison between the 3 of them.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1_select=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1=jamesle01&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id2_hint=Rajon+Rondo&amp;player_id2_select=Rajon+Rondo&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=rondora01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Kentavious+Caldwell-Pope&amp;player_id3_select=Kentavious+Caldwell-Pope&amp;y3=2019&amp;player_id3=caldwke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Avery+Bradley&amp;player_id4_select=Avery+Bradley&amp;y4=2019&amp;player_id4=bradlav01&amp;idx=players) LeBron had the highest Defense Win Share out of all of them with 2.6, and the highest DBPM with 1.9.  Not exactly sure what you were expecting when you asked for this? Were you expecting for Rondo, KCP and Bradley to be way higher up or something, to try and then prove that the stat is meaningless?

"Never forget the [2013 article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/raptors-computer-program-lebron-james-2013-3) about taking the Raptors’ program that showed the ideal defender positions and found LeBron was always a step ahead of the program in terms of reading defense  Work smarter, not harder  That being said, there’s no excuse when he’s the only guy between the ball handler and the basket and he doesn’t step up."
LeBron did win rings with all those guys.  Also Mike Miller and James Posey.
"&gt; **Western Conference scouting director:** ""He would have been the No. 1 pick in last year's draft. That should give you an indication of what kind of talent he is. Of all the other high school kids who've come into the league in recent years, the thing that separates LeBron is that he's physically ready to play. He's strong. He's a manly 6-8, 225 (pounds).   &gt; ""Having said that, he's able to get by on his physical ability right now. The question is, what happens when he can't just get by on physical ability alone? The mental side, the emotional side, those are unknowns. In high school, the only thing we're seeing is the physical ability. There were a lot of times in high school where Kobe didn't have to play his hardest and we see the same thing with LeBron. What happens when he has to turn it on?  &gt; ""When Kobe had to turn it on, he did. You saw his desire to work hard and get better. He was willing to sacrifice. Those are unknowns with LeBron at his age. But skill-wise? He has the ability to be anything he wants. He has the passing skills to be a great point guard. He can be a two guard who gets his shot off the dribble. He has legit (small forward) size. His shot is the one element of his game that has been red-flagged, but he has been working on that. There's really nothing you can nit-pick.""  &gt; **Eastern Conference general manager:** ""He's got a great body. He knows how to score. He knows how to score on his own. He's athletic. And he can really pass the ball, which makes him different from a lot of high school kids. So there's no doubt he's worth all the attention. Your job is to pick out guys you think are going to be great, and there's a guy who's (labeled) 'great' every year, but LeBron is a little unusual. There's nobody on either side of basketball, college or pro, who doesn't think he's great. I don't have a problem saying he's as good as Kobe or McGrady, as long as you add 'at this age.' Once you start saying that he will be as good as those guys, you're cutting out a lot of work and dedication.""   &gt; **Western Conference scouting director:** ""Basketball-wise he's the best high school player I've ever seen, and I saw a lot of McGrady. He has a very rare combination of skills but also charisma off the court. He's so mature beyond his age. He handles all this attention amazingly well. Of course he's also just a super athlete, handles the ball like a point guard, makes decisions in the open floor. And he's playing on a team with basically nobody -- there's really only one other guy on his team who has a shot at a Division I scholarship.  &gt; ""I saw his game last year with Oak Hill and he went toe-to-toe with Carmelo Anthony, who most people will tell you is another great player. The scoring was pretty much a wash (Anthony scored 34 points, James 36) but Carmelo had help. LeBron was all over the map. He made everybody on his team better.  &gt; ""If you want to pinpoint a weakness in his game, it's shooting. But he's not terrible. That's an area to work on, but this kid plays hard and works hard. McGrady was known to be a bit of a showboat in high school. It wasn't a bad thing, but he cruised through some games. And physically McGrady was a string bean. LeBron is like an adult physically. He has the tools, and he just plays the right way.""   &gt; **Eastern Conference scout:** ""I'm not saying he won't be better than Kobe and McGrady, but I can't say he's better than those players were at the same age. Those guys just knocked me out. It's something you can't define, it's just a gut feel you have, but I'm probably being a tougher grader because of all the hype. It's pretty clear that he's in the same class with them. And it's pretty clear that high school or overseas are the two places to go to get a star player today.  &gt; ""I'm not in favor of it. I'd rather these guys would say in school. But the best guys don't go through the college system anymore. You have to get them out of high school or get them from another country. The problem with taking on a high school player is that, for the coach, you're dealing with a lot of things you don't normally deal with. And it takes up a lot of time. These kids don't even know how to keep a checkbook when they get to the NBA.  &gt; ""The key is to remember that, even if you get LeBron James, it took Kobe three or four years. These kids don't instantly transform your franchise.""  &gt; **Western Conference general manager:** ""The hype is pretty justified. Looking at the way Yao Ming's playing, I don't know if LeBron would have gone first in the draft last year, but he's a 6-8 guy who can play point guard. He's a man among boys, a superstar in the making. I hear people say shooting is his weak spot. It's his 'weaker' spot. He's probably an average shooter, but if you look at Michael Jordan when he came into the league, he was a very average shooter. Kobe was probably an average shooter, too, as a rookie. LeBron's got enough technique that I wouldn't worry about it.""   &gt; **Eastern Conference general manager:** ""I'm very careful about dishing out too much praise for these young kids coming out of school, because I know it's going to be an adjustment no matter how good they are. But this kid looks like he could come in and play right away without missing a beat. LeBron is a phenomenal talent, probably the best I've ever seen coming out of high school. It's going to be interesting to eventually see him play with and against other great players (in the NBA), because obviously he's not getting challenged right now."""
This guy's last post was about James Harden being disrespected then posts an extremely lop sided playoffs loss for LeBron to the same team lol
I chose Lakers on the heroku app and searched for Lebron James just like two days ago.
How’d u get a LeBron James Lakers flair? It wouldn’t let me use his name?
Lebron came back from injury overweight and lacking conditioning and he came back looking sluggish. Also he wasnt gonna sacrifice his body for a team who cant play D or make free throws or make the play offs.  James harden is a good defender so this isnt even a good stat that means anything.
"Before people start speculating...[it was a MJ fan](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/07/lebron-james-jr-son-bronny-aau-game-canceled-heckling-fan-video-basketball):  &gt;The game between Bronny James’ North Coast Blue Chips and the Nike Meanstreets was canceled after a man wearing a Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls jersey began ridiculing the elder James and was denied entrance, according to a event official who declined to give his name.   &gt;   &gt;The man, who was about 150 feet away from James, also screamed at event security and was eventually restrained, which triggered the cancellation and a brief altercation with security personnel."

The rest of the team (particularly Demar and Dwane Casey) couldn’t elevate themseleves in the playoffs, and specifically against lebron James.

"""Seeing what Lebron James does ***off the court***, building a school....trying to be more than a basketball play""  ""Lebron pushed me to think about how I want to be remembered as a person after my career, especially back home""  &gt;Decides to play more basketball  I really don't get it. Like I said, good for him. But I don't see how Lebron's off the court actions inspired him to......continue playing basketball."
"&gt; James was rarely guarding the opponent’s best player  Sure, he wasn’t picking up James Harden or PG or Kawhi often but let’s not forget that the NBA nowadays will force a switch and attack a mismatch. No coach is trying to go at LeBron because, when locked in, he’s an above average defender"
"Kinda messed up that they don't pick guards at all now that I'm thiinking about it. Shoutouts to Tony Allen, Shane Battier, Pre-injury CP3, Thabo Sefolosha, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Iguodala, Muggsy Bogues, plus any other players with excellent defense who were never eligible for the NBA's best defensive big man award. Somehow Dwight Howard won three without Lebron James or Michael Jordan winning any"
I think it’s fair to say that LeBron James is the best basketball player of all time. There were also better boxers than Muhammad Ali. But he was still the greatest.
Magic Johnson Lebron James Larry Bird Oscar Robertson Thaddeus Young  Few will understand
"A guy who broke the record his rookie year playing against players who were 2 inches shorter than today whom also weighed nearly 20 pounds less on average. And the fact that these players were shooting the ball at historically low FG% is a testiment to the low skill level of all his peers. It doesn't take much flim to see that these guys werent skilled at the game of basketball in comparison to today's league. Wilt played against the least skilled era on basketball whole simultaneously being possibly the most athletic player ever no shit he'll be ridiculous and put up gawdy stat line. And league avgs being so low should have no correlation on his individual play since he was so far ahead of his peers athletically. 2000's Shaq playing against ZONE DEFENSE AND HAND CHECKING still managed to avg 57% from the field dispute league avg fg% rivaling that of the 60's so yeah your argument there makes no sense. 4 assists per game in an inflated era statistically is not impressive in the slightest. And you didn't even mention the fact that I still said players such as Shaq were still better passers than wilt chamberlain. Also using assists as the sole basis of an argument as whose the better passers is a casuals argument. Russell Westbrook is not a better passers than Jokic, Lebron, Chris Paul, James Harden, Steph Curry yet he led the league in assists."

It made for a juicy story, but ultimately, it was false. **The Clippers, according to a team source, said Morris was aware of the deal. Paul then negotiated the contract with the Spurs, but once Morris reneged on the deal, Paul and Morris parted ways**""  ""Morris, however, lost out of a much more lucrative contract with the LA Clippers, who were prepared to pay him $41 million over three seasons.

"And I’m saying that I understood exactly what you were saying, but when one side of the aisle is so below the realm of common decency (ie. Send them back) it is the responsibility of anyone who has a stage or a forum to speak up. And Lebron James has taken that opportunity to do so and give back in the process. I understood exactly what you said and my point still stands. Athletes should give back and should be political.   If an athlete disagreeing makes you uncomfortable consider why."
"If we’re keeping politics out of sports are we eliminating national anthems, thank the troops, and so on too? Stupid take. Lebron James inspires people because he doesn’t care and gets political when he needs to. He’s vocal about it."

Rodman gets too much love around here. I agree he's an all time great but he's not better than Bosh.  By the time Rodman got to the bulls PJ was trashing him the whole time because he prefered to go rebound hunting than play defense until it mattered (and i realize PJ likes to pick his players-scapegoats to keep them on edge but this was a trouble he had had before)  Bosh on the other hand may be one of the best pcik and rol defenders of all time and played five without complaining.He adapted to play with Lebron and his numbers suffered but he was beasting without James until the blood colts (Not that big of a sample size but he had demonstated in the past that he could maintain that level of play)
 That Lebron James is not the greatest basketball player of all time
"Lebron would win back to back championships with Jordan, and win FMVP both times, which would start the GOAT debate right off the bat.   But when Jordan leaves, the awful Wizards management does nothing to surround Lebron, and Lebron misses the finals on his own. He might have won a league MVP, but the ring is the thing. Questions arise as to whether the chosen one was really great, or whether he was riding the coattails of the 8 time champion MJ.   After yet another disappointment in 2005, Lebron's first free agency looms, and he decides to join up with a new friend in Miami - a young Dwyane Wade, and an old Shaq. The Miami Big 3 is formed, and demolish the Mavericks in 2006 with no questions about refereeing. In 2007 though, they meet up against the Tim Duncan Spurs, and Dwyane Wade having succumbed to injuries means Lebron loses his 1st finals. And 2008 he fails to see the playoffs. With 3 rings and 3 finals MVPs, he has defined himself as one of the top 2 to ever play - but with a finals loss and sporadic finals appearances, he might have just found his ceiling at that #2 spot.  But Lebron doesn't take things lying down. In 2009, he wins his 2nd MVP, and faces up against Kobe and the Lakers. Kobe has his own business to prove - that he can win one without Shaq. But Lebron doesn't care about Kobe's legacy, and takes yet another ring for himself. And in 2010, Kobe gets a rematch but Lebron wins yet again. And in 2011, Chris Bosh joins up with Miami to form what is seen as an even more potent Big 3.   But over in the West, the Dallas Mavericks come out of nowhere to silence the 5-time champion Lebron James, preventing him once again from completing a 3peat. Jordan starts to point this out - saying that he's the only one who could achieve such a feat. This fuels Lebron's fire even more, and the Mavericks upset especially humbles him. A new Lebron is formed, one that leads the Heat to back-to-back championships against the Thunder and the Spurs. Lebron with 7 rings, 7 FMVPs, and 5 league MVPs. It's 2014, and Lebron sees the Spurs one more time to achieve the coveted yet elusive 3peat.  But a young Kawhi Leonard and the Popovich-signature beautiful basketball of the Spurs prevail, and Lebron sits broken. He knows he needed that 1 ring to tie Jordan, that 1 ring to get the 3peat that had evaded him. Lebron is frustrated with the Heat organization and the players, and after talks with his mother and family, decides to do something he's always dreamed of in the back of his mind.  ""Cleveland- I'm coming home."" The boy from Akron returns, and as Lebron is tearing up the East with Kyrie and Klove, his new flame might be ignited by the West's Splash Brothers. And with injuries plaguing Lebron's team in the finals, Stephen Curry and his partners in crime win their first championship.   And the going gets even worse. While the Cavaliers deal with locker room drama, firing David Blatt only to hire Tyronn Lue, a coaching unknown, the champion Warriors are breaking records left and right, until they demolish the barrier that is 72 wins. A 73-9 team. The media runs wild. Every ESPN talking head talks about how Curry is the modern-day Jordan, an elite scorer, but most importantly - talk about how even MJ himself couldn't stop this team.  Well maybe MJ couldn't, but down 3-1, Lebron and the Cavaliers fight their way back from oblivion, and Lebron James hoists his 8th trophy to the sky.   He might not have achieved the 3peat, but he has achieved greatness in his own right. People debate on whether Lebron's achievements outshone MJs, and the vote on who is the GOAT is nearly evenly split. Lebron returning to two more finals in a weak East but losing to the KD-Warriors only makes the waters more murky, and when he moves to LA and shows weakness for the first time with a groin strain, people think the legend is over. But come 2020, the script might change once more."
"I think perhaps the rarest thing for a superstar is to be phenomenal off the ball, you just don't see it that often.  That alone, combined with the ludicrous spacing he provides makes Curry possibly the best offensive player of all time (you could argue Bird, Magic, Nash, Jordan, LeBron, Oscar, West), and there's literally no situation in which he doesn't fit for offensive purposes.  His historically great efficiency, which even when trailing off in the postseason, is ridiculous.   If you compare the net ratings with him on and off the court, it's mind boggling and paints a picture of how good he is even without Durant.  His defense is slightly above average for his position, he's underrated on that end; he isn't the best on ball defender but certainly has the IQ to understand defensive rotations, and he offers solid perimeter switching.  I think people inherently have a bias against him because he doesn't carry a team's offense with the ball and doesn't isolate score as much as say, James Harden, but his ceiling raising allows a decent team to become a championship contender, which I value more than carrying a team to the playoffs."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"Lets take a real good look at Kobe in the Playoffs.  5 time champion, 2x MVP, went to 7 Finals in 11 years. Has an absurd amount of playoff wins against 50 win teams, Jordan and LeBron don't even come close. In 08-10 when Kobe went to 3 straight Finals, the total SRS of all the teams those 3 years was greater than the combined SRS of all the teams LeBron faced in his 8 straight Finals.  Kobe is the only player in NBA history to have scored 600 points in 3 straight postseasons.  Kobe is one of FEW players whose numbers do not dip in the postseason. Sure there are some series where he doesn't play well and there are other series where he plays great, but for entire postseasons, Kobe's efficiency and proficiency numbers are remarkably consistent from regular season to postseason. The only full postseason, starting from 1999-2013, where he was considerably worse in the playoffs was 2011, coming off 3 straight Finals and dealing with many injuries.  Kevin Durant, pre-GSW years had magnificent efficiency drops, James Harden, Westbrook, even LeBron had a few years where there were noticeable declines in efficiency/proficiency.  No, Kobe hasn't had the greatest Finals series, but the Finals aren't the only playoff series, and guess what, he's won 5 out of fucking 7 so that's pretty damn good. He hasn't had the best game 7's, and he's still won every single one of them except the one in 2006.  Every superstar has some bad moments in clutch moments, every superstar has had great moments in the playoffs. But when you beat strong team after strong team in the postseason, when your peers look to you as the clutch option, don't fucking tell me that his clutch reputation isn't purely off marketing.  A superstar who isn't clutch doesn't go to 7 Finals in 11 years, win 5 titles, and routinely dominates other great playoff teams. Imagine being the person thinking you can go ahead and bet against Kobe having a good playoff game just because some numbers look bad."
"Pretty sure Garnett and Duncan not wanting to guard Shaq had as much to do with them playing power forward as much as anything else.  Dirk and Garnett changed the game by showing big men can shoot and made stretch bigs desirable and a prerequisite for modern bigs that's true.  But you know MJ and Lebron changed the game too. Most of the top players did. MJ proved that a score first player could be a winning player. He also made game winning shots cool, and he started the expectation that the best player on the team has to take the last shot.  Lebron changed traditional pick and role defense because through his passing he ripped apart weakside defenders rotating to the roll man. Switch defenses became normal because it was necessary against Lebron. The Heatles further popularized switching defenses with small ball using James as a big on defense and forcing teams to replace rim protectors with smaller players to guard James, thus opening up the paint. Draymond Green is the modern embodiment of switchable small ball.  Lebron's weakness is not shooting outside shots his weakness is shooting free throws and that isn't addressed by the roster of his teams. He gets teams with shooters for the same reason Steph and Dirk and everyone else plays with good shooters: because teams are better with players who can shoot well. Not to cover for a weakness. Did Dirk play with Jason Terry and have Terry close out games because Dirk wasn't clutch? Or because he can't shoot? Or was it because it simply made the team better having a guy like that?"
"I always wanted this quote to be true but could never find any sort of reliable source to verify:  &gt;""I thought LeBron James was just going to be another addition to help me score."" - Ricky Davis   After watching that video, I'm starting to believe."
Yeah one of them is at worst second GOAT. And the other is Lebron James.
"Ofcourse he is an easy scapegoat when he is the problem, just look what he did in Cleveland, he didnt even accept being the fucking #2 option behind LeBron James and forced his way out and then last year he just basically quit on Celtics after all-star break."
"How can something be true, and then you state behind others?  Harden to me is better than Kawhi and Lebron. He has not had teams like the other two you have mentioned. The team he did have when cp3 was still all star caliber, they pushed arguably the greatest team ever healthy with KD to 7 games, and had a strong chance of winning if it wasn’t for cp3 injury.   They would have definitely won the championship if it wasn’t for that series. People dock James for not winning, but the warriors were in his way. No other team took more than a game off them during their reign.   Other team? The clippers when  warriors were fully healthy and we know that took a miracle 30 point comeback.   Not even a healthy kyrie lebron love cavs got more than 1 game.   Harden is special."
I thought there were games in the 2019 Finals where he was the best player on the floor.  Kawhi was a little inconsistent.  I never thought he was the best player in any game where Lebron James was on the floor.
"Only because the lebron fans here really disrespect Kobe.   I always defend James harden as well, but lately since it’s offseason that talk has died down.  James harden is my current favorite player, followed by Shamet, then kawhi."
"People have no problem crucifying James harden, I just thought its time we share a Lebron James Flop Comp.   But when it comes to him, theres always excuses right?"

"I get the traditional context of a ""pure"" or ""prototypical"" PG but it's still completely arbitrary. There's basically a handful of roles on the court, and calling someone a PG/SG/SF/PF/C doesn't really mean anything. Why are Lebron/Simmons/Dame PGs but Steph isn't (according to Arenas)?   His top 5 was:  1) Chris Paul 2) LeBron James 3) John Wall 4) Damian Lillard 5) Ben Simmons  I think most would agree a traditional PG is someone who facilitates the offense as effectively as possible, regardless of whether they're the ones putting the ball in the basket or not, which Steph does at an extremely elite level.   And my issue wasn't solely on Steph not being called a PG, but he also says he can't rank him as a SG, since he's apparently neither."
"The only active players from the 2003 draft are LeBron, Korver, and Zaza (if he gets signed).  That draft has as many first rounders still playing as it has head coaches (Walton) and general managers (James Jones)."
"What about Yao Ming? He wasn't unique on the court, per se. But he was the first Chinese superstar. He was also the first international player selected 1st overall in the NBA draft.  And I believe within our lifetime, the best player in the NBA will come from China.    I'd throw James Harden in the conversation too, for 2 reasons. One, because he takes ""taking advantage of the rules"" to a whole new level. Two, because I don't think the Rocket's ""3 or dunk"" offense has ever been implemented to this extreme, and he's the face of it. Maybe technically the offense belongs to D'antoni and his name should be on it. What is the Rockets offense even called?      Would Magic be the guy that popularized the point forward role?    Would Pete Maravich be the guy that started making all those fancy passes and dribbling?     Jackie Moon invented the alley-oop.         Is it fair to credit the ""superstar movements"" to Lebron? Because of him, a whole bunch of stars have relocated.     I remember hearing or reading somewhere that the European players that brought over flopping to the NBA? That might not be correct."

Threw me for a loop when you switched from talking about Lebron James to James Harden
Wasn’t it James Jones that went to like 6 straight finals with Lebron? Pretty sure he never won mvp
"And as great as he was, he came up against somebody that was putting up peak LeBron stats all across the board and was a much better defensive player than James. People in this thread are acting like James should have ran away with it and that's just ludicrous. Giannis was every bit his equal and it didn't matter who won because they both would have thoroughly deserved it."
You mean LeBron James?
http://www.businessinsider.com/raptors-computer-program-lebron-james-2013-3  In the early days of SportsVU the computer was literally capturing just this. Combining that athleticism with that brain he was as deadly as any non big defender ever.

How did you do in the playoffs last year when you got LeBron James?
"Exactly.  Who do I want taking that shot, I’ll Take Kobe or KD.  Harden is great but he does have inflated stats compared to Kobe from system he runs in particularly since Dantoni got there. He is a great Iso scorer and his efficiency is historic but on isos it was stated Harden what 1.11 PPR on ISO best season vs Kobe 1.08 PPR best season.  I don’t wanna take away from the greatness of Harden and perhaps one of the best regular seasons ever for a player this year but I think people are seriously disrespecting Kobe and what a monster scorer he was and also throwing out the rules of game and different eras and very important contextual things like that to consider.  Harden has higher PPR and efficiency because he doesn’t really take contested or really any mid range shots hardly ever at this point.  Also, Kobe played across quite a few eras in terms of rules and evolution of the game.  Then the defensive rules changed in middle of his career illegal defense and the days of no zone defense that greatly helps dominant unstoppable scores like Jordan, Bryant, Durant, hell Lebron one on one scorers,  it was changed to allow zone and also offensive and defensive 3 seconds were revised and added back as they are now what think gear after Kobe three peat or around there.  That’s why the Pistons even had a chance against lakers.  They put zone in the game to handicap dominant scorers like Shaq, or Kobe, or MJ, or KD, Lebron,Tracy Mcgrady etc.  Also soacing was very bad and the lane was terribly clogged Most of Kobes career and zone made it so everyone can camp the paint on D and double team people off ball and basically have the entire team or 3-4 guys floating around paint dinanf scorers would need to beat.  There was a lot if adjusting and further changed to get where we are now.  Kobe’s last season Healthy the Achilles tear at the end of the year,  he was coaches by dantoni and had games where people were starting to call him Kobe Johnson bc all the playmaking.  Now imagine if Kobe had as Much spacing as harden and was asked to play same role.  You seriously think that if Kobe were prime and adapted to NBA now he wouldn’t have put up even more absurd numbers than Harden.  He jacked uo lots of twos contested because spacing used to be awful and the game was played a bit different.  Harden does the dame thing people Bash Kobe for... Shot Jacking, Heavily Contested Shot Jacking,  really difficult shot shot jacking, bad shot shot jacking.... bc the shots are fucking difficult.  I watched most if his games this season.  There is reason he set 3 poijt attemt record.  He would dribble the air out of the ball and then hop step back or side step back and take like 15-20 threes or more like that every game.  I I don’t really see how this is some how different or better than what people acuse kobe of.  It’s more efficient bc they are three point shots.  Many if them are horrible difficult shots just like Kobe, they are worth more if made is all.  If Kobe was to play the james Harden role On Rockets,  He’s just work on his three shooting like a maniac and Jack up threes instead of contested two pointers.  And everything else,  he is much more athletic,  better finisher and will kill you if you give let him shoot easy midrange.   Harden is great but limited compared To other true great scorers.  Kobe is just better, more adaptable and harder working.   Oh and he always has an arsenal of moves so maybe instead Of super deep contested stepback he gets more layups and super easy looks he converts and shoots better from 3 bc he won’t dribblw air out ball till shor clock winds down the. Take hardest shot in basketball bc he won’t need to.  Harden is great but I don’t really see why the conversation is about him vs Kobe.  Durant at least was the better comparison as he is a much more versatile well rounded Dominant all time great scorer in the same Mold.  He is historically efficient.  He hasn’t officially played 2 guard since seattle lol but he lied about hos height so he could have a role like that as perimeter scorer instead of big.  He is a 7 foot guard fowArd who is much closer To Kobe and MJ but probably was a better more efficient more prolific scorer.  Can u imagine Durant with illegal defense rules like Jordan had?  Jordan was an athletic freak and tough to deal with but can u imagine if Durant only had to beat 1 guy or he couldn’t be like quad teamed with pussy defense?  Half the game would be the other team blown for illegal defense and he’d or would have maybw averaged 40 points a game.  plus he can shoot from half court so guarding him is way worse than jordan, and he can shot over everyone everywhere.  Or Lebron,  Bugger more athletic than Jordan.  Good god can u imagine anyone trying to guard Him with illegal defense in play.  I’m not a fanboy but he would average way more points per game career tha. Jordan as He’s still much better deep than Jordan and has handles, brute strength again it would be ridiculous whoch is why they changed rules.   Not to take away from Harden but cluld You Imagine Curry asked to play the same way if say we swapped him for Harden team wise next year.  If he had the green lite like harden this season(has there wvwr been a greener lite?) he’d probably have hit like 700 out of 1200+ threes and averaged who knows how much playing similar to that. Granted that’s not his game and what makes him so dangerous and versatile but the spacing would be even more absurd.  I mean he  you would have to guard him super hardcore back to dame shot over paul george range and further back.  If not toght guarded,  And he was a shot chucker or decided to be he’d walk up just past half court and shoot if you aren’t in his grill with a couple guys and probably make 40+% of fucking almost half Court shots not contested.  So even more space and driving lanes bc if he is allowed to chuck tons of practially half court shots he will be more efficient than harden by a mile,  I mean who knows he will have a pretty green light this season.  He could probably average 40 Points perhaps if he goes off for another mvp on better efficiency than harden.   Just sayin Harden is great but I’d take a lot of players to get me buckets in a game at end of game for whole season or playoffs under todays rules.  Durant, Kobe, Curry, Tmac, Who knows Tre Young in a Few years as he is a much bettee deep shooter and spacer than Harden who set the record for most 20+ ft 3’s in his rookie season.  Is an amazing playmaker very crafty.   Lots of names past or present potentially.  Not that Harden won’t get buckets.  Just his game now is limited and if I’m taking someone to get buckets for a championship run from game 1 to finals win probably not picking Harden.  I don’t think it’s fair to call him a choker and all the disrespect he gets. But....... he doesn’t have enough ways or the raw scoring ability and variety of many others and while he will get buckets and go off in playoffs, and he hits some ridiculous difficult deep step back threes I feel like that play style is limiting in the playoffs.  It is easier to contain than if he also was more versatile and well Rounded especially when dribbling the clock down to take like double contested deep stepback threes isn’t working, surprise🤣.  Going like 1-25 n shit yourself from three and some Of those nightmare shooting nights he has had in playoffs,  I fee like maybe if you are jacking up 20+ of those 3’s and it isn’t working but you rinse and repeat and other tram Knows exactly what’s coming,  that has something to Do with missing so many shots.  If he was More varied he’d probably get waaaaaaaay easier 3’s and be much more clutch and harder to stop or harder To live with.  If he does what he does now The rest of his career unless he starts hitting those absurd contested step back deep threes he hoists So much... it’s amazing he makes as many as he does at a much higher rate somehow Like becomes better shooter than curry somehow and makes a lot more of those he is limiting himself.  If he can be hitting contested deep step-back threes at 40+% then well the league really is fucked and he’ll be a 1 man golden state and a better shooter than curry.  Unless he can do that I don’t see his current style getting him a championship.  I mean he could win one maybe if he is Taking over like he did last year again this year sure.... but he might also miss 30+ threes multiple times in a playoff Series And lose bc of It🤣🤣🤣.   Harden is quite an enigma,"
"You seem to keep forgetting that it's not just *some* 35 year old, it's LeBron James. Groin injury is not something that is going to be lingering and affecting other parts of the body. I have had one too. So yeah it's not astrophysics and I'm not going to reply to you after this one because you clearly have no idea what you are talking about.

2nd to the greatest player in the planet Lebron James.
"All you have to is watch highlights of the 2014 finals to see Lebron scoring on Kawhi.  &gt;Kawhi Leonard has been the primary defender against LeBron James in the NBA Finals.On the surface, it appears that LeBron James has not struggled against Kawhi Leonard. Video tracking shows that James shot 12-of-18 (66.7 percent) with Leonard as his primary defender in the first three games of the 2014 NBA Finals.  https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/91407/kawhi-leonard-wreaking-havoc-on-lebron  &gt;I swear no one on here watched the series and just saw that ESPN graphic lol.  I vividly remember Lebron being put onto Rose in the 4th quarter and completely cutting him off even blocking his last shot."
"&gt;  The only team that actually had the balls to tell LeBron ""no"" was pat Reilly with the heat.

Lebron James + Manute Bol = Tacko Fall
"De'Aaron Fox + Derrick Rose = Russell Westbrook  Andre Drummond + Earl Boykins = Ty Lawson  Ty Lawson + Paul Millsap = LeBron James  Larry Bird + Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Wilt Chamberlain, the 2005 Miami Heat and 1/2 of the 2011 Dallas Mavericks  = Nikola Jokic"
That's a pretty good answer. A guy on a ten day contract hit a buzzer beat to defeat a LeBron James led team.
Lebron James has been find for tampering.
Lebron is 4 years older than Steph. James (1984) Curry (1988) - 4 years gap!  James was the chosen one in HS and all nba level since his second year. And Curry’s injuries limited him to play well during his early years of his career
"I don't know how we can trace where it started, but it's a circle. As long as James is criticized for losing in the finals, Jordan's 'failures' will get nitpicked too. People hold Lebron to a crazy standard and now it's getting spread around."

"His success level in the playoffs can not be compared to Bill Russell, Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James.      Even with all the records to his name, #5th spot is the best he can be ranked at."
"I would want all of his rings forfeit, and take away the rings of everyone that played with him to. Then James Lebron would have to refund all of the jersies that were sold with “James” on the back then go back and edit every Reddit post where he is referred to by first and last name to switch them to make it consistent with the poster intent.   Then we can talk about suspensions."

"In a fair matchup Lebron will almost always win. Really the only time that didn't happen was 2011. So even if Lebron has 'help' like in 2017, it wasn't a fair matchup against a Warriors team that added Kd. 2014 wasn't a fair matchup (through no fault of the Spurs) with the role players aging out, and literally both Wade and James being injured."

Lebron james vs the Dallas Mavericks in the finals worst choke job by an nba superstar on a super team vs a team with one superstar.
"Klay Thompson, Paul George, Manu Ginobili, Gary Payton, and when he feels like it, LeBron James."
"James Harden is the first and obvious answer. LeBron occasionally does it strategically to save energy, but the man can play incredible defense. Curry is hidden on D sometimes because of his size, but he is ball hawk out on the perimeter, and gets tons of steals as a sneaky help defender. Harden is just an awful defender."
"Hmm, okay, they went 6-0 in the Finals when they were teammates of an NBA franchise located in the heart of the Midwest during an era of basketball's emergence into prominence looming over them as the Los Angles(best franchise ever, I might add) landed superstar center Shaquille O'Neal who eventually lead them to 3 straight rings. A decade and change later, they landed Lakers managed to sign superstar free-agent LeBron James who is the best basketball player in the history of this universe, which emerged with Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe. After its initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later atoms.  And that's how I met your mother."
"No one brings it up because they won, but Wade's decline was very apparent after 2011. Why would people talk about a player declining when they win though? That's not what they're focused on. Wade wasn't a straight negative either but his veteren presence and experience doesn't give the Heat an advantage over the Spurs, who were the definition of an experienced team. And Ray Allen was way too old even during the 2013 finals, him hitting that shit in game 6 doesn't make him young again.   On top of that, that was the Heat's 4th straight finals, that's another thing you need to consider. Not everyone is LeBron James, postseason games take a toll, and 4 straight finals was just too much for that squad"
"LeBron James was the undisputed best player in the NBA in the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 seasons, he won two rings, two MVP awards, led the league in every advanced composite metric (PER, WS, WS/48, BPM, VORP), and nearly did the same in the playoffs. Any argument for another player is a bad one."
Nope. You were never any good. Kyrie James harden LeBron would say the same thing booker said
I'm really not. But I'm going to pretend the LeBron vs. KD debate began this season. It's been going on for years. And before KD it was Kobe and Melo.   It's never been undisputed for James.

"They don't play the Warriors every game, and what does TP's case has to do with Rose? TP wasn't even having mental issues. Rose was legit depressed and it caused him to miss games without notifying anyone. Love was also depressed too during his Cavs stint. Now, I am not one to claim ""Lebron made Love depressed"" but he could've done something you know, rally the team, make them feel welcomed and maybe they'll sacrifice for you because they like you, and not because you're Lebron James and entitled to their sacrifices.  Make a positive change in someone's life, you know.. that's pretty much his image as a philanthropist, but it seems he's only doing it when it's largely publicized or only when it comes to kids?"
"22ppg 2rpg 4apg on 38%FG 17%3PT  18ppg 7apg 7rpg on 48%FG 32%3PT  In what universe are these comparable offensive outputs? Lebron literally did everything way better and those are acceptable counting stats from one of the best players in the game. Kobe is below replacement level and an obvious detriment to his team.  Gonna give Lebron the nod as well on defense, this is prime Miami Lebron James functioning as one of the best all time off the ball defenders we have seen in NBA history."
"Probably now, just think about the players that were on that Golden State team that year. Prime Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, a great defensive year Klay Thompson, Andre Iguadala before he got old, Draymond Green, Clyde Drexler, rookie Michael Jordan, James Naismith's ghost, 2 clones of LeBron, dream team Christian Laettner, and the football player from The Last Boy Scout that pulls out a gun on the field. I just don't see PG making a huge difference that series."

"Lue benefitted from a suspension of draymond; not an injury.  And the warriors roasted the cavs twice with their entire roster intact.  Nurse may not have any injury assistance on his playoff run but he definitely benefitted from the lack of Lebron James in the east anymore.  That coupled with the upgrade of kawhi Leonard in place of derozan,  the surprise explosion of siakam; and the deadline move for Gasol gave him a ton of assistance.  If anything I credit ujiri for the season you had over nurse."

"I don't know what's funnier: that they have Tatum above Horford, Lowry, Draymond, and Aldridge, or that they did so and used this as his blurb:  &gt;The Celtics need more from Tatum, who had an electric rookie season in 2017-18, culminating with a dunk over his childhood idol, LeBron James, in the Eastern Conference finals. Tatum did not build on that success, appearing, at times, curiously passive in 2018-19 and exhibiting occasional defensive indifference."

"Speaking of problems, I don't think Reinhart-Rogoff is the source to bring up. Skipping the data problems, there's no consensus there. This isn't my field, though, so if there's something convincing about Stiglitz being absolutely wrong then please do show me. Regardless, it's not a very strong point to say that he was potentially right for the wrong reasons.  As for Chavez, he did many positive things for Venezuela; increased [literacy rates](https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/charts/venezuela-literacy-rate-adult-male-percent-of-males-ages-15-and-above-wb-data.png?s=ven.se.adt.litr.ma.zs%3Aworldbank&amp;lbl=0&amp;v=201909300000V20190821), reduced poverty, and so on. Of course, there were problems: criminality and burgeoning oil production issues, particularly. But Chavez' reign was [not wholly negative](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-15240081), and Stiglitz praised him in 2007, long before the manifestation of the most severe problems (which obviously became much worse under Maduro). That praise is no reason to say that he's an ""ideologically driven curmudgeon"". It's a bit reductionist, and potentially (I hope not) ideologically driven from yourself.   Given the hyperbole I think I want to quote you:  &gt; See, you're literally doing it. This is why smart people can't be famous. People like you just find ways to attack someone giving them the truth because they don't want to accept it, whether it be LeBron James or Raj Chetty or whoever.  I'm not saying Stiglitz is always speaking truth. No intellectual does, there are significant ideological differences that are pervasive, always, with everyone.* But you shouldn't require that.   *Including Chetty and the like, especially on broader topics. Some researchers, Chetty somewhat included, rarely speak of anything outside their own research -- but I hope we can agree that if you want a famous public intellectual that's not enough."
Maybe if we had traded down in order to pass on the European Lebron James (in terms of hype) that would be a good comparison.
"You not even gonna mention that he was recovering from back surgery as well? You think you’d want to strengthen your argument if you were gonna come at me...  Injuries aside, a torn labrum doesn’t make you sit in the post for 3-5 seconds and spam the same spin move which constantly gets you stripped. Which also slows down the pace of the offense, throws teammates out of rhythm, and frustrates players who are wasting possessions to try to make Dwight happy when Dwight post ups are a horribly inefficient play call. It pissed off Kobe and D’Antoni, it pushed Pau to the perimeter, it killed their entire offensive flow.   You see, almost everyone who watched him saw those exact things, so you’re exposing yourself. No one would know you’re an idiot if you just kept your mouth shut about stuff you don’t know about, but here you are getting buried in downvotes. Getting all emotional over Dwight Howard lmao.

"Just adding to this top comment so some people can see, this is just a quick translation of the overall excerpt:  Full translation of this excerpt on SK's website:  Concerning the understanding of basketball and life in general in the US, Jokić had this to say:  ""In the US, the system is set up so that every NBA team makes it possible for a player to be the best he can be - the care, trainers, doctors, they will provide everything and won't give you any reason to blame them for your failures. In the three or four years I've been there, 20-30 players have went through the Nuggets. When you think about it, that itself is a bit worrying, but there's always new talent and new players coming into the team. It's a giant show that just keeps going, it keeps going if you get hurt, you are just one part of the ""circus."" Wherever we go, people want to take a photo, we are like some sort of circus animals, ""Let's take a photo, let's take a photo."" I also find this a bit ridiculous because if you think about it, you start losing your grasp on reality - we are just athletes, we play basketball.""  One of the conversation topics concerned the large amount of influence top-tier athletes can have outside of the field of sports. Jokić mentioned Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Novak Djoković...  ""I am honestly a staunch opponent of the media because I think they are bad for the sport, but we are what we are because of the media, this is why we are famous and that allows [athletes?] to have their influence. Yes, the influence athletes have can be even broader than some, how should I put it, more important people in the world.""   That's everything that's been released so far, can't find the original interview anywhere yet"
"See, you're literally doing it. This is why smart people can't be famous. People like you just find ways to attack someone giving them the truth because they don't want to accept it, whether it be LeBron James or Raj Chetty or whoever."
"Raj Chetty is great, but idk what fame would do for him aside from having a bunch of people on Twitter call him a dirty SJW. Trump winning fucked up any chance of his research making its way into national policy, and his work on Value Added Teaching pisses off both rich white people and teachers unions too much to be implemented.  Ironically, the most prominent application of Chetty's research might be LeBron James' school"
This entire topic is very subjective. Why is it wrong that more people would idolize the success of Lebron James over Bill Gates. They both have enough money that they dont need to worry about anything ever and Basketball is always going to be more relate-able than advanced computer programming
"Nobody in the history of the NBA has been as good at carrying bad teams through the playoffs as Lebron. It doesn’t matter if the east wasn’t as good as the west, the fact that he actually got to the finals in 2007 or 2018 is insane.  No way in hell is James Harden getting that ‘18 Cavs team to the finals. And no way he’s doing it 7 times in a row before that."
there's this guy... LeBron James... he plays for your team...
"I mean I know it's not something we like to admit, but there *is* a strong correlation between intelligence and education.   Of course there are exceptions. LeBron James is as savvy as they come and I expect he'd have been successful in a wide range of arenas had he chosen another path.   But in general, on the macro level, intelligence and education have a correlation."
LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard winning a chip is crazy?
"Bogut was valuable because by playing those 12 minutes, when the Warriors went with a traditional 5 and rested parts of their death lineup, it meant Ezeli and Varejao saw little to no playing time. In game 7, IIRC those two led in negative plus minus to the tune of nearly double digits...in a game that was essentially neck and neck all of the way through. They were awful. Credit to the Cavs for exploiting them, but to act like a series that close wasn’t effected by that injury is naive.  Midway through the 4th, LeBron gets a switch onto Ezeli...on an island. The Warriors has been holding onto a 7 or 9 point lead for most of that second half. It felt like a weirdly insurmountable cushion at the time. James gets Ezeli to bite on a three point pump fake, because if you even raised your eyebrows Festus would jump to try to block the shot. Foul, he nails all three free throws. Next time down court, same switch...you can see Iguodala and Green motioning to switch back, but Ezeli has full tunnel vision. This time, he gives James a ton of space and he calmly steps into the three and buries it. Timeout Warriors. That’s 6 points in the matter of 30 seconds, in a 4th quarter that saw the Cavs score 18 points. Would LeBron have been able to exploit Bogut? Sure, but to the same devastating tune? Andrew has a high defensive IQ, likely wouldn’t have fouled him shooting a three, and would’ve been aware of attempts to switch back. Ezeli has no business playing significant minutes in a game of that magnitude, and Anderson was even worse which was a shame."
"Curry has never been a *true* superstar as far as the media is concerned. He's not on the level of LeBron and Kobe (or Messi, Ronaldo, Federer, etc) on this point. He may not receive the hate Harden does, but every time the Warriors face off against the Cavs, things like ""LeBron James is the best player in the world and it isn't even close"" start getting thrown around just like with any other team.  I mean, I get that Rockets are salty AF about this because the basketball they like is effective but so ridiculously hateable by everyone, but if you say ""Curry is as popular as LeBron"" then you're a Curry hater rather than a realist. You bring the example of A MARKETING TEAMS COMMERCIAL BEING A SUCCESS as Curry being loved, but that's like saying ""people liked Uncle Drew, Kyrie &gt; LeBron""."
"Yeah, like you think James Harden, LeBron etc wouldn’t adjust when they’re getting 15 turnovers every game?"
My point is that giving someone a position based on who their primary assignment is doesn't really work logically.   For example lets say Kevin Durant is guarding Lebron James. Perhaps you would say Kevin Durant is a SF then. But if Lebron James is guarding Draymond Green then suddenly Lebron James would be a center and Kevin Durant would be as well since he's guarding Lebron James.   Or even more simply you could just look at two players playing different positions guarding each other. Would Stephen Curry guarding James Harden make Stephen Curry a SG or does it make James Harden a PG?
Why would LeBron James no be there to compete? He wants to strengthen his legacy and another ring in his 3rd team would do just that. I doubt he gets rid of the unique personality and goes after AD if he didn’t want to compete.
LeBron James. So damn tenacious!!
LeBron James
Because there’s a team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis and another team with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.
You realize that the *Players* Union is why they have this system right? Team owners and management don't give a shit about who gets what money as long as they can maximize their own profits. Lebron James is a VP of the players union so if he cares that much about it he can bring it up in their next meeting.
"ITT: Almost zero mentions of defence.  A Brook Lopez/LeBron James front court is going to get murdered by the Raptors. Bron is not a good enough help defender at this stage of his career to allow Lopez to play the drop P&amp;R the way he does, and if he can’t do that he may as well not be on the court. Giannis’ rebounding was also huge for us, and LeBron isn’t as good at that either.  That series was close because our defence was just as good as theirs, our offence would improve for sure but we’d lose the primary reason for that elite defence. If we’re not shutting them down, are we supposed to be relying on LeBron to beat down a defence that good so badly that Bledsoe or the terrible shooting of everybody not named Brogdon becomes irrelevant?  Maybe we could have won with LeBron but I doubt it. This team is built around Giannis, and just because they both like to drive and kick doesn’t mean a team built around Giannis is perfect for LeBron (or vice versa)."
And that’s how it should be. Lebron James shouldn’t make 35m so less impactful players can make 5m
Luka Doncic will average more points and rebounds than LeBron James
LeBron James an extra coward for not participating in a dunk contest
"But my question is why does the OP think Kareem got robbed of the 1980 Finals MVP?  He didn't play in the clinching Game 6, which was the Magic Game.  It's the same reason Big Game James won the 1988 Finals MVP (for his Game 7), even though Magic had the better series.  I don't think Kareem was necessarily even robbed in 1980, but even if he was, I don't think it would help his chances over LeBron."
"The benefit is being seen as a player friendly team making future free agent negotiations easier. We essentially got Lebron james because of how well we treated Kobe, especially when we made him the highest paid player in the league post Achilles."
"You aren't far off.  His mom took a loan out and the collateral was legitimately ""My son is LeBron James""      [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/14/sports/basketball-lebron-james-s-suv-prompts-an-investigation.html)"
"You keep doing this. This might be the fourth or fifth time that you ""counter"" arguments I've never even made. I said the best HS players are nba ready and you respond by saying most players aren't? Those aren't mutually exclusive, what are you even talking about?  As for lebron in hs vs in the nba, obviously nba teams are better than high school teams. Does that even need to be said? What are you trying to prove by saying that? The point is 19 year old lebron James was a very good nba player. He didn't dominate like he did when he was older or when he was still in HS but rookie lebron was a very good nba player right off the bat. HS lebron would be the greatest player in WNBA history by a huge margin. That's the point. Not all HS players could complete with WNBA players, but the best HS players are far better than WNBA players   As for Cade fucking Cunningham, this is literally the first time I've ever typed that name. Please stop bringing up what other people said and saying you think they're wrong like it has something to do with me. Some players are nba ready in hs. Some are close. Those players would dominate in the WNBA. Some players aren't, I never mentioned Cade Cunningham. I don't really care whether or not he in particular is nba ready"
"imagine thinking lebron ""34 points per playoff game in 2018 and carried the cavs to the finals"" james is a washed up all star"
"&gt; You’re high if you think larry was a better defender an rebounder.  3 All Defensive Teams &gt; 0     10 RPG &gt; 7.1 (KD has never even gotten to Larrys CAREER AVERAGE for an entire season). KDs career high is 8.3 Larry has 12 seasons higher than KDs best.    &gt;He beat Tim Duncan widely considered the best PF all time. Ginobili, parker.    When did he beat them in a finals? Hmmm.. never?     Magic, Kareem, Worthy &gt;&gt;&gt; Duncan, Ginobli, Parker  &gt;He beat Kobe Bryant second best SG all time.     When did he play them in a finals? Hmmm..never? Larry went through Michael Jordan on his way to the finals, who is better than Kobe. You know plus Magic and Kareem... which would be 3 of the top 5 players EVER.      &gt;KD won against LBJ who’s considered the GOAT or second best all time.     Yeah, an INJURED Kyrie. Clevelanders starters.... Lebron, Love, JR Smith, George Hill, and Tristant Thompson, etc.     Lakeshow starters? Magic Johnson, Byron Scott, James Worthy, AC Green, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, etc.    &gt;KD is a stud averaged 35ppg as a 21yo.     He literally never came close to 35ppg try 30 lmao dumbass       Jesus youre stupid"
"enter lebron james and vincebot, still not retired yet"
Are y’all forgetting who LeBron James is?
"Iverson, great scorer, amazing crossover. Best reaction play? Dunks.  Jason Williams, amazing passer and handle, best reaction plays? Dunks.  Micheal Jordan, incredible scorer, incredible defender, game winners galore. Best reaction plays? Dunks.   LeBron James, can do it all, incredible playmaker and great scorer. Best reaction plays? Dunks.  MVP last year Greek freak, what’s he best at? What did he do more than anyone in the league on his way to MVP? Take a wild guess... yup, dunks.   We’re talking about entertainment here. Have you ever heard of Zion Williamson? The world famous basketball star that hasn’t even played in the NBA and yet is one of the top 5 most talked about players right now? We know him because he’s a dunker, a huge dunker. Why would Nike give a kid who’s biggest marketable strength is far and away his huge dunks $100M dollars if no one cares about dunking?"
"Smaller nba players are insanely fast compared to their WNBA counterparts. Also much stronger. Like I said in my previous comment, a female athlete being the same height as a male athlete does not make her just as athletic  Also not sure what your link is supposed to prove. A WNBA team is better than the vast majority of men. They will beat a random HS boys team no problem. That's literally the first thing I said. But when it comes to the highest tier of male athletes they will lose, doesn't matter if those men are high school age. Think 18 year old lebron James, not your average hs age redditor"
"Rose was the only star on that team, and they overperformed from their preseason expectations. Contrast that to LeBron James, who had two All-Stars and underperformed. The Heat were expected to rip through the league, and not doing so was a disappointment. LeBron didn’t even get second that year, he got third."
"You can choose to feel this way, and it isn’t what happened.   For every Kwame Brown selected first in the draft straight from high school there was a LeBron James and a Dwight Howard.   The prep to pro generation was successful to a significantly higher degree than what is normal for players out of college or elsewhere."
Because with all due respect. He just isn’t as good......   That’s not a knock. There’s no shame in not being as good as a top 2 player ever.   James was better then Bryant maybe 3-4 years into his career....... no one was admitting it because he was ringless and there’s that unwritten rule about paying homeage to old guys no matter how much better the younger guy is.   Mike faced it when people didn’t think he was up to Magic’s level.   LeBron faced it against Kobe. Then he just elevated. Won 3 titles and is still dominating and now only has Jordan ahead of him (that itself is another debate)   Ben Simmons lost an all star spot to Kemba Walker and 1-2 others  (I don’t remember) because he is young. Literally. Because he’s young and nothing more.   If people stopped obsessing over outdated old shit and just acknowledged the greatness there and then. Debates would be a lot different.   Kobe is not LeBron. Let alone Jordan. Whether 5-2 or 7-0
"OP’s list is wild lol.  LeBron James (no fair he can fly and I can’t) Kylie Irving (Quite being weird) Russel Westbrook (stay doin the most) Tristan Thompson (actually you are trash) James Harden (bro that’s traveling, damn what the ref says)  6th Man Grayson Allen (actually you’re trash)"
Lots of young guys **who didn't play.** Larry Brown didn't trust *LeBron James.*
Exactly it’s a advantage. There are no entire troll accounts on social media dedicated to tearing down Duncans legacy like a Kobe or a Lebron James
"&gt; Rockets fans are stuck in 2014 when Harden had a case for MVP that wasn't ""my team is shit and look how good I am"", so?  Lmao, kinda true tbh. But if you can’t see why some of us are a little upset that Harden is routinely snubbed then whatever  &gt; The point is that the moment LeBron comes up then the average fan will jizz himself, the media will praise everything about him hoping James Senpai will tweet back at them, and so on... while mere mortals like Curry/Harden/Westbrook have to go so far above and beyond what is sane to be given something that can remotely be in the league of that superstar credit.  Imagine being this out of touch  Curry is on the same level as Lebron in terms of media love. He won the first unanimous MVP, and guesss who votes for the stuff? When he’s on the court, he gets praise for the most minimal things, announcers have a full blown orgasm when he gets a normal rebound of steal.  &gt; Seriously though, you think that Harden, Curry, and the rest of the non-LeBron (and after the championships, sometimes KD) players get the same credit he does for doing something as (or more) amazing?   We can go evens further, he got a 20 minute ESPN segment when he got that little girl basketball shoes, and made UA start selling girl shoes separately. Everyone loves it  **Except for the fact that Nike/Adidas/Jordan have been selling girl basketball shoes for years**  There’s a reason people call him the “Golden Boy” and nots because of where he plays  Don’t even get me started on the droves of fan who can’t take any criticism, who come to defense, making bullshit excuses and mental gymnastics to defense every one of his faults."
"Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away  And   Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion James Harden, Swaggy P (nick young) runnin' up the budget  Both are pretty short, but I like em nonetheless"
"""What if"" it is an endless wormhole where everything is possible and people choose only the good and never the bad.   Durant could have won the MVP in 2010 and died on his way home due or could have had a devastating injury in 2012 like Rose.  Life doesnt work like that, there is no Kevin Durant without Lebron James"
"Are you really a Cavs fan trying to mock the Lakers fans? Your franchise is the biggest embarrassment in basketball dude. Even when successful you lost LeBron TWICE and lost the NBA Finals any time you reached it which was not very often. Even when LeBron ""The Greatest Ever"" James fell in your lap you barely made a competitive roster for a decade."
"&gt; James and Jordan both average the same amount of blocks.  Wrong. Up until the same age, Jordan averaged 0.89bpg. He had consecutive seasons where he made 130 and 125 blocks. LeBron averages 0.76bpg and has yet to record a season of 100 blocks let alone 120+.         &gt; Lebron is flat out a better defender than Jordan              *Very* few people would agree with you. Jordan is talked about as one of the greatest guard defenders of all time, he was being talked about *when he was playing* as one of the greatest defenders of all time, period. There is video on YT of a commentator referencing MJ as 'one of the five greatest defenders of all time'. Not saying that's correct but that's the reputation he had. He also made 1st Team All Defense 9 times as well as winning the DPOY. LeBron made the 1st team 5 times and of course never won a DPOY. Oh and MJ is also one of just three players in NBA history to record 200+ steals and 100+ blocks in a season and the *only* player to do it twice. Seriously, the only people that actually entertain the notion that LeBron is the better defender are the deluded stans on this sub, everyone else recognises it as being an absolutely ludicrous suggestion. MJ was better, period."
"Either way I'm guarding Wallace because of the two of them Pippen is the better offensive player. Of the two of us I'm the worse defensive player. So I take the ""easy"" defensive assignment. (I still get killed)   Jordan was a better defender than James is. He's fully capable of guarding Pippen. On the defensive side I'll still take Jordan and his near psychotic need to destroy his opponents over LeBron."
"James and Jordan both average the same amount of blocks. Lebron is flat out a better defender than Jordan. More versatile and a better perimeter defender even. I used to say Jordan was the better perimeter defender, but after looking into and watching prime Jordan games and prime Lebron games, Lebron is slightly better."
LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
"Sorry bud, but only LeBron James aka the GOAT makes the perfect basketball play EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. He is the only one allowed to have basketball IQ. That's why he is the chosen one.   Just kidding everybody. Don't get any ideas"
"This guy's videos of himself are getting more-and-more annoying and obnoxious every time.  When did this happen? When did a guy who was on the path to becoming the greatest NBA player of all time turn into an attention-seeking teenage girl with an instagram account? Dude has become completely delusional and lost all sense of self-awareness.  And there is a blurry line between ""confident and secure enough with oneself to be silly/not-so-serious"" and just looking and acting like a damn fool.  I get it. He's a great dad. He's a quirky/funny/silly guy. Ok, cool story.  Can't wait until this opinion isn't unpopular and everyone is sick of his obnoxious social media presence.  Edit: Before your knee-jerk reaction to cuss me out or talk shit about me, ask yourself how you'd feel about some of his obnoxious videos if he wasn't world famous super athlete LeBron James, and he was just some regular person.   Like that famous anecdote:  When you see a crazy homeless guy, you call him crazy.  When you see a crazy millionaire, you call him eclectic."
Cause it’s LeBron James. Gotta analyze every single thing he does
"He's LeBron James man.  That being said, this is a good leak of iPhone 23"
"Rockets fans are stuck in 2014 when Harden had a case for MVP that wasn't ""my team is shit and look how good I am"", so?  I probably shouldn't have opened with that, because there's a serious answer to your point and that probably pissed you off - but that was your goal as well, no? The point is that the moment LeBron comes up then the average fan will jizz himself, the media will praise everything about him hoping James Senpai will tweet back at them, and so on... while mere mortals like Curry/Harden/Westbrook have to go so far above and beyond what is sane to be given something that can remotely be in the league of that superstar credit.  Seriously though, you think that Harden, Curry, and the rest of the non-LeBron (and after the championships, sometimes KD) players get the same credit he does for doing something as (or more) amazing?"
"Are you saying you want the best basketball team using your criteria?  In that case,  PG - Kenny Lofton (MLB) (won't use Jordan for MLB, that would be cheap)  SG - Mike Conley Sr (Track and Field)  SF - Tony Finau (Golf)  PF - LeBron James (NBA)  C - Tony Gonzalez (NFL)  It would be a somewhat undersized team, but it has to be since it's hard to find tall players playing other sports (they would have just stuck with basketball).  I think this team could be kinda competitive, in it's prime it definitely crushes any college basketball team, maybe the Hornets lol."
I would absolutely take a player with Deandre Jordan's efficiency if they scored 20 points a game over Lebron James. That would be it would be a player that was getting 10-13 offensive rebounds a game and putting them back in the bucket. That would represent a HUGE boost to any team.
what has patrick beverly ever accomplished to talk to Lebron James? Foh bum
 &gt;LeBron James  The guy that let Jason Terry outscore him in the Finals? Only averaging 3 shots owed game in the 4th quarter of the Finals?
"&gt; You linking an article from a month away from the 2012 season means nothing.  Lol it means everything. No superstar was under more scrutiny than Lebron James in the summer of 2011. And yet, he was still recognized as the best player in the league."
"Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, LeBron James, Larry Bird"
"On top of this, not many contenders will have the cap space to sign AD next season. I doubt he signs with the Raptors or Hawks when he can stay in LA with LeBron James."
So you'd take DeAndre jordan over LeBron James. 66%  to 50%?  Shaq couldn't handle a bigger workload anymore. If he could they would have fed him more. There was a reason he only took 13 shots a game and not 19+ anymore.  Also true shooting that year is .577 for Wade and .586 for Shaq. Almost identical. The guy with the same shooting with a bigger workload and scoring more is carrying the team. And Shaq missed 1/4 of the season. Can't carry a team like that
"I remember the arguments in the youtube comments. Lebron was always ranked ahead of Kobe by most people because he averaged more points, rebounds, and assists. It was a blowout Kobe had no legs.   It's true that Stephen A. and Skip chose Kobe over James after the 2011 Finals. But it's also true that the ESPN analysts voted Lebron as the best player in the league after those finals: https://www.espnfrontrow.com/2011/10/espn-coms-nba-player-rankings/  The 2011 Finals was such a failure in the first place *because* Lebron was the clear cut best player in the game. And he still was despite losing that series that was a failure on his part."
"Jason Kidd didn't 'stop' Lebron by daring him to shoot he 'stopped' him by timing his flops to draw charges on Lebron. Lebron was a good shooter in 2011 he was literally the best 3 point shooter in that Finals making more 3s in that series than Dirk. He shot 32% on 5 attempts per game, and without [these end of quarter heaves](https://streamable.com/shpkd) he shot 35% on 3s in that Finals.  I know it's tempting to use narratives to explain things but at least watch that series properly. The Mavs definitely weren't daring James to shoot they crowded him."
"If you want to do the whole like ""team has 5 lower level all stars who gel well together"" thing then sure you could open it up to like 20 dudes, if you mean like as a legitimate #1 clear cut lead alpha dog, then it's probably like 6 dudes.   Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo"
"In all fairness, OP started this by asking Ryan Anderson vs Lebron James."
I’ll mark my choices  (Trae Young) or De’Aaron Fox  (Devin Booker) or Donovan Mitchell  (Kawhi Leonard) or LeBron James  (Kristaps Porzingis) or Blake Griffin  Embiid or (Jokic)
"They had LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard"
"1. Kawhi Leonard 2. LeBron James 3. Danilo Gallinari 4. Jimmy Butler 5. Bojan Bogdanovic/Khris Middleton/Rudy Gay/Josh Richardson     my controversial take, Dano over Butler.  5th I feel like is pretty open, LeBron will be one year older."
"That’s because of fans like yourself and the insufferable fucking clown show NBA media circus which places this insane expectation of “ring or bust” on every star player to ever lace up sneakers on an NBA court.  As T-Mac famously said “anyone can get a ring in the right circumstance (team), not everyone can get into the Hall of Fame”. Mic drop.  Judging by your logic, you’re gonna look back in revisionism 10 years from now and claim that Harden, Lillard, Giannis, etc are all losers if they can’t win rings as the 1st option on a team. Because it’s really on them if their FO can’t surround them with talent right?  So what, you would prefer Harden and Lillard jump ship and return to their hometown teams and team up with Steph/Klay, LeBron/AD, Kawhi/PG in order to stack the deck, right? That wouldn’t be a problem that they are trying to circumvent competition for the sake of jewelry eh?  Because all that matters it that these guys don’t suffer the legacy of being “losing stat stuffers” and getting the Charles Barkley/Reggie Miller treatment on TNT for an NBA broadcast circa 2032?  The Knicks/Nets dynamic is a terrible example. The Nets won the KD/Kyrie sweepstakes because they *also* happen to be in NYC while not being owned by James Dolan.  Talk to me when Indiana or Milwaukee get a chance to upstage NY/Brooklyn for a star free agent. Talk to me when Portland or Sacramento can beat out the LA teams or the Warriors."
"2011?  Nope.  Last season Kobe had the edge on Lebron was 2007-08.  Then Lebron just made a giant leap from 2008-09.  That season I remember people starting to figuring out the truth when Jerry West said the famous ""Lebron James has surpassed Kobe as a player"".  Nobody expected that from West  Since 2008-09 Lebron put himself above everybody else."
"&gt;  you’re the only person on planet earth I’ve ever met that blames Lebron for leaving Cleveland.  what...I wasn't doing that  &gt; People would literally hate on JJ Barea  no...what a dumb comment. lebron is the most scrutinized athlete ever. He gets criticized for the dumbest shit, like an insta post or a tweet  It's like how KD got less hate for joining a 73-9 team than bron did for joining a 47 win team. People care more cause it's bron. Your barea comment is dumb  &gt; LITERALLY LEBRON JAMES HIMSELF SAID IT DUDE.  another dumb comment. It was a pep rally for HIS OWN FANS IN MIAMI. He didn't say he guaranteed 8 rings.  yes I actually watched back then unlike all the kids here. People didn't throw in the towel and view them as an unbeatable team. They did in the summer of 2010, but that quickly changed when their first season began"
"""LeBron James is more than a person, or a player. He is a movement and symbol.""  Or some bullshit like that."
"I’m convinced that you were not even a basketball fan during this time. Wtf is this take lol you’re the only person on planet earth I’ve ever met that blames Lebron for leaving Cleveland. Even Cleveland fans are okay with it now. It was because he made a superteam and declared he would win 7 rings. People would literally hate on JJ Barea if he did something like that man, idk what this “it’s because it’s Lebron” thing is you keep saying. Just like if KD had gone anywhere but Golden State people wouldnt have cared nearly as much.   And yes, people were saying the Heat were unbeatable when he joined them. LITERALLY LEBRON JAMES HIMSELF SAID IT DUDE."
Nobody else in history?  LeBron James
"My top 10: Micheal Jordan Lebron James (2nd right now) Kareem Abdul Jabbar Larry bird Kobe Bryant Magic Johnson Shaq Wilt Chamberlain(If he would have played today,he'd be higher) Bill Russell (Gotta give some credit, the guy has so many rings) Tim Duncan"
"Counterpoint - if I'm anthony davis at that point, I definitely stay. You know for a fact that other players want to play in LA, and the Clippers already have a full roster that they won't make major changes to. It'll be much easier to recruit teammates to LA than almost any other franchise.  Another consideration is branding. The money that AD will make being in the LA market is far greater than being in most of the other ones. He'll notice that for sure.  But most importantly, I stay if I'm AD because if Lebron has another down year, he's still going to be Lebron James. Lebron James on a down year is still a fantastic playmaker and can make me look really good. AND the media narrative will be about how I'VE taken over as the primary star of the franchise and Lebron is playing second fiddle to me. I get all of the credit for being the main guy while being supplemented by one of the best teammates out there.  It's very possible the Lakers don't win a championship in 2020, but now I have laid the groundwork for the city to adore me for deciding to stay anyway, already have a star teammate in Lebron, can more easily recruit other stars to a big market, and get the benefit of the money that comes in from a big market. AD has got it made."
"Yes, matchups are a thing. Since 2015 the Raptors are 9-0 in the playoffs vs. all teams that do not contain Lebron James.   They would've wiped that Celtics team off the floor and I say that as someone that thinks Casey is as incompetent as it gets in the playoffs. That would've been way too much collective talent to overcome.   9-0. Lebron was always the issue, not other teams."
"&gt; If Lebron never won a single ring, he would still arguably the GOAT? That's preposterous.  Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.  LeBron didn't become a better player because he teamed up with Bosh and Wade, he just had more team success due to things that have nothing to do with how good of a player LeBron James is.  LeBron traded Anderson Varejao and Mo Williams for Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.  That's not LeBron being a better player, that's the same LeBron in new circumstances.  If LeBron had the same individual career path, developed into exactly the same beast that he is, but he was stuck on teams with no second option for his whole career, that would not diminish who he is as a player at all.  It would only make him look worse to ""Rings Erneh"" morons."
&gt; I don’t see anyone posting a mixtape from a boy’s basketball team of someone who is excelling at their sport that will likely play in the NBA and be a world class basketball player. This isn’t about basketball. This post is political.  Was the last LeBron James jr. post that long ago?  It''s not political until you make it so dude. It's just a girl who can ball.
Lebron James and Danny Glover
Tank for Lebron James Jnr  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Maybe get a bunch of underrated international stars. Worked for the Spurs.
"That's not my point man. Lebron may be the first player to take control of his career rather than be a chess piece for a GM, but in terms of being on superteams, he's not even close to the first guy.   Julius Erving and Moses Malone, 2 MVP players, played on the same team together with 2 other all-stars like the Warriors. Then when Moses left Charles Barkley was added to the team.  Kareem and Magic, 2 MVP players, played together in the 80s with James Worthy a 3rd all-star.  Shaq, Kobe, Eddie Jones, and Nick Van Excel all played together on the same team that's 4 all-stars.     KG, Pierce, and Allen; Westbrook, Durant, Harden; Hakeem, Barkley, and Pippen, Duncan, Parker, Ginobli, and Kawhi, Kareem and Oscar, etc. So many superteams that were constructed through trades, free agency, and/or drafting. Lebron didn't invent superteams. What he invented is player's making these decisions and organizing the superteams themselves rather than the general managers."
"you don't have to imagine, you just have to look at yourself in the mirror. what i stated is straight facts, i didn't make shit up i simply said what happened. everything lebron does is magnified is because hes lebron fucking james and nobody knows this better than lebron james himself. he's not just some star player, he is the best fucking player in the world some would argue the best of all time. why you think he was willing to take in all that backlash from that heat team because if he didn't win a bunch of championships his legacy woulda been fucked. he is not even just ""joining up with others"", his moves when you look at the big picture its incredibly well planned out. just look at the past season, AD signs with lebrons agent, AD magically requests trade to lakers midseason as soon as lakers trended to miss the playoffs. he has a long history of this shit, not only this but coaching, playstyle, roster changes, contracts. the amount of influence he had and he put on the league himself is unprecented. if you don't see any of it then you just lack basic common sense. i've been a lebron james hater all my life but regardless  of that i'd never admired, respected an athlete more than this guy, every time we played him i accepted the loss before the game even started. i realized why i hated this guy because he just continued to prove me wrong for two fucking decades. this guy has been dealing with a massive amount of pressure since he was in fucking middle school to be the next great one off of just raw talent at 10 years old and he became just that not because of his talent but because of his genius. many players dominate the league for a few years and fall off, a few even had more talent than he had himself. beating KG's celtics by himself that is lebron james pure fucking talent, outlasting dwade by 10 fucking years by making his game as easy as possible and getting a top 10 player in chris bosh to play center to be a role player that is his pure fucking genius."
"Every player needs help, no matter how good they are individually. People expecting that there are players good enough to win it alone are foolishly misguided. Jordan had help, LeBron's had help, Kareem had help, and all of these guys failed when they didn't. Nobody can do it alone. And it's not a question of just having one or two really good teammates either, you need a good *team* around them, and that includes solid role players. You can't just say ""I'll give you LeBron and Wade and 13 G-Leaguers and expect them to win"" because they won't.  I don't know why so many people in this sub think a good roster comes down to solely who are the stars on it, but that's clearly what people seem to believe. The 2001 Lakers were one of the greatest teams of all time and the only people even remotely considered ""stars"" were Shaq and Kobe, the whole rest of the team was just solid role players. People say James Harden can drag a team of anybody to the playoffs are totally discounting how good Houston's supporting cast is, just like people are totally ignoring just how bad Golden State's is.   You need stars to win, of course, but you need at least 5-6 other players on the roster to be quality role players too. If you don't have that, you're not gonna do shit."
"Ok got it. Lebron is a good person who has done a lot of charitable work so we should not make jokes at his expense as it diminishes what he has done, as well as attacks his character. One could say it even hurts him financially, physically, emotionally and spiritually.   We should all refrain from making jokes about a comment Lebron made only a couple weeks ago. And we should refrain from making jokes about his hair (or lack thereof). And we definitely should refrain about making jokes about him trying to trademark the common phrase ‘taco tuesday’.   We should also refrain from making any jokes about Bill Gates as he has donated the most money this year. No Bill Gates jokes because it diminishes what he’s done to help mankind. Got it r/NBA????? We need this sub to be productive towards Lebron James ability to donate.  Edit: also, no more Chance the Rapper jokes about loving his wife, okay!?? As a fellow Chicagoan I know first hand how much charitable work he has done for the south side. Oooh I love my wife, I love my wife. Igh."
"He donated 2 million and the taxes pay 8 total over the next 5 years.   I fail to see an issue.  &gt;""This school would not have happened without the partnership with LeBron James,"" said district Treasurer Ryan Pendleton."
"you can't just trademark common phrases because you like to say them and want to be the only person to make money off of them...that's not how it works lol.  If you want to trademark common words/phrases, they have to have a distinguishable meaning completely separate from the original common interpretation, and that's usually associated with companies that sell goods/services.  There's a reason why Lebron James got memed for trying to trademark Taco Tuesday."
"But Steph isn't going around telling Kawhi Leonard or LeBron James ""the next five years are mine."""
We don’t wanna hear it. We kill James harden and Kawhi and LeBron for losing even because of injuries
"Zach Harper of The Athletic.  Lakers:  &gt;The Los Angeles Lakers mostly look good after the first week. They couldn’t hang for an entire 48 minutes with the Clippers, but that’s not a big deal this early in the season. The odd thing that has come out of their first three games is the balance of play calls within their offense. In the game against the Clippers, Frank Vogel’s team had 25 post-up possessions (ending in a shot, free throw, or turnover) and 20 pick-and-roll plays. The Lakers really tried to flex their muscles when it came to their size advantage over their neighbors. Then it swung the completely opposite way in Game 2 when the Lakers ran the Jazz out of the building. The Lakers ran 33 PnR possessions and just 13 post-ups, which makes sense considering the Jazz like to have Rudy Gobert sticking around the rim.  &gt;In the Charlotte game, we saw roughly a breakdown of 24 PnR to 14 post-ups. I wonder if the Clippers scared the Lakers out of the back-to-the-basket style of play because it stagnated them so much. The PnR is clearly where LeBron James needs to be operating when he’s so skilled at scoring and delivering the ball in that situation. Anthony Davis is a great post-up option, obviously, but nobody can touch him in the PnR as a roller. And he’s a good enough shooter for the pick-and-pop action.  &gt;It feels like Vogel would rather run the ball through the post, but they need to struggle with making sure they’re operating in the PnR a lot more often. If they give that a steady diet, the offense will be virtually unstoppable, as long as guys are knocking down the open looks on the perimeter it will force the defense to allow."
"""We were roommates, Paul Pierce Camp roommates, LeBron James Camp roommates,"" Beverley said of his long friendship with the Warriors' star.

LeBron James defied NBA rules and once brought a young boy - a victim of a capitalistic society who refused to allow the boy to make a living at a factory - to the Los Angeles Lakers bench to sit with the players and filled out job applications for him throughout the game.
"Lebron James net worth : $480 million.  Slaps his name on someone else's project, donates 600k,  and then lets the entire world know it and does TV interviews with cameras following him around the school.  Lebron only cares about Lebron.  Just like he cared about his checks RE:Hong Kong."
"By 'some shoes', do you mean $600,000USD?  From [this NYTimes Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/education/lebron-james-school-ohio.html)    *""The school’s $2 million budget is funded by the district, roughly the same amount per pupil that it spends in other schools. But Mr. James’s foundation has provided about $600,000 in financial support for additional teaching staff to help reduce class sizes, and an additional hour of after-school programming and tutors.""*"
He already tried this though that one off-season a few years ago.  https://www.eonline.com/fr/news/581856/inside-lebron-james-dramatic-weight-loss-get-the-skinny-on-why-the-nba-star-went-low-carb
"2012-13:   F: LeBron James  F: Kevin Durant C: Tim Duncan G: Kobe Bryant G: Chris Paul  Everyone plays defense, shot creation and playmaking for days, and a lot more spacing than older first teams."
"He factors in their play thus far as well as how he sees them projecting over the course of the season. Here's his write-up on Golden State.  &gt;After the Golden State Warriors lost the first game by having the Los Angeles Clippers dominate them, I went on the Back2Back Podcast on this very site and said people didn’t need to bury the Warriors after losing to probably the best team in basketball. They aren’t going to play the Clippers 82 games in the season and things will look a lot better when they face lesser teams.  &gt;After their Sunday loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, I’m looking for my shovel. Overreacting to two games can come back to bite you, but with the Warriors in this case, their 4-through-15 on the roster is truly atrocious. That shouldn’t absolve the trio of Steph Curry, Draymond Green and D’Angelo Russell from playing better and having an impact. They also need to be better and lead these role players.  &gt;It’s more or less just trying to explain why the first two have been so bad. Marquese Chriss being on an NBA roster and starting is a stunning development after the last two seasons. The Warriors are presumably trying to make the playoffs this season. Chriss being on the floor for anything other than garbage time is crazy. Well, I guess so far, the Warriors have essentially had 96 minutes of garbage time in their two games. This isn’t to peg it all on Chriss, either. It’s just an example of where this roster is.  &gt;This is arguably the worst set of role players I’ve ever seen put around All-Stars. At least in Cleveland, when LeBron James lead that team in 2007 to the NBA Finals, those guys could play defense. These Warriors gave up 30 or more points in the first seven quarters, before the Thunder’s third stringers failed to score more than 15 in the fourth quarter."
"Yeah its really weird. You have to hit the morally correct thing 100% of the time or everything else you've done up until that point has been a sham.  &amp;#x200B;  Like I got downvoted for saying this doesn't bankrupt dude and that its not just ""lul when its easy to say something of course he does"". Nobody became a fucking LeBron James fan and bought his gear because he called Trump a bum. People who didn't like basketball still don't like basketball and LBJ saying trumps a bum, or saying BLM, and so on doesn't change that."
Lebron James
"I get what you're saying and I agree on the timeline.  But at the same time, I think the point OP is making is that people were so quick to discount the difficulty of what other superstars did in the past when they were doing it, because they were unwilling to give them credit in comparison to Steph Curry in a perfect situation.  It is NOT easy to carry a team without other threats. That's very special. I'm not sure Steph is capable of it. That's something that only a LeBron James, James Harden, Russell Westbrook can do. Players that are an entire system unto themselves. They're sturdier and stronger and can by sheer force of will bend an opposing team. They are just as generational talents as a Curry with his sharpshooting when he's open. They can't shoot 3s like Curry can but Curry also can't carry a team like they can."
"They won 1 of those championships against Lebron James, Tristan Thompson, Imam Shumpert, JR Smith, Matthew Dellavedova, Timofey Mozgov, James Jones.    The other 2 were with 2 MVPs, 1 DPOY, 4 All-Stars.  This is as if Tim Duncan signed with Shaq and Kobe after they just won their first championship in 2000."
LeBron James will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies
"This sub when LeBron filed to trademark Taco Tuesday:  &gt; Yah his media/social media persona really does come off as super fake and contrived imo. But everyone always eats it up like ‘eyy there goes good old goofy relatable king James, DAE lebron is a superstar but still just a regular dorky dad???’ Meanwhile I feel like he knows exactly what he’s doing at all times and he always just feels like so unauthentic and business like. And there are many examples also that show that he is a bit of an egomaniac (although it would be difficult for someone in his position not to be)  &gt; I’m definitely not saying he’s a bad person or anything and I understand I’m coming off as a massive hater rn but it’s just the vibe I’ve always got from him  &gt; he would make a perfect case study on narcissism  &gt; I seriously don’t get it. Everything he does is so obviously manufactured.  &gt; Always felt like their was gonna be a motive behind it, went on too long to just be random lol    https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cxw5e6/rovell_just_in_lebron_james_leaves_no_potential/"
Lebron James Tax
The lakers defense looks very dominant in spurts. Everyone is engaged - including Lebron. I haven't seen this from a Lebron James team since Miami. Very exciting!
I do not believe that LeBron James is unable to find a hotel room in Los Angeles.  There are probably few hotels in Los Angeles that he can't just purchase.
Lmaooo nobody believes Lebron fucking James is a cancerous jerk come on now
Imagine trying to find rooms when you aren't Lebron James.
"Listen man, that comment was completely justified. It's funny in hindsight but we had blown out some really good teams (including LeBron James and his Cavaliers). Unfortunately people started to take us seriously.."
"Imagine being LeBron James and not having where to crash, like literally anyone in LA would house guest you...."
"""You don't teach 6'9"" or above, you don't teach 260 or above, you don't teach that kind of ability that Anthony Davis has, being able to guard 4 different positions. You don't teach what LeBron James knows about the game of basketball to the degree that he knows it. I'm going with LeBron and AD and the Lakers, especially when Kuzma comes back."""
it has value because it’s actually in there. no other player has a cut scene like that except for him. and considering it’s lebron james be most likely orchestrated the entire scene
James Harden and Russell Westbrook having a heated discussion was newsworthy. Everytime Lebron throws his hands up on defense it's bad body language. But robot man = good.
"More than 31 years of age, dude is coming off 5 straight finals runs. That's a shitload of extra gamers in a short time span. Most guys aren't LeBron James who can handle that physical stress."

"&gt;What does this sub have to say during 2011 finals where Lebum was thoroughly outplayed by Jason terry?  I never understand why Kobetards always shit on LeBron for 11 when Kobe literally got swept by that same team AND had 04.  &gt;Or you failed to mention Lebum is 3-6 in nba finals also being swept.   Facing the greatest dynasty in modern NBA history.  &gt;This sub also fails to mention Lebron did most of his scoring on layups and dunks.   LeBron shoots higher from 3 on more attempts in reg and postseason than Kobe...  &gt;Also that Lebron played in a weaker conference his entire career until now  Bruh. How is it LeBron fault he cant control which team he was drafted to.   &gt;as well as the years Kobe went to the finals 2009 and 2010 Lebron who was the league MVP and teams were the number 1 seeds lost to Orlando and Boston.  10, there were rumours that Delonte West slept with Mama James and LeBron was so fucked mentally and emotionally he was shot full of drugs.  And blaming LeBron for 09? Seriously?   &gt;Kobe played in the toughest conference and helped lead the lakers to the finals 7 times winning 5.  With Shaq another top ten player at his peak and Phil Jackson GOAT NBA coach.   &gt;Kobe would have averaged 40 ppg for a season if he got to play eastern teams 4 times a season.  Nonsensical. LeBron dropped 51 against the Western Conference.  Kobe never scored 50 in the playoffs. Ever.  &gt;Need I go on? Kobe 7 finals appearance in a 10 year stretch going 5-2, out of a strong western conference, is just as impressive as Bron's 8 straight finals appearance, so don't even think about mentioning that my negguz.  Yes it is impressive. And lol at the last word."
LeBron James is a QB1 for the rest of the season lol
"Idk if your comment disappeared but it is the same principle. The principle being rather to embarrass yourself going through extreme lengths to keep something that is actually making you look like a circus, just go bald. It's a suggestion. That's all it is.  No one is forcing the dude into anything. I don't see shame in suggesting someone to not embarrass themselves.   If he can somehow keep it while playing, who gives a shit. If it works it works but if it's falling off while playing...let it go. You're LeBron James. You adjusting a toupee on national television and becoming a meme is not cool. It's shit on the fans part but still don't do it to yourself, big homie.  It comes from a positive place. At least for me and most of the people that upvoted me."
"Dwight Howard yelled, “There you go!” Danny Green gave a look of pleasant surprise. Anthony Davis belted, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-MLS star David Beckham hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"&gt;“You see that today with some of the players like LeBron James,” Donaghy offered. **“He doesn’t really give referees respect. He kinda demeans them and makes faces at them.** He’s a guy that is the star in the league and when he goes to the Hall of Fame, **sometimes he gets the benefit of the call because of him being a star, but sometimes referees when they’re upset they let that easy ticky-tack foul go that other referees give him when he goes to the basket. They don’t call it because of his arrogance.”**  Whoa! That's some real insight, a player pisses off a ref, the ref makes things more difficult for that player."
So he’s like LeBron James but with Rubio’s offensive skills?
"the Call was pretty cool  Tacos, LEBRON JAMES"
"Did you just start watching basketball kiddo? Let me remind you of Kevin Durant and OKC, Lebron James and Cleveland before the return, and Vince Carter w Toronto until recently."

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Stephen Curry.  .  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Curry in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Curry's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Curry, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Curry in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Curry is better.  You might be jealous of Curry's three rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Warriors fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Curry isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

KCP scoring more pts than Lebron James this game.
"Kyrie’s incredible. There’s no doubt about that. Even when he was on the Celtics though, I never once would’ve argued he’s better than Steph. More combustibly brilliant with his wizardry? At times, absolutely (and that was saying a lot, considering we’re talking Steph fucking Curry).   He’s not better than Steph Curry. Whereas the Nets lost one key piece in KD (who was never yet a piece to be compensated for in the first place, due to him never yet having played a game for them), the Warriors lost 2 major, major offensive pieces for this year (KD and Klay). That’s an adjustment, even for Steph Curry. Are we about to throw James Harden under the bus for not playing so well as of yet so far as well, using the same 3 game sample logic?  The problem with Kyrie was never his skill. It was that on his own, he didn’t tend to win as many games singlehandedly as much as his talent and hype would dictate, as opposed to players like Kawhi, Lebron, Steph, Giannis etc. Over time, he also tends to take over on high volume shot attempts, to the detriment of younger, less developed players. It’s just what he does.   He’s absolutely perfect for the Nets as a 1b once KD comes around next year. For now though, he’s gonna win a bunch of games on his own, and also lose a whole hell of a lot on his own too. Honestly, I’d still argue that Kyrie is a superior talent to Kemba, but Kemba’s definitely already a better chemistry fit for the Celtics than Kyrie ever was. As I said before though, once KD plays again, we can really assess how Kyrie is for the Nets (they’ll certainly be a top 3 East team)"

"Took 2 MVPs, 4 All-Stars, and admittedly brilliant GM and ownership maneuvering and timing of the salary cap increases.  That's what it took to defeat Lebron James.   On a side note, pay that man Chef Curry! Dray too. Klay got his already. They all deserve it."
Look at my username. We have to keep it fair. If Kawhi or harden or LeBron was shooting 40/18/100 with poor defense we would be all over them.   Then again I don’t think James harden is getting enough blame right now

"its not higher than every other star in the league and 4.3 is pretty high for someone not averaging 6+ assists a game.

LeBron has been an iron man starting every game of his career (minus that one game he gave up his spot to Varejao) going in to his 17th season.

"i like how you say he has the ""edge"" in defense like they're close.  foh.  they're light years apart on defense.  wade has the most blocks for a guard in nba history.  what james harden has an edge on with wade is offense.  harden wins on offball, ft(getting there and scoring), 3pt shooting, and iso.  wade wins on slashing, post game, mid range, and they're pretty close with passing, but wade is the flashier highlight reel passer.    also everyone is saying ""__________ can win with lebron too!"" is forgetful.  lebron is 3-6.  that's twice the Ls than Ws for the best player on the planet.  and another thing.  y'all seriously disrespecting all the other teams we had to fight through for our titles.  there weren't many easy games man.  we had to go through a strong pacers team, and nearly lost to the celtics.  the only easy match for them?  when we bopped the hell out of okc with 3 future mvps on that squad.  the next year we almost lost to the pacers again and we all know what happened with the spurs.  what i'm saying is there's absolutely no guarantee harden wins any rings at all even on the heatles."
You do with what you are given.  Harden made it to the finals once with KD and Westbrook in OKC yet got beaten down by Lebron and Wade in the finals  Yet could never go back  At least KD knew where to get his best chances and he ran away with it with 2 rings and now he's getting paid even though he won't even play this year.  Most players may never get a chance or that one chance and it never happens again.  Few get lucky like Dirk who lost the finals and most thought he never get back but he did and took his second chance and ran with it with a ring.  That window for James Harden is closing and he doesn't want to be the Dan Marino of the NBA.
Oscar Robertson/Michael Jordan/ LeBron James/ Karl Malone/ Wilt Chamberlain
"&gt;FMVP  See James Worthy, Andre Iguodala and Chauncey Billups, and Kawhi before he won his second FMVP.  Sorry these players were not held in the same rank as MVP winners.  This is why LeBron really messed up Wade's all time standing with his choke, a second FMVP would have been so huge for Wade to separate himself from the pack."
"LeBron James is the greatest offensive player of this generation, and possibly any other"
"That's completely irrelevant. We were the four seed because we had lebron fucking James, not because of Luke's sub par rotations."
"That argument is dumb. This team took this team to 7 games. While this team lost to this team in 5 games. Lmao.   I certainly believe that if both of those losing teams meet in the finals, the team where LeBron James play for wins. The Houston rockets were tailor made to beat the GSW, not the Cavs.   Also I will recognize Harden as the best player if he can lead his team to a Championship. LeBron led his team against the 73-9 team which means he is a proven talent already. Harden should prove himself first.   Actually the best player is still up for grabs this year"
"They were both the consensus \#2 picks. The only time we had a high draft pick and didn't get the consensus player was when we picked DLo over Okafor. Because our front office knows how to draft *really well*.  Kobe's last contract is the kind of thing that lured LeBron. That contract was a signal to all the superstars in the league: if you come and give LA your best effort we will reward you for it. And that didn't happen in a vacuum, we've been known for that for decades. It's why you see James Worthy on Spectrum Sportsnet after a Lakers game. It's why Ty Lue and Derek Fisher got job interviews during our coaching searches. It's why Luke Walton was hired without us really looking at anyone else. It's why we let Magic Johnson waltz in and become President of Basketball Operations without having held a similar position before.  For better or worse, the notion of the Lakers Family is a very real thing that has been carefully cultivated by the Buss family because they know that in a players' league the players need to know you will do right by them. Another example is how we let Lou Will pick which team we traded him to. He was worth more than the 27th pick from the Rockets that season, but he wanted to go to a contender and we sent him there.  I could keep going about this topic, but I think you probably get the point by now."
Because LeBron James exists
Steph Curry  Micheal Jordan  Kevin Durant  Lebron James  Shaq O'Neal  Purely for offense
For reference:  **Top 5 players by Offensive Player Impact Plus-Minus so far this season:**  - Luka Doncic: +7.4 - James Harden: +6.2 - LeBron James: +4.9 - Giannis Antetokounmpo: +4.8 - Damian Lillard: +3.9
"Yes I do want him taking the last shot for me unless I have LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard or Giannis on my team (unless I need a three to tie the game)    If I need a three to tie the game the only player I would have ahead of Harden is Curry and that’s it"
Then LeBron or Curry are the two best scorers  KD’s playoff numbers dipped just like Hardens didn’t until he joined a 73 win absolutely stacked team and even when he did that James Harden still almost beat him in 2018     Either way KD isn’t the correct answer to the best scorer of the generation
Lebron James is a festering piece of shit.
"Curry’s ability to relocate is way above anyone in the league. I would say james is way better one on one but as a offensive player, the scope is too wide to define who is the greatest. It is up to what kind of game you prefer.   KD, Lebron, Curry and Harden are all in the same bracket. Lebron, harden and KD can power through double teams much better than Curry. But personally I will take Curry for his ability to do something without the ball which is about 70% of the time(not just pick and roll). To be a threat after half court with and without the ball is really good. his ability to make use of the whole court to buy that 0.5 secs he needs to release his shot makes a big difference in a team game."
"""Dak Prescott, from my Dallas Cowboys, is a better passer than LeBron James"""
"Yeah in term of pure talent, just going by eye test, Bird has much better overall game sense compared to Magic, but many people I think put Magic above Bird because of overall accolades. I remember even Lebron James, who's being regarded as the top 2 players today, chose Bird over Magic in his top 3 back in the day.  Bird is so underrated on this sub tbh, some people don't even have him in their top 10, let alone top 5~7"
"&gt;The only person who is way above everyone else - no surprises here - is James Harden at a ridiculous 5.4 fta per drive.   He has more FTA because he takes more shots, but he’s not the most fouled if look into %.  I can’t be arsed to look into everyone but here’s some players and their percentages of getting fouls while attacking the rim:  Harden 2.7 fouls on 8.5 FGA = 32%  Fox 2.3 fouls on 7.3 FGA = 32%  Dinwiddie 1.8 fouls on 7.5 FGA = 24%  Butler 1.7 fouls on 3.7 FGA = 46%  Giannis 1.6 fouls on 4.8 FGA = 33%  Doncic 1.4 fouls on 7.0 FGA = 20%  LeBron 1.2 fouls on 5.8 FGA = 20%"
"he has shut down every critic vooce to the point that prime lebron fucking james is the only player that feels like is still above harden im this era  two years ago this sub laughed at rockets fans when they put harden as an equal to curry, now if anythingh the consensus has him above steph"
"Lmao what? The person with the highest basketball IQ probably isn’t even in the NBA. Lebron James is in the top 0.62% of height. 99.38% of people in the world are shorter than Lebron James. Isn’t it far more likely that someone with a higher basketball IQ is in the group that contains 99.38% of the population? Not to mention that Lebron James is extremely athletically gifted for someone so tall, making him naturally suited to basketball without ever considering his mind. Just listen to the guy speak, he’s a fucking moron, but you think he has the highest basketball IQ of anyone, not just in the league, not just in the entire world, but of all time!? He’s one of the best players of all time, but when it comes to the players with the best basketball IQ, chances are that the best person isn’t physically gifted enough to get much attention. Also Lebron’s hairline is receding so"
Lebron Curry and Steph James.
"Homerism? That's homerism? Criticizing a different team is homerism?  It's the riskiest trade of all time. At the time he refused to talk to the Spurs, had a mysterious camp, was coming off a major repeat injury, and you needed to trade away your best player for a one year contract. It's easily the riskiest trade of all time. The trade was you literally either win the championship or you're fucked for at least the next five years if not decade. The front office did *not* want demar gone, they needed to make a change after losing in four games to LeBron James. Demar just so happened to be the piece the Spurs wanted"
"&gt;Since masai came we have been one of the best (if not the best) organization in the league.  Since 2013 the Raptors have repeatedly been easily defeated in the playoffs every single year to the point it was the biggest meme on the sub. After a 60 win season, you lost in 4 games to LeBron James. Making one HUGELY RISKY trade for one year of a superstar coming off an injury that paid off does not make you an elite GM, it makes you a gambler. That doesn't mean it was a bad gamble, it means there was a wide array of possibilities and the best one just so happened to manifest. And now you're back to the way you were."
"Apparently, Maxi Kleber closed out to LeBron James in the dying seconds of the regulation between the Mavs and Lakers."

LeBron James has fathered the most amount of children to play for the NBA
"So in 2018 and 2019, Lebron and the Cav's managed to take 1 of 9 games from the Warriors. Meanwhile James Harden and his Rockets managed to take 3 games off of the Warriors right before they went on to sweep Lebron out of the stadium like so much dirt in 2018. I don't see how anyone could say he should've gotten FMVP both years with a straight face."
"Beyond that, he has historically and continues to lift the NBA to relevance. I'm sure the existence of Lebron James (and other true `superstars' with wide recognition beyond the sport) has a profound and unique impact on the NBA brand financially throughout the 2000's and now, so even those agents of players not related at all to him owe him some of their livelihood."
Sounds like something Tim Duncan or David Robinson would do.  And now I'm imagining LeBron James being coached by Popovich. I hate it.
"This might blow your mind.. but Jordan’s Bulls during his Finals runs were better than just about any team LeBron was ever on..  When he had no help, LeBron took his teams to Finals. Without help, Michael Jordan was swept in the first round of the playoffs.. a lot.  Getting on an international team and winning a medal isn’t really as impressive as going straight from high school to dominating the league. MJ had already played three years in college and was selected in the draft before he medaled in ‘84. To talk about winning a medal before he played in an NBA game is silly.. he played in the NBA like two months later lol.  And even with his college heroics, MJ still wasn’t considered the best prospect of his draft class.. so I’m not sure why you keep holding his college achievements as a plus.. LeBron scores more points in his rookie year in 79 games than MJ scored in his entire college career of 101 games.. in terms of being a polished basketball player.. I’m not sure anybody has ever been on the same level as LeBron James."
"I don't think that you watched the series but okay. Lebron was the clear best player but there was a case to be made for either Iggy or Curry. Curry lost. It wasn't a snub.  To get a sense of the sentiment at the time, look at this article after the first 3 games where the Cavs were 2-1 up against the league MVP without Kyrie or Love: https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/06/steph-curry-mvp-worst-nba-finals-golden-state-warriors-lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers  After game 3, Iggy took on a more prominent role and made Lebron work harder for his buckets so that Curry's scoring was more valuable. Curry's performance in the final 3 games wasn't enough to offset the poor start he had to the series. The argument came down to Iggy's elite defence vs Curry's good offence and Iggy won."
"When you're talking about generational talent you don't say that nothing has said they wont, you try to look for what says they will.   Nothing so far has said that Zion Williamson won't be better than Lebron James, but that doesnt mean should pick it"
"LeBron ""Rain Man"" James"
"Derrick Rose 100% deserved his 2011 MVP award and it's not even debatable...   Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when they both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In the 2011 season the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started &amp; finished games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered, deservedly at times, by fans &amp; writers alike for his cold shooting slumps. Taj Gibson &amp; Asik were not yet what they were going to be as NBA players. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (sometimes featuring an appearance from Luol Deng, who played through a wrist injury).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). Tim Duncan got 117 total 1st place votes for his '02 &amp; '03 MVP campaigns combined (45 #1 votes for Kidd, 43 #1 votes for KG). The only players to get more 1st place MCP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron, two seasons which are historically held up for those guys carrying their specific squads &amp; being individually incredible while doing so.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavericks behind a strong Rose performance (the other two to pull this off were Lebron/Kobe).  While Derrick was relieved to see a teammate score double digits, Lebron's teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers in his own right.  26 PPG 6.4 RPG 4.6 APG 1.5 SPG 1.1 BPG 50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable? Because he had a more aesthetically pleasing stat line? On top of fantastic production, Wade serves as a guy who can be a primary ball handler while Lebron plays off ball. Even Chalmers can play PG and take ball handling heat off Lebron. Defenses couldn't leave Bosh &amp; Wade to smother Lebron as they did Rose. The only other reliable ball handler for the Bulls, CJ Watson, played 13 MPG and rarely alongside Rose because of his inability to play the 2.  Derrick's right hand man was a defensive liability named Carlos Boozer. He missed 23 games that season and when he did play he averaged:  17.5 PPG 9 RPG 2.5 APG .3 BPG 51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level and Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG 8 RPG 2 APG .6 BPG 50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worth an MVP award. Only three players in the modern era have compiled 2,000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Michael Jordan, Lebron James &amp; Derrick Rose. No one, not even MJ and Bron, have ever done it twice. No one did it at the PG position, no one did it at 6'3"" &amp; no one did it at age 22. Except Derrick Rose.  In relation to the 2,000 point/600 assist benchmark, that's no arbitrary cutoff. Those numbers aren't carefully selected to make Derrick's season look cute next to MJ &amp; LBJ. In fact, if you decrease the cutoff significantly to both 2,000 points &amp; 500 assists the list is still absolutely elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the assist benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1,900 you add only Magic, Gary Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the Hall of Fame are currently ineligible for induction or still playing. None of those six names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cutoffs either, the 2,000/500 or 1,900/600 groups. Making the 2,000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a number 1 option in NBA history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Derrick Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season. Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than Miami's Super Friends, more than the Spurs, more than Boston who had 4 All Stars, more than the original OKC group, more than the champion Mavs, the B2B defending champ Lakers with Kobe/Pau/Phil. They also swept Lebron in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  --------------------  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. None of which include voter fatigue, media favoritism or a vendetta against Lebron. Here's some direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  ""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams and stepping it up. Leading his team on the offensive end. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  ""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  ""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night, kid's out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron James when asked to weigh in on the MVP race.  Talk of Derrick Rose winning MVP due to media bias is inaccurate. Members of the rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."

"His ""athletic limitations"" are that he's not as athletic.  I mean, at some point, you shouldn't need every obvious morsel of evidence spoon fed to you, right?    He's not as fast as guys like LeBron or MJ.  He's not in the same realm of explosiveness.  His lateral movement isn't *bad*, but he's not as quick as either of them there either.  Luka's not un-athletic, even for an NBA player (people will say that he is, but that's fairly overblown), but he's not an *elite* athlete in comparison to NBA competition either (while LeBron and MJ, for instance, are/were).  The concerns that Luka wasn't athletic enough to make it in the NBA were obvious hogwash to anyone who actually bothered to watch him, but it's something that is worth bringing up in comparison to guys who are the best ever.  So to rehash: athleticism is not just physical attributes.  Even a cursory watch of any NBA game film will tell you that Luka Doncic does not possess the same quickness or explosiveness that LeBron and MJ have/had.  That is going to put a bit of a ceiling on Luka's eventual defensive prowess.  Doesn't mean he can't eventually become REALLY good on that end, but DPOTY type guys are generally either incredible, defensive scheme enabling big men or *very* athletic, smart wings.    And can we just stop for a moment and realize how hilarious it is that you really felt you needed specific answers to why Luka Doncic is less athletic than LeBron James or MJ?  Like...wow.  I'm still stunned that I had to type any of this out."
I strongly dislike it when LeBron James faces the Wizards because I genuinely think he just likes destroying us.
"And then when his teams are shitty af like last year, LeBron stans say” Look he’s being forced to carry such a shitty team!” You LeBron stans will glorify anything Chairman James does"
The TT contract was not due to LeBron james. The Cavs were capped out so they could either pay TT or lose him for nothing and not be able to replace him except with a vet min player. And since the Cavs won a championship with TT having a huge role the decision was the right one. Same thing with JR. They don't win that ring if either of those guys are vet minimum players.
The on/off are very noisy right now as Nate says. It tells you that Trae's been not good on defense but it not be that bad. Look at the on/off ranking for offense by RAPTOR as of now. Here's the top 10  1. Jabari Parker  2. CJ McCollum  3. LeBron James  4. Pascal Siakam  5. Evan Fournier  6. Trae Young  7. Jakob Poeltl  8. Dwight Powell  9. Bojan Bogdanovic  10. Ben McLemore   It's way too early to rank by on/off ratings.
You know there’s a non-white guy playing right now that averages just a little bit more than what Larry averaged.   His name is Lebron fucking James. So yea I think Larry is up there in good company just fine on basketball skill alone
"In a recent Simmons pod with Steve Kerr, they both said KD dominated LeBron on 2017.   Switch teams; James to Warriors and KD to the Cavs. Do the Cavs even make the Finals? Likely not.   LeBron has typically done more with less than any other player."
https://www.slamonline.com/nba/lebron-james-told-raptors-run-plays-game/  It gets much worse than that. He was coaching the raptors while playing against them in the ECF...

LeBron James + scrubs &gt; Celtics Roster. Not really a better roster. Deeper but not better.
"In other words, agents of non-Lebron James players really wish their players were as powerful as Lebron James"
LeBron James is
Defensive stopper that still got lit up by Lebron? Then got lit up by Kd in 2016?  &gt;Locks down the best players   Then why does he guard PJ Tucker and not James Harden?
"It's okay. I'm like that with LeBron and the Lakers. Obviously I don't know him personally, I hear that he's a great father and friend, but I just never liked how he carried himself as a player in the first major part of his career, the whole King James and all before he was even an NBA champion. But oh well."
"Yea. While staring deep into bron bron’s stormy eyes and thinking about his sexy, sexy receding hairline, thoughts of Taco Tuesday popped into my head. Unable to handle the thoughts of raw human desire dancing through my mind I came, half-screaming, half-moaning “GOAT” at the top of my lungs. My father, as a former Cavs fan who had previously liked lebron but was disillusioned since he left, had heard me. He sprinted down the stairs to the basement. My father, in his dispair at the current state of the Cleveland Cavaliers had jumped ship to the rockets fan base. “SHUT YOUR ASS UP!” He yelled “THIS IS A HARDEN HOUSEHOLD!”. Unwilling to accept the blasphemy I was hearing I couldn’t contain myself “Bandwagon, you betrayed our one true god.” I mumbled. As the words left my lips, I saw rage on his face. He grabbed his favorite set of jumper cables and beat me silly with them while screaming “JAMES HARDEN IS THE GOAT! EFFICIENCY AND POSSESSION RATE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED!” I took the beating quietly, thoughts of my one true love, LeBron James, keeping me resilient.  Projection. I’m not a lebron fan lmfao"
But do teams around the league not do this with their franchise guys? Is Golden State not going to try to put the best players they can around Steph? Have the Rockets not tried multiple players around Harden and got rid of guys that didn't fit around him? Why wouldn't the Lakers try to do the same thing? The real tragedy is to get Lebron James and then NOT put pieces around him that play into his strengths.
"So. You post from 2011 - now. You realize he came into the league in 2003 right lol. I would argue in 2007 he should have had it over Kobe in the sense that Lebron posted better averages but Kobe had just reached 20k points and was on the best team in the league so I get it. In hindsight, the Lakers losing to the Celtics makes it easier to say that Lebron should have that one. He got MVP in 08 and 09 by clearly being the best player in the league. And I think 2010 shouldn't have gone to Rose but to James imo. In hindsight it should have went to Dirk. So those are where I would give him MVPs, I wouldn't take a single one away from Curry, Durant, WB, Harden or Giannis these past few years though and this year right now Lebron is the MVP no question."
"Naaah. James Harden, Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook and Giannis all deserved it these past few years. Just because he has sustained excellence doesn't mean he was the most excellent that given year. Michael Jordan has 5 MVPs and Jerry Rice didn't lead the NFL in receiving more often than he did. He's one of the greatest. Why do people get offended when other people are getting shine other than Lebron? It's ridiculous. That's how you get backlash. Hell, just seeing this already makes me feel a certain way and I don't want to because James is great but damn."
The Lebron James special
"You can make an argument for any of them he didn't win becuase he had been the best player in the world. The only one I think he deserved that he didn't get looking back at it is his final year in Cleveland.  Harden Averaged 30 Points, 8 Assists, and 5 Rebounds. His team finished 65-17; First in the West.   LeBron Averaged 28 Points, 9 Assists, and 8 Rebounds. His team finished 50-32; 4th in the East.  In my opinion LeBron put up better stats on a way worse team. Kevin Love was the only person to put up over 15 Points other than LeBron. LeBron didn't have a PG who could give even 5 Assists beside himself. Looking at the players on the team now we don't think the team was very bad, but that team was garbage. Kevin Love and Isaiah Thomas we're the only decent players on that team.  I remember watching and seeing highlights and that Cavs team literally was carried every. single. night. by LeBron James. On the other hand the Rockets were great. Harden had two teammates score over 15 a game in CP3 and Eric Gordon. He also didn't have to take responsibility to run the entire offence as much as LeBron did becuase he had a legit PG in CP3 who got 8 Assists per game. Harden also had a big guy that was playing like one of the best defenders in the league. Capella got 2 blocks and a steal per game, LeBron never got this from Thompson. When I remember watching LeBron that year I remember him having to carry, on this team completely different. With D'Antoni's system anyone on that team could drop 20. They played easy and they shot alot of threes. Harden had the opportunity to take plays off and have his teammates make shots, when LeBron needed a rest he would have to pick the times carefully.   Overall I think that if Harden had Averaged 29.9 points or finished 2nd in the West that LeBron would've had this MVP easily. It was really frustrating at the time becuase nobody would even bring it up as a legit conversation topic. They would immediately say something like "" yeah he is playing good, but the Cavs suck"". If that Cavs team didn't have LeBron they would've gotten a top 3 pig easy."
"Here is the full quote within the context of the article. Mannix isn't bashing LeBron. He's saying he's challenging to work with, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.   &gt;James is the NBA’s most powerful player, the face of the league’s marquee franchise in the second year of a four-year, $153 million contract he signed in 2018. Lakers GM Rob Pelinka has admitted that he consulted James on roster moves this summer; player agents have grumbled that no one could get on the Lakers without James’s approval. James is an attention magnet—the worldwide reaction to James’s response to the kerfuffle between the NBA and China offering a recent example—but when it comes to coaching him, several coaches who have worked with James tell SI, the key is simple: Be as prepared as he is.  &gt;Amongst coaches, James’s professionalism stands out. He isn’t late for meetings. For buses. For flights. He studies opponents intensely. “And he knows if you are not as prepared as him,” says a former assistant coach. “He has a real bullshit meter.” With James, respect for coaches is earned. “Is he easy to coach? No,” says Richard Jefferson, a teammate of James for two seasons in Cleveland. “Was Kobe Bryant the best teammate? No. But guys like that, their job is not to be easy to coach or be the best teammate. Their job is to go out there and be competitive. A great player will challenge a coach.”  I know people won't read full articles on here, but at least read the couple paragraphs for context before attacking Mannix."
"""agents unhappy that LeBron James is LeBron fucking James."""
Lebron James is the reason why Love stopped playing in the post
"Lets just forget that James Harden averaged 30/5/9 on a Houston Rockets team that went 65-17. In addition, he had all the narratives going for him as he had been heavily in contention for two previous MVP's. But no, lets give it to LeBron after he finished 4th in a painfully awful Eastern Conference. Apparently thats not a deal breaker because he had a shit roster. There has clearly never been a player putting up all-time great numbers on a bad team.   Death, Taxes and LeBron stans being absolutely fucking unbearable."

They are clear title favorites at this point. You cant ask for a better position than to be the top 1 seed in the NBA with lebron freaking James and AD in your squad. It is really hard to fuck that up.
"**USA TEAM**: Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis  **World TEAM:** Luka Dončić, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Pascal Siakam, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid  Team world loses in 5, maybe 6. Team USA has 5 top 10 players, meanwhile team World has 3-4 top 10 players. It's closer than most think."
"Yeesh so you fell for the narrative that year too? Yikes man.   Like, if all you do is google “LeBron James Derrick rose 2011” you’ll get a bunch of articles acknowledging that LeBron James should’ve been the MVP. And you can go on and on about how they weren’t the first seed, but just about any way of measuring player success shows LeBron was better."
"Players with a legitimate argument over Derrick Rose in 2011. For the record I think Rose or Dwight deserved it.  * Dwight Howard: 23 ppg, 14 rpg 2+ bpg. Orlando had 52 wins, Dwight was the DPOY.  * LeBron James: 27 ppg, 8 rpg and 7 apg, Miami had 57 wins but he also had 2 all star teammates. I think as good or better than Rose but the all star teammate narrative hurts.  * Dirk Nowitzki: 23 ppg, 7 rpg 3 apg on 52/39/89. Dallas had 57 wins, but was 2-7 in the 9 games he missed with injury. If he doesn't go down, Dallas likely wins 64 games and is the 1st seed in the West.  * Kevin Durant: 28 ppg, 7 rpg 3 apg, OKC was 55-27."

"I think mid seed playoffs and him maintaining these numbers.  If lakers have 1 seed and LeBron somehow keeps up his D, which I’m skeptical he can do the entire regular season, he could sneak away with it.

"He (LeBron James) spent more time in China this summer than in any previous offseason, Xi Jinping says. He was a regular at the Beijing facility. Muslims recall James walking around the concentration camps, mumbling: Gotta get money."
"Finals teams come out and step on a bad team's neck, that's my point.  Teams that don't play like that usually don't make it that far unless they're being carried by Lebron James."
its lebron james he was probably born with a 6 pack
The Bucks have played the Cavaliers without LeBron James
"situation A: let's say some bum checks into the game. but he checks into the game as the same time as lebron james also checks into the game!  situation B: an equally bum-like bum checks into the game. but he checks in as lebron james *exits* the game.  both bums could play equally well. chances are, the bum in situation A is going to have a better +/- because they get to play alongside lebron james"
Lebron James
LeBron James. I forget hes human
So? They ain’t LeBron James. No one is able to perform at the same level at 17th yrs as what LeBron does.
maybe it's not a good idea to bet against LeBron James
"Best way to pick teams to root for is watching a bunch and figuring out who you think is the most fun. I happen to love the raptors because they play great defense, and great offense most of the time, and they’re just intense and fun to watch. I’ve also been a fan for like 6 years though, and they’re my home team, so it makes sense that I’d say that.  Other great options are the Lakers (watch Lebron James - he’s arguably the best player to have ever played the game), the clippers, the bucks. Younger, scrappier teams are great because of the energy they tend to play with.  Watching the knicks or hornets will make you want to watch more engaging sports, like golf, or perhaps the sport of grass growing."
It’s funny that Luke Walton and Lebron James were in the same draft. Walton has been coaching for five years (with a stint before that) already.
He plays the same position as Lebron James. Cp3 didn’t have the same competition at the position till later in their careers. Kind of an obviously misleading way to compare them.  I’m talking about the actual MVP votes. Go look at the MVP voting Melos name is in there just as much as CP3s from like 2006-on.
Cause every team has no possible way of stopping Kareem and Shaq or Kareem and Wilt on the floor. Baylor + big game James do deserve minutes yes. But LeBron and Magic working with Kareem and Shaq is too...overpowering.  Duncan and Robinson would have no way either. Kareem and Giannis vs. Kareem and Shaq would be funny though.

" That's no surprise. He's on the third axis of transcendence right now. Kyrie Irving moves in anti-planar reality (or prime-planar reality, shouts to my qmech nerds who really buy Frisch-Hayes.) While guards like Mike Conley or Chris Paul see the game from an x and o perspective, Kyrie has vision of the omega and delta factors surrounding any given basketball event. There's a reason Kyrie was able to lead LeBron James to the 2016 Finals. Put simply, Irving is visuospatial jazz. Think of Ornette Coleman or George St. Breux, not Goran Dragic or PatBev. The dorian stylings of a Eric Dolphy better describe Irving's game than a monotone listing-off of conventional basketball skills. Ball handles? When you're in constant tune with the precise Hz pitch of the hardwood like Irving, English words like ""good handles"" cannot encapsulate even a fractoid of the scientific and metaphysical majesty of Kyrie."

But your original argument was ""Cleaning staff doesn't get rings fam"", and when you were demonstrated to be wrong, you doubled down and shifted the goalposts to ""What I meant was that they didn't give the cashier at the hot dog stand the same exact million dollar piece of jewelry as Lebron fucking James"". Nobody was arguing that."

Real story - Agent Rich Paul (who reps LeBron James) recruiting KD
"L - Lebron James A - Anthony, Carmelo K- Kyrie"
Harden has learned how to play to curry the refs favor. he knows exactly what they'll call and how to sell it. Its unbelievable. Lebron used to get a ton of foul calls becuase of his physicality. James just knows exactly how to initiate contact to force the refs hand to call fouls. 
"Why aren't they comparable?   The fact that you say LeBron is arguable tells me you aren't weighing the postseason into this very heavily. LeBron, unarguably, is a better scorer than James Harden on the most difficult stages."
"He was apparently angry then the Heat let go of Mike Miller. And when Lebron left Cleveland he brought him along with him and James Jones too. So based on that those two guys.  Lebron willingly left Bosh, Wade, Love, Jr, Chalmers, Korver, and Mo Williams.  Although obviously Lebron still has a strong personal friendship with Wade, JR, Love, Williams, Kyrie, and possibly Chalmers and Korver too."

"I mean yeah dude if your injured players were in the game things would have been entirely different, that doesn't take away from anything that I've said. The game was winnable by the Rockets that were actually playing, and it was lost because of mistakes made by the Rockets that were actually playing. Responding to that by saying ""they wouldn't have been there if Player X, Y, and Z weren't injured"" has nothing to do with my point. The Hawks would win all their games if they had LeBron James and Kevin Durant but they're not in Atlanta so there's not really any point in bringing it up. See what I'm saying?"

"He is in my eyes, but idiots will say some shit like "" he played against 6""6 white centers who were part time"" or some dumb shit that never existed, he went up against many men his size, another hof bill Russell he used to play alot and would put up crazy numbers and the league only had 8 teams back then for awhile, so he played alot during the year, he would be by far the beat player in the league, better than lebron James "

"On those occasions the Celtics were already leading, or it was just regular 4th quarter points. Which are still clutch.

Wilt was like LeBron playing with James Naismith.
"They’re professional players, even Lebron James gets criticized.  I’m not saying frank won’t ever be good either and I doubt that guy was.  It’s just that he needs to make some serious progress (which he obviously can)."
Somewhere between Chris bosh and Lebron James.
"Ah you must watch those Nick Wright videos where he tries to convince everyone that LeBron is the better player. He starts off his argument with this little nugget - ""LeBron James averages more assists, rebounds, steals and blocks than Jordan"". The first words that come out of his mouth are very easily dismissed as a lie with 2 minutes of Google searching because Jordan actually averaged more steals (by far) and more blocks while also averaging more offensive rebounds. People actually take this guy seriously despite the fact he quite clearly has no idea what he is talking about."
"That's Funny ""Lebron James"""
"It's not sarcastic tho. Since the day I was born, my mama has always told me that I’m “too white” to do the things that I love to do. If I had a nickel for every time she said “you’re just a lil’ white boy,” I’d be sittin’ pretty. I wouldn’t have all this student debt, either. That’s for sure.  Here’s the thing— she ain’t wrong, though. I’m what you call a “reverse Oreo.” On the inside, I’m an Atlanta-based trap lord who balls bigger than LaVar in his dreams. But, on the outside, I’m whiter than a fresh jar of marshmallow fluff. I know, it's tacky. But, I am what I am. I love to rap. . . which is not a particularly “white” activity. I love to play basketball, which is also not really known as a “Caucasian pass-time,” if you will. I even have dudes on my Y-League team that say I “talk gangster.” No one ever wants to be that guy. Alas, here I stand. Based on what I’ve said, one could understand why I have a certain appreciation for guys like Larry Bird or Steve Nash. Those were two dudes that, despite all odds, made it to the NBA looking like milk-truck drivers. Overall, LeBron James is my favorite player. But, it's always a little exciting when you see a white dude block him twice on the same play. That white dude is a man by the name of Luka Doncic. For us white kids, the athleticism of a LeBron James or a Russell Westbrook just isn’t really in the cards. I mean, we have Mac McLung at Georgetown puttin’ on for the honkeys. . . but other than that, there just isn’t that much God-given bounce to go around. I mean, the movie White Guys Can’t Jump didn’t just come out of nowhere. Stereotypes exist for a reason. However, Luka Doncic is quite athletic. He was doubted during the pre-draft process because scouts didn’t think he could adjust to the speed of the NBA after coming over from Europe. Yeah, I think he’s doing just fine. He hasn’t seemed to miss a step after being the MVP of the Euro League. He might not blaze past people like a Kemba Walker or Kyrie Irving, but he holds his own and makes it look easy around the basket as well. Speaking of finishes— for us white kids, the Euro-step was a staple if slashing was your game. It was a glorious move that created new space and angles for guys like Manu Ginobili. It was a cornerstone of white boy ballin’ until James Harden went and appropriated it. But, Luka Doncic did it right back. He went and appropriated that step-back jumper The Beard loves so much. Have you ever seen Doncic hit a step back that’s smoother than Harden’s? Because I have. I see it in every highlight reel that Luca has. And, he doesn’t sport a wack-ass beard while doing it. Double win. Now, this last one is something all basketball fans can relate to, especially if you play a lot of pick-up. You ever see a white guy make some nice moves on the court but he still looks really white while doing it? Like SO WHITE it kinda makes you a little itchy? Cough cough Joe Ingles cough cough. You know what I’m talking about, right? Anyway, Luka does all of these moves and looks smoother than butter dipped in olive oil. His game has so much finesse that he attended the same academy that Gunna rapped about on the hook of “YOSEMITE.” He’s out here making dudes look foolish, like they can’t believe they’re getting crossed up by a saltine in Nikes. Not only is Luka Doncic a baller and should be around for the next 12-15 years in the NBA, he puts a smile on my face. He is the next Great White Hope. He gives all of us charge-takers a glimmer of pride as we watch from our couches and talk about our JV glory days. He's our hero."

"At least this was a much better report than the one before. “LeBron James is out for two weeks, and if it’s, more, it’s more”. "
" CC works for fox sports. As a commentator. It's his job to have hot takes, not accurate ones. Did he say that he had heard that from kawhi's camp or did he just say that's what he thinks? It's the latter.   And there are plenty of high profile players that don't talk to woj, famously LeBron James.  Face it man, you have zero proof that he faked anything. And the media and fans pushing so hard probably drove him to leave. "

"There you go. We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron JamesThe Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"It doesn't help with development of their young players when the focus is on their superstar HOF player. Because it's LeBron it's even worse. It's not like James is taking a step back to be that old vet, nah it's his team, his way, Hollywood James, baby."
"I agree. Management brought in McGee to perform with James. I wouldn't expect as much of him without an elite playmaker on the floor.  Rondo is basically James's playoff/crunch time playmaker backup. He doesn't need James to work. He is best utilized when James is on the bench or together in crunch time if Lonzo sits.   Lance, Beasley are filler minutes at the end of bench and to being energy when starters are ass. They don't really play off LeBron because they mostly play when he subs off. "
"Oh the classic stan behavior. Denigrate players around your favorite player to prop up his legacy in spite of his shortcomings. Not to mention that Harden has been surrounded by very serviceable role players throughout his career, its not like he was playing with smush Parker or Kwame Brown or whatever scrub Lebron was playing with.  Dwight Howard in 2014 averaged 26/14 while James averaged 27 on sub 40/30 shooting. The Rocketd were a 54 win team and got whupped bu Portland in the first round. I swear to you all you Houston fans back then woulda thought yourselves as contenders prior to the GSW superteam, but now? Naaah, its just revisionist history to make yourselves feel better about Hardens historical regular season while not coming to terms with the fact that he has, in every postseason, underperformed, and has lost and that trend will keep on going. "
"This is just nuts. Yall talking smack like we thought we'd make the playoffs because of the signings..Really just one signing. Lebron James. Yeah, he can take us the playoffs and maybe even to the 2nd round depending on who we get. But naw, we aren't beating GSW less they get injured. And that's the sentiment most have. "
"I'm fine with this though. McGee wasn't brought in to carry this team. He was brought in to complement Lebron James. Zubac worries me because Lebron or not, he has ups and downs. At least McGee is more consistent in giving Lebron help."
Who said straight up? Should have done both him and kuzma for kawhi or whatever else they wanted.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/7/6/17539302/brandon-ingram-kawhi-leonard-lakers-lebron-james
"Rondo: Am I missing something? I have Rondo averaging 68.4 games over the past 5 seasons. And during his tenure with the Bulls and the Pelicans, he was cited as being a great mentor to the youth. This is EXACTLY what you want around the new guys. He also plays very similarly to Lonzo which has been great in Lonzo's development (news already out of them training together even when Rondo is out injured).  Randle: Again, I'm happy he's doing great. He was great for us, but yes, you let him walk because he wasn't signing a short term deal with us. He took what he could get from others, but it was clear he wasn't going to sign with us. His expectations was a long-term higher pay from the Lakers. Just because he got less with the Pelicans didn't mean that's what he would have signed with us. People would be laughing at us for had we given him a good deal for a long term as he comes off the bench becuase he's not an ideal forward and a limited center with Lebron James on the field.  KCP: Watch the games my dude. KCP is getting bumped because he has been legit good after getting over his slump at the start of the season. Not like Hart (the guy he replaced) is injured.  The FO has been good because they are following the plan to compete next year. If we dont' get a good signing this offseason, then yes. But heck, remember how every was making fun of the Kings until a few years played out and they are looking pretty good now? Have to let thigns play out. All I'm saying, and until then, they have done a descent (not perfect, I admit) job while not losing sight of what really matters in the long term."
"&gt;Giannis is a much better defender than LeBron ever was due to his insane length and athleticism, his rebound numbers dwarf LeBron as well. the crazy thing is Giannis probably hasn't peaked yet either.  LeBron is a much smarter player than Giannis.  He's a far better shooter, a completely different world of playmakers, can iso better, is a triple-threat on offense, and has actually, you know, won more than a few playoff games.  &gt;James Harden is definitely peaking right now. he's at a special point in his career where his skills, IQ and athleticism will be at the highest combined value they will ever be. and what he is doing is just ridiculous, he's carrying a team to winning basketball like i've never seen before.  lol"
Giannis isn’t nearly the shooter or passer LeBron was/is.   People also somehow forget every year that LeBron James turns shit way the fuck up in the playoffs. In the 2009 playoffs LeBron averaged 35/9/7 on ridiculous efficiency. His decision making is also up there with the greatest of all time.   LeBron is Chris Paul’s IQ mixed with a 6’8 250 body with a 45 inch vertical that can shoot.

"On TV, probably Giannis Antetokounmpo jumping over Tim Hardaway Jr. or LeBron James jumping over John Lucas.   In person, I was in Miami few years ago when Winslow was a rookie, I remember him dunking really strong. Nothing crazy like jumping over a man or anything, I just remember that the power he had in it was very impressive in person."
"it's not bait. and people are acting like i'm saying scrubs are playing at a higher level then LeBron ever did. when it's all said and done, Harden and Antentokounmpo are going to be multiple time MVPs and all time greats as well. they wont have the longevity and career dominance that LeBron had, probably wont have the same amount of rings either, but it's hard for me to say that LeBron ever played at a higher level than what we're seeing from those two right now.   Giannis is a much better defender than LeBron ever was due to his insane length and athleticism, his rebound numbers dwarf LeBron as well. the crazy thing is Giannis probably hasn't peaked yet either.  James Harden is definitely peaking right now. he's at a special point in his career where his skills, IQ and athleticism will be at the highest combined value they will ever be. and what he is doing is just ridiculous, he's carrying a team to winning basketball like i've never seen before."
"I mean I definitely comprehended the part where you said signing michael Beasley this past offseason using the room exception when you have lebron james on your squad was a good idea. I am very very sad about the eagles and I do hate the lakers, but I dont tbink either of those facts are very relevant here"
"Per 36 stats are garbage so are per 100 or any other cherrypicker per stat. Per 48 is what matters, or in others words, what a player brings to every game. Kyrie's best season was 2017 and that was with James. He has gotten worse in Boston statistically and his stock has dropped too as his flaws are being exposed. In Cleveland, he got to do what he was best at and he excelled while Lebron took care of everything else.  &gt; Last year he was a legit MVP candidate before he got hurt.  No he wasn't. He was averaging 24 points for a team that was winning without him and continued winning without him when he was gone.  &gt;Miami should have not made the Finals in 2014? LOL. So you think the Pacers lead by 23 year old Paul George, Roy Hibbert, and Lance Stevenson should have? LOL.  Yes. Even Dwyane Wade said he has no idea how they made the finals that year. They were mentally and physically fatigued and many of the guys were injured. The 2014 Pacers had the best record and were the #1 defense in the league. LOL maybe you shouldn't talk about games and seasons you didn't watch.  &gt;What other Big3?  Boston, OKC, and San Antonio.  &gt;By the time the Heat Big3 were formed the KG/Allen/Piece were all out of their prime.  And Rondo had peaked. He led the league in assists, was an all-star, and was was all--nba  And Boston had beat on Lebron when he was very young 23 years old. Do those wins not count for Boston?   And on another note, you're bragging about your team beating an out of prime Lebron. So does that really count, hypocrite?"
Lebron James has been on steroids throughout most of his career. The evidence is quite overwhelming. 
"I'm just saying there's that sort of problem with types of stats. They're set at such arbitrary numbers in order to set players apart from each other. Did you know that the only players to play 800 games to average 13.5 ppg, 1.4 spg, 49% FG, and a 30% 3FG are Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Micheal Jordan, Lebron James, and Thaddeus Young?  Look I'm not trying to be mean. Just trying to show there's a problem sometimes with these type of stats."
"&gt; people expected this team as currently constructed, with Lebron James (knowing full well how great he is), at full health, to be struggling to make the playoffs.  This is bullshit. I could just as easily (more easily?) find you examples of people arguing that the lakers would make the WCF because of LeBron alone  No one actually thought the Lakers with LeBron would struggle to make the playoffs. You were written in for a top 8 finish. When the Lakers started slow it became a national story.   The reason you're ""overachieving"" was LeBron James. Sure, some role players played well. Larry Nance Jr and Tristan Thompson had some nice stretches too. But being a 5th seed with LeBron James isnt overachieving. Not when the moment he sits you revert back to a 14th seed.   No one thinks your roster is overachieving right now. They--rightly--think that LeBron is the only reason you arent a lottery team again. You can talk about Lonzo's defense (like Wiggins's MAX DEFENSE), but that betrays the truth: you couldnt move Lonzo and Ingram together for De'Aaron Fox right now. Or Luka. Sure seems like LeBron is on the Cavs again, carrying a bad team, just with a lot more glitz"
"I’m a doubter because I don’t want you to put unreal expectations on a 19 year old? Ok dude.  Let’s look at some of the best rookies of all time and see how they follow up their rookie years and you tell me what is likely.  Ben Simmons Rookie year: 16/8/8 56TS%  Ben Simmons this year: 16/9/8 59 TS%  No leap was taken, just a minor improvement like most people.  Donovan Mitchell Rookie year: 21/4/4 54 TS%  Donovan Mitchell this year: 22/4/4 51 TS%  Arguable has been a little worse. Better defensively, but his efficiency is down.  Lebron James Rookie year: 21/6/6 49 TS%  Lebron James the next season: 27/7/7 55 TS%  The first one we see that dramatically improved in every aspect of his game. But he had way less pro experience than Luka coming in, so we knew how far away from his ceiling he actually was. Still, that’s one.   Blake Griffin Rookie year: 23/12/4 on 55 TS%  Blake the next year: 21/11/3 on 55 TS%  He completely stagnated. Lowered his volume a tad bit and increased his efficiency just a tad, but the same player basically.  Allen Iverson Rookie: 24/4/8 51 TS%  Allen Iverson the next year: 22/4/6 53 TS%  Improved a little bit on efficiency with a little lower volume and took a step back in terms of playmaking. Otherwise, stagnation.  Should I really go on?"
"Another thing people need to realize is that james signed up for this plan. If lebron said win now or im not signing there wouldnt be a young core left right now. Were sacrificing 1 year to put us in a better spot for the remaining 3 years of lebron, Id say it’s worthit and obviously lebron does too."
"Okay let me try to clarify this for you since you're having trouble understanding.  People expected this team as currently constructed, with Lebron James (knowing full well how great he is), at full health, to be struggling to make the playoffs. The team surpassed those expectations while fully healthy, *despite* Lebron James playing normally by his standards. So what was the cause of the overachieving?  Anyone who's watched our games since the Chandler pickup can tell you. Javale started off the year as an amazing rim protector, Chandler came in and did more than his part, Rondo has taken over a few games (including one notable game against GSW without Lebron), Lonzo's defense has been elite, etc. I understand, not everyone can keep up and actually watch all our games to find out the details of what's happening. Sometimes you don't have time and have to rely on ESPN-level circlejerky narratives. I get it. You do you. Just don't *act* like you know what you're talking about."
"All this did for me was remind me that Dwight Howard is first ballot and Lebron James is amazing, also that dirk and Vince are old. Good post op, definitely a cool retrospect."
last year's rocket team struck gold at the right time and it was still not enough. you need lebron james to beat the warriors!
"It's still kind of funny to me how you add LeBron James to your roster and go like ""yep, we don't need a single shooter on the team""."
"And it was SO BAD yet somehow enough people deluded themselves into convincing a lot of people it actually made sense. Magic has been going at the roster like a toddler in 2K. Been saying from day 1 the front office is to blame for Lakers struggles. Almost anyone could do better with three straight second overall picks, a mountain of cap space, and LeBron Fucking James falling into their laps."
"True, in a sense. I’m in my mid 30’s, played college ball and I’ve been a lifetime fan. I think comparisons to Ginobli as far as career wise is more reasonable than Lebron James. The game now is judged way too much off hype. I’ve never been a hype beast. He’s good. I won’t dispute that. I just don’t know how much better he can get. Even at 19, he has a full league of players with elite talent that he has to be better than. I think people should just slow down on the expectations"
LeBron Skywalker James 
LA isn't a super team - it's a bunch of high upside prospects and LeBron James  GSW's had a record breaking season and then added KD... huge difference
"It doesn't really convey that much information apart from the outliers from far away (which are pretty cool). Otherwise I don't think this chart would look that different from any other high volume 3pt shooter.  I much prefer his hexagonal shot charts that incorporate volume, location, and accuracy (eg. [this](http://grantland.com/the-triangle/lebron-james-kevin-love-kyrie-irving-cavs-offense/) preview from Grantland of the Cavs after adding Lebron and Love)."
"And he can average even more if he's surrounded by competent wing players (sharp shooters) who can knock down shots after he collapses or draws in the defense, if you give him a legit big man who can score inside they can make plays to dominate inside... why not team him up with athletic run and gunners who can finish strong to help push the offense as LeBron is technically a point guard / playmaker... it's not only about having a James or a Harden and giving them the ball to make magic. Consider also other teams who have formulated strategies to stop them individually..."
"James, LeBron (OUT - dick)"
But Lebron's in the West now! Warriors are done.  *Lebron James never makes a Finals appearance again*
"I think it's more that he respects him, he's a contemporary, but they never competed in the playoffs and Hakeem isn't in GOAT contention. So in that sense, it's perfect to say he'd like to run with him.  I do like that stylistic meshing between Jordan, Pippen, and Hakeem. Good lord that's some nasty defense. And I like Magic feeding them and all five of them running the break.  But they could use more shooting, and Worthy sticks out like a sore thumb. He is a stud playoff performer (Big Game James), but he's not a great shooter, facilitator, defender.  I'd prefer Bird, LeBron, Kawhi, KD, KG, Duncan, etc at that spot instead. Jordan, Pippen, Kawhi/KG, Hakeem is an obscene defense."
"It was confirmed by [Amick and Windhorst](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2018/6/9/17443820/lebron-james-injury-hand-whiteboard-punch-nba-cavs-warriors).   &gt; He’s reportedly been playing with a serious bone contusion suffered after punching a white board out of frustration in Game 1, according to USA Today’s Sam Amick.   &gt; According to Amick, James had an MRI after Game 1, but his hand was too swollen for a definitive result. He is not expected to need surgery. "
we’re really at the point of calling LeBron fucking James just “one all star” 🙄
"My bad if you didn't intend it to be aggressive. I'll continue on a more civil manner just to avoid misunderstanding.    I think the interesting part is whether current stars were really studs from early on in their career or not. Of course in Ingram's case, he is only 21 years old, but at the same time, this is his third year in the NBA. Let's say we compare to Dame (as one of the names you mentioned), he wasn't even in the NBA at 21 years old. But in his first season (at 22), he already averaged 19 points and 6.5 assists. That is a pretty damn good stat for a rookie and would be considered as a ""stud"" IMO.    Then there's also the question whether Ingram improved this season or not. Stat-wise, everything looked similar to last season (some up and some down) and I can understand if people felt that he was underwhelming because he didn't show enough improvement.    To me personally, I tend to value more about NBA experience (and playing time) rather than the actual age. So for example with James Harden back in OKC, he wasn't producing stud stats but also because he was playing from the bench and that's why it's understandable his stats weren't as high.    Things looked bad for Ingram because his age (21) seemed to be the only reason we can accept to justify his performance not reaching star level yet. I disagree with the OP because ""he's only 21"" doesn't really mean anything to me. Some players are already good at 21, some aren't. Age doesn't play any part.    For this particular case, I'd honestly give Ingram another season before I'm comfortable to make a proper opinion of him. He produced okay as a rookie with limited minutes. He improved well onto his second season with more minutes. But he seem to stagnant a bit on his third season (LeBron factor maybe?). So I'll give him another season to see where he's at. If he's staying with Lakers/LeBron (and potentially adding another superstar from free agent), then I expect his stats to stay or get worse. If he's moving elsewhere, then I expect his stats to go up.    In conclusion, I think he can produce much more than what he has shown so far. But I'm increasingly worried that he might not get the chance to until much later on (4+ years from now)."
Lol does anyone really think he’s not an all time great or the best shooter ever ?? I’m not a warriors fan by any stretch of the imagination but I would call anyone who tries to deny the two things you mentioned about Steph straight up delusional. They’d have to be the Skip Bayless-Lebron James equivalent on Steph.

"Kings, they didn’t get LeBron James "
"Look at the top 10 Free Throw shooters in the NBA this season:  |Rk|Player|FT|FTA|FT%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|James Harden|9.8|11.3|.863| |2|Joel Embiid|8.0|10.0|.801| |3|Giannis Antetokounmpo|6.5|9.3|.701| |4|Anthony Davis|7.4|9.1|.813| |5|Kevin Love|6.8|8.3|.818| |6|LeBron James|5.3|7.8|.682| |7|Kevin Durant|6.9|7.6|.911| |8|Kawhi Leonard|6.5|7.6|.846| |9|Blake Griffin|5.8|7.6|.759| |10|Damian Lillard|6.0|6.7|.904|  Should none of these guys be getting calls?  Surely Embiid and Giannis shouldn't be going to the line this much either right?  Do you feel the same way about them?  I think they have a lower usage rate too, so they might have more FTa/g than Harden if they took the same number of shots.  Compared to someone at his own position (kind of), Hardens FTr is slightly above Ben Simmons... (.489 vs. .475) I don't think its anything too crazy. His play style just draws a lot of fouls."
[WOJ] Reports from Los Angeles that LeBron James has confiscated Kyle Kuzmas phone and has no plans to return it
"Since the day I was born, my mama has always told me that I’m “too white” to do the things that I love to do. If I had a nickel for every time she said “you’re just a lil’ white boy,” I’d be sittin’ pretty. I wouldn’t have all this student debt, either. That’s for sure.  Here’s the thing— she ain’t wrong, though. I’m what you call a “reverse Oreo.” On the inside, I’m an Atlanta-based trap lord who balls bigger than LaVar in his dreams. But, on the outside, I’m whiter than a fresh jar of marshmallow fluff. I know, it's tacky. But, I am what I am. I love to rap. . . which is not a particularly “white” activity. I love to play basketball, which is also not really known as a “Caucasian pass-time,” if you will. I even have dudes on my Y-League team that say I “talk gangster.” No one ever wants to be that guy. Alas, here I stand. Based on what I’ve said, one could understand why I have a certain appreciation for guys like Larry Bird or Steve Nash. Those were two dudes that, despite all odds, made it to the NBA looking like milk-truck drivers. Overall, LeBron James is my favorite player. But, it's always a little exciting when you see a white dude block him twice on the same play.  That white dude is a man by the name of Luka Doncic. For us white kids, the athleticism of a LeBron James or a Russell Westbrook just isn’t really in the cards. I mean, we have Mac McLung at Georgetown puttin’ on for the honkeys. . . but other than that, there just isn’t that much God-given bounce to go around. I mean, the movie White Guys Can’t Jump didn’t just come out of nowhere. Stereotypes exist for a reason. However, Luka Doncic is quite athletic. He was doubted during the pre-draft process because scouts didn’t think he could adjust to the speed of the NBA after coming over from Europe. Yeah, I think he’s doing just fine. He hasn’t seemed to miss a step after being the MVP of the Euro League. He might not blaze past people like a Kemba Walker or Kyrie Irving, but he holds his own and makes it look easy around the basket as well. Speaking of finishes— for us white kids, the Euro-step was a staple if slashing was your game. It was a glorious move that created new space and angles for guys like Manu Ginobili. It was a cornerstone of white boy ballin’ until James Harden went and appropriated it. But, Luka Doncic did it right back. He went and appropriated that step-back jumper The Beard loves so much. Have you ever seen Doncic hit a step back that’s smoother than Harden’s? Because I have. I see it in every highlight reel that Luca has. And, he doesn’t sport a wack-ass beard while doing it. Double win. Now, this last one is something all basketball fans can relate to, especially if you play a lot of pick-up. You ever see a white guy make some nice moves on the court but he still looks really white while doing it? Like SO WHITE it kinda makes you a little itchy? Cough cough Joe Ingles cough cough. You know what I’m talking about, right? Anyway, Luka does all of these moves and looks smoother than butter dipped in olive oil. His game has so much finesse that he attended the same academy that Gunna rapped about on the hook of “YOSEMITE.” He’s out here making dudes look foolish, like they can’t believe they’re getting crossed up by a saltine in Nikes. Not only is Luka Doncic a baller and should be around for the next 12-15 years in the NBA, he puts a smile on my face. He is the next Great White Hope. He gives all of us charge-takers a glimmer of pride as we watch from our couches and talk about our JV glory days. He's our hero.  I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

LeBron James currently on 15 consecutive years for all those playing along at home
3 promising players who can't go .500 without Lebron James in 2 weeks with a weak schedule. Fuq outta here wit dat fufu. This game is about wins. Lakers young core aint providing wins right now.  Get ya game up!
never gonna happen bud  you must have one lebron james to enable this feature
"Better yet, eliminate the max contract. Should Micheal Conley be getting paid the same as Lebron James? "
"James, LeBron - DNP"
Missing Michael Jordan and LeBron James.
LeBron James is hurt dude
"One more: High School one and done's and the college they would have went too:  Kevin Garnett: Michigan  Kobe Bryant: Duke  LeBron James: Duke (he says this but tbh I think he would have went to Ohio State)  Tracy McGrady: Kentucky  Rashard Lewis: Likely Houston but was also considering Florida State/Kansas  Jonathan Bender: Mississippi State  Darius Miler: St. John's  Deshawn Stevenson: Kansas  Kwame Brown: Florida  Tyson Chandler: Probably UCLA but also considered Arizona/Syracuse/Memphis/Kentucky/Michigan  Eddy Curry: DePaul  Amare Stoudemire: Memphis  Travis Outlaw: Mississippi State  Nbudi Edi: Arizona  Kendrick Perkins: Memphis  Dwight Howard: He never considered it, but I highly doubt any school other than Georgia Tech  Shaun Livingston: Duke  Robert Swift: USC  Sebastian Telfair: Louisville  Al Jefferson: Arkansas  Josh Smith: Indiana  JR Smith: Most likely North Carolina  Dorell Wright: DePaul  Martell Webster: Washington  Andrew Bynum: UCONN  Gerald Green: Oklahoma State  CJ Miles: Texas  Monta Ellis: Mississippi State  Lou Williams: Georgia  Amir Johnson: Louisville  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;"
"Jay Bilas:  ""Well simply put LeBron James is the best high school basketball player I have ever seen. At 17 years old he is better than Kobe Bryant was at the same age""  That tells you all you need to know"
Yeah LeBron James 
Tim Duncan had a better career than any player since Michael Jordan. 5 rings for same franchise across 15 years and was good until his last year. (\*Including LeBron James who is two shots/posessions away from losing his 2nd Miami title and his Cavs title)
What about lebron james?
"Both players preferred to have the ball in their hands but when playing with LeBron they adapted.  It wasn't perfect, though, or completely without tension.    The first year they played together Wade and James weren't always sure of their respective roles.  And the last year they played together Irving was getting impatient with deferring.  With Wade it ultimately worked because he was older than LeBron and had already won a championship on his own.  With Irving it worked because he was younger than LeBron and willing to wait -- for a while.  Had either of them been the same age as LeBron it might not have worked as well."
"Since the day I was born, my mama has always told me that I’m “too white” to do the things that I love to do. If I had a nickel for every time she said “you’re just a lil’ white boy,” I’d be sittin’ pretty. I wouldn’t have all this student debt, either. That’s for sure.  Here’s the thing— she ain’t wrong, though. I’m what you call a “reverse Oreo.” On the inside, I’m an Atlanta-based trap lord who balls bigger than LaVar in his dreams. But, on the outside, I’m whiter than a fresh jar of marshmallow fluff. I know, it's tacky. But, I am what I am. I love to rap. . . which is not a particularly “white” activity. I love to play basketball, which is also not really known as a “Caucasian pass-time,” if you will. I even have dudes on my Y-League team that say I “talk gangster.” No one ever wants to be that guy. Alas, here I stand. Based on what I’ve said, one could understand why I have a certain appreciation for guys like Larry Bird or Steve Nash. Those were two dudes that, despite all odds, made it to the NBA looking like milk-truck drivers. Overall, LeBron James is my favorite player. But, it's always a little exciting when you see a white dude block him twice on the same play. That white dude is a man by the name of Luka Doncic. For us white kids, the athleticism of a LeBron James or a Russell Westbrook just isn’t really in the cards. I mean, we have Mac McLung at Georgetown puttin’ on for the honkeys. . . but other than that, there just isn’t that much God-given bounce to go around.

Thoughts on DSJ for Kevin Durant and LeBron James?
"When he was all condescending after the finals loss to the Mass and said something along the lines of “yeah I choked, but you guys have to go back to your lives tomorrow and I’m LeBron James and better than you”"
"Because LeBron put up 39/16/11 and 40/12/8 to steal 2 wins. As good as that warriors team was, they weren't *The Warriors* yet, I don't think LeBron James doing LeBron things should diminish the importance of their title."
I mean we got LeBron James. There was no bigger free agent than him. Just that one signing validates everything the lakers did. Sure it would be nice to get another one with the cap space we have but I mean we got Lebron James  
LeBron James is overrated and a complete and utter fake. 
"&gt;He has missed a lot of practice time with his team.  Lonzo was also nursing a knee had surgery on this offseason. He also didn’t get the summer to train and improve. OG and Lonzo are similar there.   &gt;In that case, why is Ingram heralded as a potential star prospect?  Not a lot of people think this. Especially not on this sub. Ingram is putting up near identical numbers as last season but he’s also had to adjust to injuries and playing next to a very b-ball dominant LeBron James.  Look at Ingram’s numbers as a first option this year, when he was playing without LeBron.  19/6/4 on .550 TS, across the board those are all better numbers than he was putting up last season as a #1 option.   "
"I might be in the minority, but I'd rather keep Lonzo than BI, but I think BI has a MUCH higher value, he just sucks with lebron and we don't need him. What the FUCK would we do without Rondo and Ball!?!?!  HERE COMES LAKERS STARTING POINT GUARD ALONGSIDE LEBRON JAMES AND ANTHONY DAVIS-ALEX CARUSO!!!!"
"Brandon Ingram yelled, “There you go!” Javale McGee gave a look of pleasant surprise. Lance Stephenson belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Magic Johnson hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Idk uhm sign Lebron James. Make moves to maintain cap space? 
"Lakers need to get their shit together. If I’m Demps I want lonzo, Ingram, Kuzma, Zu, salaryfill (kcp or lance. Ideally kcp) and two first rounders.   Trust me when this deal goes down all you laker fans won’t give a FUCK about losing your young players as you trot out Lebron fkn James and Anthony Davis each night. In this league you need superstars to win and you have TWO on the same team. Only other team with two superstars are the warriors. The rest of the team will solve itself out through cap space this offseason in a loaded free agent class and veteran ring chasers and whoever the lakers scrounge out for end of bench players. "
And signed lebron James with the cap space lol go do some fact check first 
"This ain't Golden State bruh  As Lebron James once said, it aint over when games still on"
Malik Beasley &gt; LeBron James
Lebron James
"Woj: “NOLA probably won’t deal with the stupid Lakers team and their ugly front office, more likely to work with the very kind Boston team that almost beat known meanie in ECF, LeBron James.” "
&gt; they would do it to anybody  Anybody?  I don't think the Celtics would shop prime Anthony Davis for any reason. The idea is to keep him on your team for fucking ever.   Boston traded IT to a team with LeBron James.  AD himself is asking to go play with LeBron.  Is it an opportunity or *doing a guy dirty*?   
How did IT get done dirty? He has a career season and declined and never remotely close to the same player. The team move a player at peak value for a better asset AND SENT HIM TO LEBRON JAMES. He didn’t get sent to Kings or Suns or some go nowhere franchise. They sent him to the team that went to the finals. 
"The people freaking out about all this media noise right now don't understand the motives behind the noise.  The deadline is in a week.  Everyone understands this is a two horse race between Boston the Lakers, but Boston is asking for them to delay the race for another 5 months.  * That's 5 months of Anthony Davis playing in a situation he doesn't want to play in.  * That's 5 months of endless questions about where Anthony Davis will play long term.  * That's 5 months for playing for a fanbase that no longer wants him.  * That's 5 months of not being able to get major endorsement deals, because nobody cares about a sitting duck superstar playing for a bottom .500 team in an arena they can't even sell out.  Think about this shit.  They are trying... **very aggressively**... to get this ordeal over with.  Obviously, if you're Davis, it's FAR **FAR** more appealing to go play in Los Angeles right now alongside LeBron James.  Shit, maybe even you two can go on a run.  Imagine all the jerseys that would be sold.  Imagine the endorsement deals.  Imagine all the positive buzz about the ""newness"" of it all.  Feel-good vibes from a dangerous late seed Western Conference team.    Why wouldn't they prefer that?  So they're throwing shit against the wall.  Anything they can say to make it seem like they have no interest in Boston.  Anything they can do to say Davis would never stay here.  If they can piss of Kyrie Irving in the process, get the Celtic fans to turn against him, and make him uncomfortable in his current situation - even better... because if Kyrie asks out, Boston presumably will forget about Davis and build around the young guys.     Bottom line is they want us out of the running.  They want the Celtics to concede.  They want Boston to say ""fuck it"" and trade for Bradley Beal or something... put together some ""Plan B"" to make Kyrie happy in the short term... or shit, maybe ... just maybe, convince Boston to dump Kyrie now so this can be a 2-horse race and the bidding war can begin this week with Boston involved.  I'm telling you, there is no logic behind the idea of Davis not wanting to play in Boston.  If we were able to trade for him right now, he'd be gleeful about coming here.  It's a top-tier org that he would fit in with beautifully.  He wants to play for a winner for a major franchise - and that's Boston.  He would have endorsement deals here.  He would compete for the Finals here.  He would sell jerseys here.  It's a top 5 rabid fanbase in the entire league.  Everything about going to Boston makes sense... but for the next week, at least, they can't say that.    Shit is going to get worse before it gets better.  Expect them to threaten to sit Davis this year.  Expect them to start drama with New Orleans.  Anything they can do to try and force their hand right now.   But if we get through the trade deadline without him being moved, it will be a totally different story."
Just wait until LeBron James Jr. is in the league and on the tail end of his rookie contract being mistreated.   Daddy Bron gone flip his shit. 
I would never want my son to play for LeBron James after what he did to Isaiah Thomas. 
$$$$ Benching a player people want to see is killer for an organization's bottom line. Plus why would u give up the chance of snagging lottery picks?   You could get the second coming of lebron james by sheer luck in the draft.    
Rich Pauls agent LeBron James wants his client's client in LA.
Do you think that Lebron James wouldn't have signed there because they traded a very old and ineffective Kobe??? And theres no evidence that Kyrie is bolting dude. Read the actual articles instead of the manipulated click-bait articles that are being pushed. The only thing we know is that he said he plans on resigning with us and that hes keeping his options open.
"Well now you aren’t getting Anthony Davis and it looks like Kyrie is bolting, whereas *Lebron James* just signed with the Lakers."
"JR Smith, Demarcus Cousins, Lebron, Dennis Smith Jr, Westbrook, James Johnson, the Morris brothers, Wes Matthews, Tim Hardaway Jr, PJ Tucker, Derrick Rose, Darius Miller, Ayton, Khris Middleton, Jabari Parker, Darren Collison, D'Angelo, Drummond, Tristan Thompson  These players all play like thugs"
I know people hate LeBron james and try to diminish his rep but I literally cant fathom what your saying. I cant even read this...whats your number I need your bag man. https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/teams/Cleveland-Cavaliers/5/Playoff-History https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/teams/New-Orleans-Pelicans/19/Playoff-History dude has to make the playoffs this isn't even comparable. Below 500 teams what? Dude he cant even win in the regular season...bro I could make a list your not even making sense. Dude your obviously not dumb their actually is no way your trying to compare LeBron james first 7 years to davis? are you actually serious cuz? 
"I mean, I agree with you, but how fucking wild is it that LeBron James could ever be the David in a David vs. Goliath scenario?"
but but but we have injuries that's why were the fucking 9 seed with lebron james
Not represented by LeBron James puppet. 
"Loyal where it matters. Kobe last contract. We take loses in trades if it means our player requesting a trade goes where he wants (Odom, Blake, Shaq). We just did a highlight thank you video for Randle on his Staples Center return..  Dlo was a stopgap nobody with cinder block feet who wouldn’t even be in question for All Star anything in the West. You’d keep Dlo if it meant you couldn’t get LeBron James? "
"We don’t collude with everyone, dope. Trash organization that’s about to risk your future on the groin of Lebron James. That’s fine, you’ll just rob someone else’s players. "
"""I'd only want my son to play with IT's best teammate...LeBron James."""
"[There's this article where a GM in the West called Rich Paul and LBJ ""mafioso mob bosses"".](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/252025/Western-Conference-GM-Describes-LeBron-James-Rich-Paul-As-Mafioso-Mob-Bosses)  I really like that players have more agency in trying to go where they want to play.  Orgs have been screwing over players for decades and have been calling it ""business"", but if a player does it then it's bad?  I hope the trend continues."
He lost when he compared Lebron to Trump..   [Celtics' Danny Ainge says LeBron James may be taking the 'Donald Trump approach' with GOAT proclamation ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/celtics-danny-ainge-says-lebron-james-may-be-taking-the-donald-trump-approach-with-goat-proclamation/)   
Lebron followed James Jones to the Cavs. 
The 2014 Hawks had just as many All-Stars that accomplished fuck all. Last year LeBron James and Dragic were both All-Stars.  What is your point?   This isn't an All-Star debate. This is a superstar/super team debate.  You asked when and I answered.  
"The bottom line is that there are people who are close to KD that are urging him to go to the Knicks.  They may even succeed.  And it would be a tragedy of epic proportion if they do because I believe they're not doing this for KD's best interest, but their own.  Despite revisionist history, KD has always been a very loyal guy.  Reluctant to change.  While he *needs* respect he doesn't need attention.  His move to GSW was the biggest no-brainer career opportunity in the basketball history.  A perfect situation for his style of play.  Perfect culture.  Amazing talent.   Two FMVPs resulted (so far).  He attached himself to the Greatest team in basketball history.  It's well documented how hard the move to GSW was on him emotionally.  It caused deep rifts in some friendships and made him doubt himself.  He's not the sort of guy who likes to move around.   That's not his nature.  But if he moves again he will ""prove"" to doubters that he's a mercenary.  Not loyal.  And that his GSW move was just a resume building exercise.  He will be revoking his full legacy rights to being a Warrior (and what that will mean 10+ years from now) and will merely be seen as a renter, along for the ride.  Being ""carried"" to rings (despite the fact that he was the MVP for both rings).  He won't be a part of the San Francisco Warriors (as they leave Oracle behind).  When they finally put up the statues in San Francisco it'll be Curry, Thompson .... Green?  He'll be sold a bill of goods -- that he's the ""savior of New York"".  And for a full off-season he will ride high.  For a month, maybe two, he'll be a star.  But they won't win.  There's no contending team there.  By December it'll be ""Is KD overrated?""  By the Trade Deadline it'll be ""KD needs help to win.""  By season end it'll be ""KD was carried by the Warriors.""  And that will be his legacy, deserved or not.  One super star is enough to sell tickets and almost make the playoffs.  The Pelicans are an excellent example of this.   Two stars is good enough to make the playoffs (half the league).  Lebron James knows this very well.  KD should know this too.   KD and Westbrook wasn't enough.   KD +  Irving?   Butler?  Cousins?  That's not going to be enough either.   There's nothing else of value left on the Knicks.  [Sidenote:  Why trade for Dennis Smith Jr if your goal is to sign Kyrie?  Makes no sense.  DSJ cannot co-exist with Kyrie and Kyrie hates mouthy young players.]  The Knicks are not playoff ready.  With 2 stars they still won't be.  Add in a stud 1st round draft pick they'll still be 2-3 years away.   If KD goes there and doesn't win a ring -- which is very likely in a 30 team league with a hell of a lot of talent.   Then the move to NYK will be the dagger in his legacy."
He wants to go to battle with LeBron James. Thats a legit reason.

"Kyrie never got double teamed like Lillard did against NOP and he had teammates that could hit shots.    Kyrie was never the best player on his own team against GSW in the playoffs, LeBron was.  There is a huge difference when the other team has to split attention between you and LeBron versus you and anyone Lillard has ever had as a teammate.  Who cares if the points were unassisted, GSW had all of its attention on James.  Half the time Kyrie was switched onto an injured Curry.  Lillard averages 27ppg in 23 games against GSW.  "
I’m sure Fultz who thrive and develop in the absolutely no pressure no exceptions program that is the Los Angeles Lakers x LeBron James.
"What if he retires early? That's possible, if unlikely. Also he's LeBron fucking James, at this point you can't put anything past him"
"You don't read. I said it's not feasible for them to match the salary *unless they want to have a roster of 3 players.*  &gt;Knicks would be armed with exceptions and minimums.  They'd have like 2 exceptions, neither of which gets you a starting caliber player in today's NBA. And how good do you think the players they're going to be able to get with veteran minumums will be...? They'd have like 10 other players to fill out on the roster and they'd already be maxed on cap space. Exceptions and minimums only take you so far. It's not feasible, their entire bench would be guys that don't make the rotation at all on most other teams in the league. That's not how you win championships.  &gt; AD wasn’t available a few weeks ago. Kawhi and Butler weren’t available before the summer. Kristaps wasn’t available 3 days ago.   Okay first of all, Kristaps isn't a star, we don't even know if he'll ever be healthy again and he's definitely not the type of guy that helps you win a championship right now.  AD has been in legitimate trade rumors for this entire season. Butler was available to anyone watching with a brain. The only player that was a total surprise was Kawhi. And again, I'm asking you which stars could possibly be available this summer for them to trade for (and, by the way, they'd have to beat other teams like the fucking Celtics with their offer too). Lebron? Hell no. Steph? Nope. Klay? Free agent. Russ or PG? Nope. Embiid? Nope. So you tell me which one. You're saying Kyrie should gamble on the tiny chance that another top 10 player in the league demands a trade? The only guy I could *maybe* see wanting a trade in the future is Harden, and again, the Knicks can't beat out all other offers for a guy like James Harden.  &gt;I can tell that you haven't watched an ounce of college basketball this season if you think the only notable palyer in this draft is Zion lmao.  https://theathletic.com/780756/2019/01/29/vecenie-2019-mock-draft-1-0-its-zion-and-then-everyone-else/  Sam Vecenie 2019 mock draft: ""It's Zion, and then everyone else.""  Vecenie is arguably the best draft analyst in the country too. There's always talent at the top end of an NBA draft but Zion is way above everyone else. Barrett, Morant, Reddish, Bol Bol, none of those guys are even close to the prospect that Williamson is. "
"If Bruno Caboclo played a LeBron James level, would the Grizzlies win the finals?"
"Not really, it's not about LeBron's statline, it is about making big defensive stops in key moments of the game.    He also held LeBron to zero fourth quarter points in game 4. That is pretty fucking important. People just quote James' stats and act like Iggy didn't do shit but anyone who actually watched the game knows why Iggy got it.  "
"&gt;WITH ALL OF THE BLATANT TAMPERING GOING ON FROM LEBRON JAMES AND RICH PAUL, THE NBA NEEDS TO GET CREATIVE IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR PLAYERS IN LINE.  &gt;WOULD CORPORAL PUNISHMENT BE AN OPTION? I KNOW THAT THEY CAN FINE PLAYERS, BUT IF THAT DOESN'T WORK? SOMETHING LIKE SPANKING COULD BACKFIRE ON A GUY LIKE AD, GIVEN HIS PAST, BUT MAYBE FLOGGING?  &gt;THE END GOAL IS OBVIOUSLY TO REMOVE ANY AUTONOMY FROM THE PLAYERS. I MEAN THE OWNERS ARE THE ONES PAYING THEM, RIGHT? THEY ARE CALLED ""OWNERS"" FOR A REASON."
I'm quite certain it's not a fantasy of mine. Although from time to time that video pops in to my mind and makes me giggle like an idiot. I mean why would an adult man tap dance to LeBron James lmao.
LOL.  Were you born yesterday?  Did you not watch him go head to head with lebron james in his prime in the back to back finals?  Kawhi is an elite NBA player
But the specific case of KD has more to do with Kleiman than anything else. He's the element that makes the NY rumors to be so amplified by the media.   In some ways not unlike Lebron James' business plans in LA was a huge part of him going to the Lakers and the rumors surrounding it.
"He wan't talking about LeBron James; He was talking about the new up-and-comer, LeBron Eventually."
http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/8766225/rich-paul-one-lebron-james-close-friends-now-agent-espn-magazine  If Uncle Dennis met Lebron he’d be Rich Paul 
"Im curious what level of contract he'll get, if he gets any max offers or not...if he is going to be getting less than a max (which is very possible) then maybe to the lakers if they get AD?  It'd be like the 2017 Pelicans....plus lebron james."
"ALSO LEFT AS A FREE AGENT  and for the millionth time, if you want to blame someone for Durant going to the Warriors, blame LeBron James and blame Chris Paul. The league wanted cap smoothing, the players said no. This is what you get when you don't smooth the cap.   I mean, I get why the players did it - the owners would have ended up with more money if the cap had gone up over time.  So I understand why the players wanted to get all the money they could, but there are consequences when you let the cap go up by like 20 million dollars in one year.    If you want to complain about Durant going to Golden State, ask yourself how Golden State was able to fit him under the cap in the first place."
"Hate is too strong but I’m not a fan and not for nothing.  The flat earth stuff is awful and he undercut my guy Lebron right as James tried to enter the national conversation on race and politics.  The waffling and a few comments suggest he may not appreciate his gifts as much as a lot of guys so yea, he’s low on my list of favorite players."
"Haha sorry man, with an OKC childhood my only loyalties are to the Thunder and OU.   Other than that, I am mainly just a fan of good sports and legendary players. I always enjoy seeing a potential GOAT further solidifying his position. Tom Brady, Lebron James, Sean White, Messi etc. - just a fan of watching the best in sports I guess :D "
"Whose idea? Certainly not every team's owners. I get where you're coming from, but what I'm saying is that the onus is on ownership of the league to make this perfectly competitive league you're talking about. They have the power to make any changes they want.  For a perfectly competitive league the players would need a ton of guarantees like healthcare, guaranteed contracts, development, more money, the list I'm sure goes on. They aren't gonna play for free.  The only reason I'm so engaged in this debate is that I believe your argument, pure as it is, makes greedy owners of crappy teams ecstatic. Player self determination is only detrimental to ownership. So they see you and the talking heads like Charles attack players for taking firm bargaining positions and it's just the same as defending the interests of ownership.  Final thing I'm gonna say, remember this is the entertainment business. It's not pure competition. James Harden gets to travel, LeBron gets to hang on the rim, and big cities with large fanbases will have more advantages recruiting employees just like in any industry. It's on the small city teams to overcome those obstacles."

"Maybe, but that's not what the statement means. It's actually really basic math and I'm shocked this is so hard to grasp.  Lebron has 15 AS appearances. Jokic has 1. Lebron James is a top 5 player all time, but he is not 15 times the player Jokic is. Lebron is much older than Jokic, just like the Eastern all star are much younger than the western all stars.  If you took old players on the east with previous AS appearances, it would be balanced. Vince Carter has 8; he's not 8 times better than Jokic."
"LeBron James leaves his press conference emotional, almost in tears. When asked if he'd like to wait and get AD in free agency instead of through a trade he said he would, but ""it still wouldn't be the same."""
"Is there some kind of bias against rookies and the allstar game?  Only 2 made in the last 20 years: Yao and Blake. Some names who didn't: Vince Carter, Amar'e Stoudamire, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, Derrick Rose and Kyrie Irving. And those are just the ROTY winners. "
The world is his mouth piece. He controls everyone like puppets. He works with mob boss Lebron James. Everything that happens is because Rich Paul and Lebron want it to happen. AD is being manipulated by the very powerful Rich Paul. Rich Paul truly is the most powerful man in the world 
"Dude what the fuck was Ainge suppose to do? Sign IT to the max he wanted when he was injured? Stop acting so ""holyer then thou"". No one made IT play hurt. Ainge has a team to run. It's not like IT was shot off earth. He was sent to play with LeBron fucking James. Any gm and team given that trade proposal would have taken it. "
"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis is right below him, Klay Thompson. I can go on. The only thing that separates them are shot attempts and free throws. Harden is getting 12 FTs a game, a lot of it from BS calls. I've watched at least 40% of his games this season and I've seen the calls, some are fouls but there are definitely more than a few terrible calls. His double step back traveling 3 he shoots. Other superstars are noticing this crap and calling the refs out in game. Coaches are getting techs left and right arguing this crap. You want to bring up his 36ppg, then dont forget the foul calls and his ultra green light."
The NBA wouldn’t release that news okay Sunday because it would get buried.  This bullshit week of Super Bowl lead-up is one thing.  The actual day of the game and the game itself aren’t getting anywhere near overshadowed unless LeBron James gets traded.
"It is mid range shots tend to be really inefficient, for example Lebron James in his entire career only shoots 37% on mid range shots. "
James puts it up... IT'S GOOD!  LEBRON JAMES FROM DOWNTOWN!
He's also better than LeBron James at chasedown blocks so there's taht
LeBron James Harden
"'60s; Oscar Robertson / Jerry West / Elgin Baylor / Bill Russell / Wilt Chamberlain   '70s; Walt Frazier / Julius Erving / John Havlicek / Bob McAdoo / Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Dave Cowens, Rick Barry and Elvin Hayes are also good choices)   '80s; Magic Johnson / Adrian Dantley (he was more of an SF though) / Larry Bird / Kevin McHale / Moses Malone   '90s; John Stockton / Michael Jordan / Scottie Pippen / Karl Malone / Hakeem Olajuwon (leaving out Charles Barkley and David Robinson really hurts)   '00s; Jason Kidd / Kobe Bryant / Kevin Garnett / Tim Duncan / Shaquille O'Neal (I like Kidd better than Nash but you could imagine this with Nash surely)   '10s; Stephen Curry / James Harden / Kevin Durant / LeBron James / Anthony Davis?"
"I'm not saying it's realistic, but right now if the Pelicans &amp; Lakers wanted they could trade Anthony Davis &amp; Wesley Johnson for LeBron James and there's nothing LeBron or Klutch could do to stop it"
People are always playing the James Dolan card James Dolan has not been involved in basketball decisions since before the Phil Jackson days. We have the cap space for KD to bring another star with him which I'm pretty sure only the Clippers and Nets are the only other teams who can do that. KD has been following Lebron's career path and going to the Knicks would pretty much be his answer for Lebron going to the Lakers. Crazy to say but KD has never been the guy in a huge market team and we'd give him that opportunity. I actually think he could do more for his legacy on the Knicks than he could on any other team if he did come here. 
Skills you learn when meeting a high-school Lebron James while selling throwback jerseys out the back of your car.
lol not as disappointing as signing LeBron James and still not making. The playoffs. 
Ad would be completely stupid if he won the chip with kyrie next season and then left to go join a 36 year old lebron james
I doubt it. Yoo don’t leave the Celtics for James Dolan. I think he reconciled with LeBron but that doesnt mean he’s going to LA.   He’s in a great spot for a great organization. Of course it’s still FUCK THE CELTICS but that goes without saying.
"Yeah, this large market nonsense is really annoying. I wish this narrative would die already.  It's not the 1940s anymore, playing in a big market doesn't matter (see Lebron James in Cleveland). Top guys want to play for a SMART organizations (see no one outside of Melo signing with the Knicks).  Also, look at the overall league NBA standings right now. BNY / NYK / LAC / LAL / MIA are nowhere to found towards the top.  If the small markets ""can't compete"" and the large markets are mostly all pure ass, THEN WHO THE FUCK IS WINNING?  /rant"
"I would so buy a LeBron Southern Tigers jersey, both home and away unis.  You know what ? Fuck it, I'll order a ""23 James"" Guangdong jersey from AliExpress right now.  "
"Ya’ll are just saying the Lakers aren’t cheating, then mentioning random facts.  “We’re not cheating!  Lebron James was injured, and he just came back.”  Like what are you even saying?"
"[Seriously, he's that ~~cheap~~ frugal.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-admits-to-being-cheap-i-still-got-pandora-with-commercials/)"
"what lebrons 8th finals in a row....  The NBA is dying because they are trying to get out of jordans shadow with lebron   and the bulls shadow with the warriors.  But it cant and wont happen. No one cares about modern NBA and HIGH SCORING FLASHING GAMES  When people talk basketball, what do they talk about? They talk about how good it used to be and how jordan was amazing and all the players he played against were amazing.  Teams were important then. Now ""star"" players are like, LOL IM NOT PLAYING UNLESS YOU TRADE ME TO LEBRON JAMES AND THATS FINAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. It's bullshit, Black ball these players from the league, It would happen in the NFL..  This is what happens when you give players more power than the owners. The NBA becomes a single player drama show and none of the teams matter."
James Jones and Lebron have a relationship.
lebron James is really good at basketball
LEBRON JAMES
Incoming LeBron James season saver?     Seems only fitting.
"The Anthony Davis camp is the same as the LeBron James camp, so yeah no shit they’d cross those teams off “AD’s” list. "
I guess Lance has been the hot hand so they go to him???? They do have Lebron james tho
LeBron James Harden
"Only big free agent we have signed these last 2 decades are Lebron James, 40 year old Karl Malone and 35 year old Gary Payton lol"
"“Lakers always get the big free agents” when we got Lebron James (the biggest feee agent we got in the last 15 years) says the guy who signed LaMarcus Aldridge like 3 years ago. Let be real, Pop is salty Kobe would destroy them come playoff time and cost him 2-3 rings and hates the lakers for it and refuses to let us ever be good again because of it."
LeBron James: still bad at free throws
"This guy literally tweeted this today.   ""LeBron James Injury Is “More Complex."" A return between February 7th vs. Boston Celtics and February 10th vs. Philadelphia 76ers is a good bet."""
"Its sneaky that you posted those figures without the Warriors ones to compare, smart. They are beating you in nearly half of those and only trailing behind marginally in most of the others. If you believe marginally better advanced stats are what makes teams better, LeBron James wouldn't have made 8 straight finals. The best teams have the best talent which also works well together, and that's the GSW. Also, Golden State is in a harder conference with only one team with fewer than 20 wins, whereas there are 4 in the east. They play twice as many games against on average harder opponents, so I would argue the fact they are only trailing in losses to an eastern conference team as quite impressive. "
"Hello, I began watching the National Basketball Association just 3 weeks ago. Is this LeBron James a good addition to the Lakers?"
"Your team has been very bad for a good while and your front office had nothing to do with Lebron James coming. Just your name and your market.  Like seriously, we could've swapped front offices for the past 5 years and you'd still have Lebron and AD would still be leaving. "
"You can't spout off collusion until you have actual proof of it. Charles Barkley has condemned the Lakers with zero proof of anything. The Lakers signed Lebron James, which obviously puts Rich Paul in their world seeing as he's Lebron's agent, among other players. If Anthony Davis wants out of NOLA, what's the problem? That's his choice as a human being in this modern age. He's not an indentured slave to the Pelicans. He's not their property. He can choose to play wherever he wants because of how talented he is, and that's his right.  Whether it's the Lakers or the Orlando Magic, it doesn't matter where he wants to go. He's asking for a trade, and he will obviously honor the contract he is signed to. After that, it's up to him. The Pelicans don't have to trade him to the Lakers, and Rich Paul was very clear about that in the beginning. Just because he gets traded to say the Trailblazers, for example, doesn't mean he is somehow now forced to sign a new contract to stay there.  Charles Barkley is always proving he's one of the dumbest guys in the room. All you have to do is wait for him to open his mouth and he proves it every time."
"you mean like when the heat choked against the mavs with lebron james and chris bosh on the roster?  didn't even get to game 7.  at least when harden lost it was because the other team has far superior talent. but i'm sure wade would've beat the warriors all by himself, right?"
In order:   Lebron James  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo
"It's also LEBRON FUCKING JAMES. He worked his ass off and is one of the greatest players ever. Luka can fall off and never be an all star. r/NBA is rediculous when it comes to young players and their career trajectory. There's been countless players like MCW, Tyreke, Okafor who couldn't progress properly."
"*Lebron James hits ft 1/2*  ""James Lebron hits the three...""  *... min later*  ""oh they are saying it's a l-long two"""
"He is a good rim protector, sure that is more impactful from a team standpoint but Klay literally broke two three point records this season and had a 52 point game. 22/4/2 with all time shooting vs 15/12/2 with DPOY defense is not a landslide either way, you can choose either player and be fine.    I can't say Gobert is better because he is good at blocking shots and getting rebounds.   And lol at Rudy Gobert being top 12. Here are 12 better players, not necessarily in order  1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Wardell Stephen Curry 4. James Harden 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Giannis A. 7. Anthony Davis  8. Paul George 9. Russell Westbrook 10. Joel Embiid  11. Nikola Jokic 12. Kyrie Irving  And I can keep going "
"Not in any particular order, but I’d say: Paul George Lebron James Kevin Durant Stephen Curry  Giannis Antetenkounmpo"
"Our main free agent targets have been: Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, Deron Williams, Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James..."
"A star? Can they def can’t get an All Star starter  LeBron James (captain)  Kevin Durant (UFA)  Paul George  Stephen Curry  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo   Kawhi Leonard (UFA)  Joel Embiid  Kyrie Irving (UFA)  Kemba Walker (UFA)  Reserves?   They could get Aldridge, Beal (maybe), Lowry, or an expiring Vucci mane.   Davis isn’t getting equal value at fucking all especially from someone actually playing right now. Their best shot is whatever picks and players Danny decides to acquiesce to. "
Ye winner cuz it has lebron james moron
Lakers did the same exact thing last year and they only got Lebron James 😂😂😂
The role of A&amp;R has three main responsibilities:  1) Finding talent 2) Overseeing the recording process 3) Assisting with marketing and promotion  source: https://www.musiccareers.net/industry-terms/a-and-r/  Really a genius business move by 2 Chainz to get LeBron James to be the head promoter for his album called ‘Rap Or Go To The League’. 
"Lebron James? They play the same position, have almost identical stats, and are regarded as the best players in the league. Or are you saying playing style?"
Talent wins out in the end and those Hawks teams never had remotely as anyone as good as Giannis. The Bucks as a whole are a lot more talented. That 60 win Hawks team was not going to beat Lebron James in a playoff series especially when their best player was Paul fucking Millsap.
"Considering that two losing record teams will likely make the playoffs this year out of the East, it's no stretch to say that the Bucks could make it without Giannis. The cut off is probably 38-44.   Giannis however elevates that team to championship contention. The team is built around him. He dominant on both ends, and his lack of jumpshooting isn't a problem when he's an able passer surrounded by snipers. As a defensive unit, they work really well together as well.  On Harden's side, considering CP3 and Capela's injuries, EG's sudden inability to shoot, and a whole lot of new faces in the team both before and during the season, I think the Rockets would be in Phoenix territory this year without James. James is having an unprecedented year in terms of points, assists, and shooting efficiency. It's an all-time great offensive season.  Looking at a player in the context of their team always seems to be a questionable angle. You could argue that MVP means whoever is most valuable to their team, but in that case LeBron should have won it. That's why it's tough for me to rate that factor, even though it's the one that's brought up the most.  Both players have great cases to win MVPs and would have it locked up in many other years. Unlucky for Harden if he loses it that this would be the third time he's had an unbelievable season only to rup against someone who has had an equally unbelievable season."
plot twist: u/good_newseveryone is lebron james
[LeBron James has entered the chat]
&gt;being dismayed that this was the team that he was surrounded with.    Lebron has pretty high expectations.  Sometimes he forgets that the people he plays with aren't Lebron fuckin James.
In 2018-2019 the Los Angeles Lakers blew one season of LeBron James' prime.
"Not athletic or big enough now. Esp in the east vs Ben/Tobias, Morris, Ibaka/Siakam. He played pf in the Cavs series because the Cavs 3 pt defense was horrific and only got by through the strength of Lebron James"
"Hell no.  Lebron was NOT universally loved and respected with the Heat. The majority of the fans, media, and especially former legendary players didn't respect Lebron fully.  Go back to Feb 2014 and Lebron said he was going to be a Top4 player some day (Rushmore).  The former players, media, and fans went crazy. And this was AFTER Lebron already won 2 titles in Miami.  Go see what KAJ said about Lebron:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1980690-kareem-abdul-jabbar-obliterates-lebron-james-nba-mount-rushmore  KAJ, Barkely, and Bill Russell all destroyed Lebron for saying that.  It was until Lebron won a chip for Cleveland did he become a made man in the eyes of the NBA legends.  If Lebron never won a chip in Cleveland hardly anyone would even rank him in the top5 all time let alone GOAT."
"Points per drive is probably the better indicator.    Joe only shoots 0.4 FTA per drive.  Which means he's getting solid looks on cuts.   Which is still great.  Players that can cut effectively and take advantage of offensive execution are GREAT to have.  Including free throws made, points per drive leaders for the top 100 drivers (by # of drives per game), would be:   * T.J. Warren * Blake Griffin * Kevin Durant * Bojan Bogdanovic * Kyle Kuzma  Kawhi sneaks in as 6th.  If limited to the 42 guys that drive 10 or more times a game, the top 5 would be:  * Kawhi Leonard * Zach LaVine * LeBron James * James Harden * Caris LeVert  Giannis sneaks in as 6th.  Bledsoe is 26th.  Beal is 13th.  Ingles is 38th of those 42 guys.  As none of the guys in the second group are in the first, I'm assuming there is definitely some diminishing return to volume.. Eg. the more you drive, the less likely you are to produce as high a points per drive.  Makes sense.  Ultimately, this is an argument for Kawhi, as he's has REALLY HIGH points per possession at VERY MEANINGFUL volume (14 drives a game).    Of course all that said, we could factor in AST %s as well.  Kawhik has a 6.8% assist % on his drives.  Whereas Ingles is at 13.9%.  In essence, Ingles is doing a lot of running, cutting, shooting open layups or passing along to the next open guy in the offense. Bledsoe also has a high assist %, 13.1% on his drives.   In an effort to COMPLETELY make up a stat, I ranked all 42 guys first by PointsPerDrive and second by AST %.  Then I created a made up combined ranking, by multiplying the PPDrive rank by 75% and AST% by 25%.  The top 5, then, are:  * James Harden * LeBron James * Kawhi Leonard * Lou Williams * Kyrie Irving  If I wanted to put more emphasis on scoring efficiency, and changed the formula to multiple each ranking by 50% (so equal weighting), the top 5 become:  * James Harden * LeBron James * Lou Williams * Devin Booker * De'Aaron Fox  There you have it... random made up stat fun!      "
&gt;	First off I think as of today Lebron Ramone James is the GOAT  Don’t fall for it guys. This kid is a troll that shits on lebron at any opportunity he gets. 
"This is wrong... I hate to use the ""You need to play ball to understanr"" phrase, but its fitting to use here. ""Clutch"" isn't something that can be measured with stats.   Also you seem to think that clutch means how you perform when its close and towards the end of the game, but there are more instances of having to be clutch. For example look at Serge Ibaka's And-1 in Milwaukee when they were on a run. They clawed back into the game, and if he had missed that it would have fully shifted the game to the Bucks. That right there is clutch and can't be measured with stats.  Also there's no way anyone can sit there and tell me with a straight face that DeMar DeRozan and LeBron James are the same when it comes to crunch time. Clutch doesn't mean playing better in crunch time, it means how you handle mental stress and your mentality when you're under pressure. Some players can handle this well (LeBron for eg) and other can't. It definitely exists.  "
Lebron James would beg to differ

"ah how people are divorced from reality.   &amp;#x200B;  Does no one remember the Pacers series? When PG got a concussion the Pacers had the lead and PG was keeping Lebron James in check. After his concussion, when you watch the highlights, it was obvious he was dizzy as lebron started getting easy buckets.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Pacers likely win that game if no concussion.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Game 5.. the game was fixed without a doubt.

"&gt;Literally nobody thought Lebron was better than Kobe in 2008.  Except for the guy who gave LeBron a 1st place vote.   &gt;Advanced stats are so fucking retarded.  You don't need advanced stats to see that LeBron averaged more points, rebounds, assists, and blocks.  Kobe won because his team was better, not because he was the best player.  Here's John Hollinger [explaining](https://www.nysun.com/sports/without-question-lebron-is-leagues-best-player/72508/) LeBron's superiority in March 2008:  &gt;LeBron James is the best player in the league, period, and is likely to hold that honor for at least the next half-decade. The items in his favor are too voluminous to detail in just one corner of one page of one newspaper, but allow me to briefly hit on the highlights.  We can start with the basics, like how he's leading the league in scoring at 30.6 points per game. Or how, in addition to his scoring, he averages more assists than any other player in the top 12. Or, we can talk about his 8.1 rebounds per game, tops in the league among perimeter players.  One can take it a step further and look at his near-triple-double averages. Nobody has averaged more than 30 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists per game since Michael Jordan in 1988–89, and that was the only time even the exalted Jordan came close to that accomplishment.  Yet it's the more complex stats that really underscore just how dominant James has been."

Man you know who else is ball dominant? LeBron James. He and Kyrie could probably never work out together and find any success.

I think the obvious rebuttal is Lebron James. He's shown he can carry a rag tag group of guys and 100% thrives when surrounded by shooters. 
"You need to stop comparing Lebron's joining the Heat to KD's joining the Warriors. They're miles different. Lebron teamed up with Bosh and D-Wade in Miami, joining a 47-win Heat team. Yes, they lost to Dirk in the finals, but they had growing pains and had to figure out how to play with each other. Next two years, two championships.  &amp;#x200B;  KD joined a team with 3x All-Stars and the reigning unanimous MVP, a team that had just set an NBA record for most regular-season wins in HISTORY. That team was fucking insane, and then they added who you called a top 2/3 player in the league.  &amp;#x200B;  I refuse to say that anyone is currently better than Lebron James, and he is not even as good as he was in 2013/2014. THAT'S how good Lebron James is."
"Stop officiating the game differently for star players.  Everyone rips James Harden but it isn’t just him. Kobe was given titles, LeBron literally had his own rulebook in Miami, when he was in OKC Durant really bought the cheat ass rip move back into the game  to the multitude it’s at now (D Wade was doing it first. But no one really followed suit)   I guess I’m just into real basketball. But it disgusts me to see guys that can dunk with ease taking 5 steps to dunk, guys shoving people so hard they almost get whiplash to create space on a dribble move, someone shot faking from 35 feet, then practically assaulting a defender and somehow getting free throws etc.   The game is far more entertaining when the rules are enforced, because then you see who’s a star and who is pretending.

"The whole playoff series was surreal. Overcoming the Portland Trailblazers who had Brandon Roy, Gerald Wallace, Andre Miller, LaMarcus Alfridge, Wesley Matthews and Marcus Camby. They were a power team.  Then the second round they overcame the Lakers who had a prime Kobe, Lamar Odom, Pau Gasol, Derek Fisher, Phil Jackson.  Then they faced OKC, who had prime Durant, Westbrook and James Harden.  And to top it off they face the Miami Heat with prime Bron, prime Wade, prime Bosh.  And to think that all wasnt crazy enough, the way Jason Terry and Jason Kidd stopped Lebron was something nobody even dared to think about. They decided to just not defend him. They decided, hey we are going to give you as much space as you want. They dared him shoot shoot shoot all you like!  It was a fascinating crazy time those playoffs were unbelievable."
"Going purely by first place votes for DPOY, Michael Jordan outmatches LeBron James 71 to 30.  And keep in mind both the fact that there were no second or third place votes in DPOY when MJ played. It was 1st place or nothing.  Along with the fact that the point difference and amount of voters are drastically higher now than when MJ played. When LeBron was closest to winning DPOY in 2013, there were a total of 605 possible points with 121 first place votes. When MJ WON DPOY, the max amount of points was 80."

"&gt; There was a study done last year  Citation needed.  &gt; The 3 teams that challenged the Warriors in the Kerr era: 2016 OKC, 2016 Cleveland, 2018 Rockets. What do they all have in common? Ran a ton of ISOball  No.  &gt; Durant and Westbrook  The Thunder ran lots of really nice team ball *with ball movement*, and then blew games - all season, but especially in the WCF - with late-game isoball stagnation. Isoball is how they *lost*.  &gt; James and Irving  No. The 2016 Cavaliers did not rely on isoball either. LeBron James and Kyrie Irving had usage rates in the playoffs comparable to those of Steph Curry and Kevin Durant on this year's Warriors, and LeBron James's AST% was *higher*. This is despite Durant's USG% being slightly inflated by the stretch in which a third of the Warriors roster, including Curry and Green, was injured and Durant iso was in fact a significant part of the Warriors offense.  The Rockets did have to depend on Harden iso, particularly after Chris Paul was injured, and... they lost.  The only team that actually *beat* the Warriors was the Cleveland Cavaliers, and you are just completely wrong about how their offense worked.  I see you have a Warriors flair. Way to live up to the stereotype that Warriors fans are bandwagoners who didn't watch the team at all before Kevin Durant joined."

The bulls were in a completely different scenario, they had a pretty good team outside of Jordan and once he left of course they were gonna sign new people.   Also I want to add the heat did not start immediately tanking. They had 37 wins which isn’t great but isn’t outright tanking. "
LeBron James is not even close to being the GOAT. Idk why this opinion always gets upvoted. 
"&gt;Really, anything that offers benefits to the team when they lose can be abused, but how do you help a team that is legit trying to win but just sucks?  &amp;#x200B;  Why should we help a team that sucks? I honestly think the real answer is to get rid of the salary cap and max contracts so teams can compete in free agency rather than everyone only being able to offer the max for a player like Steph curry or LeBron James.

"This makes absolutely no sense. The cavs both times had to tank because the team was trash outside of lebron James. The bulls didn’t need to tank because, as their record shows, they had a very good team outside Michael Jordan. It’s not like the cavs wanted to tank, it’s just they had no chance of winning anything with the team minus lebron. "

I try not to identify as any specific race because I don’t need to. I’ve been successful without doing that. One might say I’m “self made”  Also, if Lebron is such a stand up guy, why did he make the claims that racists vandalized his house (there’s no evidence of his claims. Feel free to research and send me any evidence you find. I’d love to see some. I’d love to change my mind on that matter). He also helped to promote the false “hands up, don’t shoot” narrative (that never happened. I’m assuming you know that, though). Also, Lebron actively supported a person who called young black males “super predators” and laughed when she got a person she knew raped someone out of going to prison, but I’m sure those are just some crazy conspiracy theory, right?

"[Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/62m5po/what_are_your_top_10_nba_players_of_all_time/?st=JSBBDKVK&amp;sh=07ae788a) just a random “top 10 all time” thread here I found from a quick google search. Note where Shaq is on all those lists. Or don’t because I’ll tell you - he’s all over the bottom half of the top ten. It’s the same story basically everywhere you can find these lists. You may not believe he’s top 10 all time, but you’re the minority.  Summarising basketball as “Scoring &gt; playmaking &gt; playoff experience” (and ignoring defence or rebounding I guess) is not a good way to go about showing Kawhi is a better player than somebody who’s always been a better playmaker and has been a better scorer for the last two years.  If you don’t like paint scoring percentages, we can just look at TS%. 63.8% for Giannis, 60.7% for Kawhi. Guess that’s not in his favour either.  I’d say contesting more shots *on the perimeter* as a 7 foot PF compared to a 6’7 SF, and doing a better job of it, is pretty noteworthy, especially when even you aren’t claiming Kawhi is a better interior defender. Don’t know how you expect 7 footers to be doing more on the perimeter than wings, given that’s not usually a thing that ever happens outside of literally two guys in the entire league.  DPOY is absolutely based in part on team performance. AD is getting no love this year, because his team’s defence is shit. Giannis didn’t even make an All-D team last year but he’s a DPOY contender this year and just about guaranteed a 1st team All-D spot because the team’s defence went from bottom 10 to 1st. But in any case, we’re talking about who the better player is *now*. Tyson Chandler won a DPOY too, is he a better defender than Giannis *now*?  Of course Giannis has an absolutely enormous genetic advantage over Kawhi. He has a genetic advantage over everybody in the league not named LeBron James. That doesn’t really tell you anything about who the better player is. Kawhi has a genetic advantage over Kemba Walker, does that make them comparable players?  There’s a very fair argument for Kawhi over Giannis, but nothing you’re saying has any relevance to that. You’re throwing out half-baked ideas that don’t even help your case while dismissing both consensus opinions and actual statistical facts out of hand for no apparent reason."

#LEBRON JAMES HARDEN
"If​ you watched the​ All-Star Game on Sunday,​ you​ saw it. Couldn’t miss it.​ And​ since these things start happening​ years​ out,​​ through careful planning, it’s safe to start thinking about this now. Because you know the Warriors are thinking about this now.  Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2021.  Let’s pause right here to let the enjoy-this-Warriors-season crowd let out their yells. To be honest, I’m with them on that. There is a point where looking ahead becomes too much. There can and should be more focus on the games.  But this is the All-Star break. So we have a window of freedom here. Most importantly, we can’t ignore what we just witnessed on television:  The chemistry between Stephen Curry and Giannis.  Critical Point No. 1: This only matters if Kevin Durant decides to leave at the end of the season. Or stays on another short-term deal. If he signs long term, the Warriors will ride out their four All-Stars for many more seasons.  But the Warriors got Durant because they had scenarios mapped out years in advance. They got themselves in position to make a play. You can bet front-office utility man David Kelly, the Warriors’ general counsel and salary-cap guru, has mapped out all possible roads from whatever decision Durant makes.  A year ago, my colleague and boss, Tim Kawakami, wrote that Anthony Davis was the next apple of the Warriors’ eye. But things change and Davis’ timetable probably doesn’t match the Warriors’ next chance at a big move. It’s gotta be Giannis now. After Durant wears the crown this summer, Giannis will be the league’s next huge free-agent target, with his current Milwaukee deal set to expire in July 2021.  Curry, Giannis and Klay Thompson: that’s a viable reset if Durant leaves. It’s possible. It would first require Giannis wanting to play with the Warriors.  Tell me you didn’t get a sense he’d want this from the All-Star festivities.  That ridiculous alley-oop between them created an All-Star moment for the ages. It was the highlight of the whole event: Curry with a bounce-lob to Giannis.  Also, Curry was Giannis’ first choice in the All-Star draft. Not James Harden or Kyrie Irving, not Paul George or Kawhi Leonard. That said something. Just like LeBron James has said something the last two All-Star drafts by picking Durant first. These selections are morsels of insight into these stars’ thinking and brotherhood.  Can’t you see the sparks in Giannis’ eyes watching Curry’s game-closing dunk on Sunday?  I kid. But there is no questioning that Curry and Giannis fit together, on the court and off. Throw in Thompson and those two shooters spreading the floor to give him open driving space would be a dream for Giannis.  How could this happen? Nothing’s for free, especially for the Warriors. It’d cost Draymond Green.  Curry is due to make $45.8 million in 2021-22. When he hits free agency in July 2021, Giannis would be set to sign a max deal that starts at $42.6 million. That puts their combined number over $88 million. The current salary-cap projection for 2021-22 is $123.9 million.  So those two would eat up more than 70 percent of the cap by themselves. If, as expected, he signs a max extension with the Warriors this coming July, Thompson would be on board for $37.9 million for 2021-22, which would put the Warriors very near the projected cap number with three players.  Which means that if the Warriors are aiming for another superstar, there would be no room for Green. That’s where it gets difficult, emotionally and financially.  Green is set to be a free agent in the summer of 2020 — a year before Giannis becomes a free agent. So if the Warriors re-sign Green, it could doom their chances for Giannis the next July. Or the Warriors would have to know they could trade Draymond in 2021 to clear space, just like they did with Andrew Bogut in 2016 when they needed to clear space for Durant.  If you start hearing that the Warriors are offering Green a big two-year extension this summer, you know they are setting up for the 2021 free agency. If they sign Green to a three-year extension this offseason, he’d have two years on his contract when the Warriors would theoretically need to get rid of his salary for the Giannis chase in 2021. Is that movable? But if, at that point, Draymond only had one year left — the same amount of time Bogut had when they shipped him to Dallas in July 2016 — Green would be much easier to deal.  So yes, it’s complicated. But it’s the same way the Durant plans were complicated for the Warriors years before July 2016.  There is also a drastic measure that could be taken to set up a 2021 attempt at Giannis. I don’t think the Warriors would do it. But it’s so risky.  The Warriors could choose not to extend Green’s deal, which, again, expires in the summer of 2020, and clear him completely from the cap a year before Antetokounmpo’s free agency.  How could you not keep Green? Especially if Durant has already left, don’t the Warriors have to keep Green? You definitely can’t lose him for the mere chance of landing another star in the future. That would set the Warriors up for a down year before the summer of 2021. To lose Durant for nothing already would hurt them enough. To also lose Green for nothing would be crippling.  But if the Warriors believe they have a real shot at Giannis in 2021, who knows what they might do and risks they might take to increase those odds?  Critical Point No. 2: None of this matters if Milwaukee jumps into championship contention or wins one before July 2021, which would greatly reduce the possibility of Giannis wanting to leave.  As we’ve seen with Anthony Davis in New Orleans, it is tough for small-market teams to compete against the magnetism of big-market champions. But the Bucks currently have the best record in the league and could make it to the NBA Finals if everything breaks right for them. If.  The more likely result, though, is that the Bucks bow out early because they don’t have enough top-end talent. Milwaukee has some good players and obviously one great one. But the Bucks look right now like they need another star to pair with Giannis if they want to take down Philadelphia, Boston and Toronto.  So if the Bucks lose in the early rounds for a few more years after losing in the first round last year, the pressure will turn up on the front office. If they don’t reach the Finals in 2020 and Giannis doesn’t have a co-star with him, the noise about Giannis’ impending departure will be deafening (the same way Davis asked for a trade this season, more than a year before his contract is set to expire). The Bucks might even consider trading Giannis instead of losing him if they haven’t been able to build a title contender around him.  If the Bucks can capitalize on this window of opportunity, their chances of keeping Giannis beyond 2021 improve significantly. Giannis showed that he prefers to take down the current stars when he declined to work out with LeBron James and others last summer. From what we know of Giannis, he’d want the challenge of raising Milwaukee to championship status.  But that doesn’t last forever, especially in smaller markets. (See: Durant, Davis and, long ago, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who leveraged his way out of Milwaukee and landed with the Lakers.) And the chance to be with elite players on an elite team, where the Finals is the goal, will be enticing.  When that time comes, the Warriors, you can bet, will be ready. If they lose Durant.  Wait, is there a scenario where they can have Curry, Durant and Giannis? Hmmmmm.  "

The idea being that because Kobe scored a lot, and most of you kiddies don't know any better, that was his best season.  Fine, fuck it... that's his best season.  A season in which he played 41 minutes per game and took 27 shots per night.  Lol.    A season in which he lead his team to 45 wins and a 1st round exit.  **""Peak Kobe""**  Pure inflated stats.  He shot 45% from the field, 35% from three and 85% from the line.      We're just talking pure stats, right fellas?  Well pure stats (points + assists + rebounds + steals + blocks - missed shots and turnovers) would have put his number (27.83) as 5th in the league that season behind KG (30.3), LeBron (29.4), and others.

If you let those other guys jack up 27 shots and 41 minutes per night, they'd easily surpass the inflated bullshit 35ppg during Kobe's ""peak"" given that the majority of those players shoot significantly more efficiently than Kobe.   Downvote me.  I'm right.  The overrating of Kobe on this sub is ridiculous.

You got Paul George way too high he’s having one hell of a season but to say he’s six spots ahead of LeBron James? Nah bruh 
&gt; number 1 pick they might not have deserved  absolutely love entitled fans. who did actually deserve him? the Lakers perhaps?  &gt;a franchise that can realistically win  we've been absolutely shit for 5 years straight and we might now miss the playoffs with LeBron James on the team (a feat thought impossible barely a year ago). Please just shut the fuck up

"You are the one creating these narratives for me, I never said my opinion on Lebron James because it's irrelevant. I'm not the one saying them. You just continue to prove how intellectually small you are. It's all good though, Tyler. I'm sure your parents are proud of you regardless. "
"Prime Kobe is probably the closest to what James Harden is now.  If you think Harden is in front of LeBron and KD, then this makes sense."
Prime Kobe’s better than 34 year old Lebron or James harden
"Who do you think owns NBA teams ? Do you think Mark Cuban gives a flying fuck if the mavs don’t turn a profit every year? The teams are merely billionaires play things, and the game they play is zero sum. You think anyone is gonna go in with the lakers with Lebron James on the team? You are delusional."
"LeBron James broke his whiteboard of the Cleveland Cavaliers and sighed. It was another disappointment, not even 24 hours after one of the most frustrating nights in his career. There was no silver lining in the injury. He would have to play the series with a broken hand."
"Still missing the point. They've already done that. What's the point of moving their families, leaving Cleveland, seeking growth from what they had, then just re-joining up in another uniform?    Kyrie didn't want to be in Lebron's shadow. Which is why the recent news is that he called Lebron to apologize. https://nesn.com/2019/02/lebron-james-opens-up-about-phone-call-he-received-from-kyrie-irving/"
"I didn’t watch in the 80s or 90s because I wasn’t alive. I read the book of basketball though and I know a lot about the games history. Still, the players that immediately stand out are Bird, Magic, Kareem, Hakeem, MJ, maybe Stockton or Malone but not really. From the 00’s I think of Shaq, Kobe, Duncan, and LeBron for sure. With that in mind, I think generational talents are really only 1 or 2 players per 5 year stretch.   The next gen of generational talents, to me, are Kevin Durant (being a 7 foot shooting guard makes him obviously one of the best scorers of all time), Steph Curry (best shooter of all time and it’s  not close), and James Harden (completely adapted ISO offense to compete with some of the best offenses of all time, similar to what Kobe was doing in the 00s but without championship fortune). Westbrook is on the edge but held back by his shooting, AD is on the edge but unfortunately unproven (like KG), Giannis is IMO the best bet to earn his way into this list."
"as SI writes, ""As with Durant’s pursuit of Bird mentioned above, “Magic or Steph?” will become a regularly-discussed and hotly-debated topic by 2020.""  https://www.si.com/nba/2018/09/07/nba-hall-of-fame-lakers-warriors-rockets-thunder-lebron-james-kevin-durant"

"More points, more rebounds, less turnovers.  Lebron averaged 3.5 TOs in the 2015 finals (his career average) with a 40% usage rate. When Westbrook had a 40% during the 2017 season he averaged 5.4 TOs per game. James Harden has a 40% usage rate now and is averaging 5.4 TOs as well."
I'll fix it for you LeBron James clearly isn't a veteran player for developing young players.
"Yes he exceeded it. Not just on the court but off the court as well.   If you were writing an almanac documenting the most significant Americans of the past 50 years, you would have to include something on Lebron James."
"We are at a Lakers workout right now, by the way. LeBron James just ran off the court."
It's terribly composed team. Almost no line up compliments each other.  Even with Lebron James in which is crazy.
"It's really hard to tell for certain but given the environments both find themselves in it's hard to argue against.  I mean Walton hasn't exactly shown that he's a brilliant coach or anything, but, Kuzma has at least had the great fortune of playing with willing facilitators in Ball, Rondo and LeBron freaking James.  Markannen has had to work with Fred Hoidberg (who had the legs immediately cut out from under him) and Jim Boylen. Let that sink in Jim freaking Boylen. He's also had to operate on a far less talented team with far less capable playmakers (Chris Dunn and Zach Lavine for crying out loud). It's a minor miracle that he looks as good as he does given the circumstance.  That said when Kuzma gets going he doesn't just look good he looks really, really good. It remains to be seen if he can hit that level consistently. I can see the argument for both, but would lean Lauri if I had to place a wager on who ends up with a ""better individual career."""

"lmao you don't get to just have ""a wash"" with LeBron James.  Especially in the last few years of his prime."
I promise you. Lakers fans were the loudest most toxic group of people toward the Cavs during the 11 years he was here.   If you guys can't find success with LeBron James your franchise is truly doomed.
ITT: Lakers fans rationalizing that this is the best thing that happened to their franchise since...signing LeBron James.
Last time the Celtics won a championship was when Lebron James lost at least 35 games in a season. This season is all going according to plan
"I remember reading that. I knew what article OP referred to before opening the link.  Rereading it, I found this little gem:  &gt; “When you ask coaches what’s better between a 28 percent 3-point shot and a 42 percent midrange shot, they’ll say the 42 percent shot,” Rucker says. “And that’s objectively false. It’s wrong. If LeBron James just jacked a 3 on every single possession, that’d be an exceptionally good offense. That’s a conversation we’ve had with our coaching staff, and let’s just say they don’t support that approach.”  &gt; The coaches aren’t even close to being onboard with such a 3-happy philosophy yet.  Raptors should have fired Casey then, not 5 years later.  When you have stats and numbers clearly showing you a better way, and you dismiss them just because, you are actually detrimental to your team."
"&gt;Contract negotiations between the Cleveland Cavaliers and free agent LeBron James haven't begun, according to ESPN's Brian Windhorst.

Paul represents both Thompson and the four-time NBA MVP.  &gt;ESPN originally reported that Thompson and the Cavs had ""essentially come to terms"" on a five-year, $80 million contract on the first day of free agency.

Michael Jordan is the best basketball player but LeBron James is very good too. Larry Bird is also really good at basketball and would be really good today. 
"I want to be clear here, though - I'm not disagreeing with you. The GM's job is to make the best team, and making LeBron unhappy is a recipe for failure in that regard. That is a vastly different statement from ""LeBron recruits people and makes trade deals"". It's vastly different from ""LeBron gets what he wants"". That's all I'm saying - LeGM and ""Happy LeBron James is good for your basketball team"" are very different ways to spin the same facts."
I sure would love trading Zion for aging Lebron James.  I wouldn't be mad at all.
"If the argument is Jordan &gt; LeBron &gt; Kobe, what does LeBron do better than Kobe but not better than Jordan?  Nothing.  It is common basketball hoopla for people to jump LeBron over Kobe, and it's really not fair.  &amp;#x200B;  LeBron is 3/9 in the Finals, with multiple Finals in which he choked/underperformed/did not play optimally and did not play defense. He has had more help through his career than Kobe has. In multiple Finals, he has been sagged off of and as a result struggled to make open jumpers, resulting in less aggression or less efficiency (see 2007 Finals, 2011 Finals, 2013 Finals, 2015 Finals) and hasn't played defense since the 2014 Finals even on the biggest stage.  Kobe dominated a tougher Western Conference holding the most wins against 50 + win teams than anyone else and is the only player with 3 straight postseasons scoring 600 points in each.   Give Kobe a single all Star in Pau Gasol, he will deliver you to 3 straight Finals and 2 titles. Give LeBron 2 All Stars (one being a superstar), and he can't even get the most out of both of them, and he's still not a guarantee to win the Finals.  In LeBron's 8 straight Finals, the toughest opponents he's ever had to face in the East were the aging Celtics and MVP Rose who was the lone star on his team. All the teams that have beaten LeBron, Kobe had beaten (Spurs, Magic, Celtics), and in the West (latter run) beat the likes of Carmelo + AI/Billups, Deron Williams + Boozer, Duncan + Parker + Ginobli, Nash + Stoudamire, and a young but deadly trio of Durant + Westbrook + Harden.  &amp;#x200B;  LeBron plays, in what we know as, the LeBron system, where it is a literal iso/pick and roll system where LeBron dominates the ball and is surrounded by shooters to spread the floor for him. This kind of offensive attack is iso-heavy and easy to defend by elite teams, so when it comes to him facing off against elite teams in the Finals, it makes sense why he would struggle. Furthermore, only very few times in LeBron's career has a team led by him placed in the top 10 in assists. In this regard, he stands out compared to other championship teams who have an emphasis on ball movement and consistently elevating the play of role players.   LeBron's lack of ability to be an elite off-ball player feeds into the LeBron system as it is the best way to get the best use out of him. Both of these enable defensive gameplans to properly suppress him or his team, and this is seen in his Finals record.  Kobe does not have these flaws, he could play in any system, and would not relegate the likes of Kevin Love or Chris Bosh to be floor spreaders for him, but instead, would know how to get the most out of them and have them play at their best.  &amp;#x200B;  What about MVPs? The MVP is a HORRIBLE metric to gauge players. One, it is a narrative, subjective, award that is given out inconsistently.  Additionally, when we say ""Oh LeBron wins the MVP"", we subconciously throw out the body of work that every other great player achieved in that same year. LeBron wins the MVP in 2009, we ignore Kobe's 67-15 season. Steve Nash wins the MVP in 2006, we ignore Kobe being the first player since MJ to average 35 PPG in a season. If anything, it is much more accurate to look at the accumulation of MVP votes/points throughout their respective seasons and you will find that Kobe Bryant is neck-and-neck virtually tied with LeBron James. So instead of LeBron has 4 MVPs to Kobe's 1, its more of something along the lines of LeBron has 240 MVP points while Kobe has 200.  &amp;#x200B;  Oh but Kobbe played with Shaq, and he wasn't the best player on his team. But we don't penalize Kareem or Magic for playing with each other? Or what about Duncan? There were times in which Parker or Ginobli were the MVPs of their Finals. Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars? This talking point is clear bias and is only applied to Kobe, not to anyone else. And for further context, Shaq dominated the Finals because the East had inferior competition at the big man spots. It was the gameplan in which Kobe sacrificed his touches to feed Shaq. But in the West against better teams with better big men, Kobe outscored Shaq in those series matchups and was every bit as dominant. But again we only like to look at the Finals MVP, which ends up disregarding the body of work done in the previous 3 rounds which are every bit as important.  Oh but LeBron beat a 73-9 team, well guess what? Kobe + Shaq was the equivalent of a 73-9 team in the 2001 Playoffs with a record of 15-1, and Jordan WAS the 73-9 (72 - 10) team.  &amp;#x200B;  TL:DR Kobe is a more talented player on offense and defense, has achieved more with less, beaten teams LeBron could not beat, dominated a much tougher conference (7 Finals in 11 years), and is able to fit under any system and can be coached. There is no defensive gameplan that can actually keep Kobe down, but such a plan does exist for LeBron. Kobe's only ""flaw"" in his game is his shot selection and aggression while LeBron's flaws consist of being an inconsistent outside shooter, making him a poor off-ball player, which leads to him needing to dominate the ball in order to compete. The MVP talking point or ""he played with Shaq"" are talking point are based in biases that do not give proper context to reality. "
"""Kobe is the most underrated player of all time""-Clyde Drexler   It's crazy how underrated kobe is, this sub is a joke. Lebron failing yet again is not really going to change how delusional his fans are when they want to say he's better than kobe or worse try and compare him to michael jordan.     The irony is astounding. Lebron at 34 years old has put himself in a position squarely similar to Kobe's at 34 and is failing. He won't get this team to the playoffs and they had a better record when he announced ""playoff mode"" then when Kobe *guaranteed* a playoff birth for the lakers and proceeded to play so hard he got injured.   The Lakers were 25-29 in 2013 when kobe guaranteed they'd make the playoffs, kobe went crazy, they made the playoffs.    The lakers are 30-35 now and have lost 3 or 4 straight since lebron said he activated his ""playoff mode"" maybe even were above 500. at the time.     This is the same year in 2013 when michael jordan selected kobe over lebron and kobe as a veteran proceeded to embarrass lebron at the all star game.

"What are the actually chances the Lakers give Brandon Ingram a max after next season? Because if the Lakers don't, someone else will. I don't think any of the young guys like playing with LeBron (because they know they aren't there long term) and they all miss what they had going last season. LeBron James just seems like a passive aggressive team mate who you can't trust because you know he is only out for him self."
"Since it seems like ppl forgot how good a defender he was before he was like in year 15, 16.   Here is the blurb about LeBron.   &gt; Ultra-aggressive help defense is really hard work. Replay that clip and watch how far DeRozan’s ghost has to move as the Knicks swing the ball. That’s brutal, and it’s not a coincidence that the only team that consistently mirrors the help defense of its ghosts is Miami, Rucker says. The Heat have three of the best wing defenders in the league in Shane Battier, LeBron James, and Dwyane Wade, and the latter two are among the NBA’s most gifted pure athletes. James can mimic DeRozan’s hyperactive ghost in a way no other player can, Rucker says. “LeBron basically messes up the system and the ghosts,” Rucker says. “He does things that are just unsustainable for most players.”"

"Especially when even if you account for opponent strength, Jordan still won more rings than expected over LeBron  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-should-lebrons-finals-record-hurt-his-legacy/  &gt; We can measure a player’s Finals record versus expectation by using FiveThirtyEight’s Elo ratings (which measure a team’s relative quality at any given moment) to calculate his teams’ pre-series odds of winning the Finals.   &gt; In fact, if you add up the pre-series odds in the table above, you get an expected championship count of 2.8 for James — meaning he’s somehow running 0.2 titles above expectation, despite his record. However, that trails Jordan (who won 1.9 times more than we’d expect from the pre-series odds)"
Lebron James needs lonzo ball to maybe make the playoffs 
"AD to Boston certainly isn’t set in stone, especially if Kyrie walks.   The Suns would love Lonzo and likely give a pick around 8-10 for him which could be used in a package for Beal.

And he's culpable for playing trash defense and looking basically infdifferent on the court at time this year.   &amp;#x200B;  This has nothing to do with Kobe or MJ. LeBron doesn't get a pass for this. When you want to self proclaim yourself GOAT, you're going to get this criticism in spades. This year is a terrible look for him. No debating that."
I know MJ wasnt the same and they weren't winning but there was something mythical about watching him play during the wizards era. That mid-range shot of his was still wet and I was still in awe because he was MJ. I watched the hell out of MJ's last All-Star game and thought he hit the game winning shot and was so happy for him but then Kobe went back and won the game. Im a huge Laker and Kobe fan and even I wanted MJ to win that game and go out on top. I dont feel the same way towards Lebron James and I don't think hes winning a championship in LA anytime soon. I feel bad for him and I think he should've went to a better basketball situation. LA is Kobe's town

" You know in watching LeBron James this year have to be the man on the Lakers at 34 years old it makes me think about how much better he would’ve fit on the Rockets. We see Chris Paul able to pick and choose his spots to do what he wants, even though he has a lot of talent and he’s an older player. The fit with LeBron would have been phenomenal, with Harden being otherwordly. Oh well."
How about LeBron James?
"Someone come get this nephew. I'm a Lebron R. James Stan by all standards, but the dude was injured for like 20 games, and he's still averaging his average average while he gets back up to speed...(IN FEWER MINS PLAYED)..BRUH WHAT?!"
getting rings as a bench player is NOT hard.  Ask guys like james jones who has THREE championship rings following lebron around

LeBron James 👉👉
"Who was the second best player for the Cavs that series? Who could have Lebron deferred to so they could take over a game like Klay did in game 2,  like the warriors bench did in game 3, and like Iggy and Draymond did in game 4.   The Cavs were running an 8 man rotation of Lebron, Delly, Shumpert, JR, Thompson, Mozgov, James Jones, and Mike Miller. Outside of lebron there are just as many current GM's in that rotation as there are current NBA starters. "
Lebron James and his posse/fans had to make Love seem lesser in order to make himself look better.   It doesn't look as nice when you realize you took a dude averaging 26/12.5/4.5 and forced him to become a spot up 3 point shooter because you can only play baskeball one way. 
LeBron James
"&gt; ""Michael Jordan could return to basketball and not score a single point over the span of 117 games and he would still average more points-per-game than LeBron James currently has for his career.""  lmao no shit, they just got even on points and that's their games played differential. Great insight.   Here's a fun fact, Jordan would have to average 33 assists per game in those 117 to catch LeBron's total "
Imma be different here and say.......... LEBRON JAMES
wow the disrespect to lebron james
"1. You could still effectively play zone, the application just became more liberal (and legal) once it was a proper rule change.  2. The big man was allowed to sit in the paint significantly more, but due to rules that didn't change until the early 2000's and the fact that there were vastly fewer stretch bigs along the lines of what we see today.   3. Hand checking made it dramatically more difficult to create separation off screens, as well as much easier to keep pace with and limit the acceleration of the offensive player. In modern terms, you could essentially say that the tactic existed specifically to counter LeBron James and Steph Curry.  4. In general, defenders could create significantly more contact around the rim without getting called for a foul. Yes superstar calls have always been a thing, but the impact is still meaningful. People claim that LeBron would thrive by being able to use more of his own physicality, but the things he's already allowed to do with his off hand to create space (which only a couple players can reliably get away with today) was already the extent of what you could do back then.  The modern NBA was explicitly designed to create players like LeBron, Kobe, Steph etc in order to fill the void left by Jordan. It's not a knock on anyone to suggest that going to an era where those rules didn't exist would change their production."
LeBron James for trying and failing to trade his entire team and causing the collapse of the Lakers season.
"Yeah, isn't that too conservative at this point? How many people really have Kareem or Wilt or Magic over LeBron James right now?"
"[The Athletic] LeBron james was throwing everything he had​ at the Clippers. That included​ a few​​ choice words for Patrick Beverley, who was yapping at both James and Lonzo Ball (who was on the bench)...Beverley berated them both. “Get to the fucking playoffs before you speak to me,” Beverley barked."
"damn, now my goat list is changed it is now currently GOATa- Michael Jordan GOATb- Lebron James"
The fact that this has more upvotes than Lebron James passing MJ in all time points is something I would expect from this sub
"lebron""thisdoesntfuckmylegacyatallbitches""james"
"sure LeBron played a huge role in getting the teams where they were.  stop trying to make excuses though.   at the end of the day if two game defining shots at the end of the game didn't go in that LeBron had nothing to do with, his legacy would be in shambles.   &gt;If you dont like basketball being a team sport go fuck off  if basketball is a team sport why are we talking about team accomplishments when we rank players.. if this is how you view things, James Harden is the best player in the NBA and has been for a while."
Honestly?  Because James Harden is a better offensive player than LeBron James.
"I don't think a guy can pull 19 boards if he quit though, even if his name is Lebron James."
&gt; Michael’s last game featured NBA legends Tyronn Lue  The team was coached by a young coaching prospect named Lebron James.  
I was so scared that staples would boo him. We are having a rough season but we shouldnt forget the body of work of LeBron James.  Congratulations king
"The day Lebron James retires Skip Bayless physical form will slowly flicker in and out of existence until in flash his whole body shrinks, collapses and immolates. The only thing left of him beyond smoke particulate will be a shriveled little lump of coal, his heart and the final physical manifestation of his once sustaining hatred which will be reduced to dust the moment it's touched."
7 CRAZY facts THAT PROVE LEBRON JAMES DOESN'T EVEN INHABIT THIS PLANE OF EXISTENCE
Lebron James holds record of getting the most coaches fired and replaced with Tye Lue
"&gt;Lol, you live under a rook if you think KD has gotten less flak than LeBron in any of the past few years.  If you think the current hate on KD is even comparable to LeBron then you're stuck in the past.  &gt;I could also criticize him for his careless travels and Shaqtin turnovers that he has been having for his past few games, and ball watching up to the point that Kyle fucking Kuzma has to shove him into position to defend a shot.  See how you have to bring up unrelated shit to this game just to try and force your point? Aside from this game, I can't even recall any crucial careless travel he made. Sure than Suns Turnover late in the game was bad, I'm not excusing that. Sure one specific play of miscommunication sums up that he always ball watches, that's the only thing you idiots believe when you don't even watch the games. See how I was specifically talking about him playing great today and idiots like you keep trying to discount that and claim he's not trying because the combined mistakes in the last 10 games all mean he had a bad game today? lol   &gt;For LeBron James, yes it is. He isn’t Luka Doncic or Trae Young. Again, expectations from LeBron isn’t the same and it’s justified given his accomplishments and level. 5 years ago LeBron would have taken the game over like a man possessed.  5 years ago he was fucking 29 years old. So as his accomplishments rack up, the expectations go up?? So will we expect 40 year old LeBron to regularly put up 45/15/15 every regular season game or else he's coasting?   You've got some pretty solid 12-year-old logic overall. I'm not gonna waste more time on you "
"&gt;	Sure KD getting flak for a big time choke YEARS ago is very comparable to non stop posts hating on LeBron everyday.      Lol, you live under a rook if you think KD has gotten less flak than LeBron in any of the past few years.          &gt;	Sure you could criticize LeBron's Fts, that's inexcusable.    I could also criticize him for his careless travels and Shaqtin turnovers that he has been having for his past few games, and ball watching up to the point that Kyle fucking Kuzma has to shove him into position to defend a shot.                &gt;	31/7/7/1/1 on 13/22 FGs is coasting? lmao maybe watch the fucking game.     For LeBron James, yes it is. He isn’t Luka Doncic or Trae Young. Again, expectations from LeBron isn’t the same and it’s justified given his accomplishments and level. 5 years ago LeBron would have taken the game over like a man possessed. "
"Then you add LeBron James to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down.."
"Same thing with LeBron right now. There was a thread earlier praising James Harden and the game last night, but there were a bunch of comments just shitting on LBJ when he or the Lakers weren't relevant to the discussion at all. "
"Because he is LeBron James, top 3 player in history and self proclaimed King and GOAT. The better you are, the higher are the expectations.         You give props for 31/7/7 games when rookies like Doncic/Trae do it, for most top 15 players its just another day in the office.        We all know prime LeBron would have put on a 40/10/10 streak in the past few game to keep his team in playoffs (and would have played defense too) but he is either declining or he just doesn’t seem to entertain the idea of getting bounced in the first round. In either case, he doesn’t deserve props for that.               "
i think luka doncic has done more with these mavs than lebron james could have this year
"It's Lebron James, he may not be GM by title, but you can bet your ass if he wanted someone moved or someone signed in the preseason they'd be there."
"LeBron ""Playoff Mode"" James"
It’s going to be so weird watching the NBA playoffs with no Lebron James.
"LeBron going to the Lakers has been nothing short of a disaster and I honestly feel for Laker fans. They had so much optimism last year and the team was to fun. Crazy to say, but I think the Lakers would have been better off if they had Paul George over LeBron James. Hard to imagine a star finds this Lakers team an attractive team to be apart of except for A.D"
"I think its lebron with that careless turn over trying to roll the ball and then walton playing him, caruso, james, hart and wagner to close out a game still within reach. Like wtf was that walton"
I dont think that bothers LeBron James
"We are at a Lakers game right now, by the way. LeBron James just walked the dog off the court."
"Last year at this point the Lakers were 29-36, this year they are one game better with Lebron “literally the GOAT” James lmaooooo"
*despite the loss Lebron James passes Michael Jordan for 4th all time in scoring. 
"Lebron King James is going to go right to the locker after the game to post this giant instagram photo of him soaring over MJ and the post is gonna start with ""I have no words"" and then there will be 500 more words."
"As the evening sun slowly descended upon the great city of Los Angeles, LeBron James sat mightily in his trophy room, surrounded by red velvet walls and illuminated by the immense shine of silverware that was only matched by the presence of the man whom these accomplishments belonged to. LeBron took a deep breath and sipped on his glass of red wine, closing his eyes momentarily, as to perhaps recapture the iconic moments of his career that had brought him here, and perhaps to wonder what was yet to come. The King had won it all, or so it seemed. LeBron stood up, his massive, muscular frame decorated by thick, bulgy veins all across his body. The ground seemed to shake with every step he took across the Persian carpet, only to stop before a plain wooden cabinet that eerily seemed out of place in a room full of so much luxury. His fingertips pulled the handle with great and delicate care, and took out a photograph of a man who seemed much younger than he was. “No one knows the real reason that I’m here, no one”, LeBron muttered to himself. In what seemed like an eternity, he stared at the picture with great intensity, and softly sank his teeth and sucked on his lower lip. As his eyes fixated on the man in the picture, the King wondered how he had accomplished so much but yet felt so empty. He knew what he had been missing.  Creek… the door slowly opened.”I’ve been waiting for you”, LeBron spoke, as he carefully slid the photograph back into the cabinet. Inside stepped a lanky figure, he had pale skin and waves on his head which resembled the calm waves of the ocean. He was dressed in all black, except for the emblem on his jacket, which read “BBB”. His face, rough and rugged, only complimented the softness and innocence in his eyes. It was Lonzo Ball. The two men established eye contact, each standing tall a few metres from each other. “My King, I’m here to serve you”, Lonzo replied, his delicate voice echoing throughout the room. LeBron stepped forward, and gripped Lonzo’s skinny arms with great force. The King let out a deep breath, and slowly unzipped the Ball Boy’s Jacket, simultaneously pushing him onto the carpet floor. “Daddy”, Lonzo whispered, as James pushed himself onto Lonzo. “It’s showtime”, LeBron replied."
Barton owning Lebron James lmao
It's just hitting me that LeBron James isn't going to be in the playoffs. What a disaster. 
"If the lakers ""shut down"" lebron James they need to be fined 50k every games that's thew new precedence"
"Wow, this is too good.   Where's those guys down voting me in the other thread saying Pierce is dumb for saying so?  /u/covert_reptilian I guess you know better than LeBron James himself too right?  "
Nobody is saying he carried anyone. But he's the guy who had to go toe to toe with LeBron James and was the person who had to guard LeBron James. Do you understand how tiring that itself is?  Who else would you pick as LeBron's biggest rival? Pierce can say he took 2 series from LeBron on a team he lead. 
Why isn't Lebron James playing in this basketball contest right now?

"Damn Stan, why you so mad?  My argument above is literally pro-bandwagon.  I have been a fan through the dry period, i.e. right now.  A team with Dwight, Kobe, and Steve Nash just had injuries.  I suspect the injuries would have been lessened at other teams (not completely prevented, tbh).       We surrounded LeBron James with non-shooters and it played out poorly.  We hired a GM who has a reputation of quitting projects last minute.  We have an owner who does not invest in developing young players as well as other franchises.     What is likable about how this team operates? Every young player on the team knows they are being put on the trading block.  The remaining non-LeBron players are on one-year deals. We get rid of Luke Walton to hire probably Ty Lue to appease LeBron, but LeBron has never dutifully played under any coach.     We traded DeAngelo and insulted him on the way out.  This organization is coasting on its past success.  If things go well next year I will be happy to support them, but ""are we the baddies?"" comes to mind.  Milwaukee or Toronto or Portland could use an additional fan.    Also, judging my character by wanting to be entertained? Grow up dude."
"It's not man, I was so scared in this game everytime they made a run. The Clippers put up a better fight than the Cavs did last year, and the didn't have LeBron James on their roster. I just want to pay my respects."

"Lmao you guys don’t deserve any star on your snobby ass team, let alone Lebron James."
"I'm a huge fan of Ben Taylo's videos and thought this one in particular was very interesting. He analyzed many clips that were shown around here and on sports channels to prove that LeBron has become a horrible defender. He dissected these plays and explains why LeBron James acted the way he did. Just proves that media likes to push narratives without any analytical foundation. I highly recommend checking his other vids on the channel, too. His analysis is top notch and he combines all sorts of metrics with tape study and eye test."
"Stealing the ball more than any other player in the league does not make you a bad defender by any stretch of the imagination.  No matter how you slice it, the the objective in offence is to put the ball in the basket.  No matter how you slice it, the objective in defence is to prevent the opponent from scoring.  Stealing the ball prevents the opponent from scoring. So even if it doesn't make you a ""great defender"" you are certainly far from the worse and could obviously make you a great one.   There is a case to be made though if Curry would get into heavy foul trouble most games for reach in fouls (for trying to steal the ball) but he didn't.   Not to mention, he held Lebron to 0 points (yes you read that correctly) the entire finals  every time lebron was guarded by Curry (he went like 0-26 or something like that).   **Is Curry the best defender, HELL NO. There are plenty of other players who I firmly believe are better defenders. However, contrary to r/NBA's popular opinion, I'd say Curry is a good one at te very least.**  Edit: here is the article about curry holding Lebron to 0 points https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/6/8/17441998/lebron-james-steph-curry-mismatch-2018-nba-finals"
The real question is why isnt our team in the playoffs with Lebron James? I dont give a shit about warriors

"When the alternative is that you truly believe that Draymond Green is a better all time player than LeBron James, it's hard to believe you're not a troll. You might literally be the only person on the planet to hold that opinion, even Draymond Green himself probably doesn't think he's a top 10 player of all time."
his record was way worse  Harden had mega narrative   Giannis is all-defensive team level on 5 positions  I love Lebron James.. but you are being delusional af.
"I agree, if only because the media cycle revolves around them. It's wearying to hear about them constantly. Sometimes I just want to enjoy a deadlocked Spurs-Nuggets series without thinking what comes next. Sometimes a gritty and snappy Blazers team can be really fun. Maybe the drama in a 76ers series is really interesting and I root against certain people. Maybe watching a Toronto team knowing they don't have to play LeBron, or a lovable underdog in LA, or guys like Vooch who you have to root for. Maybe even a historic James Harden and healthy CP3. I just don't want to hear whether or not they can get past the Warriors in 3 series time. I don't care that Curry shot 5-12 or whatever. I couldn't care less if Klay was looking ahead or if KD said something. Just let me watch the team I came to watch and the matchup I came to watch."
"The Warriors have two MVPs, a DPOY, and the second greatest shooter of all time. They swept LeBron James last year. It's an effort issue"

It's also what happens when you go against Jamal Murray instead of LeBron James...

"Personally I think players by year 3 and 4 of their rookie deals should be able to ""arbitrate"" for a salary increase and be making these salaries when they are a tad younger.  like lebron james from 26-31, ya, worth a 5 year 250m deal.  problem with the current system is the supermax is ending with most of them in their mid 30s."

Imagine if Russell Westbrook was LeBron James.
"the idea of an athlete like LeBron being a bum in an older era.  lol if LeBron James drove and dunked on Kevin McHale, McHale’s entire pasty body would shatter."
Remember when they signed LeBron James and then missed the playoffs?
I mean that's if the Lakers want to waste another year of Lebron James contract.
Lebron James is amazing in elimination games! Its has been a honor watching him play! Such a good pressure player!

Thing is, they always have a scapegoat ""League sources say"" or someshit. So THEY never get the story wrong, their sources do.  Dude, EVERYONE knew LeBron was moving to LA. He didn't hide it, at all. WOJ didn't know anything that literally everyone else didn't already know.  His headline is EXACTLY what I'm talking about.  ""Adrian Wojnarowski: People around NBA feel LeBron James ‘likely’ to join Lakers or Clippers""  ""PEOPLE AROUND THE NBA FEEL...LIKELY...LAKERS or CLIPPERS""  It's just bullshit gossip"
"He played 16 seasons.  He won 8 championships.   He was basically a 6'4"" Lebron James. He could do it all and did."

"A better thing would be to get rid of individual maxes all together. It’ll never happen cause it would mean that non superstars get less money and do the NBAPA will never go for it, but it’d be great for parity. Why should LeBron James, Joel Embiid and Kemba Walker all earn the same? Under current cap rules tmtheyre basically forced to. Without individual maxes, maybe Kemba+ Embiid cost the same as LeBron+ Shane Battier and it’d give way to a lot more parity and competition."
"Lebron James  Dwight Howard  Paul George  Anthony Davis  Left their team because their team could not financially surround them with talent.  Moving forward, super max for Damian Lillard will also leave Portland with the difficulty of adding talent."
"&gt;  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 - May 5, 2017  - LeBron James scores 35 points as the Cavs take a 3-0 series lead in the conference semi-finals versus Toronto. Odds are you can type in any random date from the last five years and read about a Toronto sweep, however. &gt;   Fuck you."
"This is a bad idea for multiple reasons. First, you're essentially raising the salary cap by €40M. Initially, one would think this would only apply to teams that have superstars, but really what would happen is that every team would try to use that cap space if the can, meaning that many mediocre players are going to be getting supermaxes, thus widening the gap between teams. If a team chooses not to use that, then they're at a clear disadvantage, so they will probably be forced to tank until they get that one generational talent, meaning that the average tanking team will continue to be bad for a long time.  Second, this is really unfair on the players. Say in the case of OKC, they clearly would've used that on KD, but because you can't supermax more than one player, James Harden and Russell Westbrook would never be eligible for a supermax, even after becoming MVPs themselves. Kyrie would not be eligible for one either, because in all likelihood LeBron stays in Cleveland and takes that spot. And teams like the Rockets and the Celtics are then going to prefer super-maxing their own guys over other teams' players, even if that player is significantly worse. So what this will essentially create is a lot of supermax-level players who will not be getting supermax contracts, and a lot of non-supermax-level players that will end up getting those contracts."

"Haha I'm a dumb ass, I'll take an L here.  Thought it was in celtics sub. Must have popped up on suggestions.  Fuck lebron James"
"I love how we can rattle off all of these players who have never missed the playoffs, and yet I’ve never heard of a complaint or excuse for them being too tired from so many playoff runs, yet it was a huge topic with LeBron James. Just sayin’"
"Y'all better not act surprised when we find out that he's actually the son of Shaq and Charles Barkley and made love to the father of three, LeBron James."
"That 2008 Celtics team went 66-16 and struggled in 7 games against a 37-45 Hawks team in the first round. Hell, they went 7 games in the second round as well, against LeBron James of course. Ultimately won the championship, but it's proof that no matter how talented you are, you can take nothing for granted. Doc was the coach of that team, so he knows."
"Did you even take the time to look at my username? Where do you think I'm from? So yes I have been paying attention to what the Heat have been doing.  Bosh's blood clots was an unfortunate situation but the Heat still gave him a dumb extension in 2014 when Lebron left and management panicked. Obviously he was still a good player and his stat decline was largely influenced by playing the ""third wheel"" with Lebron and Wade but the Heat gave him a ~$23M AAV contract when he was already 30 years old and the team was poorly constructed. The Rockets offered Bosh a max that the Heat should not have matched given their financial restrictions. In the first year of Bosh's contract, the Heat ended up being just under the luxury tax line (by less than $1M) and would not have been a threat for the title even with a healthy Bosh. This was the year before the big jump in the salary cap, so having $60M committed to Bosh, a 33 year old Wade, Luol Deng, Josh McRoberts, Birdman, and Mario Chalmers is not a recipe for success when the salary cap was just $63M. And, going forward, those pieces would not have been good enough to compete with the likes of Golden State and the Cavs.  In 16-17 you had to go on a ridiculous run just to make the playoffs after starting 11-30 and finished 41-41. If you want to pat yourself on the back for being in the playoff discussion, go ahead. However, most teams (and most fans of those teams) don't want to be in ""playoff purgatory"", i.e. the 7th or 8th seed. That usually implies a team not good enough to compete for a championship but with too many solid players on bad contracts to tank and restart. Like, I'm not sure why you're so proud of *almost* making the playoffs? In the 5 seasons since Lebron left you are 209-201, have missed the playoffs three times, and qualified once as the 6th seed. That's about as average as you could be. Your future does not look all that bright because of the dumb moves your organization made. Miami sport teams on the whole are notorious for being mismanaged, you should be able to accept that by now.  as for Tyler Johnson, Brooklyn offered him a shit contract to force your hand and you matched it. That's not good management because there is no world where Tyler Johnson is worth $19.3M this year or next year. I mentioned in my original comment that the trade saved some salary dollars, however, you are wrong in thinking you get any additional relief. Johnson's [contract](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/phoenix-suns/tyler-johnson-15645/) and [Anderson's](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/miami-heat/ryan-anderson-6133/) both expire *after next year*; seems Heat fans don't know how to read. Anderson will be making about $2M more than Johnson next year **and** the contract expires in the same year as Johnson's.  Looking at next year's team, in a vacuum perhaps each contract is palatable, but **combined** Hassan Whiteside is not worth $27M, Dragic is not worth $19M, Anderson is not worth $16M, James Johnson is not worth $15M, and Kelly Olynyk is not worth $12M. Those five guys are scheduled to make $88.9M and all but Olynyk will be 30 when the season starts. Oh and the salary cap is going to be $109M and you also have $12M tied up in Waiters, $10M in Richardson, and $13M in Winslow. Even if you get some guys to take pay cuts and can offload some guys, at best you're getting closer to being under the salary cap, not getting in the position to sign a star. 2020 will bring some relief but Winslow hasn't looked like a star in the making, Adebayo needs to work on his offensive game, and Waiters will be nearly 30. Richardson looks like a good young player but the jury is out whether he will make the jump.  I originally responded to your comment that said:  &gt;We don't have a single superstar so we're not SUPPOSED to be contenders. At least we're developing our young players.  The point of all this is that you are paying Whiteside superstar money. You are paying Dragic star money. You have role players on onerous contracts. *Monetarily*, you should be contending. Excluding guys like Bosh and non-guaranteed contracts, [your cap hit this year was $124.4M](https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/MIA.html). Compare that to the Blazers ($126.8M), Bucks ($115M), Celtics ($125.3M), etc. In the short-term, who would you rather be?  In the long term, you mention developing young players. You have two (Richardson, Adebayo), maybe three (Winslow) decent prospects. There's many teams out there with more. Some have fewer, but they also have players with higher ceilings.  Also, you clearly don't understand the salary cap. The NBA has a salary cap **floor* so some teams will intentionally take on bad contracts to reach that level. Some teams will also take on a bad contract when they have space as a bargaining chip in the future (expiring contracts are very valuable). Furthermore, and I can't believe I have to explain this, a team like the Kings, who have a bunch of young players on team-friendly contracts, will take on a veteran guy like Harrison Barnes quite willingly if they have the space. Even with Barnes scheduled to make $25M next year, the Kings have just $71.8M in salaries on the books. That's the benefit of having Bagley at $8.6M, Fox at $6.4M, Hield at $4.9M, and Bogdan at $8.5M. Of their main contributors, only Cauley-Stein is not under contract for next year. AND THEY STILL ARE UNDER THE CAP BY $38M. Do you really not comprehend how picking up Harrison Barnes does not matter?"
How are you getting similar vibes when one of those teams had Lebron fucking James and the other has Lou Williams?
"In other words, he wants an interview with Lebron James, like every other sports reporter"
No Lebron James.  No Warriors.  It would be a Battle Royale.   I want it.
"IM IN MY FEELINGS. When DeMar got traded I actually cried. He was with the raptors for 9 years man, you go to a game/walk around the city &amp; everyone wearing his jersey still because that's the one everyone bought. If there was no Lebron James im the east, there was no way Raptors wouldn't have made it to the finals.   Hurts me when people use the the narrative trash bro or DeFrozen never saw any Raptors vs CavS series or a Raps game all the way through, dude was our best player and has every franchise record. And no playoff game was a blowout, Lebron literally won by Dame Lillard style buzzer beaters---scores of 2 games last playoffs - [113, 112], [105,103]. Was always criminally underrated and still is, has the best Kobe footwork in the league today, even Durant studies it. Let's not forget Toronto never got any love and loyalty for the city from a star player (Vince, Bosh...) until DeMar.  He deserves a standing ovation every time he comes back &amp; I hope he get's his jersey retired in Toronto. With Kawhi here for possibly just the season, it's championship or bust for the Raps this year, our most important year yet..."

"&gt; All you're proving is your inability to read  lmao riiiight. your inability to properly explain yourself combined with the moving of the goal posts might be whats's causing the confusion here.  ___  &gt; What I said is, if he was never given the chance to be the guy, he maybe never develops into the leader and clutch player we see now.  lmfao unless there's some type of secret encryption in your responses where i need to string together the 3rd letter in each word or something, that's not at all what you said in the slightest. why are you even trying to pretend you said that when it's right there:  &gt; But you realize that argument is completely bullshit in its own right too, right? We can never have Dame play with Bron so we don't just get to give him this unlimited benefit of the doubt that he would be drastically better..maybe he can't handle being the 2nd guy? Maybe he struggles with a smaller roles? Maybe his clutch factor is driven by the fact he loves being the main guy? If you want to play the ""what if"" game, then you have to think of the negative side too, not just the convenient angles.  your original argument was ""this hypothetical is dumb cause we don't know how lillard responds to being second fiddle, maybe he stinks at it contrary to what everyone else believes, what if he can't handle not being the main guy, etc."" which was quickly shot down since that's false because he was second fiddle to LMA and fine with it/the role.  &gt; I don't think you're really getting the point. The point was that people want to use the ""what if"" game only to his benefit, when the reality is it could go either way.   you double down on this argument, again to which i say ""we've seen him in that 2nd role and it didn't go negatively"" so that's why people don't consider the negatives, only argue the benefits; also people argue the benefits because they are viewed as comparable players.   i say that if dame was option 1 his entire career then yeah (like taking devin booker and throwing him under someone else), you could question how he'd respond to being 2, but the fact that he played 2 for his early years kinda shows he's fine handling it. and then the most ludicrous hypothetical:  &gt; The biggest thing Lillard has going for him is the leadership and his clutch factor...if he went from being under LA's wing to Bron's wing, maybe he never develops that mindset and doesn't turn into the player he is today...its all hypothetical. The point is, hypothetical arguments are dumb, both in his favor and against it  lmao literally didn't even get what you were trying to argue here? like i said if he went from being LMA's sidekick to lebron's he wouldn't develop just as well or better? his growth would be stunted playing with lebron james?  how exactly did kyrie turn out to be the player he is today? kyrie was given the chance to be the guy from day 1 and he wasn't successful. he was an injury prone, tank commander in cleveland before lebron came home and then suddenly develops into a clutch, star leader while playing with lebron and is now a top 3 pg after.   did playing under lebron help this growth? maybe, maybe not. was it just a natural thing kyrie was capable of doing on his own with his growth? then why not dame too if that's the case?  lol so anyway none of that says, ""if he was never given the chance to be the guy, he maybe never develops into the leader and clutch player we see now"" (which is a whole new argument you just brought in).   i don't fault you for not knowing because you probably don't catch many (or any) portland games, but you could see all that development even alongside lamarcus while he was second fiddle; he didn't need lamarcus to leave to become that clutch leader it was already within him, it was just let out when he became portland's guy.  &gt; The whole topic is dumb, Lillard is equal to or lesser than Kyrie so replacing Kyrie with him wouldn't yield better results.   lmao"
&gt;this year should have been a quiet year of mediocrity  lol. Good luck with LeBron James being on the team.
"RDCWORLD1. You should watch his lebron james videos, they're hilarious."
At no point in time did Dame play with LeBron James on his team this is a terrible argument.
"I wouldn't give AF because I'm not a Rockets fan. Isn't this a question for r/houstonrockets?   Would you rather have PG3 or Kawhi, Lebron James and Tim Duncas on the Sonics?"
"I don't need to nitpick at all, I just needed to watch the first 2 highlights to know this is a joke  Highlight 1. Curry sets a screen for Durant  Highlight 2. Scramble play on a break and a miscommunication has LeBron and Kyrie step in Curry's direction but neither get within 7 feet if him.  LOOK AT OP'S PICTURE AND SHOW ME CURRY GETTINF THAT TREATMENT. DON'T SHOW ME CURRY SETTING AN OFF BALL SCREEN. DON'T SHOW ME A BREAK DOWN ON A FAST BREAK. SHOW ME CURRY GETTING SANDWICHED LIKE HARDEN BT DESIGN.  CURRY APOLOGISTS ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST. GOD FORBID YOU POINT OUT STEPH CURRY IS NOT JESUS INCARNATE WITH A BASKETBALL AND YOU MUST SOMEHOW BE HATING.   SHOW ME CURRY HAVING A DEFENSE DESIGNED TO STOP HIM LIKE JAMES HAS IN THE OP PIC."
"Alright I’ll play along let’s find out. Because I don’t think you’re understanding what I said.   Magic Johnson - second year Magic had on his team Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Lebron James - 42 wins did not make playoffs    Kareem - second year won championship had Oscar Robertson and Bob Dandridge who both averaged 19 pts   Óscar Robertson - 43 wins had Jack Twyman who averaged 22 pts  Hakeem - second year 51 wins and finals loss. This one could possibly be the “one” I was talking about. But Ralph Sampson still averaged 18 points. But I’ll give you this one.   So, yes A second year player taking a team to 50 wins and playoffs WITHOUT a second big scorer, Donovan is the probably only one ever besides maybe one, Hakeem.   What Donovan is being asked to do and what he had been able to do as a second year player had almost never happened."
so he can retire still having never beaten lebron james
"Shitty edit but [here](https://i.imgur.com/7FQ4xoT.png) is the correlation I'm referring to- as you can see with positive correlation, someone with high efficiency would be generally expected to have high usage and someone with low efficiency would generally be expected to have low usage, but rather it's the opposite where those with high efficiency tend to not have as much usage. Superstars like the one shown break the mold a bit because no superstar is going to have a low usage rate, but still looking at Durant, James, IT, Harden, and Russ, the pattern still applies.  The thing about how you should look at it at an individual level may have merit, but it's nearly impossible to assert that as true because of just season by season changes in how a player plays, how the team offense is run, and what not. Like how almost none of the ones shown on the graph reflect it, I think a lot of it is just to do with the fact they just got better or worse, rather than staying the same and just changing how they play. The one that I would say did the closest to that is LeBron James as he has been at his peak and just switched off a bit, and he happens to follow the pattern so it's hard to say anything for sure."
"Not just an LA team, but the LA team that DOES NOT have LeBron James on the roster.   Gat dayum. I'm gonna pull my eyes out if this happens cause nothing will ever be so sweet to see"
"The game starts in the 4th quarter but ends in the 1st.  Games also aren't won by who scores the most points but rather the audience determines which points are worth more.    In this league, Lebron James is the postmodern player: Four points is not four points and referring to self in the third person is the norm."
"Montrezl ""LeBron James"" Harrell"
LeBron James with 110 30+ point playoff games is straight nuts. We are spoiled
Yet you guys have had our number for so many years. We needed to sign Lebron freakin James to finally get a W against you fuckers.
Are you forgetting he dropped 30 on a 65% TS% in 2012? Making his 2012 finals one of the most efficient in NBA finals history against a prime defensive Lebron James?

And then suddenly, he spoke: “I’m getting rid of these motherfuckers tomorrow.”"
You doubt LeBron fucking James is in the interest of winning rings? Haha. Nice take
"Yes, I believe LeBron James expects a team to be put around him that wins. I believe LeBron was drinking that Laker koolaid and really thought he could turn it around by himself and make them the winning organization they once were. I think LeBron really believed he could pull a FA this year. He really believed they could trade for AD. Lebron's interests are still winning at the highest level."
"It really feels like OKC may have found their LeBron in Dame. Of course James perfected the art of being an owner of a whole city with LeBronto, but that logo three and wave had the same energy as LeFuckYou fades and floaters he did last season in Cavs vs Raptors.  I guess it's just a preference in style. LeBron savours every shed of hope he peels from your heart, while Dame really likes that Joker scene where he made a pencil dissapear, he's more of a one big hit man."

There is talking shit when you're LeBron James in the finals and then there is talking shit when you're Dennis Schroeder in the first round...
I’m convinced our franchise exists so we can suffer for other teams. Lebron got his first championship against us. We gave Houston James Harden. Golden State murdered us then took the best player we might ever have. Donovan Mitchell has his coming out party against us as a rookie. Can’t wait to see what happens next year
Yeah the Lakers aren't about to be the team that fucking trades LeBron James lol.

"The Jazz could use another sharp shooter like Westbrook. But really Westbrook is a hell of a player despite all the crap people talk on him. He gets his team to the playoffs which is more than can be said for other ""super stars"" (Anthony Davis, LeBron James), and he plays hard. If he could somehow rediscover his jump shot which I imagine after this season he is going to work really really really hard on it we might be having a way different discussion about Westbrook at this point next season.   &amp;#x200B;  Also i'm not even a fan of Westbrook but it's hard to hate on a guy that plays as hard as he does. I would rather have my guys play with everything they have and fail, then not give a crap at all and just mail it in so they can start their vacation."

"I've been a basketball fan since 2007 when I watched LeBron James destroyed the Pistons and then was destroyed by the Spurs in 2007. I was glued in 2008 when the Celtics toppled the Lakers, disgusted in '09 and '10 when the Lakers won back to backs (Bulls-Celtics in the first round, Rockets Lakers and Celtics-Magic in the 2nd round, and Magic-Cavs in the ECF of '09 and the Magic- Lakers finals are some favorites, don't have as many memories of '10) absolutely elated to watch Nowitzki do it in 2011 (Brandon Roy going apeshit in the first round, Dallas sweeping LAL and then going toe to toe with OKC, Derrick Rose!!! and the WTF performance by LeBron in the finals), watched LeBron come to life in '12 and topple the Thunder (Derrick rose :(, remember when OKC was gonna win championships?), enjoyed the hell out of Spurs-Heat in '13, less so in '14.  I left for college in '14 and got busy so I didn't see as much of the '15-'18 playoffs, but I watched each Finals series in full and at least a game or two of each playoff series.  All that time, I remained a Kings fan, which was hard as fucking hell. I remember going to a ""Here We Stay"" night in 2013 and in total went to a bunch of games from 2008-2014 before moving to Portland. Didn't really get in to Blazers basketball until this season, and last season I took up the tradition of seeing my Kings in Portland when they come. This season, we finally had a good one in the first time of my major fandom, and I watched about 60 of their games. I joined Reddit in an effort to find more of a Kings community. I splurged on 100-level tickets  to see them in the last game of the season against Portland (the 2nd game I went to this season). That game was so fun (despite the loss) that I decided to go to the playoff game, something I'd never been able to do in Sac and never cared to do in Portland until this year, and absolutely loved it.  I love this game, I love this league, and I love talking about it.  But yeah, you can call me a nephew. :shrug:"

"I’m gonna go with Lakers-Pelicans  PG Lonzo Ball  SG Jrue Holiday  SF Brandon Ingram  PF LeBron James  C Anthony Davis  Randle, Payton, Hart, Kuzma, Moore, Okafor, Miller, Bullock off the bench  Coached by Gentry, Assistant Coach Frank Vogel (Toss Kidd into a bayou)  .  The defense on this team would be real solid (Zo, Holiday, Davis, coached by Vogel) and superstar offensive talent in James and Davis, great facilitation from Zo, Jrue, Bron, and Payton. The depth is great (Randle and Kuz especially). If this team stays healthy I don’t see any other merger team beating em (including mergers with the Lakers or Pelicans).  I’d also say they make at least top 3 in the West, and go to the WCF for 6-7 games against the Warriors, maybe even steal the series if KD goes down like he does irl."
"Reminder that LeBron claimed he “broke” his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, something that no one did to him and didn’t happen on the court mid game etc.     The story during last year’s finals was about JR Smith of course, but it was simultaneously deifying the efforts James was putting up, “with a broken hand,” which:     - wasn’t broken     - was only hurt to begin with because he chose to injure it himself after a game.     It’s interesting how today’s “media” is always seen through the lens of Twitter hot takes and no longer actual articles written by people trying to bring journalism to sports — which is an indictment about the fans more than the journalists, as they would keep writing long columns and articles everyday if people were actually going to read them, but we’ve stopped doing that unless it’s an occasional Zach Lowe piece or whatever. It’s a really hard subject to sum up in one comment but I thought I’d try by using an example of just one little (mostly forgotten) “narrative” [not the word I’d use but it seems like this sub has started using it to mean all sorts of things] from less than a year ago."

It hurts so much less when it wasn't Lebron James in every free agency period.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
He is just the 10th player ever to average [8 rebounds per game and 8 assists per game](http://bkref.com/tiny/PmPb6) over the course of the playoffs when playing in multiple series.   Magic Johnson four times  LeBron James twice  Oscar Robertson twice  Jason Kidd twice  Larry Bird once  Rajon Rondo once  Clyde Drexler once  Wilt Chamberlain once  Draymond Green once* (in play to do it again this year)
No one of them is CJ McCollum and the other is Lebron James
Okay here’s for the last 10 years   Who in the west are you favoring over Lebron James? Cause the answer is Warriors and Spurs.    Also your point that only 6/16 is Eastern   It’s only 8/16 right now don’t have to ruin playoff travel cause 2 average west teams are better than 2 average East teams

"The same reason Toronto gets bashing for not defeating Lebron led teams. He choked past years when it mattered the most. This year he played well but he got flak for not showing up in final minutes for both the games 5 and 6. Remember this is same James Harden that hit the dagger 3 in regular season to win the game in over time against warriors and said "" I am fucking MVP"".  Malone, Stockton, Chuck, Reggie gave memorable performances in playoffs but lost to GOAT. Also none the of the teams GM said they have one specific task, to beat 1 single team, they were build for that. Capella said he wanted to face warriors got blown in oblivion. CP3 and Harden wanted to be ref properly they got what they wanted, lost KD, and boogie. Still couldn't beat a depleted team. That's on them."
"Well obviously no one has a 0% chance until they've actually lost. But the likelihood of a Draymond suspension and Bogut injury again is much smaller and the team margin was way larger in 2018 than in 2016. Also the Warriors were somewhat complacent in game 1 and I doubt they'd play like that again in other games. Momentum means quite a bit, but momentum, even with LeBron James, isn't enough to bridge the gap they had there. Obviously I can't prove it and you can't prove that it would change anything, but from looking at the teams that year and their performances prior to the Finals, as well as during them, I just don't see it man."
BLOCKED BY JAMES!  One of my favorite plays ever and I'm not even a Cavs/LeBron fan.
I AM TALKING ABOUT JAMES HARDEN WTF THE WHOLE POST IS ABOUT JAMES HARDEN WHERE DID YOU GET LEBRON FROM?
LeBron James?    you think that's what's defining LeBron James?
What if I told you that LeBron James is better than Micheal Jordan purely for the sake of shit talking?
The Lakers have LeBron fuckin James. Let's calm down a little bit man jesus r/nba is ridiculous lol
I don't understand where this talk even comes from. I will never believe that the Lakers even considered trading LeBron James.
LeBron James
"Honestly don't really feel like this moment ""deserves a deep rewind."" Like it's one of the the funniest moments of NBA history, but the implications aren't as big as the video tries to make them seem. ""No team that has LeBron James can truly be seen as underdogs."" Yes, they can, and this is one of those cases. They still went on to lose both home games.   But like you said, they went about it in completely the wrong way. Showing facts about Klay and George Hill was absolutely not the way to do it."
"The Rockets system does work. James Harden has been to the conference finals 2 times with the rockets. He has gotten further than Chris paul ever did on his own team, and farther as the leader on his team in the WEST than anyone not named Durant or curry. He has won the most games against the warriors in the playoffs than any other team/player. In the last two years, lebron has only won 1 game against the warriors in the playoffs. In that same time-frame, Harden has won 5. The choking narrative has gone too far. Harden is not the one losing in the first round yearly. That is a choker. Tmac never escaped the 1st round as the lead dog on his team. Chris Paul has never made a conference finals as the lead dog on his team. Harden has. So what he lost to the warriors? That team has already won 3 titles since 2015. I can't knock him for that."
[He was playing hurt since game 2 against the Bulls.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2015/05/09/kyrie-irving-injured-foot-lebron-james-poor-shooting-cavaliers-lose-game-3/27033399/) He finished the series shooting like shit against them and only scored 10 in game 1 and 16 in game 4 against the Hawks
"I've mentioned this before, but what still hurts me on that game is the way LeBron is positioned at the three-point line, with no Warrior player in vicinity, and J.R. Smith with 4 seconds to simply swing a pass towards James. There's a good chance that the game could've ended with a LeBron game winner/buzzer-beater to cap off a 52-point night. It would've been an instant classic, comparable to MJ's shot over Ehlo. Instead, we end up with an all-time JR blunder."

I mean if Lebron James is the only one better than you I think you’re doing ok...
Omg look at this dude's fucking post history. Nearly every single post is a poorly veiled attempt at putting down any top 6 player that isn't Curry.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;If Kyrie continues to outplay Giannis in the playoffs how can the giannis be seen as so much superior   &gt;   &gt;Why do people consider Kawhi a top 5 offensive player when he is a bad playmaker/passer?   &gt;   &gt;\[Serious\] Has lebron ever carried a team like Harden has this year?   &gt;   &gt;Why aren't more people concerned about James Harden shooting 37% from the field and 35% from 3 to start the playoffs?   &gt;   &gt;Why is there even a conversation about Giannis becoming the face of the league when Curry still exists?
"MJ had a finesse game that James just doesn't have, and you have to watch them both to compare it. The stats tell bits of a story, but they don't actually show you what plays out. People can say that it doesn't matter because James still gets his points, but James plays a brand of athletic bully ball where he basically charges into the paint and then runs his offense, whether that's getting the dunk/layup, passing out to the 3, or in his Heat days he had a nice little post up game starting to emerge. An offense *has* to be built around that playstyle to maximize his effectiveness. We just saw the Lakers had no shooters and while Lebron put up his stats they weren't winning shit.  Jordan was a swiss army knife. He would wait for an opening, ANY opening in the defense, and then take it immediately. And there was basically no adjustment you could make, because Jordan would adjust again. There wasn't anything on the court Jordan *couldn't* do. Portland forced him to take 3s in the Finals, he set the fucking record for 3s in a half. Once his athleticism started declining and he couldn't abuse defenses off the first step, he became one of the most efficient midrange players ever. There were just no holes in his game for that era. One could argue that in today's game his lack of 3s would be a hole but I don't think I could be convinced that Jordan was unable to develop an efficient 3 point shot. The game was built around having a couple specialists like Kerr (who holds 3 of the top 10 spots for 3p% in a single season) and he just didn't have to develop that part of his game."
"they have lebron james on the floor, stop circlejerking X's and O's guys. their system and performance didn't change after blatt was fired and lue took over"
"""The Lakers have found a head coach for LeBron James whose teams were eliminated by James in the playoffs three consecutive seasons.""  LeBron has lost to the following coaches in the last 8 years. Pop/Kerr/Carlisle."
I’ve always been convinced that the NBA rigs the draft lottery. What a coincidence that the year Lebron James enters the draft that the Cavs get the #1 pick! What a coincidence that the year Benson buys the New Orleans Pelicans that he also gets the #1 pick and is able to draft Anthony Davis!  This year I think the Knicks will get the #1 pick. What a coincidence that the year that a transformative player enters the draft and Dolan is on the verge of being pushed out as owner is the same year the Knicks get the #1 pick. What a coincidence indeed!
Because Lebron James is there?
LeBron is kinda like the James Harden of basketball.
"Imo Ben Simmons will never be the centerpiece of a championship team now or in the future.  https://youtu.be/2x3-B4ogAqA  I agree with Thinking Basketball's analysis. Ben Simmons' ceiling is a low level all star. He is not a generational talent like some people claim he is, and imo he is unlikely to develop a respectable jumpshot enough to be a threat.  People often brush his flaws off because he's young and still maturing as a basketball player, and I totally understand the need for patience when it comes to emerging talents like him. And I guess you could cite examples of players who have developed different facets of their game over their careers, but the fact of the matter is if it were easy, everyone would do it. Even Lebron James still struggles with his FT shooting after 16 years in the NBA despite it being one of his biggest flaws as a player.  Imho Ben Simmons is tragically flawed as a player and won't quite reach the heights many hope he will. That is not to say the 6ers should blow it all up, but the hype surrounding him isn't backed up by his current production or future potential."
"As much as I dislike Harden, pretty much everyone except GSW loses their elimination games.   LeBron James lost 4 of them too in 5 years.   Paul George has lost something like 8 straight."
i too love LeBron James.
"I understand that this is a Curry circle jerk thread, but seriously? LeBron James is the second greatest player of all time, while Steph is borderline top 10. Steph is still the second best player in the league, and the gap between him and LeBron is much greater than the gap between #3 and him, but still, we're talking about the King, the man who redeemed Cleveland, LeBron fucking James. Steph is the second best point guard ever. LeBron is the second best *player* ever."
because they won 37 games after adding LeBron fucking James
Age related decline. Durant and Curry are both over 30. Not everyone is LeBron James or Michael Jordan. Most stars significantly decline after 30.
"While 'safe hires' is certainly one way to look at it, the flip side is that the NBA is a very prestigious and elite league to be coaching in. On that note there just aren't many coaches that have experience at this level, so having some semblance of success here means more than at other levels. However, obviously seriously sustained success at high levels means something though (see coach K) it isn't the norm.   In this regard Vogel has closer relationships and knowledge of nearly all the teams in the league and their plays and playstyles that other coaches without any prior nba coaching experience would have to learn on the fly.   This is all without saying that they are also going to be coaching Lebron James, still quite possibly the best player in the world (although the argument against it grows stronger each day, it is still an argument that can be made). Oh, and its the Los Angeles Lakers, one of, if not the most, storied franchise in the NBA."

"I disagree when you say James Harden Nikola Jokic and Eric Gordon have that mentality, Lebron James aswell but let's be fair he earns that mentality when games are within reach like in 2016.  I like your point with they're young and they need to develop and mature, but honestly you can't develop that mentality, you come in the league with it, learn it from an early age or even be born with it.

"&gt;Someone recently asked when I will turn into a ""Back in My Day"" guy. I had to pause to think about what that even means. So here it is: Back in my day, free agency wasn't a yearlong situation. It wasn't something that was talked about two years in advance. It was talked about for maybe a couple of months, total. And, yes, I blame LeBron James because of The Decision. (He knows it's all his fault. He'll tell you. Just ask him.)"
No Siakam is Lebron James
I'm telling yall Siakam is Lebron James
Are we forgetting how depleted the Cavs were during that finals run? I remember both Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving being out during that finals series.  I honestly couldn't name you a Cavs member who made a major contribution in that series not named LeBron James.

Lebron James averages more FTs than Steph Curry   I’m downright shocked   I bet Giannis averages more also   Crazy I wonder why?
[One also averages near double the FTAs the other has in the playoffs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id2_select=LeBron+James&amp;player_id2=jamesle01&amp;idx=players)  The issue with curry getting mauled isn't that it doesn't happen to other guys. Its that for his volume and usage his FTAs have always criminally underrepresented this in comparison to other 1st options on other teams
A lot of confidence for a team that is best known for being Lebron James' personal bitch

Also why tf is NBA using old town road on their outros?!?"
LeBron James.
"That series, each team really only played their 7 best guys.  That means that the coaches and players, by the middle of game 3, had pretty much seen what’s working and what’s not.  When James Harden is bringing the ball up, he’s looking to figure out who’s on him, and who’s on his teammates, and where the advantage is.  The Warriors threw a lot of different looks at him.  Sometimes Steph would give up the switch, sometimes he would do the “Lunge at LeBron” and his teammate would be on Harden.  But it was pretty much the same guys in front of Harden.  He didn’t have enough game time against Bell to know right away, that “this guy bites every time”.  It was “who the fuck is you again?”  Because the Rockets only got ~7 minutes of Bell and Jerebko, they couldn’t pick those guys apart."
This will be the first time I'm watching the finals without my favorite LeBron James. It feels weird.
players who have scored more than 50 in a NBA Finals game:  Here are the players who scored more than 50 points:  LA's Elgin Baylor: 61 points against Boston in 1962  Chicago's Michael Jordan: 55 points against Pheonix in 1993  San Francisco's Rick Barry: 55 points against Philadelphia in 1967  LA's Jerry West: 53 points against Boston in 1969  Cleveland's LeBron James: 51 points against Golden State in 2018  St. Louis' Bob Petit: 50 points against Boston in 1958
"LeBron James, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Jordan. Curry is up there but try and make a case that he's more impactful than these guys with actual accolades and stats. No gravity talk just hard numbers. No way."
"Averaging a fucking 128 offensive rating in a conference finals  against is historically impressive, idc what the team or the sample size is. That Boston team still had great defensive players in Smart and Horford along with a proven great defensive coach in Stevens. They also held up the 120 ORTG against the Pacers and Raptors, who were both pretty solid teams in their own right considering their conference position.   The 2017 Cavs were a historically great offensive team. The postseason numbers support this and the eye test support this (LeBron and Kyrie just looked even better and had more chemistry together), and I’m pretty sure the Warriors would tell you the same thing. They COULD have definitely beat the 2017 Warriors if they didn’t have KD. Also, the series that actually happened easily could’ve gone 6 or 7 if KD doesn’t hit those clutch shots in game 3 at Cleveland.   The Warriors didn’t NEED KD to possibly beat them, but KD made them unbeatable that year and added a lot to that already great offense, which is immensely valuable when you have fucking LeBron James on the other end of the court playing some of the best basketball ever"
"&gt;No, that’s incorrect. He did not go up to Riley and try to get Spo fired. Before the season started, he was talking with Riley and Wade and others and asked him “do you ever get the itch?” meaning, the itch to coach again. Riley said no. That was the end of that conversation. THAT actually IS well documented.   ""No, he didn't ask Riley to fire Spo. He just asked Riley if he wanted to coach. Spo wasn't even a consideration...""  [Also,](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23088267/pat-riley-said-lebron-james-did-right-thing-left-miami-nba) it was in an emergency meeting after they went 9-8 right after talking about how LeBron was not happy with Spo...

Maybe the Lakers shouldn't have signed world famous superstar and ESPN golden goose LeBron James to the largest basketball market on the planet if they didn't want to be talked about all the time
"Steph is second only to lebron in the NBA when it comes to winning NBA games. Until I see LeBron actually isn't the best player in the league anymore in the playoffs with my own two eyes, he will remain the best in my eyes. I'm done doubting LeBron James."
"Correct, but Kawhi is much easier to guard then James Harden.  Harden is literally trying to get foul calls the entire game. Kawhi just plays basketball how its supposed to be played. These guys, Klay, Dray, and Iggy have faced far tougher players then Kawhi.  These same players have guarded LeBron James in three straight finals, plus Harden in 4 straight playoffs. Kawhi is like a sigh of relief to them, believe me. As good as Kawhi is, his offensive skill is very predictible and mechanical."
"That would have been valid before Kyrie got traded.   After the Kyrie trade, half the Cavs thought it was a retirement cruise to the finals and they had dismal defense  with all the guys pointing at each other.   IT failed to do the minimum (score so James can take a breather as the other s take on the defense).   Then the Cavs pretty much traded half the team at the deadline and  it was too late to teach these guys the system.   All they could do was teach them the cuts and where to expect the ball from James the fact he had to carry them past the Pacers and the Celtics plus takeover in Toronto to ensure he had maximum rest shows how much nothing else was working.   He also didn't play defense because of that because that's all he can trust them with when they are shooting 20% from 3 and 40% from the floor.   As for the Lakers, the year was a whole audition of who to re-sign and who to trade while their value was up.   It made no sense for LeBron to carry the Lakers when he is there for 3 more years, management knew from the start this summer is their ride or die moment and he came back from injury with the Lakers fighting for a spot to face the Warriors or Rockets."
"Hopefully interspersed with shots of Lebron James watching from home, where he’s been chilling since two weeks before the regular season ended."
Career : Steph “ Light Skin Sniper” Curry Best player : Lebron “Fuck..the warriors again ?” James
Nobody really cares about the nba or basketball. The only thing the nba is good for is tormenting LeBron James' legacy as it should be.
This isn't complicated. It's LeBron James.
"I mean, it was a bone bruise; he was fine. It's also very common for players to just play through pain in the playoffs and not reveal any injuries they are playing with. Are you seriously expecting LeBron James to just give up dunking and playing because his hand hurts? I don't understand why people like you want everything to be a conspiracy. When has the guy ever lied like that before?  Edit: And you can literally **see** that it's swollen, haha."
"It's okay, I've heard that LeBron James actually makes a pretty good salary. I think he takes down like 60k a year."
"Well hold on there. Not that I want to defend the Lakers, but it’s Lebron James. You are being way too confident in his inability to make the playoffs. I swear, you miss 1 finals in 9 years... That man drug our sorry ass team to the finals in 2018, and the Lakers current core cannot be that much worse."
"""There's been a trade...the Lakers send Lebron James, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, and the #4 pick to the Sacramento Kings in return the Lakers receive Kosta Koufos."""
"Chris Paul getting traded here because it was on his list of preferred teams, Dwight Howard getting traded here because it was on his list of preferred teams and Lebron James signing here are ""empty claims""? Like even if you discount Paul George straight up saying the Lakers were his top choice after OKC what the fuck are you talking about?"
"""It was also the last time LeBron James got eliminated from the playoffs in the Eastern Conference""  Nah it wasn't, they lost to the Celtics the next year in the second round. That's why games 6/7 of the 2012 East finals were the most important of Lebron's career, cause it looked like being a 2010 repeat  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K21g-ESIvpw"

I hope I can get to a place to where I can say fuck LeBron James the same way Raps fans say (and rightfully so) the same thing about Vince. Tired of these dudes fucking everything up so they can get their way
DONT LET THIS FINALS DISTRACT YOU FROM THE FACT THAT LEBRON JAMES IS 3-6 IN THE NBA FINALS AND HAS NEVER MADE THE WESTERN CONFERENCE PLAYOFFS
"That's GM, Head Coach, and Director of Player Scouting Lebron James to you."
"Interestingly enough, the article I read this morning actually says he’s entering his sophomore year.   https://www.si.com/high-school/2019/05/29/zaire-wade-lebron-james-bronny-jr-play-together-sierra-canyon-high-school"
"20 sports themed or sports adjacent movies have taken home Oscars in its 91 year history.   [https://fansided.com/2019/02/19/oscars-sports-movies-hate/](https://fansided.com/2019/02/19/oscars-sports-movies-hate/)   This is out of 69 sports themed or sports adjacent movies that have been nominated for Oscars in the past 91 years.   For Hoops movies, only *Dear Basketball,* an animated short film written, narrated and produced by Kobe Bryant has taken home the hardware.   *Hoosiers* and *Hoop Dreams* were nominated for Oscars, and Hoop Dreams had a very strong case to take home Best Feature Documentary, [but wasn't even nominated due to a voting controversy.](https://indyweek.com/guides/archives/dreams-cost-thing/) The film did net a Best Film Editing nomination, but did not win for that.   With Kobe paving the way, maybe the Oscars are finally ready to accept a feature length basketball film by 2021.   Many are probably asking, ""Well if Space Jam didn't sniff the Oscars in 1997 (film was released in 1996, but eligible for the 1997 Oscars), how can we possibly except Space Jam 2 to get close?"" Well, a lot has changed in the past 25 years! Basketball has truly become a global game, and viewership has steadily increased every year. Boxing movies have historically gotten a lot of Oscar love, but with the sport of Boxing dying, maybe Basketball can fill that void.   And now we arrive at the biggest kicker in the Space Jam vs. Space Jam 2 gap: Michael Jordan's acting vs. LeBron's. Michael Jordan is arguably the greatest player to ever play the game (that is my take... Bron stans stay seated). But LeBron is coming into Space Jam 2 with a wealth of acting and producing experience. He had an amazing cameo in *Trainwreck.* His documentary*, More Than a Game,* was well received. He has produced the moderately successful Starz comedy *Survivor's Remorse,* and has been crushing commercials as a Spokesperson for a long line of products over the past decade+ (see above). LeBron has been a far more dominant media figure than Jordan was during his prime and amidst the Space Jam production, and this *should* translate into a greater performance for Space Jam 2.   Do I think LeBron is going to win Best Actor? Probably not. He'll likely be nominated and stir up some controversy in getting snubbed, but I don't think we are getting a Best Actor win until Space Jam 3, starring Bryce James (you all thought it was going to be Bronny, didn't you?)  Is Space Jam 2 going to take home Best Actor? Not likely, and this will really come down to the performance of the Looney Tune characters and then those that are filling the Bill Murray and Wayne Knight roles, as well as the direction of Terrance Nance (who directed the critically acclaimed,  *An Oversimplification of Her Beauty).*  Supporting Actor? I think Bill Murray is going to win, playing the Wayne Knight role. He is long overdue for a win. Maybe Boban gets a nod?  Best Director? Terrance Nance will at least win Best Hair.  Best Supporting Actress? We'll see how much of a role that Tessa Thompson/Tiffany Haddish are going to have here before I can make predictions.  Best Original Song? Lock it down. We know Kendrick is going to bring us home."
"Let me be very, very clear. Lebron James is a STUD, and when it comes to tacos that is no one's business. I don't care if he eats hard tacos, soft tacos, spicy, mild, cold, medium, or HOT. Lebron James answers to no one when it comes to tacos. He could be eating straight guacamole for all I care. So for you to sit up here and tell me that he's ruining the Lakers organization with his taco eating is downright BLASPHEMOUS. What he's done with Rich Paul n dem boyz is nothing short of spectacular. So what I'm trying to explain to you, Max, is this - far as I'm concerned they should be eating tacos every night."
"i don't think they were weak exactly, was moreso speaking on the clippers and blazers, although i do think they were less effective than last year.   tbh im not sure about the raptors offense, that was the one concern i had against milwaukee and it felt like they just found a way to be productive. they probably will try to attack steph if the warriors are switching heavily and force him into foul trouble which would be devastating for them without kd. fvv having a huge series from 3 probably tipped the ECF in their favor and they'll probably need danny to come around this time to have an even better chance.   i think the main advantage they have in the half court, which i spoke on before, is that they always have 5 guys who can shoot on the floor at all times. that's something the warriors haven't had to deal with a lot besides the cavs with love at center and houston with tucker at the 5, (not to mention meyers fucking leonard who killed them on pick and pops, lol) and that was the most competitive any teams have been with them. their defense is so good you just need to have that ability to completely stretch the court and make them pay for helping.  if i was a warriors fan i'd be confident just because it took the 3-1 lead comeback + draymond suspension + lebron james and kyrie at their absolute peaks to have ever lost this run. but the raptors just match up so well and have kawhi whose the type of player that you need to be seriously competitive with them"

This would all be a lot funnier if they didnt have Lebron James.
"LeBron James is a Cowboys fan but rooted for the Eagles in the super bowl a couple years ago.  I don't think he cares that much about certain sport alliances, I think he cares more about putting Bronny in the best situation to succeed as possible."
"Adam Mendelsohn  James hired Adam Mendelsohn as his publicist. Mendelsohn, a veteran political strategist, former Deputy Chief of Staff to Arnold Schawarzeneggar, and high-ranking communications guru, was just the man for the job.

But his experience was in navigating the waters of the vicious and rapid political arena, and that's precisely the type of expertise post-Decision Bron needed more than anything.

"2nd best Lebron defender we've ever had. And our best Lebron defender came after Lebron left the east.   I love how Lebron defender is a role that we've tried to fill over and over again, from Carroll to James Johnson (fuck you Casey) to P.J. Tucker to OG to Kawhi, and when we finally get the ultimate defender, Lebron leaves."
"Great players put up insane stats. Team changing players put up great stats all while making the team around him better. Harden doesnt make his team better. Giannis definitely doesnt either. Neither does Butler, or Westbrook or LeBron James. Kawhi and  Curry definitely do. Probably why these two teams are in the finals."

"I’m not trying to be a high school contrarian. He kicked Stephen Adams in the nuts. He purposely poked James harden in game one this year, just like he purposely poked Lebron James in game 1 of last year. if you recall he also tried to repose harden in game 2 and harden got into his face about it.   I just think draymond is wack. The best defensive player of all time lmao get outta here.  I don’t think he would be considered good on a team that didn’t have the best back court of all time plus KD."
"Yeah, the arm chair psychologists try to push through the narrative that it bothers him even though throughout the whole season, including on serges show said it does not bother him. In fact, serge used it the laugh as an april fools joke.  When I show this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwzuWwA-IRk  People say, he's just internalizing and hiding his emotions about how he feels about the laugh.  lol Armchair psychologists man. Don't forget this is the same subreddit that blame lebron james for Kevin Loves mental health struggles then love comes out and said lebron helped him a lot and they ate crow after that."
"Chris Paul puts Lakers on his short-list but gets stopped by basketball reasons  Dwight Howard puts Lakers on his list but it doesn't work out after he gets here  Paul George straight up says he wants to go to the Lakers and only ends up not coming because another team took the risk of trading for him and it paid off  Lebron fucking James joins the Lakers  &amp;#x200B;  You: ""Where the hell do the Lakers get the idea that stars want to go there?!?!"""
"Now, I'm neither an expert in the sport nor a great player myself, but my suggestion would be to watch some high level basketball to learn the kind of passes and shots you should be taking.   Watch some young LeBron James. Use your athleticism and your height to your advantage, get to the rim whenever possible. Focus on tightening your handle and once you draw a defender, find the open man. The jumper may come or it may not, but defense and passing are always valuable skills on the court.  Learn the art of the pick and roll. At your size, you should be able to post people up pretty consistently as well. Use that to your advantage. Study the post. Turn around jumpers, post spins, dream shakes, and shot fakes.  I'm glad that you're doing well, man. It's really admirable that you decided to turn your life around."
"I would put KD in my second tier along with Giannis and James Harden.  The reason is that I don't feel like KD's done enough to convince me that he's on par with Lebron/Kawhi/Steph in elevating a team.  He was only able to lead OKC to the Finals once and didn't lead them to a championship -- despite having a pretty good supporting cast (once he left they were still a borderline playoff team).  And, with the Warriors, it's obviously difficult to quantify his impact given that we were an all-time great team before he joined, too.  If KD does end up leaving and going to a team like the Knicks, I feel like we'll truly get to see his impact.  Will he be able to elevate the Knicks to the point where they can compete with the Raptors and Bucks for East supremacy?  If he can, then I'll put him in my first tier.  But as of now, I can't justify it.    On the other hand, Steph, LeBron, and Kawhi have proven that they can elevate teams to a championship level.  And that's why I think they're the 3 who truly deserve to be in the first tier."
"The Knicks arrogantly thought they had a chance to sign Lebron James in the big summer 2010 bonanza, and so they decided to trade a bunch of draft picks to clear cap room. They traded rookie lottery pick Jordan Hill, a future first and a future pick swap to clear the 1.5 years remaining on Jared Jeffries' contract. Jeffries was on the mid-level exception, only making around $6.5m per year, but it got the Knicks close to having two max salary slots, which was speculated to be important so that James could bring a friend.  The expiring contract the Knicks got back in that salary dump was Tracy McGrady.  It's hilarious to think that the Knicks were a lottery team at the time. It was before they signed Stoudemire and traded for Melo. Their best players were like Al Harrington and David Lee. They were giving up two picks that had great chances of being in the lottery (with very minimal protection). You could argue that they gave up more to dump Jeffries than many teams have given up for superstars like Chris Paul, Dwight Howard or James Harden (even if he wasn't a superstar at the time).   The fact that the picks and Hill didn't amount to much is the only reason this trade isn't brought up alongside catastrophic trades like the Nets/Celtics trade. Not as bad just because the scale was smaller, but on a metric of stupidity, right there with it. And it did have serious consequences for hte Knicks, who by trading those future picks cornered themselves into trying to compete in the short term. Had they had those picks as insurance, maybe they don't overpay for Stoudemire and instead just take another rebuilding year. Maybe htey don't force a trade for Melo and instead take their chances on him coming in free agency. Maybe when the Stoudemire/Melo pairing proved pretty terrible, they move one or both before they both declined."
"We’re talking about NBA players.   Bronny just got 1.7 million followers on Instagram in 2 days, NBA isn’t passing on that. I would bet large amounts of money that, barring an act of god or extreme injury, he goes top 3.   99.6% chance. Imagine being the GM that passed on LeBron James’ son...  If r/nba is allowed to talk about RJ Barrett, it’s also allowed to talk about Bronny James."
"Because none of them are game-breakingly dominant.  LeBron didn't peak until his second stint on the Cavs, when he was already sufficiently limited by a combination of the existence of Curry's Warriors and the existence of the Cleveland Cavaliers.  KD has been. They changed how the rip-through foul move was officiated because it worked too well for him.  Kawhi Leonard has only won one championship, and he was on a team with three Hall of Famers. He's not game-breakingly dominant.  James Harden has never won a championship. By no definition is he game-breakingly dominant, or he would have.  Giannis Antetokounmpo has never won a championship. He is very young. Currently he's limited by his poor shooting more than anything else. It remains to be seen how that will go, but largely, he's already contained by the rules that have been put in place because of dominant big players before him. Players being unstoppably dominant inside has happened before, and the adjustments for that have already been made."
"If LeBron James lands in your lap and you can't make the playoffs, it's probably not the small market owners fault."
I think these people thinking Kawhi is literally God are gonna have a huge reality check. We're used to playing lebron fucking James. And somehow Kawhi will win almost single handedly?
Lebron James
I wish LeBron James tried to monetize my childhood
"Only reason he hasn't DOMINATED the biggest stage, is because he's shared the court in the finals with Lebron James and sometimes Kevin Durant. Of course you're not just going to dominate everyone when you're going up against a consensus Top 5 player of all time."

"Can you tell us why Lebron’s Free Throw percentage falls off a cliff in clutch time?  According to ESPN Stats &amp; Info, ""in the final 15 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime, LeBron is 10-21 (48 percent) on free throws in one-score games since the start of last season. That's the worst free-throw percentage of any player with at least 10 free throw attempts in those situations.""  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2018/10/lebron-james-shocking-free-throw-stat/amp"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Lol first no Lakers fan thinks Kuz, Ball and Ingram are Westbrook, KD and Harden in fact as far as young players go the Lakers' young player are better.   The Lakers have LeBron James, 40M in space, #4 overall pick, Ingram, Kuz and Ball yet you're saying we should be shitting on them."
How?  Why the fuck is Davis wanting to play with LeBron fucking James seen as not wanting to win? Zion is a generational prospect but he's still a damn prospect.  He has a better chance to win by teaming up with LeBron or Durant or Kyrie than hoping that Zion translates to the pros.
"Damn, her we go again,  Melo passed on this team, I made it to a jam  Now everything I'm not made me everything I am.  Damn, here we go again.

He was clutch as Kobe was  I'll never be the Dream that Hakeem was  I never could see why people'll preach a  fast court offense that I couldn't keep up  You see how I creeped up?  You see how I played a big role in Denver like TD-30?  I'll never rock a sky hook 4th quarter time like Kareem-Abdul  Or win six in the summer time like a certain Bull,  But let me know if you feel it, man  'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am.   &amp;#x200B;  Damn here we go again,  Everybody saying run it through him?  But everything I'm not made me everything I am  Damn, here we go again,   People talking shit, but I'm the shit to the fans,  Everything I'm not made me everything I am.  &amp;#x200B;  And I'm back to tear it up,  Haters start your pick-and-roll, I see James gearing up.  People talk so much shit about me with twitter-barbs  they forget their avatars.  Okay, fair enough, the West is flaring up,  'Cause they want dunk talk, and I don't slam enough.  Rim protect, blocks, throw elbows,  Can I add that I'm 80% shootin' free throws.  So say goodbye to the NBA MVP award,  Goodbye to the ALL-D award,  They'd rather give me the B-Best Whitey Award,  But I'll just take the I Dish Like Steve Award.  &amp;#x200B;  Damn here we go again,  But everything I'm not made me everything I am,  DAMN, HERE WE GO AGAIN,  People talking shit, but I'm the shit to the fans,  Everything I'm not made me everything I am.  &amp;#x200B;  I know people won't usually draft this,  But I got the stats to back this  Just last year, Denver had 600 buckets off my passes,  Man, my dime's wreakin' havoc.  Oh, I forgot, 'cept when players is brickin',  Do you know when it feels like when Jamal is missin'?  He went 4-18 200 miles from Aspen.  I need to talk to somebody, Silver?  The city wants a title, shit we on our way,  60+ fuckin' minutes when they need me to play,  My season up, but I got more to say,  That's enough Golden State, KD leavin' the Bay."
"He clearly played injured in game 7 and got injured in game 6. Curry played injured all series, not helped by the Cavs defense during the entire 4 year final stretch being “Foul Curry and the refs won’t call it.” Harrison Barnes couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn, Draymond got given a suspension due to not fouling Lebron James, and you try to compare that laundry list to Love who never helped against the Warriors in the first place and Irving who, while a positive for the Cavs, probably wouldn’t have won the series for the Cavs because none of the last 3 games were close and they lost the one game Irving played anyways.  And let’s not forget the game was TIED when Bogut got injured with Draymond not playing."
"Before Luka Doncic did it this year, LeBron James, Tyreke Evans, Michael Jordan, and Oscar Robinson are the only other players to average 20/5/5 their rookie season.  Definitely puts Tyreke in a good light."
"I just love the “James Harden is easily a top 5 player in the league” comments. So where does that leave LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, and Giannis Antetokounmpo? Not saying he isn’t special, but easily...not really. I have him 6 or 7th in my book."
I am interested in the 2020's NBA how will it differ from the 2010's ? Imo the 2010's NBA was all about Lebron James Steph Curry Kevin Durant Kawhi Leonard and it is fitting it ends with the same players who made the finals in the decade. Just to point facts LA Bos Mia Dallas OKC SA GS Cle Tor were the only teams to make the Finals in the 2010's. It wasn't an open door decade for most teams since Miami GSW and Cleveland dominated most of the appearances. And the decade was the decline of the Lakers. I think competition will be spread out in the 2020's and we might get different diverse Finals matchups more like the 2000's. I think the 2020's will be the re emergence of the Big man too.
"Oh, LeBron James was an incredible athlete? Yeah ok, Conzorbatron Scoliosis is way faster and more athletic and he’s 7’3, 400 pounds. LeBron played against bitcoin miners and Twitter shitposters."
And from the shadows emerges an unknown prospect.... LeBron James Jr.
Better or worse with the absence of Lebron James? Worse.  Better or worse with the absence of Lebron James *from the conference he ran train on for a decade*? Wayyyy better.
"&gt;  In other situations, we saw Kobe make it a point to go directly at Lebron, and for Lebron to avoid that competition and confrontation.  They went at each other. They both bought into the hype. And Lebron dominated the Lakers. Lebron went 16-6 against Kobe in their careers. Kobe dropped 35 or more against James 3 times and James dropped 35 or more on Kobe 5 times. They definitely enjoyed the competition. Even in the all-star game James took the challenge of guarding Kobe in their crazy hyped matchup.  James Harden plays point guard. He handles the ball the most Chris Paul actually plays the 2. But if you consider him a point guard then yes he's better than Klay. But that's really it.  McCollum is not as good defensively as Klay. Neither is Mitchell because of his size. Butler and Derozan are not close to the shooter Klay is as one of the best shooters all time. Their dribbling skills vs his shooting skills are a trade off that evens things out. Derozan also isn't the defender Klay is.  Lebron plays a smart game. But he is a highlight machine regardless especially because of his athletic play. Watching Lebron you can learn a lot about professional basketball that's what I did. Especially when he is going up against a smart defender like Draymond. For example, this is a play that the Cavs liked to run to get Kevin Love open shots: https://streamable.com/gxrbd  The Cavs try to force a point guard (in this case Vanvleet) to switch onto Love and the Love's defender to switch onto a guard (in this case George Hill). Both the big and the guard hesitate to switch because they know it will be a mismatch, and Love takes advantage of the confusion by sprinting to the rim. If the guard does switch onto Love, then Love can shoot over him, or back him down into a postup. During the switch Hill would also be open at the 3 point line as the big slowly moves to switch on him.  This play doesn't work against great defenders like Draymond: https://streamable.com/3mnjj  Draymond Green has memorized the play and know what the Cavs want to do. So this becomes a chess match between James and Draymond everyone else is just a pawn. Draymond recognizes the action and goes to stand in Kevin Love's way breaking up the pass and open shot. James immediately recognizes this and calls Draymond's man Tristan Thompson to set a screen for him. He rubs off Durant, and knows he will get an open mid-range shot because Draymond is committed to Love on the baseline. Lebron gets the open shot and Draymond is late contesting. Lebron wins the possession.   Also, I think you're forgetting about prime Lebron who even more of a highlight machine than anyone: https://streamable.com/cjriw. You're comparing old Lebron to prime Kobe. Old Kobe just took a lot of contested 2s. There's nothing especially exciting about that. Prime Kobe was a much more varied scorer like prime Lebron."
"[Wojnarowski] League sources tell the Lakers are trading Lebron James to the Boston Celtics for Brown, Tatum and picks. Irving re-signing is imminent."
"Sure. The Mavericks beating the Heat didnt require Dirk to outplay Wade, it did however require Jason Terry to outplay Lebron James, which he did."
"Did you just miss the part where they signed every headcase in the league and missed the playoffs with Lebron James?  And as for their current roster, they have 3 players at this point, one of which is a 34 year old superstar, who will be 37+ when the back half of those picks/swaps start to convey."
No because you still have Anthony Davis and LeBron James
"[Wojnarowski] Lebron James, 15x All-Star, 3x MVP Champion and NBA Final MVP, has surprisingly announced his retirement. Says Lakers are in 'good hands' with AD and Kuzma."

LeBron James Jr. is very unlikely to be an NBA lottery pick so I think they'll be fine.
He said that he turned off social media during the playoffs so he could focus...  Source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2768675-lebron-james-says-hell-ditch-social-media-again-for-2018-nba-playoffs.amp.html

“Lebron James-Kyrie Irving reunion is more likelier than ever.”  At the end of the article:  “A reunion still ultimately seems unlikely.”  Oh okay. Great read. Thanks.
"The Lakers were sitting with Lebron James, probably the best player in the league but 34 years old, and a whole cast of young, high-potential but not yet great players. In Anthony Davis, they are adding a top 7 player, just entering his prime, and immediately become the premier destination for any players that want to chase rings on minimum contracts and have the space to add a 3rd max contract player (likely someone like Kemba Walker). With AD only being 26, they are set up to continue to be an attractive FA destination for years to come, and so their 1st round picks far into the future are set up to be lower  For the Pelicans, you add two young players with a high ceiling, the #4 pick for someone like Culver or Hunter, and the ability to add cost controlled pieces via the draft until 2025. The floor here is basically the #30 picks in the 2022, 2024 draft in addition to this years #4. That would unquestionably make the Lakers the winners of this trade barring some unforeseen AD disaster.   However the ceiling for the Pelicans is extremely high. Realistically the 2021 pick (which as I understand would go to the Pelicans only if it's top 8) is unliklely to convey, meaning the 2022 pick-3 years from now-will be the Pelicans' regardless of what happens. This is imo unlikely to be all that great, but all it takes is a weird transition/injury year for the Lakers in 2021-22 for that pick to become extremely valuable. But the real potential lies in pick swaps in 23/25 and the unprotected 2024 first. Who the hell knows what will happen by then, but Lebron will no longer be a force at that point most likely, so the Lakers as a team could be a wide range of things and so could their first round picks. But remember they will likely be a popular destination for stars as long as AD remains.  Best case scenario from Lakers: win a title/titles with AD and Lebron and whoever, seamlessly transition to AD/other stars as Lebron's contract ends and his career winds down. Continue to contend, lose out on only this years #4, the players they gave up, and a couple late 1st rounders.  Best case scenario for Pelicans: hit on #4, develop Zo/Ingram into all star caliber players, get lucky and add a high pick or two in the last few years of the Lakers pick run to help aid your own title push in the mid 2020s  My prediction: Lakers win at least one title with this core making the trade worth it on their end, 2/3 of Zo, Ingram, #4 ""work out"" for the Pelicans making them a contender, they get lucky and add one lottery pick out of 2023-2025 via injuries/transition and are a winning franchise for the majority of the next decade-hopefully winning at least one title."
"[Wojnarowski] LeBron James visited Davis' home after the trade was agreed upon and immediately began giving him a los angeles welcome (a reach around with the smallest bit of lotion in the center of the palm). The two have been swapping fluids for hours as Anthony repeatedly screams for LeBron to ""give him the keys"" LeBron immediately slipped an orange VHS tape in Davis' asshole. It's been reported this could be The wild thornberries movie where they explore the entire globe. Sources suggest this is a surefire sign of Kyrie Irvings impending arrival."
Wut? Imagine he finesses Lebron James to play with Lonzo Ball?
"Both teams benefited!  So the Pelicans have the first overall pick in the draft this Thursday, and Zion Williamson is one of the most hyped and exciting NBA prospects since well... Anthony Davis.   Now, Anthony Davis in his prime has been traded to the Lakers alongside Lebron James. They also have enough cap space to attract another star now that the Lakers have given up a bunch of young players such as Lonzo, Ingram, and Hart.  The Lakers has the fourth pick in the draft on Thursday, and they traded that in this deal along with a bunch of other first round picks they had. It sets up the Pelicans very well in the future, they have tons of picks and good players to build around Zion. And now the Lakers have two top players in the league, setting them up to be immediate contenders next year and (hopefully for them) a few years to come."
"Anthony Davis is one of the best players in the league.   He has been traded to the LA Lakers, a storied franchise with many championships that is hated by many for its success, arrogance, and ability to attract stars.   Davis forced a trade and made it clear he wanted to go to the lakers. In return LA sent two young players who were high draft picks as well as another young prospect and multiple first round picks. The picks and swaps involved mean that the Pelicans will also gain additional young players with potential for the next 7 years.   LA now have two superstars in Davis and LeBron James. They have an opportunity to put together a championship level team. The Pelicans are set up to have a lot of youth and potential for years to come. They also hold the #1 pick in this years draft and will gain Zion Williamson who has phenomenal athletic talent and may turn out to be a superstar (or not, we will see).   It’s the biggest trade in many years."

Breaking: The Los Angeles Lakers have traded LeBron James for Anthony Davis.
"[Wojnarowski] In a 3 team trade, the Thunder are sending Westbrook to the warriors, the Lakers send LeBron James to the Pelicans, Jrue Holiday to the Thunder, and Steph Curry to the Lakers."
&gt;Bill Russell (PF/61-62)  David Robinson (C/93-94)  Janitors  Magic Johnson (PG/88-89)  Michael Jordan (SG/95-96)  Lebron James (SF/12-13)  Larry Johnson (PF/92-93)  Antawn Jamison (C/00-01)   Bill Russell *actually* played against Janitors this time 🤔
This is already what’s happening now. I can’t believe people really believe Lebron 3-6 Superteam Weak-eastern-conference James is the GOAT. You all saw what happened when he went to a conference with actual competition.
"I don't expect him to play for the minimum.  I do think that's a reason to trade him away.    ""The Lakers young core"" couldn't get to the playoffs with LeBron James.  The idea that they're going to become finals contenders with Zion is lunacy."
They have *LeBron James* and an MVP DPOTY caliber player.
Classic Lebron James cap allocation. Cavs are still dealing with it
"I understand you and I don't at the same time. Lebron fucking James and AD wanted to play for the Lakers, that's something. Be happy about it and enjoy the season man, it's gonna be a good one for ya'll. See you in the finals ;)"
"The Lakers wouldn't have made this deal without a guarantee from Davis and his agent that Davis will sign an extension. Especially with having the same agent as James.  To think otherwise would be stupid. And you'd only be doing so to support a really weak narrative.  Whether good trade or not, they had to do it.  Look at what a shit show they have going on.  Their front office is obviously over matched. They did the only thing they could do to keep the one positive thing they have going happy. LeBron said jump and do it now and they said ok.  James don't give a fuck about young players, Wiggins anyone, and is confident in his ability to with with Davis and a bunch of veteran ring chasers.  If they get another max player, even better, but they're still gonna sign a whole bunch of vets he approves of.   They weren't bidding against anyone else, everyone knew that.  Rich Paul even tried to help them by pushing the ""Lakers and Knicks as the only two options"" rumors, knowing the Knicks have absolutely nothing to trade for him, basically saying Lakers or bust.    You also notice that LeBron hitched his wagon to Davis, probably because none of the other free agents would want to be LeBron's puppet like Davis doesn't mind being.  You think Durant, Irving, or Leonard would let LeBron dictate their career like Davis has, even getting his agent of choice? No, they wouldn't.  Davis is gonna regret this one the two years LeBron has left are done and he's in a worse situation in LA than he was in NO."
"It's insane how you can sign LeBron James and trade for AD in the span of 12 months but still be so hated that people call your management ""awful"".  Stay salty."
Do you guys really think Windhorst is good at his job at all? He literally got this far riding Lebron James’ coattails. All the way back to his High School days. Windhorst is at best a mediocre writer and a bad reporter. I always cringe when he’s on the Lowe Post because the disparity in actual basketball knowledge is so obvious. And ESPN wonders why they’re facing declining ratings...
he says fuckin world champs but nephews will hear lebron james in every single opportunity.

And I know it was an emotional time that they told me that because I was leaving. They just told me it was the biggest mistake I was making in my career. And that right there was my motivation.""  &gt;McMenamin and Windhorst note that James appears to be referring to Heat president Pat Riley, who made a reference about ""smiling faces with hidden agendas"" when James left the team.  &gt;LeBron added: ""I knew what I was doing. I knew what I was doing and I mean, tonight is a product of it."""
"LeBron James announces retirement, now that's a crazy headline"

"If laughing at your childish trolling and at the same time pitying you because the lack of accomplishments of your team despite having LeBron frigging James forces you to be this salty jealous little bitch, then hell yea count me fully trigger.  But yea, LOL"
Lol are you serious? Windhurst owes his entire career to stalking LeBron James. I remember when LeBron accidently showed his dong on live TV and people were surprised to not find Brian Windhurst nestled down in there.

"And really, an agent. An agent that is only an agent because of LeBron James. Which I don’t mean as a slight towards LeBron.

I guess props to him."

Lopez also got injured. Different story if that doesn't happen.  Lakers not making this trade would be stupid. You have LeBron James. The Warriors have lost two All-Stars. The Rockets have some internal dysfunction and CP3's age is showing. There is really no better time to go all in for a 'ship than this year.
"Lowkey, Celtics won this trade. Kept all their assets, especially Brown and Tatum, while their biggest rival gave up the whole future all to keep a 35yrs old LeBron James, who has 3 years left on his contract, happy. Wow."

"&gt;Idk bro it takes a team not three players to win a championship (Toronto)..they gotta get a better bench and guards  I agree with you, and I'm aware of that. We will have to wait and see what the Lakers do with the rest of their roster this offseason. I My bad, I should've been more clear. My point was that I just found that narrative dumb about LeBron James not caring about winning anymore. I'm not saying that LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers will win a championship next year, I was just pointing out how silly that narrative sounds. If the Lakers don't land a 3rd max player, they could use the rest of their cap space (around $30 million or so) to sign some decent role players which isn't a bad route to take as well lol"
It’s Lebron James and AD. It’s not Gordon bum ass Hayward and Tatum.
Lebron James is only signed until 2022. Pretty sure some decent free agents can be acquired with the $40 million that frees up.

lebron james
&gt;i’ve never been on a super team   - lebron james
The other team who had LeBron James won 2/4 seasons. 
"&gt; he should have given the Clippers serious consideration  I keep seeing people saying this, but the Clippers didn't have anywhere close to the max cap space that they would have needed to even pitch LeBron last summer. I find it amusing that people look at the Clippers as having young prospects and two max slots and think they're well positioned for the future, and yet one year ago when the Lakers had young prospects and two max slots nobody gave them the same consideration.   I think we need a reality check when comparing the Clippers' and Lakers' situations moving forward this summer. The Clippers have the following players under guaranteed contract for next year:   * Lou Williams (33 years old)  * Danilo Gallinari (31 years old)  * Montrezl Harrell (25 years old)  * Landry Shamet (22 years old)  * SGA (21 years old)  * Jerome Robinson (22 years old)  That's it. Everyone else is a free agent or non-guaranteed, and while they could bring some of the free agents back or guarantee a couple extra contracts, that would eat up their cap space to do so. Also, the Clippers won't have a 1st round pick this year. So basically the Clippers are 100% dependent on signing two max free agents this summer, because while the rest of that above is solid, it's by no means a championship core. It's also two separate timelines, as the Clippers' roster is basically made up of old guys and rookies (and Harrell).  Here's who the Lakers have signed to guaranteed contracts for next season:  * LeBron James (34 years old)  * Brandon Ingram (22 years old)  * Lonzo Ball (21 years old)  * Kyle Kuzma (24 years old)  * Josh Hart (24 years old)  * Mo Wagner (22 years old)  * Isaac Bonga (19 years old)  The Lakers will have one max cap slot this summer and a lottery pick (possibly even a high lottery pick). You can say that the Clippers ownership or front office or coach are better than the Lakers (and that's probably true), but their situation on paper is arguably worse than the Lakers' is. The Lakers have the better superstar, more experienced young players with higher upsides and a better draft situation for this coming season.  So now, a player like Kawhi could join either team, and in either case that team would be one of the better ones in the West, but I think it's tough to argue that Kawhi with that Clippers group would be better than Kawhi with that Lakers group. And if you say that no stars would ever want to join LeBron, then consider that that would have to also apply if LeBron had joined the Clippers instead of the Lakers. Maybe the Clippers can convince two max guys to sign this summer, but it doesn't sound like anyone other than Kawhi is even considering them.  In the end I think the Clippers' pitch to free agents this summer is going to be a tough one, since they'll need to get two guys to commit to really be a championship contender. The Lakers offer a preferable situation, probably both on and off the court. After all, players can just ask guys like CP3, Blake and DJ [what it's like to be a star player on the Clippers while playing in Los Angeles.](https://streamable.com/6pck2)"

Lebron James effect 
I’m saying in reality they weren’t as good as people make it seem by saying “Celtics almost beat a Lebron James Cavs team”... idk what’s so hard to understand. They had great playoff performances by lebron but besides the Toronto series the supporting cast was average at best lol. I’m jussayin that is the one year of the last 8 that they actually had a shot to beat lebron. Fasho the weakest team he’s had in 8 years. In a weak east. Just putting it into proper perspective. 
"The MVP debate should be more towards whether or not James Harden shoukd be the unanimous MVP rather than whether or not he'll actually beat out Giannis. If Steph, KD, Giannis, PG or LeBron had those statelines and the same storyline, they'd be debated as unanimous MVP. "

Putting money on one or two people and an idea is exactly what investors do. And Nike committed 90 million guaranteed to Lebron James in 2003 so I’m not sure why 50 from an investor or 50 million in equity equivalent from an a well-funded startup looking to make a splash in the basketball market seems totally unrealistic.   And Lebron James in 2003 is the the #1 exception to the “almost no rookie is worth 50 mil” rule. 
kawhi james harden kd steph giannis &amp; embiid are all players i’ll take over lebron.   
"Okay tell me this then does playing with Trae Young, Kevin Huerter, and some other young players give him a better chance of winning a championship then playing with Lebron James a top 5 player of all time?"
"Yeah, not everyone is Lebron James. I am still amazed he actually got hurt and took all those games off. I didn't think I'd ever see that in my lifetime honestly."
"maybe [Steph Curry Syndrome](https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-doesnt-like-stephen-curry-2017-4)? he came out of nowhere and really became a star, **and** he doesn't look like the typical nba player. (though neither does Trae ""Chernobyl"" Young)"
Because watching/posting about another man playing Minecraft all day makes you unique?   Take your LeBron James hairline out of my inbox you fucking dweeb lmao. I’ll sit comfortably at the number 3 spot in the west behind my superstar. 
"There's not many iconic and interesting players any more. Giannis's face doesn't really sell well, and any faces that do are in their 30's, or entering them soon. 34yo Laker Lebron, Steph Curry, KD, and James Harden are the faces of the league, only Harden currently at his real peak. There is no new MJ-level icon on the horizon, at best there's hope of Harden kind of riding the MJ/Kobe/LeBron generational wave of the face of the league. None of the younger players will seemingly ever be on that level, so it will likely just get even worse from here. After the Curry/Harden draft of 09, from 10-14 the biggest players drafted are Kawhi, Giannis, AD, George, Klay, Jokic, Embiid, Lillard, Irving. Some great players that are fun to watch, but a far cry from as sounding as iconic as some of the 00's roster had, not mentioning anything back before that. And then you've got drafts after 2014 which I don't even feel like mentioning. 20's will likely turn me off from the league, though of course that's just my personal thing, but I don't think the general populace is excited about many of the current and future faces either."
"&gt; paid a ton of money to participate in a sport that millions of people care about  *and* don't do as well as expected in your job. Even before Lebron, I don't think Lakers fans and the NBA were all that jazzed up by Luke's coaching. And I don't care that Lebron's been injured for 18 games, you can't have Lebron James added to your core team and only be able to match or *barely* surpass your win count from last year. That's nonsense."
"This is why Lebron James is the greatest athlete of all time. There is no figure in any sport who is as perfect as he is. Generous, somewhat humble, dedicated to his fans, strong, black activist, never did a bad thing in his life, and the most dominant baller of the last two decades.  Even though he will likely become the top scorer of all time, he is known for his passing. His game is a reflection of who he his. The players all seem to love him. His teammates support him all the time. Even ex-teammates will follow him and support him forever.  Is there any other sport where the best player is also a transcendent role model? Lebron combines the two in an unprecedented manner. He really is way bigger than basketball. "

The Lebron James method.  Couldn't figure out how a dude his size never rolled ankles until I tried on his shoes.
We got LeBron James   We missed the playoffs with Bron  Now we are a meme 
So a Lebron James who has to be pushed by Kuzma to play defense is doing great? You know theres a whole lot more to basketball than stats right?
"You sign LeBron with the cap space from the D'Lo/Mogov trade. Lopez was willing to sign for cheap after this, and you sign him to a cheap contract. I'd sit down with Randle and negotiate a contract with him. There have been reports he didn't want to come back, but that may have been because we were only willing to give him a one-year contract. He has the talent and is worth more than a one-year contract, so I'd negotiate with him a bit more. The team desperately needs shooters after this, and a back-up PG. I really wanted Shabazz Napier and Seth Curry last offseason. McGee is a fine signing for a back-up big. I think the team needs a bit more help with SF after this, so sign anyone not named Lance Stephenson, and I think the team looks pretty good overall.  &amp;#x200B;  Ball / Napier  Ingram / Curry  James / Hart  Randle / Kuzma  Lopez / McGee / Zubac"
&gt;James Harden - 0 rings. (Staying put) &gt; &gt;Kevin Durant - 2 rings. (And counting)  &gt; &gt;Steph Curry - 3 rings. (And counting)  &gt; &gt;LeBron James - 3 rings. (??) &gt; &gt;Russell Westbrook - 0 rings. (??) 
"No it isn't. It's just not as obvious as when, say, James Harden drops 61. He affects the spacing for his teammates every second that he's on the floor more than anyone in the history of the game, and on top of that he's one of the best offensive players in the game. In terms of winning basketball games, there's no player I'd rather have on my team except Lebron James."

There's no such thing as a throwaway year when you have LeBron James on your fucking team. 
Kyrie has very similar sulking mannerisms to Lebron James
LeBron Raymone James showed his wiener on live tv
I don't think there's a single person in the mix who sees Lebron James as having more individual blame for the Laker's losing than Magic/Pelikna/Young core etc  That said there are games that could have been won before they were realistically out of it. Lebron sleeping on defense and missing free throws didn't help.
Magic Johnson the type of GM who would pass on Ja Morant and keep Lonzo Ball because of potential.  Magic Johnson also the type of GM who would trade Deangelo Russell and draft Lonzo Ball for his replacement a year later.  Magic Johnson the type of GM who would let Julius Randal walk for nothing.  Magic Johnson the type of GM who would sign Lebron James only to end up back in the lottery.  Magic Johnson is not a good GM.
Maybe for yall. Me and many others will remember as a 4 time scoring champion and MVP who's skill has been publicly admired by everybody from Lebron James to Kobe Bryant
So what you're saying is that LeBron James was more productive for the Lakers since 2014 than Mike Muscala is now?

No because statistically Lebron hasn't been the best. I think James Harden has. To me I see why wins are important because if a player was averaging 37//6/8 on a 14th seed I would have trouble supporting them as MVP. But no team with that great a player would be a 14th seed. The Rockets and The Bucks are both dominant and the Rockets have been faced with more difficult circumstances even though when healthy they have an incredible team especially now with the return of Danuel House
"&gt;You really think guys like Jimmy Butler and even Lebron James had home cooked breakfast every morning, a car ride to practice and an in home basketball court?  They both had people who looked after them and took care of them. Lavar had the means to provide a certain lifestyle. That doesn't devalue the work that other parents/caretakers had to do. I'm sure some had to work 2 jobs just to make enough to give them food and a place to sleep. A lot of kids didn't grow up in Chino Hills.   My point is that behind these players, are all kinds of parents/caretakers who had to sacrifice to put these players in a position to be successful. "

"Filling the roster with the absolute worst possible players for a LeBron James system.  LeBron plus shooters has been the formula for a decade, what idiot signs LeBron and thinks ""you know who would be good with this? How about Rajon Rondo, Lance Stephenson, Michael Beasley, KCP."" They literally could not have made worse decisions in free agency it they tried. "
LeBron James no question
"3 years? That puts the 2016 WCF inside of that. You know, the one where the 2014 MVP and the 2017 MVP couldn't beat the Warriors, but then LeBron ""worse than KD"" James had the best finals series ever and beat that same team. You just can't even make that argument until at least last years finals, and even then it is pretty stupid. I still don't think KD is close to as good as LeBron, but the gap is for sure closing. "
"Oh right, the 2nd seeded GSW. Obviously that makes Harden a choker. Other chokers include LeBron James and the entire rest of the NBA. "
"No he’s not, don’t act like saying the arguable goat doesn’t care to win is some indisputable or factual take. That’s much less reasonable since you don’t know it for sure while the contrary has been evident throughout the vast majority of his career. Y’all are just sheep hunting for upvotes, LeBron fucking James isn’t some role player scrub who doesn’t care about ball no matter how much you haters want to believe otherwise "
"&gt; If LeBron we're in the west those years then he would've been in better teams.  You really believe this?

That's a fact. Unlike your boy James Harden LeBron is a beast in the playoffs.  Lebron ain't used to having to actually try in the regular season just to seed well.

You're not looking at it objectively either. If LeBron we're in the west those years then he would've been in better teams. What his record be that different?   Put LeBron on last year's Rockets team and he'd currently have 4 championships. That's a *fact*. Unlike your boy James Harden LeBron is a beast in the playoffs. No player other than Jordan comes close to LeBron's playoff success and dominance.  James Harden ain't it chief.
"definitely true. these two exemplify the easiest MVPs.to.vote for: two-way contribution and tons of wins versus high offensive production. it's neck and neck even with the eye test and both players are electrifying to watch. it's an easy sell for the media and we don't even have to get into the advanced stats to make a decision because both candidates are so deeply driven by narratives.  Harden is the savior of Houston and the personification of Mamba Mentality, and Giannis is looking like the second coming of LeBron James. a revival of the Kobe-LeBron figures makes this a fun MVP race to watch"
LeBron “Steph Curry” James
"Our team is so dysfunctional right now.  It was really telling when it came out that the coaching staff wanted to keep Lopez and Randle against management’s wishes.  One of our biggest issues last year and this year was/is a lack of continuity.  Great teams grow together on the court.  I understand injuries happen but Brook and Julius were so big for us last season that to remove both from lineup shakes things up a lot and forces the others to re-learn the habits of other players.    Ultimately I’d have been ok with them letting Julius go because he wanted out and you supplant his production with a greater talent in James, but letting Lopez go was a big mistake given out desperate need for shooting.  What’s crazy is that his presence doesn’t just give LeBron a target from deep, it opens up the lane for Ingram, Hart and even Kuz who like to play at the basket.  McGee would have been a terrific signing if he was playing backup to Brook because that’s what he is, a fantastic, high energy big who can go get the lobs from the second unit but the FO fell for his “I want out of GS because I wanna start” campaign.    Rondo I don’t mind as a one year rental, but Lance and Beas were bad moves.  You don’t sign knuckleheads next to youth, you add the knucklehead or two to bring that oddball x-factor after your roster is already constructed and groomed a la Artest, DeShawn Stevenson, Sheed, Cousins etc...  "
"Not that I don't believe you, but I never saw any of these posts over a month ago.   538 predicted the Lakers would get *6th*, and all the upvoted comments were 'He brought a sack of potatoes to the finals last year, you guys are idiots for underestimating LeBron""   I think Nylon calculus posted an article saying the Lakers *might* miss the playoffs, due to poor roster construction, what if the young players don't make the leap everyone is expecting, what if people get injured (honestly the author pretty much hit everything on the head). All the upvoted comments were calling him an idiot / LeBron hater.   Now they're looking like they'll end the season with *33 wins*, even fewer than last year, and now I'm seeing all these people saying that's what they predicted.  If you said at the start of the season there is *even a possibility* the Lakers would add LeBron James and win less games than the previous season, your post was getting buried in 2 seconds. Hell I even read the buried comments pretty often and I never saw anyone suggest that.   Even the Lakers haters I saw just thought the Lakers would miss the playoffs, never saw anyone suggest they'd even have under 40 wins let alone less than last year. "

"Sure, people thought maybe LA could land Kawhi but when that quickly came out to be false, literally everyone knew that LA would need to wait it out until next year's FA to compete again for AD/Kawhi or even Kyrie. There weren't anymore big fish after Kawhi went to Toronto for anyone to legitimately think that ""other big free agents [were] on the way"" that same summer. Do you have any sources whatsoever or are you just going on what you remember reading on r/nba? [Here's](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23973940/kawhi-leonard-trades-lakers-do-now-lebron-james) a piece from Pelton and Marks even before Toronto trades for Kawhi where they discuss how it might be smarter for LA to wait for 2019 with the much better FA class, and perhaps in hopes that if a FA signs in 2019 they won't even need to lose their young core. They discuss how LA purposely signed a bunch of vets for 1 year deals in preparation to clear up cap space in 2019's offseason. The consensus was that LA would wait a season because, after Kawhi, there wasn't a second star to get in 2018. You're the one spouting the revisionist history."
"I'm still too new here to understand everyone's ""nephew"" remarks. From what I can tell, it has something to do with LeBron James, but it's still unclear to me.

"Magic Johnson was a legendary Los Angeles Lakers player in the 80s. He retired young due to HIV, became an enormously successful businessman, and is an inspirational figure deeply ingrained in Lakers and NBA history. He is my all time favorite basketball player and I love every second I watched him play.  Unfortunately, none of this qualifies him to be the president of daily basketball ops, a job he fell into a few years ago due to his good standing with the team and their interest in being a glamour team in a glamour market. Magic as the face of your team sounds great, but this is a deeply analytical job that requires an exceptional commitment in the multibillion-dollar world of the modern NBA.  Outside of recruiting an aging superstar in LeBron James, every single move Magic made as president of basketball ops has snowballed into a disastrously poor roster that is not attracting the other star players that the whole house of cards counted on attracting. It has been an ongoing soap opera among NBA fans: there's palace intrigue at play, superstar players sniping openly, and absolute managerial chaos the most valuable team in one it the most valuable media markets in the world.  The NBA regular season is coming to a close tonight. We all expected Magic to clean house and start a new course tomorrow, and I think we were all intrigued at just how spectacularly wrong **that** would go. Instead he bamboozled us all and quit on live TV, ranting about it for half an hour on camera, without telling the Lakers first, leaving them to pick up the pieces of whatever the hell he's done, none of which ever made any sense. It's one of the wildest things we've seen in a long time."

We have two first round second picks on our team - one of which averaged 28 a game for close to a month. Lonzo was looking a lot better before he got injured. There were a lot of rumors that the lakers had reached out to him to tell him that his shoes were unsafe to play in, and he’s finally coming out of them. We have Kuzma. He’s inefficient, but he’s still a stud. Josh hart was also great before he got injured. Caruso and Wagner are good, but still have a ways to go. And we also have LeBron James locked up for a couple years. I think we’ll be fine."

"The original is perhaps the clearest evidence of MJ's greatness. People are actually nostalgic about a movie so shitty that it couldn't get any laughs even though it had Looney Tunes, Charles Barkley, and Bill Murray in the cast.

In Win Shares per 48 Minutes, Wade is 10th (.210) while Kobe sits at 13th (.192). If we use pure Win Shares without factoring in minutes, Kobe is seventh (36.5), while Wade is 11th (34.1). When you compare this specific portion of these two careers using all-in-one statistics, it’s clear Wade actually was neck-and-neck with Kobe. Maybe Riley was on to something. &gt;  &gt; Here’s the caveat. *Would you like to guess who was first in every single one of these categories?* **Dirk. Dirk was.** Every one of them. If you prefer a stat like Value Over Replacement Player, which attempts to control for a player’s teammates, Dirk trailed only Lebron James and Kevin Garnett during this time. There is a real case to be made that Dirk was the best player in the league during this stretch, and you never hear anyone say this."
"Oden was a great college player yes but he was nowhere near as good in college as other big prospects like Blake Griffin, Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, Deandre Ayton, Karl Anthony Towns, and now Zion Williamson.   There was a large vocal minority of people who were completely baffled that Durant wasn't going first overall. Read [this mock draft](http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=nbamockdraft/070627) by Bill Simmons. It was absolutely not crazy to consider Kevin Durant. Granted I am nowhere close to as scathing as Simmons is in his criticism of Oden, but my point is that it's not revisionist for me to say I'd take KD over Oden. Oden was absolutely not a perfect prospect. Durant was.  Odens counting stats were definitely not bad, he averaged 16/10/1/1/3, on 59% TS and his shot blocking was definitely solid. His 63% from the line wasn't great but for a big it was solid. He played 29 mpg. All of this was great, his rim protection was excellent and he was easily the best player on the Ohio State team that made it to the championship game. He lost to an incredible Florida team that had 3 top 10 picks (Al Horford, Corey Brewer, Joakim Noah). He won the defensive player of the year award. He was a 2nd team all American.  There is no doubt I would have taken Oden second. He was a very good big man prospect, and he was definitely one of the better prospects of those draft classes, but he wasn't Durant.  Durant averaged 26/11/1/2/2 on 59% TS including 40% from 3 (6 attempts per game) and 82% from the line. All on 36 mpg. He was the first ever freshman to win the Naismith and he won just about every other college basketball award you can think of. His only blemish was losing in the 2nd round to a USC team, even though he scored 30 points that game. Calling him the best player in college basketball isn't doing him justice, he had one of the best college seasons in NCAA history.  We are talking a 6'10"" pure forward with a 7'5"" wingspan (bigger than Oden I might add), 9'2"" standing reach, who averaged 26 points per game on incredible efficiency, had the speed and fluidity of LeBron James, who could handle the ball like a guard, shots 40% from 3, 82% from the line, and had just won every award you can possibly imagine. All while he was a 19 year old freshmen in college.  Durant was, plain and simple, the best prospect we have seen since LeBron. Oden was also amazing, he was not Kevin Durant."
"I’d prefer Isaiah Thomas, but fat chance he gets invited to a Lebron James movie after what went down in Cleveland."
"...trade him. This summer. I can’t imagine why that same Lakers package wouldn’t be available now, their pieces have only depreciated and they just missed the playoffs with LeBron fucking James on their roster.  Or better yet, the Celtics actually offer them the trade package they held out for in the first place. I also don’t see why their pieces wouldn’t have depreciated over the last two months, Celtics have been a dumpster fire all year and Tatum has shown no improvement this season."
"I think it's the same as KD with the Warriors and LeBron with Miami.    LeBron said a year after the heatles that he wanted a team that had his back clearly meaning enforcers and players who can send a massage to those playing it rough because they can get away with it and having guys like James Jones, Juwan Howard Pat Riley and such showing him the championship mentality ( like I assume guys always there throughout the day training (vs just mandatory hours) , use breaking tech in gym machines, having and encouraging healthy craves (as opposed to fast food runs, ect.    Don't remember where but some formers players said in an interview how some teams with less leadership had some gyms were very basic at the time, nutrition was up to the players so they often made runs to the fast food joints, they could do whatever they wanted and it was a distraction as it just became can't wait till April or I'm on contract year so I want my stats up so I can bounce."
"I hope LeBron James leads a team of monstars against the tune squad. The monstars are Giannis, KD, AD, and Harden (Steph if they need the fifth)"
"He was putting up those numbers when healthy. But he’s also been injured a ridiculous amount. 31 injuries in 6 years. I’m sorry, but no team can be a top team when their top 5 player spends that much time on the bench.  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2019/1/31/18203802/anthony-davis-extensive-injury-history-demands-he-play-alongside-lebron-james"
"[Well this was a report that came out around the kawhi trade talks](https://sports.yahoo.com/source-kawhi-leonard-reaches-lebron-james-hopes-play-210550904.html) that was quickly forgotten after he was traded. Then reporters like ramona and woj started saying that Kawhi probably doesn’t want to play for lebron even though they have no direct sources, and from there the narrative picked up, and I’m inclined to belive that Kawhi’s camp let it happen to reduce speculation of the signing."
Or LA's offer was overhyped and they can't even make playoffs with Lebron James on their team.  &amp;#x200B;  Or AD is a top player who needs another star because he can't handle the pressure of being the main option.
"You're right that agent is acting on the best interest of the client, but with LeBron James in mind. Everyone knew the writing on the wall was there when he signed with Klutch Sports but how it was handled and how he allowed it to he handled was pathetic. He has been their puppet throughout this situation, if you can't see that then you're being naive"
LeBron James as Michael Jordan in Space Jam 1
Or a few other players not named Lebron James.
"Things that need to happen in Space Jam 2.    1.  AD becomes a Monstars, but requests a trade to play with Lebron James.    2.  KD becomes a monstar, but leaves at half time to join earth, when they’re up, citing “hardest path.”  3.  Lavar Ball convinces the Monstars to draft Lonzo Ball by constantly yelling he’s the best and Aliens are “small ballers.”  4.  Harden is a monstar whose power is to draw fouls with his beard.    5.  Derrick Rose becomes a monstar but gets injured right away and is out for the season.    6.  Once KD leaves the Monstars, Westbrook leads them to a win with the first triple triple game stat padding his way to 100-100-100 on 41.2% TS.    7.  The entire planet cheers for the Monstars by the end of the movie."
"Dwayne Wade is greater then James Worthy.  Kyrie Irving may go down as much better then Worthy also. But the main point is you are forgetting the teams of the 80's were stacked. So of course KAJ has a stacked team.  Sorry but KAJ destroys Lebron in almost every category.  More stats, better winner, more championships, better defender, better scorer, better rebounder, more iconic shot, more MVPs, More All NBA, more All defense, more rings, more top5 MVP...............its not even close.  You have to come up with dozens of excuses just to justify your stance."
"That same front office signed LeBron James.  Last I checked, getting one off the greatest players of all-time to sign with you &gt; trading Zubac."
He played with Lebron James and Chris Bosh in his prime....
Imagine being Lebron or Kyrie and then realize how fucking lame you are for dicking the city of Cleveland for no reason and wasting several years of your prime in the process. The chain reaction of Kyrie having little man syndrome and bailing on the Cavs just to come crawling back to Lebronathan James.
"Lebron James, Im the greatest basketball player of all time and my pickup friends always tell me Im overconfident"
"Howard Beck recently examined the relationship and rivalry between Dirk and Dwyane Wade. He included this quote from Pat Riley, which was fed through the aggregation machine for a few days:  *For about a three-year span Wade was, in Riley’s view, “the best player in the world.”*  *“Dwyane was better than Kobe at that time,” Riley says. “He had a better year by having the impact on winning—in the Finals, in the biggest moments, on the biggest stage.

"obviously all star players have some say in who the team brings in, but some people act like Lebron James is Cersei Lannister or something. A lot of hear-say/insinuation when it comes to the 'LeGM"" criticism."
"You've just described EXACTLY how it should work.  It SHOULD be harder to guard folks by not fouling them.   Do you think if people stopped fouling James Harden he'd score less points??  He gets fouled on his 3s so much because the rules in today's NBA are VERY clear.  You have to give the shooter a spot to land.  Other players can CERTAINLY take advantage if this rule as well, and some do sometimes.  But if it was that easy, many more would. Nevermind the fact that it's an injury risk all the time... if there's any reason Harden would stop doing it it would be because of that/he really f's up his ankle at some point.  It's not pretty basketball.  It's not exciting basketball. But it is basketball.  Nevermind the fact that despite the dude being a bowling ball when he drives, and despite the fact that he drives more than any player in the league, he's not leading the league in FTA on drives/drive.  Giannis, Lebron, Dinwiddie, LaVine all go to the line more per drive.  Giannis' rate far exceeds Harden's - he's 24% more likely to go to the line on drives.  That difference would be the same as the difference between Harden's rate and Mike Conley's rate, so ""around"" Harden's % would also include players like PG, Ingram, Kawhi, John Wall, Fox, Lou Williams, Jimmy B., Devin Booker and Luka.  That's not ""unfair"".  That's just what it is.  Shaq used to get fouled all the time, too.    Bear in mind, Giannis gets fouled on 0.49 of his NON-DRIVE FGA.  Harden's number there is only 0.35.  This shouldn't be a surprise.  Giannis shoots 9.5 FT per game to Harden's 9.6, despite taking nearly 7 less shots a game.  In other words, Giannis is going to the line MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY per usage.  But, but, but, but... Giannis a ""big"" and doesn't shoot pull up threes.  Yes, we get it, old school dudes still think you can only get fouled in the paint, and that even though a dude is taking 100% contested pull up threes with defenders consistently and repeatedly right in his face and landing zone, that there can't possibly be a foul there, lol.  If you actually watch the Rockets play, you'd know that the guy that is doing lots more foul baiting and foul hunting is CP3.  He loves the rip through move.  Harden barely does the rip through.  Giannis plays bully-ball.  You watch enough Bucks and you see that.  Again, that's not unfair.  That's perfectly reasonable, appropriate and part of the reason he is likely the MVP this year, but wasn't last year."
"[Did Kyrie Trade Convince LeBron to Stay in Cleveland? NBA Execs Doubtfu](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2729459-did-kyrie-trade-convince-lebron-to-stay-in-cleveland-nba-execs-doubtful) - **Ric Bucher** **August 2017**  &gt; The prevailing sentiment among the league executives B/R contacted remains that when it comes time to exercise the option on his final contract year with the Cavaliers, James won't.  ""He's out,"" a Western Conference scout says.  ""Foregone conclusion,"" one Eastern Conference general manager adds.  ""I don't see him staying in Cleveland,"" another thinks.  With all that in mind, league executives not only expect James to leave but have circled his destination—the Los Angeles Lakers—for a host of reasons. The top three are:  • Setting up his post-playing career in TV and movie production.  • Attempting the unique feat of leading three different teams to a championship.  The first motive is obvious. He already has founded a Los Angeles-based production company, SpringHill Entertainment, and has developed several shows already. James and his two childhood friends-turned-business partners from Akron, Ohio—agent Rich Paul and business manager Maverick Carter—have all purchased homes in Los Angeles in the last two years as well.  The second is a byproduct of the presumptive dynasty built by the Warriors. LeBron has relinquished his goal of Michael Jordan's collection of six championship rings, a league source says."
"No, I don't think he did. The Lakers have been in favor of quick turnarounds long before LeBron ever got there. They even tried doing one in Kobe's final few years before it became clear that injuries were going to finish him off. In this case, I think that LeBron and Magic were 100% on the same page. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's one of the reasons that James signed with LA, aside from the Hollywood angle: he knew that they'd do whatever it took to compete now. If the young guys panned out, they'd go with that. If not, they'd shop them for win-now talent."
I actually like James Harden. I rooted for years prior against Westbrook and I actually admire that he was willing to do whatever it took to gain victory when it his team was primarily injured. Not to long ago I even said I'd take him over LeBron for that very reason.
"&gt; That's completely ridiculous to say. LeBron has a long list of teammates he cares about, has supported, and they in return care about him.  He's legit provided life support to multiple players' careers alone.  You're right, but he's fucked over as many guys as he's helped. These two things are not mutually exclusive.  &gt; What Lakers fans need to realize and accept is that their young core is trash. Kuzma isn't actually a great player in terms of winning basketball games. He's a glorified Andrew Wiggins except he isn't terrible at the one thing he actually does: score.  Kuzma's mostly a scorer and little else, but that doesn't make him a Wiggins, because unlike him he can be quite efficient when used properly. He'd be a key piece on a well-built team, it just so happens that the Lakers aren't one of those.  Ball is a mess and entering a summer that looks like he'll be even more of a mess.  &gt; Ball is a mess offensively, but an excellent distributor and very good on defense. What needs is a coaching staff that'll help him work on his shot.  &gt; Ingram has potential but he's hardly transcendent.  BI is similar to DLo from a few years ago: talented with a good work ethic but in a poor environment. Put him on a team interested in developing young talent and he'll eventually thrive.   None of LA's young players is bad, it's that they need more time and attention to develop, and that's not what a win-now team with LeBron at the helm is willing to do. Honestly, they should've tried trading them all as soon as they signed James, because at the moment you have a team torn between two incompatible approaches. Neither one's wrong, but they don't really fit."
"   When Buss railed against the media at the Sloan Conference on March  2, blaming the “fake news” relating to the Davis trade situation for  hurting the morale among the team’s younger players, it was about more  than that one story. Her frustration, according to a Lakers source with  knowledge of her thinking, extended to another report that she didn’t  mention.  In early February, ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith [said on his radio show](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/02/05/rumors-lakers-owner-jeanie-buss-pushed-magic-johnson-to-draft-lonzo-ball/)  that Buss had been the driving force behind the decision to draft Ball  second overall out of UCLA in 2017. According to Smith, Magic had wanted  to draft De’Aaron Fox out of Kentucky but, in essence, succumbed  because of the business possibilities that came with pairing the Bruins  star with the Lakers brand. While the source adamantly denies the  veracity of the report, and Johnson is known to have told Buss that he  had nothing to do with this message being spread, these are the types of  fires that kept flaring up in the media throughout the course of a  chaotic campaign.  Last week, Buss appeared on a live taping of the Sports Business  Radio Road Show, and described one story that made her doubt the front  office she had put in place.  “There was a story that came out this season — and we’ve had our  challenges this season — and it kind of made me doubt for a second some  of the people that I was working with,” Buss said.  Following the All-Star break, the Lakers had 25 games to make their  final push. They were 28-29 and in 10th place in the West. This was when  James infamously declared he would “activate” for the stretch run. It  was a statement he backed up with 29 points and 12 rebounds in a  decisive win over the Rockets on Feb. 21. But after the turbulence of  the season up to that point, the Lakers needed to keep it going.  “If we go on this road trip and drop two straight, then what does  this game really mean?” Walton said, before the Lakers went on to lose  in New Orleans and Memphis to two sub-.500 teams.  A week later, after LeBron passed the ball off the bottom of the  backboard and the Lakers lost in Phoenix to fall to three games under  .500, they returned home for perhaps their most critical game of the  season. The Clippers were 4½ games ahead of the Lakers in the standings,  with 19 games left in the year. Win and the Lakers could conceivably  still go on a run and make the playoffs. Lose, and any hope of reaching  the playoffs would essentially die."
"   The first sign of trouble came on Oct. 20, the second night of the  season, when a hard foul by Brandon Ingram on James Harden led to a  brawl between Rondo and Chris Paul, with Ingram running in to throw a  haymaker. Amid the melee, James intervened to pull Paul away rather than  defend his fellow Lakers.  The scene reinforced a storyline that would emerge throughout the  season: James being closer to someone not in a Lakers jersey than his  own teammates. It cropped up two months later when James said it would  be “amazing” to team up with Anthony Davis, with whom he shares an  agent. And again when he periodically discussed the prospect of the  Lakers adding Carmelo Anthony.  But James tried to bring his team together. [After a 2-5 start led Johnson to berate Walton](https://theathletic.com/631000/2018/11/02/oram-magic-can-question-the-coaching-but-who-holds-the-front-office-accountable-for-this-roster/),  James organized a team dinner on the road. In the banquet room of a  Portland steakhouse, James attempted to calm the nerves of his new team.  Three Lakers starters — Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Kyle Kuzma — were  still in their second or third years in the league. Another second-year  player, Josh Hart, was playing a key role off the bench. Only one player  on the roster, Michael Beasley, had ever played with James before.  “He was just talking about what we could do to get the year back on track,” Ball told *The Athletic*. “Not to panic, he’s been through this before. Basically telling us it’s early, growing pains and we’ve got to get through it.”  These were things the young Lakers knew, of course. But it was different when James delivered the message.  “Hearing it from the dude at the top, it’s just more comfort,” Ball  said. “Don’t panic. Nobody was worried, we just knew we had to turn it  around.”  And they did. The Lakers won four of their next five games and nine  of their next 11 to begin their climb up the Western Conference  standings.  Elsewhere in the organization, however, things were not stabilizing.  The seeds of distrust planted by Johnson’s chiding of the coaching staff  was only the beginning of the turmoil.  The lines were drawn. With his closed-door tongue lashing, Johnson  essentially planted a time bomb under Walton. Any suggestion now that  Walton could have guaranteed his job coaching the Lakers would seem to  be revisionist history. Johnson said Walton would keep his job barring  “something drastic.” Lakers coaches spent much of the second half of the  season looking over their shoulders, wondering after bad losses like  ones in Indiana and Phoenix how exactly Johnson would define “drastic.”  Walton had reason to be concerned. At one point during the season,  the Lakers reached out to former Nets and Bucks coach Jason Kidd to  gauge his interest in coaching the team, should the position become  available, a source told Frank Isola of *The Athletic*. A high-ranking Lakers official disputes this claim.  The tension between the Lakers’ front office and coaching staff only  appeared to grow over the course of the season. Johnson is seen as an  absentee executive, a label best illustrated by one moment last season.  At the end of a week the Lakers were criticized for not backing Walton  in the wake of LaVar Ball’s allegations that the coach had lost control  of the locker room, Johnson turned up in Hawaii, on lockdown in a  fallout shelter following the false missile alert.  This season, Pelinka, the general manager, took a proactive role in  sitting in on coaches’ meetings and even requested the Lakers change the  way their scouting reports were packaged for players, according to  multiple sources. While a GM collaborating with a coaching staff on how  to present information may not be without precedent, this was seen by  those on the ground as another example of Pelinka unnecessarily meddling  in low-level affairs.  Meanwhile, James had a problem of his own. While he had endorsed the  front office’s summer strategy, he objected to a comment Johnson made  more than a month after the season started.  Near the end of November, the Lakers were 20 games into the season  with an 11-9 record. LeBron, meanwhile, was averaging the fewest minutes  of his career (34.8). Knowing he was approaching age 34 and had played  more basketball than anyone over the last decade after eight straight  Finals, those reduced minutes were designed.  But the way Johnson described this Lakers plan, in an interview with  SiriusXM NBA Radio, caught LeBron off guard. Magic said the Lakers  wanted to watch LeBron’s minutes and get the ball out of his hands some,  because otherwise “now it is Cleveland all over again and we don’t want  that.”  “I didn’t like that when I heard it, because, I mean, four straight Finals,” James told *The Athletic* earlier this season.  LeBron added that he wasn’t sure what Magic meant by his comments,  though there was no mistaking them. The Lakers were not going to be set  up like the Cavaliers in Cleveland, where LeBron had to do so much.  There was no follow-up because, in the grand scheme, it didn’t matter.  He was signed for at least three seasons and was going to have the ball  in his hands regardless.  By mid-December, the Lakers were on a roll, side-stepping the initial  wave of injuries to Rondo and Ingram and, at one point, won six out of  seven games. Looking to strengthen their defense and shore up their  shooting deficiencies, the Lakers pursued a deal for ex-Laker Trevor  Ariza before Phoenix traded him to Washington.  That exercise sent a clear message: The Lakers were looking for upgrades that would help them win this season.  A few days later in Brooklyn, James took it a step further. He was  stretching on the floor of the visitor’s locker room when he told an  ESPN reporter that it would be “awesome” to one day play with Anthony  Davis, the New Orleans star who would lead his Pelicans into Staples  Center a few nights later.  For the young players, this was the first time James had publicly  indicated he would be open to the Lakers making a blockbuster trade —  even if it was indirectly.  History will be left to wonder if the Lakers could have continued their roll.  Speaking to *The Athletic* just before the start of the  regular season, Jeanie Buss invoked a favorite maxim of her former  fiancé, ex-Lakers coach Phil Jackson.  “Phil always used to say, ‘By Christmas Day, you kind of know who you  are, because … you kind of know where you’re going to fit. We just have  to see the team play,’” she said.  By Christmas, the Lakers were 20-14 and in fourth place in the  Western Conference — although in the jumbled West, they were as close to  10th place as they were to first. James was a frontrunner to win MVP.  But with a misstep in the third quarter of the Lakers’ win over the  Warriors, an entire season changed. James was initially listed as  day-to-day with a strained groin, but the injury proved more serious.  It was during this time that James became less present around the  team. The Lakers struggled without him, naturally, but James was not  really around. His injury did not allow him to travel, and he would  arrive at home games moments before tip-off. [Once with a glass of red wine in hand](https://twitter.com/ChrisPalmerNBA/status/1078858683415556096).  This was when, according to some in the locker room, players started to look at James a bit differently.  In contrast to LeBron’s disconnected presence, there was Rajon Rondo.  Rondo had also suffered an injury on Christmas, a sprained finger that  required surgery. Instead of disappearing, however, Rondo was a regular  presence. He shot left-handed in post-practice shooting games and hung  around the locker room. When the Lakers’ plane left for Sacramento the  day after Christmas, Rondo met the plane at the airstrip.  With cookies.  Rondo’s snacks are their own story in leadership. He started making  sandwiches for teammates when he played in Sacramento. Then, his  personal chef taught him to make cookies. Lonzo Ball likes to tell Rondo  his chocolate chip cookies could be sold in stores.  “Food is the best way to bring people together,” said Rondo, who also  frequently catered the postgame meals in the locker room for the team."
"But they do often win.   Michael Jordan*   Karl Malone   Shaquille O'Neal*   Allen Iverson*   Tim Duncan x2   Kevin Garnett   Steve Nash* x2   Dirk Nowitzki*   Kobe Bryant*   LeBron James* x4   Derrick Rose*   Kevin Durant*   Stephen Curry* x2   Russell Westbrook*   James Harden*    Those are the winners of MVP in the last 20 years. Out of all of those, only 3 (karl malone, kevin garnett, and tim duncan) defense was a significant contribution to their argument. The idea that MVP is not about offensive production is just wrong, when you look at the asterisked seasons."
"From the article:  &gt; Howard Beck recently examined the relationship and rivalry between Dirk and Dwyane Wade. He included this quote from Pat Riley, which was fed through the aggregation machine for a few days: &gt;  &gt; For about a three-year span Wade was, in Riley’s view, “the best player in the world.”  &gt;  &gt; “Dwyane was better than Kobe at that time,” Riley says. “He had a better year by having the impact on winning—in the Finals, in the biggest moments, on the biggest stage.

"&gt;Antetokounmpo does make summer modifications to accommodate for relaxation and family time. Still, when approached about starring in ""Space Jam 2"" with LeBron James, Antetokounmpo declined. Being in the film would have required him to give up two weeks of private workouts to train with his fellow stars while making the movie, a total non-starter, given Antetokounmpo's reclusive tendencies.  Totally missed opportunity on title bro."
I think the pressure is more on Lebron James on surpassing MJ's charisma on the movie. I definitely think that the movie will be great in most aspects than the predecessor

Staring Lebron James   Lebron James   Lebron James   And this guy
"There are more guys Chris Paul's size who've managed to have a long NBA career than guys LeBron's size. I agree with you that LeBron is likely around longer than CP3, but it's not because of height. Recent groin injury aside, James has had a relatively healthy career, whereas Paul is mostly held together with glue and athletic tape these days."
"No, this is LeBron James"
"They have LeBron James, it's very likely LAL will attract at least one top free agent"
"Anthony Davis, James Jones, D Wade, Chris Paul. Those I’m certain of. Maybe Melo.  I thought about KD but I wouldn’t be surprised if he were to refuse to play second fiddle to LeBron in a basketball movie."
I can’t wait for hordes of grown adults who hate lebron James leaving bad reviews of Space jam 2 just so people don’t watch the movie.
"Kyrie was so adamant that he needed out of Cleveland.  -Per ESPN July 2017 The request came last week and was made to Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. Irving has said that he wants to play in a situation where he can be more of a focal point and that he no longer wants to play alongside LeBron James, sources said.  Now he’s considering going back to play with James. Kyrie wanted to be the man.....he got his chance to be the man.....then realized being the man is a hard job. Now he doesn’t want to do it. That makes it the bitch route."
"Yes, he had 1 month (march) in which he posted the same TS% as LeBron James in his entire rookie season while increasing his assists and rebounds. BUST!"
Forgot video game James   After Lebron vs the pistons series
"Follow up if anyone is interested. 117 current NBA players polled, and shocker Jordan on top again. So we have the masses of fans, over 1,000 people that love the game aging from 18-65+, and now even current NBA players. Yet again not even close. So who do you have to ask to get a definitive answer, the fans (DONE), Past NBA Greats (DONE), How about current NBA Players (DONE). Here is the article I found on the most recent NBA players poll.    https://clutchpoints.com/nba-news-players-overwhelmingly-vote-michael-jordan-goat-over-lebron-james-kobe-bryant/"
"I said this in r/bostonceltics (re Pierce's comments), Wade has three playoff appearances without Shaq or Lebron.   * Two first-round exits (2009, 2010) * One second-round exit (2016)  Yes he was better than Pierce, but he isn't better than Harden.   As *the guy* Harden has arguably had more playoff success than Solo-Wade ever did. Harden's only crimes are:  1. Not playing with Shaq or Lebron  2. The Holocaust  &amp;nbsp;  Harden is an MVP and by the end of this season, we could make the argument that he's had the career of a 3-4 time MVP.   He's won one MVP and come second in two historic MVP races (Curry and Westbrook) and realistically he could win the MVP this season as well.   This year, he's put up an offensive season we objectively haven't seen since Jordan's best year and arguably is even better than Jordan's best year (lower ppg but much higher efficiency and assist numbers).  He's beaten a lot of the *unbreakable* records of legends like Kobe and Nate Archibald.   * The first NBA player to both score and assist on 2,000 points in a single season.  * The first player in NBA history to record at least 2,000 points, 900 assists, and 600 rebounds in a single season * One of five players in NBA history to average at least 29 points, 7 assists, 6 rebounds in a single season.  * Includes Oscar Robertson (achieved this seven times), Lebron James (achieved this twice), Michael Jordan, and Russell Westbrook. * The only player in the history of NBA alongside Wilt Chamberlain to score at least 30 points in 20 consecutive games. * He has the 10th highest scoring season of all time * Plus a whole lot I'm sure I'm forgetting. There are so many stats that now have Wilt #1 and then Harden/MJ competing for #2-3  IMO, right now he's challenging Kobe for the #2 spot for all-time SGs and the only way he doesn't beat Wade is if you count Harden as a PG instead.  &gt;Wade's 2005-2006 playoff run surpasses that handily,  If Harden had a 28 / 5 / 5 playoff run he would be labelled a choker.  Hell he had 28 / 5 / 7-8 in the past two years and has been labelled a choker..."
no i don't think that the nba refs are intentionally giving...james fucking harden...an advantage.  the most hated player in the nba continues to get calls even though he's the most scrutinized. much easier to give calls to players everyone likes such as giannis/lebron/etc.

"I doubt if you would have had that Pistons team (Isiah, Rodman etc ) talk about MJ like that...  John Salley played against him and with him and he didn't pick MJ. Parish played against him and with him and [thought MJ wasn't the greatest](http://www.sbnationradio.com/robert-parish-jordan-isnt-greatest-time-didnt-beat-great-teams/) . Horry's point of view was similar to mine. (No single GOAT).   Bill Walton didn't pick MJ (he's named Kareem and said Russell is his favorite, but again [words](https://theundefeated.com/features/bill-walton-wants-to-expand-the-list-of-50-greatest-players-in-nba-history/) around maybe not one greatest)  &gt; “Don’t go down this road of qualitative, binary decision-making  McHale [didn't pick one player.,](https://nesn.com/2019/01/kevin-mchale-unimpressed-with-lebron-james-goat-comments/)  &gt; You can’t compare eras   It's easy to make up stats like 95% when a lot of players simply went about their business.   Like I said, MJ was great, but I think he is helped by a lot of mythmaking, and I don't believe in Highlander style contests, especially across eras..."
&gt;Warriors would switch on him  Ya and get clamped up by Bosh  &gt;2015-2019 Curry and KD  != 2013 LeBron James and Dwyane Wade with 50% knees  &gt;Lol that's enough of that  Ya you right cuz Shane Battier and Mike Miller where throwing 3s into the ocean
&gt; Team defense would cause nightmares for GSW  Warriors defense was almost better than the Heat's  &gt; Chris Bosh would work whoever is playing because Chris Bosh was able to pull bigs out of the paint to open the lane  Warriors would switch on him  &gt; 2013 LeBron James  2015-2019 Curry and KD.  &gt; Warriors got shooters? Hello Shane Battier  Lol that's enough of that
"I'm bias as hell cuz I hate the Warriors but here's what I think:  *  Team defense would cause nightmares for GSW * Chris Bosh would work whoever is playing because Chris Bosh was able to pull bigs out of the paint to open the lane * 2013 LeBron James * Warriors got shooters? Hello Shane Battier, Mike Miller, Ray Allen * Mario Chalmers is a good enough defender to give Curry problems * Dwyane Wade *  Udonis Haslem would disrespect Draymon * Coach Spo is actually a better coach than Kerr"
Draymond Green was gonna get suspended no matter what. He didn’t get suspended because lebron james had to point to the doctor where he touched him. He got suspended because he kept touching everyone’s nuts. ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS NOT TOUCH NUTS. Stop giving dray a pass for being a serial nut puncher.
The Lebron Raymone James Sr. Arena
Lebron James...Overrated..?   These NBA players man
"He led *both teams* in Points, assists, rebounds, blocks, and steals.  The first player **ever** in playoffs history to lead in all 5 major stats in a playoff series, [Source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2016/06/20/lebron-james-becomes-first-player-on-record-to-lead-series-in-points-rebounds-assists-steals-and-blocks/amp/). He should have been FMVP."
&gt; implying lebron james didn't have elite pgs for all of his championships..  [lol ok](https://i.imgur.com/N4z0YKZ.png)
"bruh having lebron james on your team has benefits.  he obviously wont have the longevity of kobe, but if he gets kawhi they will pay him.  he will be overpaid at the end of his career just like cp3 or a million other guys."
You may be a teenager and think being seen around Your parents isn’t cool.  But his Bronny’s father is Lebron James.   Look into Ken Griffey and Ken Griffey Jr.   Imagine how much higher you’ll be drafted if the team that drafts you could potentially get an old Lebron James at Vet Min?  Kareem played to 40. This Lebron will be worth something at 40.
"If he wins even 1 ring in LA, they never let him walk away. They would offer him whatever contract he wants until he retires because he's LeBron James.  LeBron brings too much to a franchise on and off the court to let him walk at any stage in his career."
"Jason Terry landed in Miami. Eliminating everything in his way. Bosh tried to block him, failed. Chalmers and Haslem each charged at him and he knocked them back. Finally, Wade dealt a killing blow by dunking on him, but it was too late, he should've gone for a floater. Jason Terry snapped his fingers, and a charging foul was called.  LeBron, somewhere in Dallas, watched as his accolades faded away and finally the Larry O'Brien trophy turned to him, ""Mr. James...I don't feel so good."" Falling into his arms, the Larry O'Brien trophy slowly disintegrated right before LeBron eyes. For weeks, this haunted him. He wanted to give up, all of the Miami Heat did.  Suddenly, Ray Allen appeared to take LeBron home.  After a few months, the Miami Heat decided they needed to try again. Bosh stated, ""Some people move on, but not us."" They gathered around and devised a plan. They went to the Heat film room and watched all of their key moments as a team and collected all the information needed to set things right.  Jason Terry returned with a much larger army this time around, the Boston Celtics fanbase. He held his own and even outscored Ray Allen, but this time, he was ready to finish it. End the legacy of the Miami Heat franchise.  ""I am... inevitable."" He said.  But from afar, he heard commentators at the scores tables shouting ecstatically ""Wade from behind takes it away.""  LeBron, with his eyes dead set on Terry, ran down the court, ""And I...am...King James.""  The commentators continued, ""Chalmers! Cole! James!!! WHOA!!!""  Jason Terry laid on the court as his army faded away and eventually he accepted his impending demise.  The End."
"[Trump]""Look, having Kahwi— my uncle was a great player and drafter and influencer, LeGm Lebron James at LA Lakers, good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Los Angeles Lakers, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a Laker, if I were a Clipper, if, like, OK, if I signed as a LA Clipper, they would say I’m one of the greatest basketball players anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you’re a Los Angeles Laker they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Cleveland, was a good player, went there, went there, did this, got a ring — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the Kahwi deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these trades are — Kahwi is so powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many offseasons ago, the power and that was 3 championships ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right, who would have thought? — but when you look at what’s going on with the four teams — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the stats; nephews, and it is nephews because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the two points are more than just two points right now, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 playoffs — but the Warriors are great negotiators, Pelicans are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us, this is horrible.”"

"So I was at a restaurant with my family. This restaurant was like any other, it had a few TVs. It was a particularly cold night which was odd for our small town. We were all having a good time, laughing, smiling, and eating good food. When we were eating I was fixated on the the college basketball game on. I’m not a huge fan of college basketball but it was a close game and wanted to see the outcome. It cut to commercial. The infamous Sprite Cranberry commercial. The commercial that haunts me everyday of my life now, forever. It seemed like the normal claymation commercial but when it came to Lebron James’s part of it, he started farther back than usual. Then he whipped out that wretched drink and started running towards the screen. He got so close to the “camera” that it seemed like he would jump out. And he did. The famous 6’8” basketball player rushed out of the screen turning from claymation to a real person. The entire restaurant went quiet. He looked around then he locked eyes with me. Then this giant started sprinting as fast as he could holding a frosty Sprite Cranberry. Lebron decked me to the ground and pinned me down. I couldn’t move because i was in shock and awe. He then tried to forcibly shove a cold soda can full of sprite cranberry inside my mouth. Patrons of the restaurant tried to stop him but no one could stop Lebron. He started tearing the corners of my mouth with the can to fit the entire fan inside my mouth. I tried pushing him off to no avail. Blood was coming out of my mouth and my vision was fading. All i could hear were screams from people and Lebron just repeatedly saying “Want a Sprite Cranberry?” I passed out. I woke up for what I thought a few hours later in the hospital with stitches on the corner of my mouth. My family wasn’t there, and i called in the nurse. They said that they all went home days ago. I was in a coma induced by Lebron James for almost a week now. I text my mom telling that I woke up but it was late so she was asleep. I asked the nurse to turn off the lights and when she did and left, all that was there was just the dim light from the hallway. I try to fall asleep but i can’t the trauma made by Lebron wouldn’t wipe away from my memory. Finally a few hours later I was drifting off when then I saw a figure. I thought it was my dad but I realize the figure was too tall, and he was holding two objects. The figure got closer and i realize this person was holding a soda can and a basketball. He’s back for me."
Basketball is a team sport. No one player makes any team an instant title contender.   See: LeBron James   Kawhi is amazing...but he's still just one man. And you need five men on the floor at a time.

"‘I really want to play with Lebron James and Anthony Davis, with Alex Caruso as the point guard’ crazy how everything can fall into place for Kawhi"
"This week I caught up with San Antonio Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard’s high school coach at King (Riverside, Calif.) Tim Sweeney. Leonard turned in a terrific performance in Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Tuesday night.  Jason Jordan: What’s your best memory of Kawhi on the court?  Tim Sweeney: It’d have to be the Mater Dei game in the CIS title. We had two losses and Mater Dei was 33-0 and considered one of the best teams America had ever seen. Kawhi just played such a phenomenal game; he had about 15 points and more than 20 rebounds. He just dominated the game and he didn’t even need to score all that much to do it. That’s how he is. No one gave us a chance going into that game. They said Mater Dei was gonna steamroll us, but we just took it to them. Kawhi led that charge.  JJ: What kind of guy was he off the court back then?  TS: Just like he is with the Spurs; he’s a very private individual and he’s quiet. When he does speak it’s big. He’s, honestly, one of the hardest workers I’ve ever seen.  JJ: Did you always know he’d be a pro?  TS: When we first got him he was a junior and I looked over at my father, who is a hall of fame high school coach, and told him we’ve got ourselves an NBA All-Star here. Everyone laughed. I felt that from day one because of the intangibles and the things that he does on the court that I couldn’t teach. He just feels and builds a rhythm like no one I’ve ever seen.  RELATED: A Look Back at Kobe Bryant  JJ: What was the craziest story from his recruitment in high school?  TS: That nobody wanted him. He played for Renardo Sidney’s father’s AAU team part of the time and he was showing up Renardo in every game. They ended up getting rid of Kawhi because of that and started badmouthing him to college coaches. UCLA, USC and all the big timers that were recruiting him just dropped off and stopped recruiting him out of nowhere. It was like, “Are you kidding me?”, I ended up later getting apologies from everyone from UCLA to USC to Long Beach State to a bunch of schools behind it. San Diego State and Coach (Steve) Fisher were always true to him and he appreciated that. It ended up being the best place for him. But he wanted to go to UCLA out of high school and they backed off. It was crazy.   JJ: What is something people would be shocked to know about Kawhi?  TS: He’s got two cars: a Chevy Malibu and he’s got a Porsche. He hand washes them and details them himself and he prefers to drive the Malibu over the Porsche. His father, Mark, who was murdered, owned a car wash in Compton and he grew up washing and detailing cars with his father. He takes a lot of pride in it.  RELATED: A Look Back at LeBron James  JJ: Everyone talks about Kawhi being next in line to star for the Spurs; how do you see him filling that role when the time comes?  TS: I think he’ll fit in to that role perfectly. He is very unselfish and he knows that he’s got three hall of famers on his team. He’s done exactly what (Gregg) Popovich has asked him to do. He plays his role, but he’s capable of being a dominant scorer too. As those guys move on and retire you’ll get to see that more.  JJ: How good can Kawhi be?  TS: It’s tough to say hall of fame or anything like that, but I think we’ll know that in the next four years. I do think he’s gonna be an NBA All-Star. He’s a total package player and as the Spurs start giving him more opportunities within the offense to do things he’s gonna flourish."
"When Anthony Davis and lebron James first set eyes upon kawhii,  the Bulls had an All-Star Game and finished off a 3-2-0 run over a six-game road trip. Since that moment, I've become convinced that Kobe isn't a great defensive big, but he still has his own unique strengths and he's a pretty damn good scorer when he gets going. I thought about just putting a kawhii chart with the best defensive players and Kobe in the starting lineup. But for whatever reason, that didn't fly well because people just hated  the idea of Kobe as a defensive big."
LeBron thinks the heat ripped off the vice jerseys from his son’s team lol   https://www.bardown.com/lebron-james-hilariously-wants-to-know-if-the-heat-ripped-off-his-son-s-team-for-their-new-jerseys-1.1204764
"As the defense scrambled into confusion, middleton inbounds to bledsoe. giannis is kept in check by lebron on the weak side. With the lopez switch, the lane is left wide open. bledsoe crossesover whoever the hell the lakers got at point, drives through the laaaaaannneee annnnnnddd misses the freaking point blank lay-up. Game goes to OT. lakers already figured out lopez switch. #6 james goes to work. Game over! Then OP wakes up sweatin’ coz he put too much money on the bucks. Neither team made the playoffs that year."
"Houston during the regular season? Doubtful. We'll see come playoff time - the whole point of the moves we made was to eliminate the way Houston destroyed us the last two years.  Portland is going to be interesting. I don't think they're nearly as good with Whiteside instead of Nurkic.  The Lakers, absolutely not, unless they get Kawhi. I've watched Gobert make AD quit too many times head to head to have much respect for him (not to mention his inability to stay healthy across a whole season), LeBron is older, and they've missed out on a decent chunk of good supporting cast. If they get Kawhi, yes, absolutely.  I'm a Denver hater - they're going to have targets on their back this year. They had a hot start last year and still were one missed James Harden FT and some other crazy things happening from losing the 2 seed - plus Gobert owns Jokic head to head as well, he quits just like AD does."
The king of New York is about to meet LeBron James
I’m not trading LeBron fucking James
"Predicting multiple MVPs for somebody who doesn’t already have one, or isn’t in some 07 LeBron James type of scenario, is pretty wild.  One is more understandable but multiple is *really* hard, consider how good Steve Nash was and figure that he’s by far the worst player in the last 40-something years to win more than one."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
LeBron James debuts new signature hairline.
Lebron James *is* a Millennial (and I bet he would never agree to that label)
Jimmy Butler and Al Horford are not LeBron James. Do you understand the difference there?
"&gt;  So you're saying your expectation is that a player should choose mot to play for a team that he wants to play for because they already have good players?  Why do you have a problem with what KD did then?   &gt; I feel like you saying you don't see a difference in players joining up and one player hopping onto a championship team that doesn't need him is a clear sign you are not arguing in good faith  No I recognize that there's no difference, because the end result is the same. What did LeBron James join up to do in Miami? Win championships? Why did KD join Golden State? Win championships. Why is Kawhi potentially joining the Lakers? Win easy championships.  It's just that simple. There doesn't need to be any added context, the situation of the team before the decision is irrelevant, it doesn't matter that the Heat were a 45 win team in 2010, the Warriors were a 73 win team in 2016, or the Lakers were a 35 win team this year.   All 3 players looked at the landscape of the league when they were in their prime ages as free agents, and said this is how I can be the face of the NBA by winning easy championships."
"Cap space matters for the ""how badly do I want him?"" question. Cap space is not preventing you from signing a guy you want really badly though.   Simple thought experiment: is there any team in the league that wouldn't be able to sign LeBron James due to cap considerations?"
"[Woj] Lakers are now hard capped, league sources tell ESPN. CBA rules dictate they must waive LeBron James, who I'm told, is very intrigued by the possibility of joining the Los Angeles Clippers."
No I haven't.  If LeBron James becomes a free agent tomorrow every team in the league with an interest in signing him can either create the space to sign him outright or swing a sign and trade.
"Yeah, but Lebron James is Lebron James.  Zion could be anything, he could even be Lebron James!"
Yeah but everyone was saying that when we literally HAD Lebron James. Not “a player with Lebron James potential.” Literally Lebron James.
Yeah that happens when you add the most hyped prospect since LeBron James
LeBron James winning in Cleveland is proof that you can have shitty ownership and still win
They have and found nothing.   Source: https://www.si.com/nba/2017/07/31/lebron-james-klutch-sports-group-ownership-investigation
"LeBron is tenth in all time assists. He has a career 36% assist percentage, meaning he creates a third of the buckets his teammates get on top of the 27ppg that he's avg'd. Don't be absurd because you overreached in an argument. LeBron is an all time ""elevates his teammates"" player.  Kawhi is a better defender than prime LeBron by a hair. 2013 LeBron was arguably a DPOY - Marc Gasol was not  a better individual defender than LeBron James in 2013."

The Lebron James Experience Featuring The Danny Green Express Train ofcourse
"In a world where Lebron James, Anthony Davis, and Kawhi Leonard are planning to come together for multiple years on the 2nd most storied franchise in NBA history, how on earth are we the evil??"
"Imagine how it goes down if the Sonics stay in Seattle? A super team of KD/Westbrook/Harden is just starting to slow down and the Supersonics are valued at 3.5 billion dollars. The NBA is in shambles as Lebron James joins a feisty Golden State team that has given Seattle problems for years, but continually falls short."
He did one when he opened his school. https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24194051/lebron-james-discusses-opening-public-school-akron-move-los-angeles-lakers-nba
it felt that way at times but I would disagree.  Playing james jones significant minutes  and inserting mike miller at times is just a joke.  they played quite a bit better defense however.  mozgov got exploited later but provided some scoring value in the finals and tristan was a lot better in 15.    I think one thing i might be emphasizing too much is lebron was definitely better in 18 than 15 so that just makes the roster look worse to me.
"There’s also an outside chance that he grows 8” and metamorphoses into a literal 25 year old Lebron James. Of course the critics aren’t bringing that up. Of course there’s also a chance that the earth is hit by a meteor and we don’t even have a 2019-20 nba season. As they say, anything is possible."
LeBron motherfucking James
"To be fair, KD thought all he needed to do was to have championships and finals MVP to his resume and he'd no longer be 2nd best. His entire life he's always been number 2. He was the 2nd best kid in HS, he was drafted 2nd, he was 2nd best to LeBron, so I'm sure he just felt if he won some rings, he'd finally be number 1. He was the best player on those warriors teams. I still believe if Irving and Love where healthy the Warriors don't win that first ring. And If KD doesn't go to the warriors, the Cavs win another one.      But KD is going to a franchise that has been in the basement for almost it's entire existence. They have good ownership, good front office. Their coach is a good, not great coach. So KD if thinking he'll finally be number 1 on a really good team that wasn't given everything. So I can see why he made the move. He just has to hope that Irving is ok with being number 2. Irving had no problem with it with James when they where winning, I'd be interested to see if they aren't winning, what happens between them."
"Tell me how I missed your point. You’re saying basically that his output may disappoint people, but it’s not because he’s not maximizing his talent, it’s because he doesn’t have talent. But you’re associating him not having talent with not knowing where to be, bad basketball iq, or saying that he plays at a different pace, etc.  But you can learn where to be by studying film. You wouldn’t go from Dud to LeBron James but you can get a lot better.  And he doesn’t just play at a different pace, others have shared clips of him just standing in the corner, either not knowing what to do or not asserting himself.   This is pure laziness. Either laziness to learn what to do, or laziness/passiveness to not care enough to assert his will on the game.  He has played 5 seasons now. 400 games. Over 14,000 minutes. If he cared he would know where to stand and what to do by now.  Face it. He doesn’t care."
"They definitely are. All three are significantly better than either Klay, or Bosh. Even when you consider it a wash on LBJ prime, Wade, Steph, and Durant - that third piece is still the best third option you've ever had. You're talking about a team that legitimately could be using Anthony Davis, or Kawhi Leonard, or Lebron James as a third scoring option, not to mention one of the best paint defenders in the league mixed with the best perimeter defender in the league. It's an absolutely absurd starting lineup."
"I don't even get it... if Simmons had a jumper, he'd be LeBron James or Giannas. Instead he's just an all star, elite defender, elite play maker, one of the most versatile players in the league, and the primary ball handler on a team that was just a contender this past year.  After playing 2 years in the league.  Should totally expect more from him!"
LeBron James started playing at age 9.
"Lmao, Marcus was head and shoulders over Bron’s kid and he was never a prospect. Bron’s child isn’t playing in the NBA. He’s not good enough and is not even considered a prospect. Lebron James success is predicated on sheer power and speed and because he relies on his disproportionate physical talents, he never developed the skill set that players like Kobe or MJ or KD or even curry or Kyrie have. He’s not a phenomenal ball handler, has a pedestrian shot, and cannot work the block like Kobe or MJ because of his mediocre footwork. This means that unless his son grows into a body like his father’s, Lebron hasn’t probably been teaching his son a skill set that can circumvent his physical weaknesses and get him to the NBA. I’d put more money on Mambacita having better footwork, ball handling, and shooting than Lebron’s kid when she comes of age."
Every championship on a resume isn't created equally. Kawhi's and Dirks are significantly more impressive than any championship Kevin Durant or Lebron James won.
"Career stats: 13,456 points, 5,631 rebounds, 4,821 assists, 1,663 steals and 552 blocks.   Seven other players in history can lay claim to those five-category totals in their careers: Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Karl Malone, Kevin Garnett, Scottie Pippen and Clyde Drexler.  Of those seven players, only Jordan, Bryant and James match Iguodala's awards haul of an Olympic gold medal, three championship rings, a Finals MVP and an All-Defensive selection.  Short answer, YES."
"Also, If Lebron had Bronny when he was like 8, and the King were a free agent, the same year Bronny were eligible, let’s say King Bron is 26/27, do you think that a team would draft Bronny 1 to also get King James?"
That and also because the possibility of finals MVP Kawhi Leonard teaming up with Lebron James and Anthony Davis is very much real
"You think over a course of 82 games a team led by Marc Gasol, Kyle Lowry, &amp; Pascal Siakam would be better than one led by Lebron James, Anthony Davis, &amp; Kyle Kuzma? I know FVV, Ibaka, &amp; Powell are solid, but Caruso, Troy Daniels, &amp; JaVale McGee aren't shitty enough to bridge the gap."
Lebron James never won an NBA title without at least 3 All Star level players on his team.
Lebron James. He makes an entire team better than they are. Kahwi doesn't pass and AD can't even get to the playoffs even with elite talent like Holiday and Beasley
Giving $109M to a 33 year old dude who isn't LeBron James isn't a good move. Horford's minutes were already down and the 76ers still have no bench.
LEBRON JAMES LEAVING THE EAST IS THE SOLE REASON WHY THE RAPTORS WENT TO THE FINALS.
"""LeBron James is coming home to Cleveland, so tell us what you know""  ""LeBron is going back to Cleveland""  He got all the scoops 🔥🔥🔥🔥"
"&gt; Lebron James is still the best player in the World.  I know who you are, and I know you don't think this"
"Lebrong James. Cousin to famous the famous Lebron James. Drafted number one overall by Cleveland in 2003, but was body swapped like The Man in the Iron Mask after his uncles decided Lebrong was too snarky."
"lebron james, kawhi leonard"
"He said he **CALCULATED** it, why are you questioning him? Surely Lebron James in 2017 had the best season with less team success, points, assist, WS, WS/48, VORP on same efficiency as James Harden is the better player."
oh shit are you telling us that Lebron James is in fact better than Ray Allen?  Big news if true.  KD was also apparently not on a superteam because he was the best player on the team.
All-Time Greatest Laker - LeBron James.
"I like that, Brogdon and Seth Curry. They may still would have had enough left over (with the MLE as well) for the likes of two of Ed Davis, Ish Smith, DeMarre Carroll, Garrett Temple, Enes Kanter, etc.  Imagine  * PG - Seth Curry  * SG - Malcolm Brogdon  * SF - Lebron James, DeMarre Carroll   * PF - Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma  * C - Ed Davis  I mean that's a respectable top 7 right? Obviously injuries and such are variables, but that's a probable playoff team and once you can get Davis and Lebron playing 40 minutes a game in the playoffs they could definitely be in contention."
They do. It’s still LeBron James rocketing a pass at your nads. Only so much can be done.
Yeah I'd don't see how playing basketball with LeBron James for the world's largest fanbase could be exciting.
Ahh we all remember the next “LeBron James”
Man the remaining PG pool is pretty dire. I've gone with Arcidiacono because I'm struggling to find a better 3 point shooter. I think Justin Holiday is an underrated 3-and-D guy. I think Javale McGee is one of the most underrated FAs. He balled out last year.   ROTATION | PG | SG | SF | PF | C ---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------- STARTERS | Ryan Arcidiacono | Justin Holiday | Marcus Morris | Lebron James | Anthony Davis SECOND | Tyus Jones | Kentavious Caldwell-Pope | Kyle Kuzma | JaMychal Green | Javale McGee THIRD | Alex Caruso | Zach Norvell Jr. | Iman Shumpert | Markieff Morris | Ivica Zubac
Ok...who is LeBron James AKA the best player in the league at the time equivalent in your equation?  Derek Fisher?
I'm not really trying to argue lol. Just want to point out the interesting fact that the Lakers didn't make the playoffs while having a LeBron James that just came off averaging 34 a game the playoffs before.
Not a sweep. But wanna know what's even more interesting ? Imagine having LeBron James and not making the playoffs. That's extremely interesting
LeBron had an ordinary season? KD isn’t a shooter? James Harden isn’t a shooter? Paul George can’t shoot?
“I dont flop”. Also lebron james
No they aren't. Good luck with Tobias Harris on LeBron James.
I'm seeing a trend here of comparing good players to LeBron James
"I don't understand the point of this post. You think that Lebron James would be like Lonzo if he lost some inches and mass? Even if he lost that level of physique, you're talking about one of the smartest and most skilled basketball players that has ever played the game."
"Yeah everyone in Minnesota said he cared when he was here, and everyone in Philly said the same thing. I’m repeating myself over and over here.   It’s not an accomplishment, I was simply correcting you because you were wrong. You’ve been wrong quite a bit this thread.   Oh right, because your FO and ownership did such a good job drafting a developing Lebron James lol.   I said we have a better team than the Heat, and the Heat are not contenders. Which is true. If you want to switch it up and talk about some arbitrary timeline in which you think Miami will contend, feel free lol."
TIL that LeBron James is delusional.
"Before he signed with GS you doof. It was all over the sub lol.   We have a better team than the Heat. Current players don’t matter? The squad you have now is essentially the squad you’ll play this season with. And that squad is not a contender, at all. That doesn’t seem like a debate. Again, nobody is talking about what you did 7 or 8 years ago when you had Lebron James...except maybe you.   Our new management is the same GM that turned the Rockets org around. You don’t seem to know much about what’s happening around the league. I’d say we’re in a decent spot. You just maxed a guy who doesn’t care about your team or winning apparently lol. I’d say you’re in a worse spot."
A potential team would look like:  &amp;#x200B;  Rondo/ Caruso  KCP/ Troy Daniels/ Vince Carter  Lebron/ James Ennis  Kuzma/ Jamychal Green  AD/ Mcgee/ Chandler
"Oh yeah, Lebron James, the constantly injured player who has missed more than 15 games in a season ONCE in his entire career."

"In addition to Bobby Knight calling him the GOAT before the NBA I also forgot to add...  Larry Bird called him the best player he’d ever seen in 1985 during his rookie year. This was over a year before the 63 point game.  So, he hadn’t been crowned by the media yet, but two of the best basketball minds ever called him the GOAT before he’d even finished his rookie year...  To put things in perspective, It’d be Lebron James calling some rookie at all-star break this year a Better player than him and the best player he’d ever seen this year"
“I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me... but I can't help it that I'm so popular.”- Lebron James 2019 after Kawhi signs with the Lakers

"Damn, looks like another Lebron James Jones kind of rel. lol"
"Pg did not have a top 3 offensive season. Hanes Harden Stephen Curry, LeBron James and Giannis at the very least all had better offensive seasons and then I would also say jokic. Pg is not even the concern. It’s all Rusty. Rusty is so detrimental to winning basketball. Not even Michael Jordan could win with Russ"
"Lakers if Kawhi signs with Toronto. They'll get desperate and throw some okay money at the last remaining free agents not at the minimum.  Fuck it, Cousins worked with AD before and I think they can do it again.  PG - Lebron James, SG - Troy Daniels, SF - Kyle Kuzma, PF - Anthony Davis, C - Demarcus Cousins  Bench: G- KCP, G- Iman Shumpert, G- Andre Igoudala, G- Jamal Crawford, G- Rajon Rondo, F- Jared Dudley, F- Jeff Green, F/C- Kenneth Faried, F/C- Pau Gasol."
"Infinity less than the Knicks' existence. That's a dumpster that can't even catch fire. The Garden has been a trough of wilted flowers, with nothing near a Wilt. LeBron has AD, the Knicks have ownership ED. Spike Lee about to change his name to Flat Lee. Brooklyn is gonna use games at the Garden as practice scrimmages, and their best player gonna be out anyways. The Knicks should change their name to just ""New York"" because mascots shouldn't degrade themselves to representing that franchise. The Knicks front office is like Jordan in baseball, why is this even a thing? Chris Broussard is reporting that the Knicks will be good this season, possible contender to come out of the East for the Finals. James Dolan could become the most talented Knick in the next 2-3 years, and he's in decline (like a mother fucker), and was never talented at anything in the first place. Former Knicks players who have long since passed have chosen to come out of retirement due to their lifeless corpses making the team better. Stephen A. Smith is on suicide watch. Because he has spent so much time watching the Knicks commit suicide. The City of New York has reportedly cut ties with the Knickerbocker organization due to concerns about being represented by a ""team unworthy of being a G-League bottomfeeder."" Donald  Trump has announced that the New York Knicks are the best, most intelligent, best walls you've ever seen. In a recent poll asking who was more rational and intelligent between the New York Knicks, the current White House regime, and ISIS, every participant committed suicide rather than answer."

Yo Gotti - LeBron James
LeBron James lion king in SHAMBLES
Literally not going to mention the song titled “Lebron James”
[Feasting on this content like](https://giphy.com/gifs/eating-lebron-james-doughnut-13x0OguvAGp2k8)
"They need to steal Lebron James, AD, Giannis, curry, Klay, Kawhi, kd, kyrie, and Paul George. If they have all the all stars they can't lose. /s"
"Coulda gone with ""I got eses on Beaumont, posted like Cousins"" on Pest Control by The Game. And ""rap's LeBron, Teflon Don"" on If You So Gangsta by Lloyd Banks. Or ""shootin these n***** lights out, like LeBron James"" by Young Buck on Gangsta Shit. But instead, you stanned Kanye."
"Shaq and Dwight play nowhere near the same. Howard has/has zero post game. He got his buckets by just running the floor and playing hard and being athletic.  Zion has nowhere near the feel for the game as LeBron James. Lbj is like 3 inches taller, One of the best passers ever, can shoot, drive, play the pick and roll he’s a main ball handler. Zion is not a main ball handler. You can’t give him the ball and just say alright get us a bucket. He is a decent passer but it gets a little overblown. Trae is a better passer than curry and can’t shoot as well."
Lebron James (39)
"well Delonte West himself seems like he confirmed it.  &gt; “I named my son Cash after Cashius Clay and Johnny Cash…His middle name is Delonete but I didn’t want to name him Delonte West Jr. just because of that… I don’t want my son going to school and people making fun of him **for something his daddy did,** “Oh didn’t yo daddy have sex with LeBron James mama?’ Man, I don’t want to deal with all that . . . “"
Whenever people come up with the Lonzo Ball injury excuse thing it makes me crack up.  You're expecting me to believe that LeBron James needs Lonzo fucking Ball to make the playoffs? Just fucking lol

Lebron James Jr.
"Take notes, [this](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/boxing-closeup-of-cleveland-cavaliers-forward-lebron-james-and-wife-picture-id840281250) will be on the exam!"
"It is literally impossible for LeBron James to be the Toronto Raptors' long lost father.  LeBron was born in 1984 and the Raptors were born in 1995, meaning LeBron is only 11 years older than the Raptors. Wtf."
No.. I am LeBron James
"This was my least favorite Timberwolves game in recent memory.   Thibs wanted Butler to iso against LeBron fucking James, and he did it repeatedly.  Jimmy took 8 of our last 10 shots. He went 3/8.   Either Thibs couldn't plan something better than ISOing against the best player this generation 8 out of 10 times, or Butler was too stubborn to acknowledge LeBron is a tough matchup.  Jimmy missed more shots in overtime than KAT missed the entire game."
"This is dope! Also this is a bit off since it doesn't exactly fall under ""referenced in a song"" but Buckethead has, I think, two  songs named after Lebron (Lebrontron and King James, King James is really good) and one after MJ called Jordan. Looking forward to the GSW one!"
"[People view the triple-double as a useless statistic since, they argue, it's just a random benchmark. The thing is: they're right. How different is a 20/10/10 season from a 20/9.5/9.5 season? Not very, it's just 41 rebounds/assists over an 82 game season.  So I think the best way to look at Westbrook's statistical achievements is to lower the bar by about 20% and see how many other players have managed to leap over it. If it's a lot of players, then it's arguable that Westbrook is being overrated because ""triple-double"" sounds good. If he stands mostly alone, then he's rightly viewed as one of the most impressive players ever.  How many players have had 20/10/10 seasons? 2 players \(Robertson, Westbrook\) and 3 seasons between them.  Let's reduce rebs/assists by 10%. How many players have had 20/9/9 seasons? Still only 2 players, but now it's 6 total seasons \(4 for Robertson\). Wow, so far Westbrook's achievements are holding up.  How about 20/8/8 \(20% reduction\)? Now the list starts to expand. We get 6 players total and 12 seasons. Joining Westbrook and Robertson are: Michael Jordan \(1 season\), Wilt Chamberlain \(1 season\), James Harden \(1 season\), and LeBron James \(2 seasons\). Magic Johnson has two seasons which almost qualify, one 20/8/8 season where he only played 37 games and a second season where he played 77 but was 9 rebounds short on averaging 8 for the season. Bad luck, Magic.  Let's do one more: 15/8/8. Even by dropping the points requirement by a full 25% we only add a single player and season: Ben Simmons' rookie year. **EDIT:** I forgot to mention that Magic Johnson's '81-'82 season also qualifies here.  So, to conclude, even by dropping the statistical requirements by 20% \(and 25% for points\) we see that only 6 other players have managed to achieve anything close to what Westbrook is doing and 5/6 are all-time greats while the 6th is a 6'10"" PG whose career is just getting started. Basically, averaging a season of 20/8/8 is one of the hardest things to do in basketball and any player who manages it \(or even gets close\) is probably a generational talent.  tl;dr Westbrook is pretty fucking great.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/aogllr/russell_westbrook_got_his_8th_straight_triple/eg1597o/)"
"I believe players have a vote on the overall deal or something, but they aren't voting on individual provisions. That would entirely defeat the purpose of having representatives.   Extending the age limit benefitted exactly two players at the time; Chris Paul and LeBron James. It just so happens that one is the NBPA President and the other is NBPA VP."
"Anderson .Paak also has a song called King James, it's pretty much an ode to how Lebron uses his platform to help change communities around him."
"&gt;If you’re using primes how can you say LeBron James is getting cooked at the perimeter lol  because i watch basketball...  &gt;You said pre switch to hide Curry but on who?   holy shit. that's not how pre-switching works. you use it to keep a defender **off** the ball, if only to waste time on the shot-clock, not to get him **on** to a guy.  &gt;Every single player is substantially bigger and can play in the post.  it would be an absolute win, defensively, if team 1 could get team 2 to settle for post up shot attempts and isolation.   &gt; Those guys are unstoppable for sure but don’t pretend like Magic, Kobe, Bron, Duncan, Hakeem are any less unstoppable.   magic is the weakest scorer on the court here. kobe, bron, and duncan are all worse or equal to their matchups,  and not even hakeem will be stopping shaq.  &gt;And that’s the better defensive team.  yes, team 2 is composed of better overall defenders, but it's offense is significantly worse because it has no spacing, therefore, team 2 is significantly easier to defend."
"there are certain accomplishments Manu has that Brady won't be able to approach - for example there's no Olympic Dream team of only American Football players to beat with a group of football players from Brady's home state. That 2004 Gold Medal is a pretty major accomplishment. It is too bad that that gold is tarnished by the fact that the US team was poorly constructed with scrubs like Tim Duncan, Lebron James and Dwyane Wade."
"Seeing how this sub and the media responded to this deal, it’s clear that no one watches the Pelicans. This dude is easily top 5 and talent wise is top 3 in the league. He’s 26, the best big in the game by far, and is about to run pick and roll with Lebron fucking James. Holy fuck"
"**Tier One:**  Michael Jordan  LeBron James  **Tier Two:**  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Magic Johnson  Larry Bird  **Tier Three:**  Shaquille O’Neal  Bill Russell  Wilt Chamberlain  Tim Duncan   Hakeem Olajuwon  Kobe Bryant  **Tier Four:**  Dirk Nowitzki   Moses Malone  Julius Erving   Kevin Durant  Steph Curry, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Kevin Garnett, Karl Malone in some order next  Charles Barkley, Dwyane Wade, Isiah Thomas, David Robinson, James Harden in some order after that  Most controversial is probably the Sixers guys. Moses is a bit forgotten I think because he moved around quite a bit so he doesn’t really have that one dedicated fan base that will argue for him. Dr J. probably shouldn’t be on this list anymore (as time has moved on and more guys would knock him down) if it is strictly top 15 NBA and while I’m not completely counting the ABA career, it’s not nothing to me either."
If there are no cap limitations:  PG: Mike Conley  SG: Devin Booker  SF: Luka Doncic  PF: LeBron James  C: Rudy Gobert
That's only true because Miami is one of four destinations that always gets looks from big name free agents.  The other franchises value picks because that's the only way they'll get an MVP level player.  Not every market can just sign a Lebron James in his prime or a KD in his prime or a Kawhi Leonard in his prime.
"Fun fact. In 2018 if the NBA made a rule that all players named Lebron James are required to start the game by air balling a three point shot, Lebron still had less FGA, more FGM, better FG%, better 3p% and better TS% than Westbrook"
"&gt;  If LeBron James can’t get you to fuck off then nobody else can.  I think guys like Lillard, Duncan and maybe Curry are better culture setters than him... especially if you consider how unsettling all the media circus surrounding Lebron must be.  There's also people being complex and responding better to some leadership/mentoring types than others. Some like to play the asshole general type and that goes well with overcompetitive guys but falls short with guy that have self confidence issues, for example.  JR was a party boy that found the best situation for him in Cleveland where, according to his own words, there's not much party to be found compare to New York.   Maybe Milwakee helps him again if he doesn't start chucking beers"
How could a player even come close to possibly change somebody fundamentally? Just because you’re around someone who’s a decent enough guy doesn’t mean you automatically become a good person. If LeBron James can’t get you to fuck off then nobody else can.
Players that have both an NBA Championship and an Olympic Gold Medal:  - Michael Jordan  - Scottie Pippen  - Magic Johnson  - Clyde Drexler  - Shaquille O'Neal  - David Robinson  - Larry Bird  - Kevin Garnett  - Ray Allen  - Gary Payton  - Jason Kidd  - Kobe Bryant  - LeBron James  - Kevin Durant  - Manu Ginobili  - Klay Thompson  - Harrison Barnes  - Draymond Green  - Alonzo Mourning  - Spencer Haywood  - Bill Bradley  - Jerry Lucas  - Oscar Robertson  - Jerry West  - K.

Thought John wall was gonna usurp Lebron James as best player coming into the league
President LeBron James.
"Yeah. So I'll come out and say it, I'm LeBron James. AMA"
LeBron James is a good basketball player.
The dude was literally as fast as Lebron James and could jump higher then MJ... at 7 feet tall.  Think about that for a second people.
"This is why the Lakers should be the favorites. Sure, everyone has elite Guards and wings now, but only the Lakers have 2 All Star Level big men *and* LeBron James. Nobody is going to stop them except the injury god"

"eh, not a heat fan, and I enjoyed it.  I actually found myself rooting for LeBron after the hate he got from the finals loss. Especially when I read a Chicago based minor league team has a 'Lebron James ceremony' where they won a championship, but no rings were being given.  Freaking baseball man. talk about transcendent and unnecessary hate."
LeBron James averaged 22 points on 43% TS% vs the Spurs in the 2007 NBA finals  He turned out ok

"Imagine thinking in 2019 that we would be arguing over the relative merits of Lebron James versus Donald Trump for President of the United States of America, and its not even a crazy conversation. Good god what have we done?"
Bro it is LeBron James. That is all the guarantee you need.
"&gt;I’m just saying not to blindly follow the dude  You only said that in a reply, but not the initial comment. Your initial comment was implying not to listen to him at all because of his GPA 16 years ago and because he’s a basketball player.   And not a single person, including LeBron, says to *blindly* follow him on politics. No one is saying that. And his “more than an athlete” is directed at athletes. You think an athlete could relate to LeBron James’ views on being an athlete? I’d think so."
"To me the question is this; if Lebron James starts talking about politics is he using drowning out people who are more qualified to talk about politics or is he encouraging more people to get involved and take a serious interest in politics?   When he called the president a bum on Twitter he got a lot of attention and a lot of news sources spent time talking about that in a way that didn’t add value rather Han covering more substantive news. But you never know what the upside is, if he gets more people interested that’s a good thing, even if I don’t think his opinion is that insightful."
"I don’t follow the ideology because lebron james says it. I follow the ideology because it’s what actually happens in real life. Just because you don’t live it, doesn’t mean it can’t/doesn’t happen in every day life. If you want to make stupid remarks on a reddit to justify yourself you can, but it really does nothing for you in the end."
"This will probably get me hate but;  &amp;#x200B;  2005-06: Steve Nash (Winner) : 18.8/4.2/10.5 0.583 eFG%  LeBron James: 31.4/7.0/6.6 0.515 eFG%  (Also averaged more steals and blocks)  &amp;#x200B;  2006-07: Dirk Nowitzki (Winner): 24.6/8.9/3.4 0.529 eFG%  LeBron James: 27.3/6.7/6.0 0.518 eFG% (Averaged more steals and just 0.1 less blocks a game)  &amp;#x200B;  2007-08: Kobe Bryant (Winner) 28.3/6.3/5.4   0.503 eFG%   LeBron James: 30.0/7.9/7.2 0.518 eFG% (Averaged the same amount of steals and more blocks)#  &amp;#x200B;  While Steve, Kobe and Dirk were 100% deserving of their awards, one look at the Cleveland roster LeBron was playing on and you realize just how 'valuable' he was to them. No one player was more essential or 'valuable' to their team than LeBron was during these 3 seasons. No way were that Cleveland team making the playoffs each of these 3 years without Bron."
"&gt; If Shaq was 6'3"" and had the same exact skills, he would not be in the NBA  Shaq developed his post-game moves because of his height and weight. He would have certainly developed a different skill-set if he was 6'3""... just like AD who started as a point guard then as he grew taller and teller developed post-skills, if a Steph or Kemba were taller they would also develop different skill-sets to play the game.  &gt; As for the other players you mentioned, I never said all of them weren't skilled, just the big men  Ah ok, I quoted what you said, ""a lot of the best players"" but you probably meant just big men. I responded in another post with a clip only about the best big men.  &gt; Also a lot if those players were actually nothing special as far as their skillset, they were just super athletic.  In another post you defined ""skillset"" as ""high-dexterity""... ball-handling and shooting. For the most part of the 90s Reggie Miller shot over 40% from 3-point, Jordan was driving through defenders and scoring on double or even triple teams, Grant Hill was considered the first LeBron James as he could do everything on the court and was I think the first best Point-Forward, Barkley was an undersized power forward who averaged double-doubles his entire career save for his rookie year, Penny Hardaway was the modern-day Magic Johnson in terms of running the break and passing the ball and was a tall-point guard who could handle the ball... Yes, they were all physically athletic but they also had tremendous skill."
"If Keven Durant was 6'3"" he wouldn't be in the NBA either. If LeBron James was 6'3"" he wouldn't be in the NBA. If Ben Simmons was 6'3"" he wouldn't be in the NBA.  If Kawhi Leonard was 6'3"" he wouldn't be in the NBA.  If Giannis was 6'3"" he wouldn't be in the NBA."
"You have no idea what you’re talking about, please refrain from speaking on Wilt again. Most of the shit he did was recorded in one way or another. He ran a 100 yard dash in 4.6 seconds, that’s as fast as Lebron James, want . Benched 500 in his prime, 465 at the age of 50. Upwards of a 40 inch vert. It’s unfair to compare modern players to Wilt, its an insult to him."
LeBron James.
"I'm not going to rank KD, but I'd have him as the best player in the nba right now if he wasn't injured.   James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo   Steph Curry  Lebron James  Anthony Davis  Kawhi is at 6th for me. I know its unpopular to think AD is better than him and Im fully willing to change my opinion if Kawhi comes out better than AD next year."
"It’s a team sport but this is an individual ranking, at some point the individual has to do something extraordinary. I think you’re underselling what Kawhi did with Raptors and what KD with Warriors.   I know what you mean with being in the right situation to win it all but you can still show you’re #1 in the playoffs. James Harden was good but never did anything to leap him ahead of the others. KD and Kawhi did at different points of the playoffs last season and both have multiple finals MVPs, they have the credentials and pass the eye test.  I don’t think James Harden is so much better than everyone else in the regular season that it bypasses the post season.   I’m not knocking Harden by saying he’s not the best, he’s top 4 imo and 3rd with KD out. Lebron, Kawhi, Harden, Curry, Giannis."
Everyone in the NBA is taking growth hormones.  I'm not paying $300 get some shit seats at the Colleseum to see LeBron James sit on the bench.
"so let’s make this clear, you know more about guarding Carmelo Anthony than Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Paul Pierce And Kobe Bryant? That literally what you are saying. Delusional."
yes because you know so much more about basketball about Lebron James and Kobe Bryant   ... are you reading what you are typing or just trolling?
Playing with LeBron James lmfao
"Yeah I do, in reply to your first comment the sole reason Kyrie won a chip and Kemba didnt is one Lebron James. Simple stuff."
Kobe Bryant: “Melo was the hardest player to guard” u/samueladams6: “but look at the stats!!!!”  Paul Pierce: “Melo was the hardest player to guard” u/samueladams6: “but look at the stats!!!!”  Kevin Durant: “Melo was the hardest player to guard” u/samueladams6: “but look at the stats!!!!”  Lebron James: “Melo was the hardest player to guard” u/samueladams6: “but look at the stats!!!!”  &gt; I don’t care about the subjective opinions of players   hahahaha yeah what would they know? you going through bref must mean you know so much more than *the players who actually had to guard him*
LeBron James might beat Jiren

"waiting for those ""fuck steph curry"" ""fuck lebron james"" reference"
If all it took was steroids to be LeBron James then there wouldn't be a LeBron James.
Whenever I hear “LeBron went to LA to chase Michael B Jordan and not Michael Jeffrey Jordan” I hear Shannon Sharpe saying “OH DONT DO THAT SKIUP TO OL GOAT JAMES” lmao
Lebron James Harden
"By this logic, Derrick Rose was better than LeBron James in 2011"
"the projection this laker flair is using put green 20th in the league last year and eric bledsoe at 19, and lowry at 18  also ahead of them are nurkic (#10) and brook fucking lopez one spot behind lebron james at 13  the more you know"
My Grandma currently has Alzheimer's doesnt speak English so i speak in broken arabic to her. Also since Im a guy my mom won't let me care for her but usually if she needs something done I'll ask and do it. On the funny side I once convinced my Grandma I was Lebron James.
"I don’t really see the Lakers having any problems outside Philly. I just think the front court of AD/Boogie overmatches anything else in the league, and they’ve still got LeBron James on the floor. I just don’t know how you walk on the floor already beat at the 4 and the 5, and then try to guard LeBron James.   I just feel like the Lakers walk down the court with a 60% chance of scoring already in their pocket. Either someone’s gonna get overmatched, or someone’s gonna be wide open, and that’s without trying to create mismatches or favorable switches. That offense can just bulldoze everybody"
"I still remember there was a guy who did a ""facts about Lebron James"" post every in story."
"If LeBron James owns a team and they're even average, he'll be the greatest basketball person of all time and it wont be close.  MJ needs to learn how to delegate."
Not that he would be better. It’s a mentality thing. If Melo went out there embracing a sixth man role he’d find a team. If his mentality was “I want to be the best 6th man in the league” he’d find a team.   But his mentality is “I want to be Lebron James.”
"I think he's actually going to look better than last season. This was the first time in awhile he's had a long break during the summer... he's been playing into June for 8 years, but this year his season ended in March. Those 3 extra months off will make a massive difference. He also has something new to prove after the Lakers traded the farm for AD.  It wouldn't surprise me if the Lakers disappoint a bit (I'm very skeptical of their roster after James, AD, and Green), but I think LeBron himself is primed for a big year."
"I respect you, but I think you are greatly misguided in your views on endorsements.  [Here's a Forbes article back from 2015 stating Nike sold $340 million worth of Lebron James' shoes alone in 2014, which is 13% higher than the previous year, meaning $300 million sold of Lebron's shoes in 2013.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/03/18/lebron-james-is-nbas-top-shoe-salesman-with-340-million-for-nike-in-2014/#4aadda7c4e56)  &amp;#x200B;  The year is now 2019. Nike may have paid Lebron a billion for a lifetime deal, but they have made at least 30x that on Lebron since he's been in the NBA. These are shoe sales alone. Now imagine his product line of Lebron's logo apparel, and then, consider how his global fame attracted several billion more in revenue for Nike because Lebron always wears Nike products (so think about all the non-Lebron Nike products, the shoes, shirts, shorts, etc).   &amp;#x200B;  Now, anytime Lebron is on TV, which is a good 15-20 regular season games alone plus 8 straight finals meaning another 4 rounds of Lebron on Internationally broadcasted TV and streaming websites for an average of 5-6 games per round, which is \~155 NBA playoff games with Lebron over his 8 year Finals run dynasty. Every time the camera goes to him, which is at least 50 or 100 times in a single game (free throws, replays, TOs, etc) he is wearing Nike products a headband/shoes/socks/jersey/shorts.   &amp;#x200B;  If anything, Lebron took a MAJOR L for his Nike contract despite any details not being known because he's responsible for generating billions in revenue annually for Nike, and a lifetime contract for one billion dollars is a major rip off. Given Lebron's talent, the ideal solution would have been if he created his own apparel brand the same way the Ball Family did, but because Lebron is Lebron, any company that produces his apparel will be guaranteed billions in revenue. Of course, had he made his own brand, a big factor would be the cost + quality of his goods, which is much harder to initially set up (ie getting suppliers, manufacturing line + warehouse, licenses, product innovation, etc). I am confident Lebron has some percentage cut in his deal with Nike."

"Body Mass Index is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared. A BMI of 25.0 or more is overweight, while the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9. BMI of 32.1, which technically makes him “obese.” But that’s BMI we’re talking about. Every running back in the NFL is obese if you go by BMI. So is Lebron James and I miss my ex."
"Exactly this.  If you could come up with 3 ball dominant players that run an offense as well as Harden, your list would likely be Chris Paul, LeBron James, and Russell Westbrook (maybe a healthy Wall, too).  However, Westbrook's style is more similar to Hardens than CP3's, and I think that'll help make the team more cohesive.     Westbrook and Harden will both try to drive and score, then make plays if the defense allows them to.  CP3 is much more of a playmaker first before a scorer, especially at this stage in his career.  It should be easier for guys like Gordon, Tucker, House, Green, etc to get used to a single playstyle from Harden/Westbrook rather than having to constantly adjust between Hardens and Paul's playstyles."
LeBron James.
LeBron James
"*Lebron James, for TWO! ...they're now telling me it was a 1.5 pointer, his foot WASN'T on the line...*"
"Shaq “wouldn’t team up with superstars”  ...played with Penny, Kobe, DWade, Steve Nash/Amare Stoudemire, LeBron James, and Pierce/KG/Ray Allen"
"&gt; so he got very lucky Nike gave him that lifetime contract as a thank you for being such a good ambassador   Agreed with everything up to this point. He got a lifetime contract so Nike can use him to promote whatever products they sell in the future since Lebron has global fame. I doubt Nike will be producing the King James line and Lebron shoes as much as they do while he is a current player, but after he retires, having him seen wearing Nike apparel in general is great brand recognition to all his social media followers, ie it is exposure/advertising.  \-&gt; No company will every do a billion dollar level business deal ""as a thank you"" lol it is 100% about the future revenue."
Lebron James the 8th should probably wear 823 tbh
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Darko Miličić.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched the goat in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Darko's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the greatest center ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Darko, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Darko in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Darko is better.  You might be jealous of Darkos ring, or jealous of his status as the greatest player in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Pistons, Magic, grizzlies, knicks, or Celtics fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Darko isn't even a top 1 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Darko talk to the adults. Fair?"

"Yes Lebron James Championship ring is worth more than the medical staff's. Not in hard value of the materials, but thats not what gives the ring its total value.  im 100% positive. despite me not linking you a source."
"&gt; I was showing you how your argument for that is fallacious since it could be easily used to show that Kareem and Russel are the GOATs not MJ.  It's not falacious at all. You can make an argument that Kareem is the GOAT over Jordan, it just depends on whether you value dominance or resume more. Most people value Jordan's combo of absolute dominance and resume, but if you want to pick Kareem that's at least a defensible opinion.  But Jordan has dominance AND resume over LeBron, so clearly LeBron has no business in the conversation.  &gt;   Lebron has had worse teams and more difficult opponents throughout his career.  In every single round of the playoffs, the average opponent Jordan faced a higher win total than the average opponent Lebron faced in each round...  Lebron has played in a much softer conference, and he's had a ton of help of his own between the time he left Cleveland until when Kyrie was traded to Boston.  And even when you account for their finals' opponents and their own teammates, Jordan still won more rings than expected compared to LeBron.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-should-lebrons-finals-record-hurt-his-legacy/  &gt; So in that sense, it’s not really a surprise that James has that 3-6 record in the Finals. In fact, if you add up the pre-series odds in the table above, you get an expected championship count of 2.8 for James — meaning he’s somehow running 0.2 titles above expectation, despite his record. That trails Jordan (who won 1.9 times more than we’d expect from the pre-series odds)  Your entire comment is laughable lmao"
"&gt;With his status and wealth, he could have land a super model   Yeh, that's the thing. That ain't it. Sounds hot, and cool, but no  &gt;  The thing is, Ayesha was fine as fuck before her first pregnancy. She's still gorgeous, but not the same. Not everyone comes back looking like the same after the pregnancy, and she's aging too.   &gt;  But Ayesha was Steph's high school sweet heart, and they grew up together, as best friends and lovers. Now they have a beautiful family and kids.. It's all just perfect  &gt;  That's worth a 100 different supermodels. They are perfect for a one night stand, but nothing beats this.. Real Love, and a good woman, a ride or die.. taking care of everything, and building ya home and children.   &gt;   It's the same with LeBron. He actually could and still can have any woman he wants. Hell, women like Rihanna and all other hottest women in the world just gushes over him. He's LeBron James  &gt;  But he has always been with that one woman, his high school sweetheart.. Savannah. They have the perfect home, family, beautiful children.. and Bron is just a role model of a father, and just a global icon.   &gt;   Supermodels come and go, especially if ya rich. But that right there.. very few people got that gorgeous, fierce, ride or die, loyal and a responsible woman.. holding ya down and ya fort... growing old with ya, and still loving you and every part of you, the same. That's special"
"I was gonna say, LeBron fucking James obviously has a whole crew of nutritionists and personal trainers he works with, I'm pretty sure he knows what he's doing"
I think lebron James and Michael Jordan have proven to be shitty gms but they will never be fired
&gt; routinely embarrassed itself in the playoffs   ??????  Since when is it embarrassing to lose to Lebron fucking James? The best player in the NBA?  This is a strange take.
Well Nidoking is a poison type I believe and everybody knows Redguards are immune to poison so Lebron James wins 8/10.
Lebron James will never win a ring again
"That’s crazy talk. How the fuck can a player win league MVP over guys like Lebron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Kawhi Leonard without being a “bona fide first option”? I don’t particularly like Russ, but the hate he gets here sometimes is outlandish."
Draymond Green outscored LeBron James in a game 7 of the NBA finals
"Elimination game results, career:   Steph Curry: 7-4   LeBron James: 14-10"
This sub and lebron critics everywhere love it what do you mean. That finals is so often talked about purely in a context to shit on James.

"Draymond ""backpack"" Green outscored LeBron James in game 7 of the NBA Finals, an elimination game"
"   I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old.

"""You can blaze WHILE you blaze""  - Lebron James"
Steph Curry  Donovan Mitchell  Joe Ingles  Giannis Antetokounmpo   LeBron James
The control that an organization has to give up to get Lebron James at this stage of his career is no longer worth it. His on court contributions no longer out weigh all the bullshit that the team and players have to go through to have him. The lakers would be in a better position to trade him and acquire the 10 first round picks they would get for him and set themselves up for the next decade.
“LeBron James plays for the Lakers”- empirical  “LeBron James is the greatest laker of all time” - normative
"""I've tasted better asses."" LeBron James"
"&gt; Dirk had more years of talented teams  lmao this is retrospective nonsense, dirk's supporting cast was never held in high regard, in every single playoff round they were predicted to be upset in 2011. Acting like Dirk had a solid all-star cast surrounding him is simply untrue. The most all-star teammates Dirk had in a given year? 1, and it only happened in 4 seasons. Wade had 1 allstar teammates for 5 seasons and 2 allstar teammates in 4 more seasons. That's 9 seasons of more than 1 all star on the team with only 5 50 win seasons to show for it vs 4 seasons of more than 1 all star on the team with 12 50 win seasons to show for it. This isn't a tiny difference. It's a pretty significant one.  BTW, you're talking about Wade being a good enough player and yet you can't even hold up a consistent argument.   &gt; But Wade is a monster and in his prime he was unstoppable  &gt; which is why Wade's peak got cut short carrying those trash teams  is he unstoppable? or was he stopped because he couldn't carry his teams *in a weaker conference?*   &gt; If you take away team accomplishments (because you can't control) and go by individual talent  oh you mean like comparing an MVP award which is literally an individual accolade? But you don't want to do that.   &gt; Wade was better than multiple MVP award winners. Playing with guys like Shaq and LeBron excluded him to be in the conversation  &gt; Dirk had more years of talented teams  So Dirk was more often in the conversation for MVP because he had talented teams - but Wade having talented teammates excluded him from the conversation?  &gt; LeBron only has one ring without Wade. So even though Wade was the second best player with LeBron, James would have never won without Wade and you have to give both guys credit for their rings.  Lebron would've never won without Wade? jesus christ are you actually DWade's burner?  &gt; Wade's best statistical season, lol look at his teamates  &gt; getting shutdown by UD   oh so is Udonis Haslem bad now? And also Wade had a young Michael Beasley and Rio Chalmers and Shawn Marion.  Your entire argument is based on narrative- a narrative that consistently contradicts itself. Either Wade was unstoppable, or he was stopped. We shouldn't be looking at team achievements - but individual achievements are actually team achievements in disguise. Dirk was in the conversation because of his talented teammates, but Wade wasn't in the conversation and his peak was cut short because of his talented teammates.   I can point to concrete accolades that Dirk won over Wade. I can point to concrete benchmarks that Dirk managed to consistently reach over Wade. I'm sure you would pick Wade over Dirk in the all-time list. You'd just be wrong."
"I agree Dirk had more years of talented teams while Wade had 2 good years of Shaq and the 4 years of big 3. Those teams after Shaq were pretty terrible which is why Wade's peak got cut short carrying those trash teams. Dirk always had a solid point guard and role players most of his career and credit to the Mavs organization for that. But Wade was elite on both ends and had a higher peak. Dirk had a longer one but if I had to choose one of them in an all time great pick up game I'm picking Wade. LeBron only has one ring without Wade. So even though Wade was the second best player with LeBron, James would have never won without Wade and you have to give both guys credit for their rings.   I'll also give Dirk some credit after choking in the 06 finals shooting 39% getting shutdown by UD and then coming back strong and win the MVP and getting bounced in the first round to eventually get the title in 11. But Wade is a monster and in his prime he was unstoppable. The 06 series is a perfect example no one could stay in front of him but Dallas also didn't have the defensive roster to do so. No one did at the time not even Detroit who was the better defensive team than Dallas. I wouldn't say peak Wade blows out Dirk I stoll think it's close but Wade being a guard had more control over the game since the ball is in his hands. If you take away team accomplishments (because you can't control) and go by individual talent I have to take Wade because he's a guard and was an all nba defender while Dirk is one of the best offensive players ever was average to slightly above average on defense. Wade was better than multiple MVP award winners. Playing with guys like Shaq and LeBron excluded him to be in the conversation and the years between Shaq and LBJ Wade didn't have a good enough roster to put him in as an MVP. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Miami_Heat_season Wade's best statistical season, lol look at his teamates. That was rough. Comparable to MJ before Pippen came.   https://youtu.be/KDJjMTZLVfU  Peep this"
"Lebron James teammates has had 14 all-star appearances while playing with him, Michael Jordans teamates has had 6 appearances, so no he has not had ""consistently better supporting casts around him. The only all-star caliber player he really played with was Scotty Pippen, who probably a top 100 player of all-time, but you know so is Dwayne Wade."
LeBron James wouldn't average even 20 if NBA called offensive fouls
"&gt;In his prime he could outduel lebron james, Kobe Bryant and paul pierce.  What?   &gt;Soild top 5 Point guard of all time  LOL ok"
"&gt;I wish Bron would bring back the mustache. He looks like a badass 70s-era star or cop or some shit.  I came in to comment this almost exactly, even down to the 70s cop comparison. He rocked that look. Now I want a buddy cop film starring LeBron James set in the 70s. He'd look great with that facial hair and a Shaft-esque leather coat."

"Late to the thread but I'll drop a few.    Lebron is third in NBA history,  and at this point,  I don't think he can pass either guy ahead of them.   The NBA has intentionally built a system to limit parity as much as possible, so the league will never have the level of competition of NHL or NFL.   I would never vote James Harden for MVP or all NBA. His game is so hard to watch I avoid the Rockets when they play anyone but the Pacers."
"I don't think Wilt is in the top 10, just as I don't think LeBron was inferior to Westbrook in 2016-2017 because I don't ascribe to the ""stats"" argument anymore than I ascribe to the ""rings"" argument (i.e. Robert Horry was not vastly superior to Malone, Stockton or Barkley). Yes, great players tend to have great stats, but great stats don't MAKE them great players.   You don't get better stats anywhere than the Harlem Globetrotters, and you can always find great stats from average players as long as they're the best player on their bad team.   You want the best players? Find me those players that dominated the game, AND that won all the titles, AND whom their peers called the best among them. I can think of few that fit that bill: Lebron James, Michael Jordan, and Bill Russell.   Bill Russell: 11/13 championships. 21-0 in elimination games. Got into Chamberlain's head- potentially the greatest athlete to play basketball- and outplayed him year after year after year.   Lebron: 4 MVPs    Jordan: 5 MVPs    Russell: 5 MVPs"
google LeBron flop and there's gems like...  LeBron flop collection. top 10 LeBron flops. LeBron James with the worst flop of his NBA career. NBA fans are clowning LeBron James over his epic flop last night. then the best one which is   number xrunching the NBA's flop fine on LeBron James.  he's literally been fined for it before.
Because it's his only playoffs as the #1 option? Obviously it's easier when you have LeBron James on your team
"Yeah,  cause Lebron fucking James needs another source of income  You're not a troll, you're an idiot"

"Pippen was not an all-star that season, call it a technicality if you want it is the truth. Horace Grant was a one time all-star in 1994. The list of one-time all-stars include players such as, Wally Szcerbiak, Chris Kaman, Devin Harris, and Mo Williams. Hardly all-time greats.   Kyrie is a 6-time all-star and Kevin Love is a 5 time all-star and neither of their careers are over, and Irving only just turned 27.  And yeah if you remove Lebron James from the Cleveland team they will have less talent than the Bulls team. I gotta give you that one, but i would be kind of weird if they did not. If you remove the best player of any team, that team will most likely have less talent than any random championship team."
LBJ are the initials of Lyndon Baynes Johnson. If you want to refer to LeBron it should be LRJ because his middle name is Raymone. It is Le Bron James
"Lebron James is not a hall of famer, hes just been lucky. Hes only slightly above average.  The Nuggets will lose 60+ games next year.  Zaza is not a dirty player at all.  The Celtics should change their color scheme to purple and gold."
LeBron James secretly wishes he was Paul Pierce
"Almost everyone's efficiency and PER falls in the playoffs.  The superstars who raised their games were  Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Lebron James, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, and Jerry West."
"Lebron is playing PG this year. Kuzma gets the start. So let’s compare.  Lebron&gt;Ben Green&lt;Jrich Kuzma&lt;Harris AD&gt;Horford Whoever the hell they put at center (Cousins?!?)&lt;Embiid  That’s 3-2 sixers Then we have the bench.  PF sixers: Mike Scott, Jonah Bolden Lakers: Jared Dudley, (rookies I guess?) Center: sixers: Kyle O’Quinn Lakers: Javale McGee  SF: sixers: James Ennis, Furkan Korkmaz? Lakers: Troy Daniels,  Guards: Sixers: Trey Burke, Raul Neto, Shake Milton, Zhaire Smith, Matisse Thybulle(Rookie/unproven) Lakers: Avery Bradly, Kentavious Caldwell Pope, Alex Caruso, Quinn Cook, Rajon Rondo  I’d say offensively these two are equal(but my bias says sixers are better) but defensively Sixers have the far better bench. The sixers bench was built with defense as the priority since the starting 5 can carry most of the scoring load. I’d give the sixers bench an edge and say the sixers win 4-2 (in terms of talent). Lakers 1-2 is better than the sixers but the sixers 1-10 is better than the lakers."
People are expecting Lebron James but should be expecting Draymond Green
I think you’re really underrating how good Lebron James and Anthony Davis are. Their supporting cast is pretty good too.
"Lebron is one of those athletes who’s been dominant for so long, you can break down the iconic moments of his career by eras  * HS Lebron: beating Carmelo Anthony’s Oak Hill team on national TV  * Young Cavs Lebron: 27 straight points vs Detroit in ECF  * Miami Lebron: 2012 ECF Game 6  * Homecoming Cavs Lebron: 2016 Finals “Blocked by James!”   * Lakers Lebron: Taco Tuesday"
"I'm sorry, but this is the dumbest take I've read on this subreddit. Really dumb. They were a playoff team and on pace to get 50+ win before Lebron james got injured. The team totally fell apart when he was injured. How is that one dimensional? There's more to the game than just 2 sides of the ball (offense/defense)  Sure, his defense was terrible but to say he's one dimensional is absurd man. Please analyze what you said and look at the whole picture, look at the lakers in addition to just the numbers."
"Easily the Lakers. Their playoff drought was going on for 6 years and now they’re a title contender with 2 top 8-ish players. Another thing to show how spoiled they are is the fact that there is a decent size majority that has the privilege to complain about Lebron James, one of the greats, not being Kobe sometimes."
"Harden is better than wade, bosh, melo, jr, dirk, Barkley. Only people above him are kd ,curry, lebron. Westbrook, kawhi, are similar maybe they are better. James harden blasts ass, giannis isn’t mentioned because I don’t think he’s that good but I have a bias since I can’t dunk. I don’t believe anyone from the big Three is better than current players, the stat boom, internet boom, economic incentive, all play a part in my conclusion that today’s players bang ass"
And still averaged like 27? Yeah get out of here he's LeBron Fucking James
"Biggest fucking Kobe fan here. Maybe you can make some “intangibles” argument for Kobe, but objectively, it’s Lebron James. Pretty much every stat backs it up. Nothing wrong with Kobe being slightly behind a top 2 all time player though."
Nephew. Here's a LPT: It's Lebron James. Lol. All but the saltiest Lakers fans think Kobe is better than Lebron but that will probably change now that Lebron is actually on the Lakers.
"He isn't nowhere near wade though imo, while Hardens defense is underrated, Wade is one of the best defensive guards of all time, he also took a 2006 heat team with a regressing shaq to the finals and defeated that insanely good Mavs team and I would call wades prime better than hardens prime as in 2009 the reason he didn't win mvp was a prime Kobe Bryant and prime Lebron James, in 2012 and 2013 he completely accepted his role as the 2nd best player on the heat and still balled out in the playoffs both years with only 2014 being ruined because of knee problems and when all was set and done he was a 3 time champion with the most blocks in guard history, so while I like Hardens game these hot takes saying Harden is better even though he hasn't really seen that much playoff success, combined with his average defense I don't think he's anywhere near Wade"

"And that number from curry is a full 3 less shots per game than what Mitchell just put up. Again, with: more trips to the line, increased Efficiency in general, and better shot selection to get more pts from 3s and trips to the rim w/ fouls instead of contested jumpers (totally realistic given the increased spacing he's going to get) he can get to 26 ppg without it even being an absurd feat.   I have no idea what his volume is going to drop to guy lol. I haven't claimed to. I'm simply pointing out to you that 26/5/5 isn't that much of a feat to begin with for Mitchell in this specific situation this upcoming season and that you shouldn't be acting like it is lol. It is just a reasonable line.    &gt;His free throw rate can increase and still be low relative to his peers. That's how bad it's been for him in his first two seasons.  &gt; To be frank, Mike Conley is a better offensive player than what Mitchell has shown in the NBA. He does get to the line at a solid rate and is an efficient scorer who does so on solid volume.  I'm aware of how bad his FT rate is. I just told you the number. And again, you're intentionally choosing to underrate Mitchell as a player in general (and being super lazy) by comparing 2 year vet Donovan Mitchell vs 10+ year vet Mike conley AND not using any sort of macro level logic because the jazz are going to continue to make sure Mitchell sees heavy (though I do think, and at least hope it is reduced somewhat) usage. Why? Because he's the future of the franchise and Conley is on a 1+1 that's a player option and is going to retire within 5 years even if he's retained.   They are going to continue to make a specific effort to develop Mitchell. And through two years, I just told you who his peers are among active players. So you're just wrong to say Conley is just  "" 'frankly'a better offensive player"" as if that's a permanent situation and the comparison you made was lazy and the logic poorly thought out.   &gt; So your argument for Mitchell making this leap is to compare him to players that scored more than Mitchell on better efficiency. That was the case for KD, LeBron, Towns and Carter. All of those players have seen their volume decrease when playing with better talent. Towns with Butler, James with Wade and Irving in year 1, Carter with Kidd, Durant with Westbrook (exploded without him). These are bad examples. Wade had a 56 TS% in an era where league average efficiency was MUCH lower than it is today. Another bad example.  They aren't bad examples, they're to force you to acknowledge the tier of player that he's scoring among. Because they're 3 HoFers and KAT. So you can't just dismiss Mitchell being a prolific scorer. And idk why you repeated yourself here by implying Mitchell's volume is going to go down. It has never been in dispute.   For the record, I'm in love with this roster as a whole lol, I have no idea why you'd think I feel otherwise, but I'm beginning to think you just want to be condescending, and that you are not, in fact, ""just looking for an explanation."""
"Curry in 2018 averaged 26ppg on 16.9 FGA, 5.9 FTA (35% free throw rate); 67 TS%. I'd like to know how you think Mitchell is averaging 26ppg with substantially lowered volume. Again, I do not think you understand what you are proposing.   &gt;I haven't given an amount I think his volume drops too lol.  Well..what do you think his volume drops too.  &gt;Mitchell had 5.1 FTA per game last season. If you DON'T think that's an aspect of his game he's gonna look too increase then you're, like I said, just not giving the guy any credit. That number is absurdly low.  His free throw rate can increase and still be low relative to his peers. That's how bad it's been for him in his first two seasons. The problem with using FTA is that his responsibility will go down, and so any improvement in drawing fouls may not be reflected in his trips to the line.   To be frank, Mike Conley is a better offensive player than what Mitchell has shown in the NBA. He does get to the line at a solid rate and is an efficient scorer who does so on solid volume. So for Mitchell to make this jump in production doesn't make much sense when the Jazz now have an option who has shown to be even better in the halfcourt.  &gt;And yeah you can count on an inherent improvement just from Mitchell as a player. Out of active players, he scored more in his sophomore season than anyone in the NBA except KD, Bron, KAT, and Vince Carter. And before you try to blame volume again, Bron and Carter both had higher volumes their sophomore years. So Mitchell is firmly in that echelon of scorers. (Though you won't enjoy being told that). Even d-wade, one of Mitchell's biggest comparisons jumped from 24.1 to 27.2 in years 2 to 3. So it just isn't that much of a leap.  So your argument for Mitchell making this leap is to compare him to players that scored more than Mitchell on better efficiency. That was the case for KD, LeBron, Towns and Carter. All of those players have seen their volume decrease when playing with better talent. Towns with Butler, James with Wade and Irving in year 1, Carter with Kidd, Durant with Westbrook (exploded without him). These are bad examples. Wade had a 56 TS% in an era where league average efficiency was MUCH lower than it is today. Another bad example.  I'm beginning to think you're more interested in Mitchell winning MVP than the Jazz finding success as team."
This pose of Lebron.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-face-jr-smith-blunder-cavs-game-1-finals-2018-6
It’s a lot easier than saying LeBron James Jr
"Zion could be 'a better LeBron James' on offense, David Griffin says"
Wtf LeBron James is a normie
"""Well it looks like Zach Lavine has this in the bag, unless Gordon dunks it from the three point line or something""  ""WAIT WHAT'S THAT? BAH GAWD THAT'S LEBRON JAMES' MUSIC! THE KING IS HERE!"""
Harden was being brought off the bench on a team that run up against Lebron James. If you seriously put the blame on him for that series you’re a fool. Are you also referring to the same semi washed up Shaq that was first team all-NBA?
"Fucking hell, people nowadays are saying Lebron James is overrated omg..."
"That thread was embarrassing. A less extreme version of the ""LeBron gave Love depression"" thread. This sub is a monstrous case of hypocrisy with how they scrutinize the media and then turn around and bite at every hot take they hear.   A lot of people really want to believe LeBron James is this evil person because he has an ego. You can be both a good person and a guy with an ego. I don't see how people can't see that LBJ is just a good guy."
Least: Anthony Bennett  Most: LeBron James
LeBron James Jr. mainly cuz he's 14 and we have no idea how he will stack up with the best players in his age and people have already penciled him into NBA rosters.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Idk how the f you got Lebron best player currently from all these conversations. The point is he’s create a ceiling that he’s shown time and time again, and just when people thought they saw his decline. He had the most historic playoffs run in history in 2018. His stats were filling all major categories.  James on the other hand, is not able to break or come close to that ceiling that he himself and Lebron made. He is less efficient on the playoffs due to everyone taking the games 100%. Greatest player are able to adapt, to such situations and fly to greater height. However, for James Harden, these situation shows his vulnerability and his inability to adapt. Such as the series against golden state warriors.  Kawhi is a good example of exploding in the playoffs.   In 2001 finals, Allen Iverson who basically carried his team to the finals, got a stat line of 48-23–35-35-37 points scored in 5 games.  Shaq who was the fmvp, had 44-28-30-34-29. Great numbers still lost to AI’s average of 35.6, shaq averaged 33 that series, scoring wise.   AI average a phenomenal PPG and was second of all time behind Jordan in Average PPG in playoffs.  But his stats has hardly ever been brought up, or at least has fade due to time and people forget how great he was. What people remembered however, was Shaq monster stats, and the fact that Lakers won."
"1. Referring LeBron James as James when comparing him to James Harden can be confusing.  2. Of course LeBron has better totals because he played 475 more minutes that season. On a per 100 possessions basis, Harden had way more points and even lightly more assists than LeBron.  3. Harden took the Rockets to 65 wins, dethroning the Warriors as the #1 overall seed for the first time under Steve Kerr, while LeBron's Cavaliers had 50 wins and a 4 seed in a weaker conference."
"They weren't there when he signed there a year ago. It's even been reported that Kawhi didn't want to go to the Lakers because LeBron was there.   When LeBron signed there a year ago, all they had was young guys who hadn't shown great potential yet and cap space that ultimately turned into role players. Philly had a top 10 player in Embiid and the ROY who was already playing like an All-Star in Simmons with both being under the age of 25 while coming off a second-round exit in year one.  Heck, he even said his decision was based on his family and the Lakers.  &gt;“My decision was based solely on my family and the Lakers,” James said. “I’m a basketball player. I play ball. That’s what I do.”  https://www.boston.com/sports/nba/2018/09/24/lebron-james-humbled-to-join-lakers   The Lakers part is obviously up to loose interpretation. But they've had the worst record in the league going back to 2013 and didn't have any other stars on the team when he signed there. So I don't think recent success played a part in that.  So yeah, if you're gonna call my take ""dumb,"" at least use actual facts to explain why."
"He's 34% from 3 in his career. Which you're right he would be guarded closer but at the same time he wouldn't because he's gonna drive right by you for an easy dunk because he's LeBron. 34% isn't bad either, it's higher than Kobe and Jordan, even James Harden is only at 36% who is regarded as this great scorer. If LeBron starts hitting 40%, the Lakers are gonna have 3 players that are gonna be wide fucking open lol. It's just this narrative that he's not the best but he is, like scoring isn't his best facet yet he's top 2 with Durant in pure scoring ability."
"The pelicans are missing the best player in the world, Lebron James"
"Now I’m confused why you’re bringing up your guy, LeBron James, in a thread almost entirely dedicated to discussing Kobe Bryant’s fade-away shooting. Like, your point wasn’t even relevant to the discussion on hand at all. You can understand why I’d assume you were talking about the Lakers vs Raptors right?  I can tell you about how LeBron is 5-11 in Finals games against the Spurs. 2013 just made 2014 all the sweeter, but by all means keep trying."
"You’re basing a player’s skill off of how much money they’re signed for lol. Ben Simmons is getting paid more than Lebron James. You’re point is dumb lol if anyone is going to come back from a major injury I’d take my money on a 28 year old former all star who was the most dominant big in the NBA for a period. Lebron is still capable of defending, Bradley is known as a defender and he’s healthy, McGee is a rim protector, AD can guard 4 positions, THT is a 6’4” guard with a 7’1” wingspan with the same size hands as Kawhi and graded out as an elite defender in college, Caruso has clamps, Dudley is a smart defender, Kuz still has room to grow into an average defender, Danny green has good defense, KCP plays pretty good defense so I don’t know where u see so many holes lol. The people who can’t defend are shooters and that fits in today’s modern NBA"
"Naw fuck that the clippers overrated, Paul George is LeBron James son, Kawhi 28 but his knees 43 just tell em the truth bro lmao #lakeshow"
"Interesting coincidences:  The Nets currently have 3 Team USA 2016 players.  The Warriors had 3 Team USA 2016 players, maxed out at 5, had 6 at one time or another, and are down to 2.  All the best Raptors players in 2016 all played for team USA.  Nobody on Team USA 2016 has won an MVP since 2014. Nobody besides Kevin Durant has won an MVP, period. Notice that LeBron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook all sat this Olympics out."
Smh y’all are not creative. It should be this:  LeBron JOmes  Steph COrry  James HardOn  Giannis Ontetokounmpo  Kevin DOrant  Kawhi LOonard  Anthony DOvis  Damian LOllard  Paul GOorge  Kyrie Orving  Joel Ombiid  Nikola JokOc  Russell WOstbrook  Carmelo Onthony  Kemba WOlker  Blake GrOffin  Rudy GobOrt  Be better next time r/nba
"Are you dumb bro 😂 you’re saying Boogie is washed and injury prone when dude is 28 and fully healthy now, it’s not hard to have common sense bro. Trez is 6-man of they year candidate, big fucking whoop lmao Boogie was the BEST center in the league putting up numbers Trezz will never put up. And you should know a lot about missing the playoffs as your franchise hasn’t even made a conference final 💀 why would we have to force a 35 year old Lebron James to play 40 mins a night when we have 2 superstars???? That 35 y/o Lebron James put up 28 8 8 last year on a down year. And why do u think Boogie will take 15-20 shots a game lol u have no IQ, why would a vet minimum player be taking the most shots lol you have no basketball knowledge if you think Boogie is going to take more shots than AD."
See: Lebron James
Then I must contend that if Cavs didn't lose Kevin Love after Kelly Olynk dripped his arm off and Kyrie wasn't out during the finals Cavs would have won the championship that year.   LeBron played his heart out in those finals that he was a strong contender for Finals MVP even though they lost in 6 games. Had Kyrie been there offense would have more spread out between him and LeBron and defense spread between love and James

The fact that Zubac is making more than Boogie is comical 😂😂 sounds like a bargain for Boogie to Lakers and an overpay for Zubac 💀 and I like how u bring up those players on the squad and don’t bring up Lebron James and Anthony Davis lmao but keep talking like Avery Bradley is gonna win the Lakers the game against u guys lol I love the new Clipper delusion about Zubac and Montrez like they can hold the jock strap of Boogie and Ad 😂 y’all talk trash like y’all have done something before 🤣
Carmelo Anthony has never been close to LeBron James
"Although I really think Kobe is superior to Lebron James, which other legends picked Kobe over Lebron aside from Bird?"
I think lebron James is better than those guys.
"Our target client has a minimum 1M in assets that we would manage. Bare minimum (if you aren't a reference by an existing client) would be mid 6 figures, if you are still working and are going to be contributing.  That's not to say that there aren't services that can be beneficial for someone below that. We have a la carte services that can be useful for clients with smaller portfolios, but we wouldn't take them on as clients we manage assets for. You simply don't have enough in assets to make the management fees worth our time, and your portfolio isn't complex enough to where our expertise is going to make a substantial difference.  The analogy I like to use is the return you would get from a physical trainer. If you're the average joe, paying for someone to assess your current fitness level and working out a plan for you would be way more valuable than having someone who's going to be with you every step of the way from training, nutrition, recovery and so on. But if you're a LeBron James, you are at a level where all those things matter and provide enough value for you to justify the cost."
"LeBron James, that’s how. He had 20 WS and 18 WS in back to back years which equates to the Cavs being mediocre w/o him."
"how exactly do you apply 'per capita' to basketball?  its almost like you have no idea what you are talking about.  nba players per capita?  that still doesn't account for lebron james, kevin durant, kawhi leonard, steph curry, klay thompson, dame lillard, anthony davis, paul george, etc...   maybe stick to watching soccer buddy"
I'll go with 35 years old LeBron James.
"LeBron James deserves all the credit for this win (his Game 5 performance is possibly the best I've ever watched) but this Pistons team was a bit different from the '04 iteration. Ben Wallace was gone, Rasheed Wallace was showing his age (slower footed, increasingly reliant on picking-and-popping-and-standing), and Flip Saunders' defensive philosophy differed greatly from his predecessors.   Moreover, and this is only anecdotal, but the Pistons seemed to lose an edge after their '04 win, like the hunger had been satisfied to some degree, and with each subsequent series loss in '05 and '06, they seem to become more and more unmoved.   Again, that takes nothing away from James leading that crew of randoms past Detroit - it was still a massive undertaking. It just wasn't that '04 team anymore."
"Griffin agrees to a story with SI about the process of building the Pelicans. Along the line, he shares what he felt at the time of winning the championship and that those feelings were proven to be wrong in the following years and how that would influence him with this new project.  This whole ""LeBron story"" happened because SI saw they could generate some juicy buzz with these quotes without the right context. That's also why the post on r/nba that started all of this is literally just linking a 210-word side story from a different reporter (Michael Shapiro) that just has a few of those juicy David Griffin quotes along with fillers such as these:   &gt;Griffin joined the Cavaliers in 2010 and was promoted to general manager in May 2014. LeBron James announced he was returning to Cleveland two months later, initiating a rapid rebuild. The decision reportedly filled Griffin with anxiety.  &gt;Cleveland reached three-straight Finals with Griffin, losing to the Warriors in 2015 and 2017 and defeating Golden State in the 2016 Finals. Griffin left the Cavaliers in June 2017 after his contract expired.  &gt;Griffin worked as an analyst for NBA TV for two seasons after leaving Cleveland. He was hired as the Pelicans' general manager in April.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ckp5ei/david_griffin_on_3year_stint_with_cavs_everything/?st=jyvnhiub&amp;sh=a01a297b  https://www.si.com/nba/2019/08/01/david-griffin-leave-cavaliers-2016-title-lebron-james-pelicans-gm  I mean this isn't even the main article. That one is considerably longer (over 3500 words) and focuses way more on the Pelicans.  And even in that article (from Jake Fisher) there are whole sections that focus on Griffin and Lebron, instead of the experiences that Griff wanted to translate to the Pelicans process, where Griffin's quotes are pretty clearly inserted with context provided by the reporter and not by Griffin himself. Considering he has said very similar things before on podcasts and on other media appearances but presented them differently.  &gt;James’ contagious hunger to deliver a championship for Northeast Ohio dissipated.  This is a direct quote from the article but not from Griffin. But it is supplemented with the quote of Griffin's feelings at the time of winning the championship (which Griff said were proven wrong) so this made it sound like Griffin was talking like this about LeBron right now.  I sincerely doubt that reporter will ever get another story from Griffin. It's simply disingenuous reporting."
"&gt; ""The fact that there was so much scrutiny in everything that we did, when I was speaking about being uncomfortable and being miserable, it was my inability to deal with that media scrutiny,"" Griffin said.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"They gave him MVP because he was defending LeBron and he managed to tie him down to “only” 36/13/9 stats per game.

But best player that series was by far LeBron James, and because they had to give FMVP to a winner out of respect towards LeBron they gave it to Iggy.   But Iggy wasn’t the best player in that Warriors team and everybody knows that. If they wanted to give FMVP to a best Warrior they would give it to Steph."

"&gt; Miller said he had been filming all day and had his tapes confiscated only after Crawford's dunk over James.  ""LeBron called Lynn over and told him something,"" Miller told CBSSports.com.

"The Warriors are a better organization, but that's not why they get less attention than Lebron. People simply care more about Lebron everyone's got an opinion on what he is doing and what he should be doing. Everyone is aware is he a generational freak so people can't stop talking about him and arguing about him passionately whether to praise or criticize him. He is a once in a lifetime talent the impact he can have on a basketball court is not believeable. The Warriors 4/5 all-star team should get more attention than any team all time, but they are not as special as Lebron the Warriors all-star team can be replicated again.  Steph could be criticized too if he had the spotlight James has on him. [Steph and the Warriors were smiling after Kevin Durant got injured in the Finals](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bml3aw/curry_on_kds_injury_we_all_looked_at_each_other/).

"**What timezone do you currently live in?**  I currently live in AEST (Australian Eastern Standard Time)  **What are your normal reddit operating hours?**  I spend **A LOT** of time on Reddit. On weekdays in AEST my operating times are about 7:40am - 8:40am,    10:50am - 11:15am, 1:15pm - 2:15pm, 3:15pm - 10:30pm with a bunch of of other check-ins sprinkled throughout the day. On the weekends it’s from about 7:30am - 11:30pm. So in EST for the Weekdays it’s 5:40pm - 6:40pm, 8:50pm - 9:15pm, 11:15pm - 12:15am, 1:15am - 8:30am. For weekends in EST it’s 5:30pm - 9:30am.  **Roughly how much time do you spend on /r/nba on a daily basis?**  Almost all of my time spent on reddit is on r/NBA. I’d say the number would be around 10 hours on a weekday and on the weekend that number jumps up to a colossal 16 hours. So yeah I spend a decent amount of time on r/NBA. Even when I’m not posting or commenting, I’m almost always browsing.  **How long have you been a part of our community and why do you think you'd be a good addition to the mod team?**  I think I’ve been apart of this great community for about 4 years and I’ll tell you this, they’ve been a great 4 years. Being apart of the community for that long, I have a good idea of how things work and run around here.   I think I’d be a good addition to your mod team as I have plenty of moderating experience (Former r/NBA2k Mod and Current r/Thunder Mod), I have good judgment when it comes to deciding wether or not a post should be removed, I only take the rules into account when debating removal of a post, I don’t base it off of my own personal opinion on the subject. I also work well as part of a team which I believe is a useful trait to have considering the r/NBA Mod Team currently consists of 27 moderators. But most importantly, I thoroughly enjoy moderating on reddit, it’s highly enjoyable for me and I enjoy every aspect of it. It’s not a chore nor a hassle, more like a fun and relaxing activity.  **If there's one thing you could change about /r/nba, what would that be?”  I’d change how the removal of shitposts are judged. For example, a post with the title “Why Lonzo Ball is better than LeBron James” that also has 0 upvotes should be removed ASAP, while a funny shitpost with something like 700 upvotes that the community seems to like should be left up. Some of my side ideas are too take more community feedback to get a better vibe for what they want and too re-work the “Top Team Subreddit Posts” algorithm to allow some smaller team subreddits too be featured as they usually have good quality content aswell, but due to their smaller subreddit/fan base don’t get the credit they deserve.  **What is your favorite NBA memory?**  As a die-hard Thunder fan who experienced the greatness and pure beauty of Russell Westbrook’s 2017 MVP season, this is a very tough question as there are so many moments to choose from. Just to name a few, his 58 point game, his 57 point triple double, his 41st triple-double where he tied the Big-O and his 42nd triple double game. But for me, in a close contest, his game against Denver where he recorded his record-breaking 42nd Triple-Double of the season, had 50 points, led a last minute comeback, hit a deep game-winner, eliminated the Nuggets from playoff contention and essentially sealed the deal for his MVP is my favourite NBA moment ever. I will never forget that.  **Do you have any experience with CSS?**  Unfortunately I have very little experience with CSS. But I am willing to learn!  **Do you have any experience with PRAW, discord.py, or just Python in general?**  Unfortunately no, but I am willing to learn!  **Are you interested in helping mod the sub discord?**  I’d be up to help! I also Mod the r/Thunder discord server, although that doesn’t require much moderation as what the r/NBA server would.  **The rest is up to you guys. Feel free to add anything else that you think might help make a case for why you should be a moderator for /r/nba.**  As I said previously, I have a lot of reddit moderating experience (r/NBA2k and r/Thunder). I truly enjoy and love moderating. Being selected as a Mod for r/NBA would be a dream come true and a real honour! I’ll be crossing my fingers till the announcement post!  ***  Thanks for this opportunity and good luck to everyone else applying!"
"""We have a LeBron James at home"""
"&gt;giannis is in another world from kawhi (and every other player not named James or Lebron)  Well, this didn't age well. Also, you seriously thought Giannis is another level from KD 3 months ago?"
That was still excellent defense by Lebron. Getting scored on doesn't prove a player is a bad defender. There are no good defenders then.  And I was referring to last season's matchup when Lebron was playing center for the Lakers in the 4th quarters as an example: https://stats.nba.com/game/0021800066/matchups/?OFF_PLAYER_ID=203999&amp;DEF_PLAYER_ID=2544  In 9 possessions with James guarding him Jokic never got a shot off he had 3 turnovers and 1 assist.
"America is useless besides California, and New York. Don't act like anyone says thank god Cleveland exists lmao. Only think Cleveland has contributed to society is LeBron James."
Lebron James.
People act like Larry Bird didnt play AAU too. He even played with Magic before college. Some people are just built differently; Draymond talked trash to LeBron James then went on his show.   If you're built to talk trash friendship wont get in the way of that. Michael was friends with a lot of the top tier players like Patrick Ewing and Chuck but just used that win more.
"So I’m sure the bunch of times that Lebron James gets nominated it’s considered bullying right? Nah fam it only got real ugly once Javale’s mom and the warriors got involved. Like it’s been stated players laugh it off and try not to make dumb plays again,"
"Lebron James, its amazing to watch an all time great player that will be talked about for the next 20-30+ years live. Pretty soon being able to say you saw Lebrons whole career will be like the people who talk so highly of Jordan, Bird, Magic etc"
But they don't have Lebron James.

"LeBron ""Inigo Monyota"" James starts shooting left-handed and never misses again."
"I don’t think so. His 2009 run is still brought up quite often. If it were a player of lesser caliber, than maybe, but we’re talking about LeBron James here lol."
He's actually going to get a student from the crowd to stand behind and look menacing to help him scare Kobe off. That student? LeBron James.

"#What timezone do you currently live in?  Central  #What are your normal reddit operating hours?  On desktop a bit in early morning (6-8 AMish), then for several hours later in the day if I have nothing else to do, if I'm not at home, I use mobile as well  #Roughly how much time do you spend on /r/nba on a daily basis?  During peak F5 season it was probably several hours, now it's probably just about 1 hour though.  #How long have you been a part of our community and why do you think you'd be a good addition to the mod team?  I believe I first used r/nba in spring 2016, when I first made a reddit account, although I wasn't very active until sometime around spring 2018, when I began commenting on posts here and at r/Mavericks around the end of the 17-18 season. All-in-all, about a year and almost a half.  I believe I would be a good addition to the mod team as I've had prior experience moderating moderately-sized communities (on other sites) where I've had to do my fair share of quality control and userbase maintenance -- I helped to make sure the website (at least the popular parts of it) maintained of a relatively high quality. Here on Reddit, though, I don't think we really have to focus on that too much as upvotes/downvotes serve as their own method of quality control, usually ensuring what we've come to call ""nephew"" posts never reach hot, which the other site I moderated didn't exactly have. Regardless, there have been and will continue to be special situations where mods will have to use their own judgment. As for the other thing, userbase maintenance, from what I've seen, there's been some toxicity between fans on here, but usually all that boils down to is banter and doesn't truly turn ugly (most of the time). Of course, that's not the case all the time, and there will be situations where mods will have to intervene (severe flaming beyond petty banter, personal attacks, etc.) and use their judgment, which I have also practiced a bit on that other site as there were occasions where I had to step in regarding site-related arguments and whatnot.    #If there's one thing you could change about /r/nba, what would that be?  The top thing that I've made multiple posts about in the last year is making the Top Team Subreddit Posts section include more teams, or reworking the algorithm that creates it (really not sure how it works). As it is now, it ends up dominated by posts from the same teams, usually the ones with the largest team subs (Lakers, Celtics, not Warriors anymore, Raptors, etc.), so we barely see much of smaller team subreddits.  I also think r/nba mods are currently a little too delete-happy on some posts. I ultimately think it should be left to the upvotes to decide what stays up, especially during the off-season when we have very little actual basketball content to post. We do get tons of shitposts, most of those, like the name suggests, being pretty shit, but usually when you open those, you see 0 votes (35% upvoted) or whatever, and they never make it to hot. And then other times I've seen actually funny stuff get deleted after reaching the front page of r/nba, which ticks me off. During the season, I understand tightening up the rules, but we could loosen up a little bit.  #What is your favorite NBA memory?

"Good points.   Caps for emphasis is my thing and btw think you just did really well even though it was in jest.  Your personality counter argument is great - especially given how you've tied it to the media coverage Zion gets.  Zion is like LeBron in that regard, his personality enhances the overall value of what Zion brings to the table.    Think his athleticism attracts attention and his personality keeps it.  To address the hype factor, serious fans are tempered in their expectations for Zion.   David Griffin has already said Zion is by no means the number one guy in his own team. The hype at the end of the day is neither here nor there. Just a part of doing business in the NBA.   Finally, in addition to Zion the fact Zion by no means the main option on the Pelicans, the team is set for success and Zion probably will win Roy. If he does that and makes the playoffs there will be no talk (from any credible source) of Zion failing to live up to expectations. The hype is neither here nor there and will be forgiven and forgotten like it was for LeBron James."

Here’s a specific quote from [this interview](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24665317/javale-mcgee-lebron-james-shaq-new-look-lakers):   &gt;	it starts affecting how other teams look at you, like, “Oh, he’s not a smart player” because someone picked up all of his lowlights and put it in a reel. I definitely didn’t feel like it was fair or needed at all. Like, at all.**  In context: &gt;		 You've had a memorable career. You struggled a bit early on, made enough mistakes to be a regular on ""Shaqtin' A Fool,"" but you've grown on and off the court and have the hardware to show for it. When you retire, how do you hope you'll be remembered? I'm hoping I'm remembered as one of the most prolific shot-blockers. I'm definitely a smarter player than I was, especially defensively. I used to be a wait-at-the-rim big, more of a Rudy Gobert-type of player. Going to Golden State, I really fine-tuned everything on defense, which is important because the NBA is moving away from standard bigs and going toward bigs that can switch and things like that. I feel like people think that I have mental lapses and I'm injury-prone, which isn't true. You just don't know me. You're watching TNT and think it's real.  &gt;	So in your mind, was Shaq picking on you because you made an irregular amount of mistakes, or was he just being a jerk? I don't know. I'm sure you can find the same amount of lowlights for Kobe, for Jordan, for anybody who's an All-Star. But you keep showing just one person. And it got to the point where I'd miss a layup, then I'd be on the show. Like, people miss layups. Like, that's not a thing. So it got to a point where it had to end. At one point everybody grows, and they have to speak up and defend themselves as a man.  &gt;	You did take exception to it, publicly.  **Yeah, because it starts affecting how other teams look at you, like, “Oh, he’s not a smart player” because someone picked up all of his lowlights and put it in a reel.

"Mo went from a starter on the 60 win Cavs with Lebron to a bench player on Portland and Minnesota. In 2016 he was back on the Cavs 'coincidentally' when James was back. He wouldn't have lasted until 2016 if not for James going back.  I'm not sure how you can say the Cavs role players were suited to complement Lebron. They were not great 3 point shooters or rim runners, and there were no lockdown defenders either on the perimeter or in the post. Those guys were all average NBA players."
"Well yeah I guess you’re right   Serge Ibaka is better than LeBron James because LeBron just put up empty stats on a shitty team and Ibaka helped win a ring   Some people would say you’re wildly in denial and borderline deluded for insisting your contradictory opinion is better than actual recorded accounts of games, but I think you’re really onto something."
"I guess one could say LeBron James. Traditionally a 3, he subverted the traditional expectations for a wing into a facilitating machine averaging 7 assists per game throughout his career"
"Lmao I don’t even like Harden but this is an insane bending of the word dirty. People who flip aren’t dirty players lmao, by that logic LeBron James was a dirty player in Miami which just wasn’t true."
Doesn't work  Reports: Dwight Howard requests Lakers to release LeBron James **and** AD  so he can be the face of the franchise.
Football GOAT:   Tom Brady - 6 rings in 9 finals  Hockey GOAT:   Wayne Gretzky - 4 rings in 6 finals  Baseball GOAT:  Babe Ruth - 7 rings in 10 finals  Basketball GOAT -   LeBron James with 3 rings in 9 tries  or  Michael Jordan with 6 rings in 6 tries   It's so simple.
"&gt;Nobody wants LeBron's contract.    But everybody would always want LeBron more than anything else, if he was available. It's not just because he's the best in the world and already considered the 2nd Greatest of All Time.. but it's also his brand. LeBron. That alone sells out jerseys, tickets, everything. Complete revamp of revenue, all due to one man. NBA is a business. LeBron is not just the best player, but also the greatest draw the NBA ever had..  He is the bar   &gt;  His contract? Considering the fact that it's LeBron James, and considering today's market and what so many other players are getting paid..  LeBron's contract is still a fuckin bargain.      &gt;  In his 16+ year career, and with all that unrealistically high work load throughout his entire career.. the man just had his first ever real injury. It was also an unlucky slip and non-contact injury. He still ended the season averaging 27-8-8 lol He was actually leading the KIA MVP race and the Lakers was the 3rd seed.. then that bitter sweet Christmas happened. Big win against the Warriors, but LeBron's injury. Rest is history   &gt;  The funny thing is.. y'all incel nephews out here disrespecting the fuck out of LeBron already..  I can't wait to see the reaction of y'all hateful fucks when he actually starts to decline. Well, you lot might need to wait a lot longer for that to actually happen.  &gt;  Too bad"
Yeah who knows what the future holds. &lt;Lebron James Jr.'s eyes light up with a cybernetic glow&gt;
"Jamario Moon only played 10 MPG for the Cavs in the '10 Playoffs. He wasn't an important player. Elevating a player like that to Starter (Moon at the start of the season) is obviously going to go to shit. The bigs were old except Varejao, who stayed in the League for a while. So even if LeBron stayed their defense and rebounding was on the verge of going to shit regardless. Mo didn't really immediately fall out of the league. He stayed in the NBA until 2016. He battled injuries throughout the 2010-11 season as he hurt his groin before training camp and then had a shoulder issue as well. Of course wasn't suited at all to be a team's only ball handler since he was at his best, the 2nd injury replacement to the Eastern Conference All Star team playing besides LeBron James and getting a lot of open looks. Hell, even as a second ball handler he wasn't super ideal, and the Cavs were very reliant on LeBron just always having the ball. At one point the Cavs were running the Princeton offense when he was injured. Delonte West got traded, then was injured and a HUGE problem off the court, so that was the end of him.   The Cavs WERE built entirely around LeBron and utterly dependent on him for any success. The type of role players the Cavs did have though were at least suited to complement LeBron's skillset."
"How is what I said stupid and not related? The comment chain was literally talking about Kyrie lacking stability with Lebron, then someone commenting that Gordon had a long term contract but I was commenting that Kyrie probably wouldn't care about that because....Gordon is not comparable to Lebron James. In this hypothetical situation, why would Kyrie care about Gordon having a long term contract when he is not a particularly great player, and definitely not of Lebron's caliber? What context am I missing?"
"Man I was alive then and watched most of those Cavs games and even I don't recognize the names Alonzo Gee and Christian Eyenga. The Cavs would easily be able to replace them. Jamario Moon, Mo Williams and the rest all fell out of the league after James left. Those Cavs team were built with truly average players but Lebron at 25 was gonna win close to 60 games regardless."
Most of any player named LeBron James. Also this isn’t LeBron cock riding lmao Jesus. It’s just inaccurate and OP could’ve made a mistake  Anti-LeBron Stans are worse than LeBron stans
"Yeah Rachel Nichols does strike me as an advance basketball mind. The voting split was initially 4-3-3 Bron-Iggy-Steph before Iggy got all 7 votes so LeBron wouldn’t win. And aside from that those are the same kinds of “respected figures” who left James Harden off of all nba teams in 2016, who gave Steph, kyrie, and Lillard all defensive 1st team votes."
LeBron James
They were good teams because of Lebron. Those guys all fell out the league after James left.
"&gt; every other series that year he was head to head with wade as the primary option why did he suddenly take the role of third star against dallas?  This is not true. In the ECF Wade played like the 3rd guy. In the ECF it was James who averaged 26 and Wade averaged 18. Wade said he felt bad and that he owed his teammates in the finals and he took over. The result was Wade averaging 26 in the Finals, and James averaging 18.  &gt; His TS% dropped 5% while Wades efficiency went up  Yes this is true. And the basketball reason for this is that Wade shot more free throws while James played on the perimeter more spacing the floor for Wade. James was actually the best player from the field in the 2011 Finals with the best combination of volume and efficiency.   &gt;Not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4 ……Personally guaranteeing winning the next 8 rings and then having one of, if not the worst playoff series of his career.  This has nothing to do with what happened in the finals. That was his first time having star teammates he didn't know any better. You can clown him for it but that doesn't do anything to prove he 'choked'.  &gt;Im not sure how this is even possible when him and wade played 40 minutes a piece but somehow lebron managed to go -24 while every other starter except Anthony was a net positive.  Quite simple. Lebron spent more time playing with the 2nd unit. That unit was all negatives and they got outplayed by Dallas's bench. The FMVP was a -4 in that game even though it was one of his better games. That doesn't tell the whole story."
[Aging veteran excited to get carried by LeBron James in hopes of winning their first ring]
Lebron James can’t handle that physicality.
I want to send Allen Iverson back there when he was in his prime. Or Lebron or James and watch them win 400-2#
Next week:  **Reports: Dwight Howard requests Lakers to release LeBron James so he can be the face of the franchise.**
&gt; You can't possibly be elite at everything.  [You sure about that?](http://s3.amazonaws.com/oratv/assets/prod/asset/98135-larry-bird-lebron-james-0.jpg)
Why are we comparing him Michael Jordan and LeBron James.
We just gonna act like the corpse of Gordon Hayward is comparable to LeBron James?
Is this some elaborate troll? You SERIOUSLY think Lebron James would beat these legends? Jesus ur dumb
"Imagine trying to make it sound like having LeBron James on your team for the next 2 seasons is a bad thing lmao.  Also giving Kobe that contract worked out. We weren’t going to be good anyway, and it made us look loyal to future superstars who might want to join the team."
"Yes. In fact, I would trade James Jones for Lebron James too. GM job when?"
LeBron James
"Curry game winning shot against the Thunder, Kyrie Irving shot in game 7 finals 2016, LeBron James miss in game 6 2013 finals, CP3 in 2018 wcf against Warriors Game 5, Game 6 of the 2019 finals, I think this one is from the game 6 of the Warriors/Rockets series of this year but I'm not sure, and the last one is from the Game 4 of that same series."
"Yeah, Gordon is definitely comparable to Lebron James..."
LebRon James for the win.... YES
"No, genius, I’m talking about LebRon James SR"

"But on the flip side it's highly likely that he wouldn't be anywhere near as efficient if he averaged more than 16 FGA per game. His scoring is far more opportunistic than the likes of the top scorers today. It's hard for me to put him in the same level as a James Harden, LeBron, Giannis, Durant, Steph or a Kawhi as far as scoring. I don't even think that he's better than Lillard or Kyrie when it comes to the scoring. If those players are considered elite scorers than I'm not sure how I can classify CP3's scoring as elite when he's clearly a tier below them."
"Op's take is so brutal it's insane. LeBron fuckin James couldn't win it all in '11, '14, or '17 with good rosters every year. In what world is CP3 winning 99% of the time with some semblance of a contending roster, especially when he already had that with Blake, DJ, JJ, and Jamal"
"I agree they have a depth problem. We don't know what exactly their 2nd unit is going to be, but if Rondo and Kuzma are in it with Javale I think they are okay. If Rondo and Javale are constantly injured, or Ad and Lebron have injury problems, the whole season is toast but this applies to every team.  Their hopes of winning a championship regardless are dependent on superhuman efforts from Davis and James but that's not a bad bet."

"&gt;LeBron absolutely torched Kawhi in 2013   LeBron averaged 25.3 points on 44.7% from the field, and as a Raptors fan, I know that’s not LeBron “torching”.   &gt;Kawhi was able to play LeBron 1 on 1 is because Duncan was anchoring the defense.   Disagree. LeBron was passing up way more shots, turning the ball over way more, and was denied of the ball by Kawhi than any other defender on that Spurs team.   https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/91529/mvp-leonard-does-it-all  *“Leonard's defense on James in the series was key. James shot 57.6 percent against him, but he wasn’t always able to get his shot off or even get the ball. Only 19 percent of James' touches against Leonard in the Finals resulted in a James field goal attempt. Against all other defenders, that rate jumped to 33 percent. LeBron was held without a touch on 33 percent of the Heat's possessions when he was guarded by Leonard. Against all other defenders, he was held without a touch 23 percent of the time.”*  And I’m very sure Duncan wasn’t only anchoring the defense was Kawhi was on LeBron.   The Heat’s offense was at is worst when LeBron was being slowed down, yes it was a team defense, but Kawhi was the one slowing down LeBron more than any other player."

"It’s make Lebron James the Taylor Swift if basketball. The most popular and recognizable person, but controversial and polarizing."
"Patrick Ewing, Reggie Miller, Isiah Thomas, Larry Bird, Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning.  And also, why exactly do people act like Jordan had it extremely easy in the Finals?  He had to go against Magic Johnson, James Worthy, John Stockton, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Gary Payton, Clyde Drexler.  Like sure, LeBron had to face tougher Finals teams. But it's not like Jordan's Finals were easy. He still faced tough Hall of Fame players."
"Most teams sf is not Lebron james , Kevin Durant, Kawhi, or Giannis. The rockets had Pj Tucker at sf and almost beat a team with kd  at sf one year ago."
"Not only that, but both Kevin Durant and LeBron James have quit the league. Rose says Durant “got upset and he left the league.” Rose adds that James left the league after finishing in last place one year.  Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors and Maverick Carter are among the big names still in the league, according to Rose."
"The Lakers have Lebron James, Anthony Davis, and that Kuzma guy.  The Warriors have Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and now D-Lo.  The Lakers have more depth than the Warriors but it's the Warriors.  In conclusion I would take the Charlotte Hornets."

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better. You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Lebron James. He personally thinks he's the goat, and a lot of bronsexuals agree with him, but his finals record and propensity to be passive-agressive when the chips are down says otherwise. But he does have nice stats that he's carefully padded throughout his career."
"I’m a Wizards fan. He’s not a Hall of Famer.  He is however being severely underrated by this sub, who fail to put in context the limitations John has had his entire career between lack of supporting cast and awful coaching.   In 2015-16 if he doesn’t break his hand in Game 1 of the semis against Atlanta, we probably win that series.   In 2016-17 if the Wizards has a backup guard - 1 or 2 - better than Tim Frazier, we win that series and go on to the conference finals. (27 and 12 during those playoffs)  People are comparing him to Kyrie and Lowry saying how much worse he was, but John has never had the luxury of getting carried by a Kawhi Leonard or LeBron James. He did the carrying despite being saddled with lower leg injuries and playing through him for most of his career.   I say all this because with John’s most recent game at full health getting further in the rear view mirror it makes me sad to know that nephews will straight up forget how good he was. Especially knowing that we probably never see him at his peak again.   TLDR; not a hall of Famer; better than you fuckers all think he was though"

"Not only did Andrew Wiggins score 23 points as a 21 year old in the best league in the world he's also one of the two players who is outscoring Lebron James, who some would have as the GOAT, in their head to head match ups.  The other player who is outscoring Lebron is Durant, who is one of the best scorers in NBA history, but Durant is only outscoring Lebron by 0.1 point while Wiggins is outscoring Lebron by a WHOLE two points.  With that kind of talent it's perfectly UNDERSTANDABLE how our beloved owner, who totally and thoroughly understands basketball btw just wanted to make that clear, would give Wiggins a max contract.  If you trade for Wiggins now we'd even throw in Dieng, a marksman from midrange and a dynamic defender, for free."
"Well the entire article's premise is that Woj uses his columns as a means to pressure people into being sources, either by rewarding them with good publicity if they do (Dumars) or by punishing them with negative publicity if they don't (LeBron). If you've read it I'm surprised you missed that, since that's the entire article. But if you want something more specific with regards to LeBron, here you go:  &gt; Those within the league think Wojnarowski’s criticism of LeBron stems from reporting failures. “I don’t know if LeBron’s whole camp or just LeBron shafted [Wojnarowski], but [Wojnarowski] was having trouble getting to him,” a former team employee he tried to cultivate as a source told me. Somebody else familiar with Wojnarowski and James’ relationship said, “Adrian does not talk to LeBron, or people in LeBron’s camp. He doesn’t do any reporting with LeBron James or his people.” (Both spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fears that Wojnarowski would harm their careers.)"

Now replace Lebron James name in here with Steve Blake
I'd be like holy shit lebron fucking james!?!? Why do you have so many pizzas?
"I swear to god I just watched this like 300 times. At first it was hilarious. I couldnt stop looking at LeBron's face as that kid just fucking ignored the everliving shit out of him, literally just fucking ignored LeBron into the motherfucking Stone Age. Like I'm surprised LeBron didn't just fucking get obliterated into cosmic dust on the spot because no one has ever had anything done to them as hard as LeBron got ignored. Like they need to invent a new word for how fucking hard that kid ignored LeBron, one with the same meaning but stronger, sort of how the word ""devour"" works for ""eat."" And that jazzy music at the end made it extra whimsical.  Then after like the 50th playthrough I started wondering why that kid would do that. Maybe his mom just died. Maybe he has crippling social anxiety. Maybe he was afraid of being robbed. Maybe he got bullied a bunch growing up and associates a 6'8"" confident outgoing athlete as someone who will always go back to making fun of him, even after pretending to be nice as a joke. Maybe he hates the way his voice sounds and doesn't want it to be caught on camera. Maybe he thought it was some prank show bullshit. Maybe he knew it was LeBron, but wanted LeBron to know he did not give single microscopic speck of a fuck about LeBron and his accomplishments, just to spite him. Maybe he was so fucking nervous LeBron motherfucking James was walking towards him he completely forgot all social conventions and pulled out his phone. Maybe he's just super racist.  It got me thinking though. Would I ignore LeBron if he came up to me with a bunch of pizza boxes? I want to think not, but there is a little more of that kid in me than I'd like to think. He's probably in all of us, honestly, although maybe that's wistful thinking on my part, just some coping mechanism to make me think I'm less alone in this cruel world. What would I even say if motherfucking King James, the motherfucking Chosen One, came up to me asking me, quote/unquote, how I'm doing? How am I doing? I don't even know. I can barely even make eye contact with a cashier, what the fuck am I going to say to LeBron motherfucking James? Nothing I could say will add any value to LeBron's life. I'm just some fucking bum being used to promote some fucking pizza. My hand would probably melt when we're shaking hands. LeBron would just look at me and think ""Look at this fucking guy. He has no idea what it's like to have millions of people watch his every single movement, with their breaths bated and their mental wellbeings hinging on whether or not I put a ball through a hoop. He probably can't even make a lay up, let alone dunk. The difference between us is immeasurable. If we lived in a different time, a time where the weak served the strong, and if I were of a much crueler disposition, ""men"" like him would be toiling in my fields for the scraps I have so graciously decided to spare for him. His life and his livelihood, the dignity of his wife, the chastity of his daughters would be subject to my every whim. If this were a movie, I would be Darth Vader, and he would be lucky if he could even manage to attain the significance of a Rebel soldier being helplessly and humiliatingly force-choked to death by me aboard Tantive IV as my men stand around and jeer at him, even though they share more with him than they do with me. I would forget he existed mere seconds after killing him, his terrified expression as his generic, pathetic life flashes before his eyes being no different than those of the thousands of other people I had killed before him. Here, I surpass in him in every metric, not just physically. My charisma has been honed from countless interviews, rubbing shoulders with celebrities, innumerable media appearances, and years of being a leader of leaders. My willpower and self-efficacy undoubtedly dwarf his; I have likely overcame more adversity and obstacles from the moment I was born than this man has in his entire life. I came into this life as a black baby born to an impoverished single mother in a crime ridden area, and yet I made something of myself. I was down 3 to 1 in the 2016 NBA Finals against the greatest regular season team of all time, and yet I emerged a champion. I beat the odds. I went from the lowest of the low, to the most astronomical of heights, while this serf has been content with his mediocre, stagnant existence in the middle. I have no idea what it's like to be normal like him, and, while I look down on him both figuratively and literally, I must admit that I pity him."" Although I am doing relatively well in life, with positives traits both earned and inherited that I like to think set me apart from others, my life is meaningless compared to LeBron's. All of ours are. We are bound by machinations well beyond our control, and sometimes the best we can do is be like this kid, just fucking ignoring the absolute living shit out of the demigods who venture out of their bubble of opulence to partake in some novel but cynically patronizing interactions with the adorably harmless common folk, rather than giving them what they expected (and possibly wanted) by being starstruck. i havent slept in 48 hours i think i have mania cue the ""what the fuck did I just read le XDDDD"" fuck all of you also Bush did 9/11"
"A lot of those WNBA players directly compare their salaries to those of NBA players though. ""Lebron James made so much money, I wish WNBA players could make some of that"". So because they brought Lebron into it, it is relevant on r/NBA"
LeBron James...Kevin Nealon...basically the same.
"They aren't super stars, but those contracts weren't because Paul is a fantastic agent. Thompson got it because of the Lebron connection. Bledose is underpaid. Draymond deserved the max and got less than that. You were correct about Clarkson, because that was a above market contract for him. But I don't see much else. Paul is a average agent who happened to be fortunate enough to meet Lebron James early on."
"Oh man!  Ichiro is another guy who I'll always recognize.  Okay so the point of my story is that it's totally normal and believable that a gay man who doesn't watch an ounce of basketball wouldn't recognize LeBron James.  Hell how many people on this sub can recognize the [PM of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinz%C5%8D_Abe)?  Japan is the 3rd largest GDP in the world so he should be recognized the same way as Trump, Xi Jinping, Vlad Putin, Boris, and Angela Merkel.  But I'm betting that a large amount of us here until we clicked that link wouldn't recognize that man who can be called one of the 5 most powerful world leader currently."
"Imagine comparing LeBron James approaching you and saying ""What's going on man! How you doing?"" to seeing Kevin fucking Nealon buying spinach artichoke dip from afar, I'm rolling"
Right? That's the most hilarious thing about LeBron James' stans.  LeBron got cramps during the finals with the Spurs?   Well that doesn't count because LeBron reportedly spends billion of dollars on his healthcare so it was The Spurs organization that were doing something shady with their air conditioner. Probably polluting air by venting out Kwame Brown sweat Pop has kept up until that moment so that he could poison LeBron.   That's the extent of how far they go if you push the right buttons
"&gt; I'm not a Stan or defending him at all lol   Hard to take that seriously with Lebron James written all over your flair.  Expecially when I just explained that my problem it's not with him but his stans (mind you, not his fans) but you keep bringing the man up.  Just stop while you still can LOL"
There’s also a difference between somebody asking “do you know who LeBron James is?” And you answering that he’s an NBA player vs being able to recognize him in civilian clothes.  My grandmother knows who is is but I don’t think she could pick him out of a group
The statistics argument is tired. Russell Westbrook and James Harden have had far better stats than Lebron for the past 3-4 season. Would anyone consider either of those two as the better player?
Am I wrong to think that not watching sports isn't an excuse to not know who lebron james is? Unless he was just saying he didn't recognize him which I guess is understandable.
"I might be in the minority, but I find this kind of prank videos fucking tedious. People are busy and distracted, not expecting a celebrity with pizzas to approach them. The fact that they don't notice isn't some amazeballs revelation.   Best case scenario, they do look up and go, ""Wow, it's LeBron James with a stack of pizzas. Super fun day for me."" Big fucking deal. Get over yourself internet-videos-of-celebrities-being-ignored.  I saw Kevin Nealon at Trader Joe's yesterday. Celebrities go outside. Big fucking deal."
I have never met anybody in my life who was younger than 40 years old who did not know who Lebron James was.
"So you think LeBron James has to deal with more nonsense from his boss than, I dunno, Josh Hart in this instance?"
Tbf it would be cool to tell people you ignored lebron james like he's some kind of street bum

The difference is LeBron James is recognizable by all races and age groups globally. Im talking 5 year olds to 50+ years olds will recognize him. Comparing his celebrity status to Billie Eillish is a false equivalence.
"It is quite hard, though. Lebron didn't even tell Wade and Bosh. Two of his closest friends and teammates whose contracts negotiations were directly linked to James' decision"
I imagine LeBron James is pleasantly surprised. He probably hasn’t had anyone just ignore him in quite some time.
Imagine ignoring Lebron James.
"What a dumbass, how can you not recognize Lebron fucking James  That Amish beard is iconic"
Lol if LeBron James started skating at 3 years old he would be the greatest hockey player to ever live.

Fact: Michael Jordan as a toddler had more killer instinct and mental toughness than current LeBron James.
Harden last year had more 50 point games than any other active player has had in their career with the exception of LeBron James.
Lakers fans didn’t want to trade their young core for LEBRON JAMES. It’s funny how opinions change after a couple seasons and trades
Tim Duncan won the MVP award in 2002 and 2003 and then averaged 13 PPG in the 2004 Olympics.  Lebron James for his Olympic career averaged 11.4 PPG.  James Harden for his Olympic career averaged 5.5 PPG.  Kobe averaged 13.6 PPG in his Olympic career.

"Let me ask you a question.  LeBron was injured for roughly 20 games this season.  During that time span, if somebody asked you who’s better at basketball - LeBron James or, I don’t know, Tobias Harris, would you then say Tobias is better? After all, he was able to play those 20 games and LeBron wasn’t. By your logic, Tobias would be the better player, wouldn’t he?  &gt; Nevertheless, Embiid isn't more skilled than Jokic. He is more athletic, sure, but Jokic is all skills and IQ.  Athleticism counts towards being a better basketball player."

I dont wanna be that guy but Dicaprio would probably live such a different life from 99.999% of reddit. more importantly he's probably the LeBron James of attracting women. now how you deal with such a life with such power is not my concern since ill never be like that but as long as he fights grizzly bears he can deal with the worst of em. the breast of em.

LeBron James career average is 34%. I think Doncic is doing just fine
"Google translate:  With a changed body and eating habits, an extra measure of self-confidence and, above all, a winding orchestra of Texas, Luka Doncic is laying the groundwork for his second NBA season in which he wants to make the playoffs, and basketball analysts see him as an all-star team in his second attempt .  In the eyes of US media networks CBS and ESPN, Luka Doncic is a central contender for the All-Star Baptism. Not only because of the serious knock on the door of the All Star match, where he received as many as 4.2 million votes in the World Vote (only Lebron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo received more votes), but he was eventually greeted by the voices of journalists and actors. The future of the Mavericks will more than obviously build on Doncic, which is the main reason analysts see him on the floor on Feb. 16 in Chicago with the biggest stars in American basketball.  His trainer Rick Carlisle also provided a sort of summer vacation for Luka: “This summer is crucial for Doncic. He was the rookie of the year, so everyone will prove even more by standing on the opposite side. I expect him to play even more and carry a heavier burden. But in order for him to succeed, he must come into life form. It has to work. We will play on team preparations. No physical fitness is built there. He has to do the main job on his own. ”The 20-year-old Ljubljana man seems to have listened to him well.   According to the first information coming from Texas before the official start of Dallas preparations, the Slovenian national team made it clear that he had not surrendered in the summer. In addition to photos from pools and beaches, others testify to a physical change. He is expected to lose almost ten pounds while adjusting his eating habits. All in order to be so much more vital and faster in the second season, while being defensively responsive. “I believe I'm faster. Defense will be better, too, ”I can make progress in every way. Better throws, better passes, more rebounds, ”promises Dallas No. 77.  Doncic is the first Slovenian basketball player in the NBA, who was personally unavailable to the Slovenian media after the season and his return home. He has now made his impression in an interview with the club's official website. “I can't wait to meet all my teammates again. I look forward to the new Dallas jersey games, ”says Luke, who also makes a big deal out of a tandem with Kristaps Porzingis. ""I know he's well prepared. Together we will be very dangerous. We are young and eager to play. We have a lot of teammates to help us. However, Dirk Nowitzki will certainly help with the advice, ”confirms Doncic, who last year, despite a series of Dallas defeats, could look forward to a better future for the club. the playoffs will have to break through to clubs such as the LA Lakers, Denver Nuggets, GS Warriors, Potrland, San Antonio, LA Clippers, etc. “Everybody can beat it. Every match is tough. If you win one game, you win the next one, from match to match, ”adds Luke, who is aware that the Western Conference is stronger and wilder by the shade.  He and his teammates will officially open the season on October 24th. Before that, Doncic and his family are waiting for five prep games against the Detroit, Milwaukee, LA Clippers and twice against Oklahoma."
"The man may have been very good at some point in his career, but he hasn't been serious about anything for many years, If anyone can influence him, it's LeBron James, so we'll see how this experiment works out."
72 LeBron James
And the illegal defense changes would make him alter his offense a little bit. He can’t iso all alone on one side of the court anymore. He’d probably rack up more assists and play a James Harden-LeBron hybrid style.
"Ignores how the game has changed and ignores efficiency. LeBron's rookie year was pre-hand check rule, the past 3 years rebounds and assists have risen league-wide, the increase in threes by ten-fold increases the volume of points, etc.  Also, same logic &gt; players with 800 games to avg 13.5 points, 5.9 rebs, 1.4 stls, 49% fg, 30% 3pt  &gt; Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Thaddeus Young  http://imgur.com/gallery/0HVbTFQ"
"Yea we should follow the Lakers plan on things, the team that missed the playoffs with LeBron James"
"&gt;why don't we hold it against MJ for quitting 3 times  Because whether you agree or not, the narrative is he didnt ""quit"".  You see, if MJ didnt 3peat or never won a title before the 1st retirement then the narrative would be that he quit. But he 3peated.  He dominated. So when he took it off, the narrative was that this dude was so dominant that he got bored of dominating the league so he wanted to play baseball.  The 2nd retirement, he just missed basketball and wanted to run it back.  &gt;We can't say he has the ultimate killer instinct and is the standard that we hold players to then let him off the hook for quitting.  No one cares if you have the killer instinct off the court.  What matters is when he was on the court, he absolutely did have that killer instinct.    &gt;Also, MJ and the Bulls were down in series before and they didn't come back and win.  Right........and Bron never went undefeated in the Finals...each player did something that the other havent. What we can measure, like I said, is that when both players were favorites - MJ won 100% of the time, Bron didnt.   I highly recommend giving this a look:  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8qj44z/oc_michael_jordan_vs_lebron_james_an_analysis/  And this:  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-should-lebrons-finals-record-hurt-his-legacy/  &gt;We can measure a player’s Finals record versus expectation by using FiveThirtyEight’s Elo ratings (which measure a team’s relative quality at any given moment) to calculate his teams’ pre-series odds of winning the Finals. Add up those probabilities over an entire career, and you get the number of titles we’d expect a player to have won, adjusted for who he played and how good his own team was. If you add up the pre-series odds in the table above, you get an expected championship count of 2.8 for James — meaning he’s somehow running 0.2 titles above expectation, despite his record. That trails Jordan (who won 1.9 times more than we’d expect from the pre-series odds)  And you argue that Bron's longevity is a plus for him which is true to an extent but it could also hurt him:  Michael Jordan’s first 667 games, (Pre-Retirement) 84-93  3 Rings (6 career total)  3 NBA MVPs (5 career total)  3 Finals MVPs (6 career total)  7 scoring titles (10 career total)  3 steals titles  Defensive player of the year  Lebron James Career (1143 games)  3 Rings  4 NBA MVPs  3 Finals MVPs  1 scoring title  You can take the titles away, even just indivdual records, MJ achieved more in a less amount of time"
"I think point guard is weaker than center. Not a single starter level point guard, in a guard centric league.  Rondo and Cook can't defend. Caruso, for all the memes, still has to take an extra couple of steps forward.  LBJ and Rondo can run an offense and create. AD might do a bit, too but that's overusing/overburdening him.  With Bradley etc providing defense on point guards, it *might* be enough to patch over and cover the holes. [But those holes exist](https://www.forumblueandgold.com/2019/07/09/lakers-roster-bigs-playmakers-shot-creators-anthony-davis-lebron-james-demarcus-cousins/); *the guards and wings are all finishers, not creators*  Javale did well on offense last season in a run and gun offense pushed by Luke and with Zo running transition friendly PG and youngsters on the wing. With old LBJ t P , Vogel's offense and almost all youngsters gone, and a more likely half court centric offense among the starter's Javale will not fit as well. But he might do better with the faster second group; provided that somebody (hint: Dwight) is good enough to beat him out to start at center."
TDIL that usatoday has a whole section/newsletter dedicated to lebron james
"Yeah so, not only are you talking out of your ass, you have no understanding of metrics you are using.   So let’s dissect this one by one:   &gt; I'm not talking about playmakers necessarily, I'm talking about dudes who can dribble the ball enough to attack a closeout. pretty simple stuff. no one other than Caruso can do this on the Lakers, KCP sometimes can but he can also get really erratic.  No, once again. When you have two high impact offensive player, you can run the offense through them. There is really no data for any Lebron lead teams that shows the necessity in slashers. If anything once again, when you have AD and Bron, great shooters are more than enough.   &gt; needing shooters is not an excuse for signing bad players who can't do anything else. a bad player who can shoot is still a bad player. the same LeBron James won all 3 of his rings when he had a star guard next to him.  Lebron James won three rings because he had shooters every where and a rim runner. Every single championship was built like that.   Wade wasn’t a shooter, but he was most certainly not a guy you move your defense away from, so it inherently doesn’t matter since the spacing would still be great.   &gt; Rajon Rondo was the 11th worst PG in the league last year by RPM.  &gt; Quinn Cook was the 9th worst.  &gt;Avery Bradley was the 10th worst SG.  &gt; Javale was the 7th worst C.  This is exact definition of you talking out of your ass.   Rapm is an impact stat for how a team impacts his OWN team.   For instance, Quinn cook is a back up PG for the most impactful player in the game, no flying shit his impact metric is terrible.   This is exactly why people need to understand the stat they are using:   NONE OF THOSE PLAYERS ARE GOING TO PLAY THE ROLES THAT THEY PLAYED LAST SEASON.   Using RAPM stats for players who completely changed roles are completely useless. And you see this fucking every where when a player changes teams.   Example: This was why Steve Nash was seen purely a good second option with Dallas in terms of rapm, but as soon as he leaves, he becomes an offensive powerhouse as a first option.          &gt; does this really look like a roster put together by a GM who did a ""perfect job"" to you?  Please just shut up lol"
"&gt;Literally because Lakers don’t need a playmaker.

"Literally because Lakers don’t need a playmaker.   You can easily run the offense with AD without Lebron, and vice versus.   They were expecting Cousins to be the main shot creator off the bench. But he was injured, what can you do about that?   Rondo can absolutely provide some minutes coming off the bench as well.  LeBron James cannot lead an efficient offense without having shooters in every position to space the floor. Every data sample with Lebron and non shooters lead to mediocre offensive rating.   Last season, Lebron lead Lakers were only 110 offensive team, precisely because they didn’t have great shooters.   Lebron with Danny Green, Kuz, And AD provides one of the best spacing in the league. They also added Quinn cook to provide floor spacing.   CLEARLY, the Lakers knew they need to space the floor for Bron, and they did EXACTLY that.  Edit; KCP is also a decent shooter and Bradley is still a good player off the bench. Outside the superstars like Kawhi, this was the best you can do. Javale is also a terrific role player as well."
"I feel like he won't be same old Dwight. I know he says this every time but I think he'll stick to it this time or he'll be gone instantly and he knows it. With Nash he probably felt like he was the star of the team since he was in his prime and Nash was way older, and so was Kobe. Now he's an older guy on a  vet min and known to be cancerous and he's playing with LeBron James who's still one of the best players in the league. I feel like he knows he's on the shortest leash yet and if not it's no skin off the lakers teeth since his contract is nothing"
Which should be the mindset of every offense of every sports team that doesnt include people like Lebron James. Which is odd because you go to the rec center and you would think that no basketball coaches ever teach these kids this.
"because some bullshit ass pop up video ad on mobile :  A pair of photoshopped images of Los Angeles Lakers guard, Alex Caruso, went viral on social media last week. The pictures illustrated an extremely jacked up Caruso putting in what appeared to be Arnold Schwarzenegger type work in the weight room. The photos, which were fake, seem to have since potentially prompted a random drug test according to Caruso.  On Tuesday, Alex shared on his Instagram story an image that included what appeared to be an official letter requiring him to submit to a random drug test. The caption on his story read, “Last Week: Photoshopped weight room pic of me surfaces on social media. This Week: Random offseason drug test.”  The photoshopped images of Caruso that initially went viral are below.  LeBron James recently took to Twitter to express his excitement about playing with Caruso during this upcoming season. The 24-year-old guard out of Texas A&amp;M appeared in 25 games for the Lakers last season while averaging 9.2 points and 3.1 assists in 21.2 minutes per night. As a rookie, he also appeared in 37 games for Los Angeles and has made 11 combined starts over his two years as a professional.  With the departure of Lonzo Ball, Caruso has an opportunity to earn a spot in the rotation this year alongside Rajon Rondo at the lead guard spot. While he only attempted 50 3-pointers in 25 games a year ago, Caruso’s ability to make good on 24 of those attempts from distance (48%) is certainly encouraging. With defenses around the NBA keying on LeBron and Anthony Davis, there will be open looks available throughout the year for players like Caruso. If he can knock them down consistently and not turn the ball over, he could end up logging some considerable minutes."

"For example, LeBron James"
I'd take that bet 100/100 times. You really think anyone playing on the same team as Lebron James could win MVP?
"It kinda seems vague.  &gt;The company seeks protection for use of the phrase in a host of forums, including “downloadable audio/visual works,” podcasts, social media, online marketing and “entertainment services.”  &gt; “The filing was to protect the company from potential lawsuits should we decide to pursue any ideas, nothing of which is in development,” a spokesman for Mr. James said this week on (taco) Tuesday. “It has nothing to do with stopping others from using the term.”  That last part is what I don't get. Does that mean he will have no ability to stop others from using the term? Or is he saying he doesn't intend to do that, and everyone should just trust him.  The whole thing is interesting to me cause it reminds us that though he's LeBron, this guy we all feel like is cool and silly and we know as a person...he's also this mega millionaire who is trying to ass as much power and influence as possible.   We all love these players, but a lot of us have different opinions about billionaires in general."

"What the hell is this garbage?   No shit a player's production decrease when he joins fucking Michael Jordan.   Every high volume player lowers the volume of role players, a great player raises the efficiency of those guys with it.   His efficiency shot sky high from 1996-1998, and was the highest of his entire career by a significant margin.   What are you complaining about?   If you are somehow suggesting Lebron James raises his teammates level more than fucking MJ, you are HILARIOUSLY wrong.  Edit:   Oh yes, Steve Kerr/BJ are great examples of MJ's great help despite their numbers plummeting in samples without MJ."
That's disingenuous. If he got the help he wanted he would get James Harden and Kevin Durant. He was trashed in 2017 for asking for a playmaker and receiving a washed up Deron Williams. 'How much help does he need'. Meanwhile the Warriors had just added Kd and people were mad at Lebron for trying to even it up.
"To me LeBron and Steph are a cut above the rest of the players of this generation.  LeBron has been a freak since year 1 but Steph’s peak is extremely potent as well.  I think LeBron is pretty solid rn but if Steph were to win another chip or two and LeBron did not, there would be some questions to ask.  I think another MVP would help Steph’s case as a way to remind people that he’s been on a ridiculous tear since 2014, and contrary to the popular narrative, he has been the #1 or #2 player since then.  It’s very strange, but people love to hate man.  Tons of people are saying LeBron is washed now while seemingly ignoring his still great numbers, but then talk all box score, saying Steph doesn’t average a thirty point triple double therefore he’s worse than James freaking Harden.  It’s a joke.  You ask every GM in the league who they’d want for 1 season, no further strings attached, and it’s LeBron and Steph, maybe Giannis or KD.  Anyone else would just be stupid."
"You know that Ballmer is paying Adam Silver and Woj both, right.   It's just a conspiracy set in place by the reverse vampires and the mole people to stop Lebron James and the Lakers.   It's so obvious."
"I was just using the Lakers and LeBron as an example since that's what everyone is talking about here, but it could be any team or player. Like people picking apart everything James Harden or KD says or does just cause they hate him, etc. But you definitely are fooling yourself if you don't think there's some people who base their opinions about things specifically because they hate the Lakers. You might not be one of them, but they're definitely out there.  &gt; it's the Laker fans on this sub that have been altering the narrative by criticizing Paul George for his actions against OKC  I don't think it's just them. I think Thunder fans were also kinda upset by that. There's a lot of Laker fans, Thunder fans, Spurs fans and Raptor fans who weren't thrilled by what Kawhi and PG did, just as there's a lot of people who hate the Lakers or Thunder or Spurs or Raptors who were very happy about it.   It's just annoying when people try to use extremely flimsy reasons as some kind of justification for why they hate something. Just be honest and say you hate it and that informs how you feel about anything having to do with it, rather than trying to reverse engineer it like you were totally neutral on it up until this point. It's bullshit."

"I hate that saying, that a player makes others around him better.  Barkley once said about that, that Magic got to make All Stars Kareem, James Worthy and Byron Scott better.  Larry Bird got to make All Stars Kevin McHale,  Robert Parrish and Cedric Maxwell better.  Barkley got to make Scotty Brooks, Hersey Hawkins and Mike Gminsky better.  Some players are blessed to have All Stars as teammates to "" make better"".  Others do not.  Blame management for not surrounding franchise players with quality complementary talent....not the franchise player.  People say that same thing about Lebron.  Bit when with the Lakers last season, without any other All Stars his team missed the playoffs.   Making Lonzo, Ingram  and Kuzma better isn't as easy as making Wade, Bosh, Love and Irving, I guess."
"Just cause PG always gets destroyed by LeBron James or Joe Ingles in the playoffs doesn’t mean he is no where near as good as AD. He was top 3 in MVP and DPOY voting despite getting injured at the end of the season. He’s a better defender than Kawhi at this point and doesn’t like getting heavily load managed. Honestly, people underrate him too much."
"I feel like you could make a case for Bird, Duncan, or Russell. Bird, while all-time great, played with so many great players that it's hard to imagine Barry couldn't have had a similar impact in Bird's place. In fact, their numbers are quite similar to it wouldn't be much of a stretch to switch those two. Duncan also benefited from great teams that Barry never had, so that is a close one. Russell is the ultimate benefactor of team success but I wouldn't necessarily discount him that way.  For reference, my top 10 players are:  1. Wilt Chamberlain 2. Michael Jordan 3. Oscar Robertson 4. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 5. LeBron James 6. Hakeem Olajuwon 7.  Shaquille O'Neal 8. Magic Johnson 9. Jerry West 10. Rick Barry  With respect to Kobe and Bird, you could swap them for West and Barry if you want and it's close enough to be perfectly understand. It just isn't definitive and I do believe West and Barry are better. You could possibly swap Russell and Duncan as well but I would not."
"lebron james is the goat, it’s that simple."
"""Everybody crushed LeBron James for needing help.""  oh no!!!! think of lebron!!!! think of the children!!!!!!!!!!"
"I don’t know why you are interpreting my comments as he won’t ever get injured. I’m simply stating that this is the biggest rest period he’s had in the past decade, No 16+ extra games extending three months past the season, mental stress and even more body wear and tear. So as someone’s who’s watched Lebron diligently every season since he went to Miami it’s pretty far fetched to look at this upcoming season and doomy and gloomy, being scared that Father Time is coming.  This is Lebron James we’re talking about. But apparently you just don’t understand"
It would’ve been documented because it’s LeBron James.   AD was the one that forced his way to play with LeBron. LeBron didn’t have to lure him like Kawhi did with PG.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever.

Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"They romanticize the periods where they were the biggest sport on the planet.

Nope the next year it increased to a ridiculous .35! More than lebron James at.334 oddly enough who took 42% of his shots at the rim as opposed to  Curry who took 18% at the rim!   This most recent season Curry ftr dropped to .214 an awfully large difference that I can't really explain..... But he did take career low shotd near the rim to so that may have played some factor

You are worried about 4th quarter minutes when you have Lebron James and Anthony Davis on your team? Come on man.
"Let's say they're all top ten (which is true). Championships aside, is the debate really James is better than Kobe because he's been the best player on every team he's played for? Kobe is a basketball God; LeBron is, too. Jefferson can say whatever he wants but we all know that this entire debate could go on forever. There are too many factors for each player. 5-3 is more even than we think. Kobe had help in the form of the best big man to ever play the game. I get it...I didn't see the others play. But I did see him. All 7+ft of him. That beast was an animal on the court. And they racked up titles. I feel so bad for LeBron. He DESERVED a title that first time around with Cleveland. He had to leave the state, form a trio and then play pretend on every flop call. But I digress...let's just ask Wade. But I'll ask this: you're team captain so who are you picking first?"

Lebron James
Lebron James
"See, what you said for Kareem is exactly what happened to Lebron in 2011. The Heat had a balanced scoring offense and Lebron played his role as the second option. But the narratives are the complete opposite even though Mark Cuban went on First Take and said Lebron didn't do anything wrong in the 2011 finals and actually made the right plays.  If you dig further into that playoffs, you'll learn that Wade and James were switching roles every series. In the ECF James was the leading scorer averaging 26 points per game and Wade was averaging 18. They switched roles for the finals, and Wade averaged 26 and Lebron 18. They were a few baskets away from winning that series too, but they lost, and Lebron is the one to blame because of his lesser stats."
"[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HuqMsViHw) SB Nation video about the NBA players to reach 1,000 points before the age of 20 actually changed my entire view on the situation. To me, MJ has always been the greatest, but I thought Lebron was starting to make a case and that we'll see what happens after his career.    The entire video is fantastic and deserves a full watch, but Lebron receives first mention at 6:35 and is basically the discussion through the rest of the video. Lebron James is not the greatest basketball player of all time because he is the youngest to 1,000 points.   Lebron James is the greatest basketball player of all time because he - and *only* he - is the youngest to reach 1,000 points, and to 5,000 points, and to 10,000, and 15,000, and 20,000, and 25,000, AND 30,000 points. Lebron James is, *in a purely objective sense*, the greatest basketball player of all time."
"Lebron James is someone who physically  dominates someone who would physically dominate someone who would physically dominate you.  Like, James Johnson is one of the biggest, strongest and athletic mofos on the planet and watching Lebron just body him and have him bounce off him like a child .... just goes to show you that hes a God amongst men."
"he doesnt need a 3pt shot, but he need a perimeter shot, he absolutely needs a mid-range one if hes the superstar wing player on a championship team. lebron james at least had an average shot when he won all his championships. he had a midrange to compliment his slashing. as did  kawhi, kd, etc."
Somewhere between Anthony Bennett and LeBron James
I mean lebron has literally played with James Jones
"81 points in a game means jack shit, it just means, as always that Kobe was just being Kobe taking all the shots, it's like people having an orgasm on his 60 point game to end his career, wow he scored 60 points on 50 shots, just shows how ridiculously inefficient he was. He's a better 1 on 1 defender, not overall. Yes he made some ridiculous shots that he never should have taken in the first place, but he also missed a shit ton more of those ill advised shots. He only stayed on the Lakers because Buss REFUSED HIS TRADE DEMAND. I agree the West was better top to bottom more or less. I'm not sure what you mean by a better arsenal? But Lebron can play all 5 positions effectively on the floor, he's a better and more efficient scorer, passer and rebounder. I'm 34 and I'm from LA, I'm a fan of Kobe. But he's not better than Lebron James. Also dont forget, Lebron is still playing at very high level, so it isnt fair to compare them yet as one is still relevant to the game. But if he retired today, he's still better."

"Nike’s Jordan Brand generated $3.14 billion in revenue for the 12 months ending in May. The tally is up 10% and a record for the brand. MJ’s cut is an estimated $130 million, four times that of LeBron James, the No. 2 sneaker deal earner in basketball, with $32 million.   Jordan is worth $1.9 billion dollars. LeBron has a looooong way to go...."
"Shaq was 7’1” and 330 pounds. There is no one in the history of the NBA that could defend Shaq in the post....the only person with a chance was Wilt Chamberlain.   I remember him getting swept. I also remember LeBron averaged 22/7/6.8 in his first Finals.   Shaq also got swept in his first Finals. But he put up 28/12.5/6.3 and 2.5 blocks against Hakeem Olajuwon, who won the MVP that year.   I’ll say this one more time. Shaq was the best player in the NBA in his prime. He was the most unstoppable player in NBA history in the post. LeBron James playing along side him would have deferred to Shaq. I don’t care what LeBron did driving to the basket. He wasn’t on the level Shaq was.   [Not sure if you watched Shaq. Watch](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HK7yF9F_l64)"
I'm sorry but what does that have to do with overall greatness?  How does Kobe temporarily having a better team mate than him relate to LeBron James at all? It seems like a totally unrelated conclusion...
"I understand what’s being said perfectly fine. The argument is Kobe is not better than LeBron based on winning 5 rings to LeBron’s 3. Kobe was the second best player on 3 of those 5 titles and therefore is less responsible for those 3 title wins than Shaq. LeBron also never had a teammate remotely close to Shaq in terms of ability or dominance. LeBron was always the best player and never had the luxury of playing with someone like Shaq.   I’m rejecting that premise. While it’s true that Shaq was more of a factor in winning those titles than Kobe, Kobe was a huge factor in winning those titles none the less. He earned those titles. He can claim 5 titles without being the Alpha Dog. Just like Scottie Pippen can claim his 6 titles even though Michael Jordan was by far the best player.   I’d argue Shaq doesn’t win any of those titles without Kobe Bryant. Just like I’d argue Jordan didn’t win 6 rings without Pippen.   LeBron James is a Top 3 player ever. He’s not as dominant as Prime Shaq, but he’s a better player than Shaq. The fact that LeBron only has 3 titles to Kobe’s 5 titles isn’t the fault of Kobe Bryant being Shaq’s teammate.   And it’s not the fault of LeBron not having the supporting cast to win more titles. LeBron is an All Time great. He he had secondary star power and he had a good supporting cast. Kobe benefitted from Shaq. But he earned his 5 rings. LeBron benefitted from having Wade, Bosh, Love, Irving and good supporting casts. He earned his 3 rings."
"You’re high. No. One. Could. Stop. Shaq. No one. You’re arguing stats about Prime LeBron James. We aren’t talking that. If LeBron James played with Shaq at the same ages that Kobe did, the offense would have deferred to Shaq as the first option. No debate. LeBron’s job would have been give the Ball to Shaq first, score second. If he were paired with Luc Longley instead, LeBron would have been the first option on offense. But, not with Prime Shaq. Not during the early 2000’s...."
"Because their entire core was injured and traded....   Are you sure you want to keep talking about this?   Of course that team wasn’t going to be successful, it was team built for Lebron James.   If the engine of a car is gone, it doesn’t work well right?"
Lebron James had played with more All-NBA players than anyone in NBA history
"In multiple ways Lebron and AD is a no brainer, they complemente each other way easier. For Russ and James, we need to see it cause it aint that easy, but could work for sure"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It’s obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it’s there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn’t watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn’t watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here’s the thing: basketball isn’t played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up “true          shooting percentage” or “win shares” I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe’s game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He’s the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn’t think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe’s five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you’re a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don’t know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there’s nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn’t even a top 100 player ever.  So don’t go spouting bullshit about players you didn’t watch. Talk about your “greats” like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?  I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns."
And the 2007-2010 Cavs had LeBron James. The Bucks did not get stronger this off-season
"Chuck owns it though. He'd be the first person to say he gave two shits about watching certain games. He is a national treasure and has laid down some of the funniest lines ever. When The Heatles were playing San Antonio and Chuck was walking around with a Home Depot bucket asking people to donate to his San Antonio air conditioning fund. He said it was because,  ""All them big ol' women in San Antonio done sucked all the air out of the stadium and almost killed LeBron James"""

"All-NBA isn't everything. Also worth noting that VC had injuries early on in his career. Since media values games played he lost out for 2 years he could've made All-NBA 3rd team and that's ignoring his Nets years where he got snubbed at least once.  By the time he was healthy again at the end of his Raptors era/beginning of his Nets years, there was a new crop of players (2003 class) and the media are always looking for the next new thing to hype up and promote (in this case LeBron, Melo and DWade) and quickly forget the past. It's a what have you done lately mindset. You see this every year with, which NEW player should win MVP this season?  VC was still putting up great stats but the media is also inconsistent with their voting. Do they value the best 3 players for each position in the entire league based on stats? Or do the teams with the best records automatically get a representative? (usually the best player on the team but not necessarily an objective top 15 player in the league in terms of talent)  For instance, Demarcus Cousins was named to All-NBA despite never making the playoffs (before last season) yet there's James Harden missing out in 2015-2016 being on a playoff team. Kyrie is praised as one of the game's best players and even viewed as a top 10 player during his Cavs years. But yet, he's only made All-NBA 3rd Team. Never mind Ray Allen has same amount of All-NBA teams as VC. I guess they're overrated too?   &gt;Even though he was the third best player on the Thunder, I'd count those WCF appearances (and NBA Finals appearance) as well, because VC was third best player on that Magic team.  It shouldn't. VC was past his prime at Orlando Magic and Harden was just a 6th man. Their accomplishments to reach Conference Finals aren't that impressive by applying context into it. Scottie Pippen won 6 rings, but it's nowhere near as impressive compared to someone winning a title as the No.1 guy for his team."

Didn’t realise LeBron James was the bare minimum required to lead a team to a title.
"Why does his 2014 fmvp not count? He played right? He dominated at the highest level right? He earned the award right? If we randomly don’t count guy’s awards then sure we can make a lot of guys fall out of the top 10.   I just want to be clear, I’m not saying Kawhi is top 10. However, if he dominates another playoffs, wins a title, and wins fmvp in the process then I don’t think it’s too crazy to start discussing his case for top 10. He did all of this in an era of a debatable GOAT Lebron James as well."
You really think 10 year veteran LEBRON F’N JAMES forgot that theres a million cameras on him ? The man that calculates all his moves and all his words ?
"If you are gonna consider LeBron a PG, then Nikola Jokic should be on this list.  He probably would be #3 honestly (#2 if you remove LeBron and have Curry #1).  And for the record, Jokic averaged MORE ASSISTS PER GAME than Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard, and Kemba Walker last year.  But James Harden, who you are also missing, is more of a PG than Kemba Walker, Kyrie Irving, etc.  He actually played most of his minutes at PG rather than SG but because of CP3, no one considers him a PG (even though Harden brought the ball up and facilitaed the offense more times than CP3)."

"Doc Rivers smiled as he sipped on a diet soda Monday night near a golf course in Los Angeles.  “I have my first official dinner with Paul George and Kawhi Leonard tonight,” he said, still giddy that the Clippers were able to land two of the best players in the NBA over the summer.  Before Rivers left to meet his newest stars, he spoke to a small group of people brought together by the Westcoast Sports Associates, a nonprofit organization dedicated to giving economically disadvantaged children in Southern California the opportunity to participate in sports.  As guests enjoyed cocktails, the Clippers coach laughed and said he was done drinking for a while after watching his daughter, Callie, get married to Dallas Mavericks guard Seth Curry last weekend in Malibu.  “It was very expensive,” he said. “I have to be the first coach to ever throw a wedding for an NBA player. Like, I don’t get that. I don’t think I should have paid. I really don’t. But it was fantastic.”  INGLEWOOD, CALIF. -- TUESDAY, JUNE 12, 2018: A view of the vacant land and site of the proposed Cli CLIPPERS Clippers propose committing about $100 million in benefits to Inglewood as part of arena deal Sep. 10, 2019 Rivers has had plenty to celebrate in the last couple of months after landing Leonard and George, making the Clippers one of the favorites to win the NBA championship this season. It was a haul that was a year in the making, with the Clippers not-so-discreetly trying to get the attention of Leonard last season while he was playing for the Toronto Raptors. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer; Lawrence Frank, president of basketball operations; and other team representatives occasionally made appearances in the crowd for games at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto.  “I got a lot of credit, and so did Jerry West, but the guy that was the hero in all this was Lawrence Frank,” Rivers said. “He did all the work. He had Steve Ballmer going to Raptors games and he went to some, too. We were warned that no more Clippers players, coaches or employees could go to games in Toronto. We were sending guys to go sit in the stands.  “There was nothing wrong with what we were doing, but Steve Ballmer sitting courtside in Toronto seemed a little strange. But we didn’t say a word. We just wanted [Leonard] to know we were there and we were interested.”  The Clippers had been optimistic about their chances to land Leonard, but when the Raptors won the NBA championship and the Lakers traded for Anthony Davis, pairing him with LeBron James, and then opened up a third max-salary slot, there was a feeling the Moreno Valley native could sign elsewhere.  Play Video Kawhi Leonard and Paul George aren’t thinking about the Lakers. “The Clippers have been better,” says Leonard. “Lakers is Lakers,” says George. “We got our own identity. We’re chasing something else.” “We had a meeting with Kawhi at my house in Malibu and we felt we had the inside position,” Rivers said. “The Lakers had a meeting with Kawhi and they built this whole thing up for him to come to their new practice facility and he said, ‘No, you can come to my hotel room.’ But with us he said, ‘Yes, I’ll come to your house.’ When we heard that it felt like he was telling us he wants to come here.”  As much as Rivers coveted Leonard — the coach was fined $50,000 for saying on ESPN, “Kawhi is the most like Jordan we’ve seen” — he didn’t know much about him. That first meeting at Rivers’ home was their first conversation.  “I actually tried to speak to him last season a couple times as he was walking by and you get nothing out of him. Nothing,” Rivers said. “He comes into this meeting and he shakes our hands and he’s talking. We were prepared for a meeting where we would have to drag things out of him. Instead, he’s the one talking and finally he tells us exactly what the deal is.  “He said, ‘I want to play for you,’ and he pointed at me. He said, ‘Mr. Ballmer, I love the things you do and what you stand for, but your team is not good enough and if you don’t change your team, I’m not coming.’ ”  It was a franchise-altering case of good news and bad news: Leonard wanted to be a Clipper but wouldn’t make the jump unless the team was able to get him a running mate to make them championship contenders.  “We actually had a list of guys, which was a mistake, but we got lucky,” Rivers said. “We shouldn’t have had a list, because then he got to choose who he wanted to play with and the assumption was that we could get them. We didn’t know if we could get anybody. We just showed him guys that we thought would match him and when he saw Paul George’s name he said, ‘I want to play with him.’  BASKET-NBA-CLIPPERS-LEONARD-GEORGE SPORTS Woike: Team USA is ousted at FIBA World Cup. Is Kawhi Leonard somehow to blame? Sep. 11, 2019 “We showed him everybody else and he didn’t want to hear it. He just stayed on Paul George, so after the meeting we sat down and I said, ‘We got to get Paul George. I don’t know how we are going to do it, but we have to do it.’ We did know that Oklahoma City wanted to break their team up, so that helped, but we didn’t know if we could get him.”  In exchange for George, the Clippers sent Oklahoma City unprotected first-round picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026 along with Miami’s first-round picks in 2021 and 2023. They also agreed to pick swaps in 2023 and 2025 and threw in former first-round picks Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari.  “Steve Ballmer was nervous about the picks,” Rivers said. “I said, ‘Steve, you keep saying six picks for Paul George is insane, but you’re saying it wrong. It’s not six for Paul; it’s six for Paul and Kawhi. So three for each. I would do that.’ You have to look at it in those terms.”  Even with that record number of draft picks, the Thunder originally said no, which meant the Clippers were not only going to lose George but also miss out on Leonard.  Play Video Clippers owner Steve Ballmer is pumped and wants Los Angeles to be pumped, too. While seeing Leonard potentially return to Toronto would be tough, what Rivers really couldn’t stomach was the idea of Leonard signing with the Lakers. As hard as the Clippers had worked to gain respectability in the city, losing Leonard to the Lakers would likely have been a knockout blow.  “The day of the trade at 12 noon the deal was off,” Rivers said. “I was at home in Malibu and Lawrence called me and told me, ‘It looks like he’s either going to Toronto or the Lakers.’ The Lakers part just threw me over. I told him that can’t happen. … I remember I kept telling him, ‘We cannot allow that to happen!’  “I actually told Steve jokingly that if that happens, we’re moving the team to Seattle. It was a joke, but I was actually serious about it. I really believed that.”  The trade was back on at 4 p.m. before dying again at 5 p.m., and by 6 p.m. the Clippers had essentially moved on, believing they had exhausted every possible trade scenario. Rivers decided to take in the bad news by having a sunset dinner in Malibu with some friends.  “So I’m pulling into the parking lot and the phone rings andit’s Lawrence and he said, ‘Where are you?’ ” Rivers recalled. “I said, ‘I’m walking into Nobu.’ He said, ‘They have terrible reception there! Get out of there! Go somewhere with better reception. The deal is back on!’  “So I go to the side of the road on PCH and we’re going back and forth and we got the deal done. I walked back into Nobu with a whole different attitude. Our waiter was a Lakers fan and the news hadn’t broken yet but I knew. He kept telling me, ‘We’re going to get Kawhi’ and I kept saying, ‘I don’t know about that.’ ”  As great as the summer was for Rivers and the Clippers, he knows it won’t mean much if they’re not playing basketball when next summer rolls around.  “We won the summer, but we’re trying to win the season,” Rivers said. “Winning the summer is great, it allows you to win the season, but we’ve won nothing yet. Now the real work begins."

"Tbf even with Lebron the Lakers were only 28-27. I don’t think it is pure chance that Lebron’s least healthy season game at age 33-34 coming off a dozen seasons or so with playoffs. Every player regresses, it’s a matter of when not if. Lebron James has played more minutes than Vince Carter, I think it’s fair to wonder if his injury issues last year and defensive regression are a start to a slight downward trend."
"&gt; stardom Bron elevated him to.  At the same time, Kyrie was very much as important to Lebron's success in Cleveland and a big reason why Lebron decided to go back. If Kyrie isn't there and the Cavs don't land that number 1 pick, I highly doubt Lebron was going back to Cleveland to not compete.   Hell, Lebron winning the title made him a hometown legend - even moreso than his first stint - it honestly caused a 180 perception change on him on this sub for sure. People on this sub used to hate Lebron James. A lot of that credit should be given to Kyrie, but everyone always sees it as ""Kyrie needs to be thankful..."""

If the Lakers dont win in the 80s, Shaq doesnt go to the Lakers and Kobe likely doesnt either... if that doesnt happen, Lebron doesnt go either....  &amp;#x200B;  and oddly enough, it's the Cavs that made one of those idiotic trades that set the Lakers up in the 80s"

The Spurs beating the Heat in 2014 was not an upset.  The 2010s will be rememberd as the Western Conference vs Lebron James.
The Pacers have always been like that. Even after Reggie left they did the same thing with Paul George and then Victor Oladipo. Their organization and fanbase create a college like atmosphere and they practice hard defense.  Reggie averaged 17 points per game in that series against the Bulls. Hardly all-time great numbers. That is Lebron James 2011 numbers and that was considered an epic failure not a HOF performance.
Wilt Chamberlain  Bill Russell  Kareem Abdul Jabbar  Michael Jordan  Kobe Bryant  Lebron James  Tacko Fall   You tell me that sounds wrong.
"But going to the Finals year after year after year nowadays is a war of attrition, it's not just about having an easy extra 1st round en route to a title. We're talking about going to the Finals 11 times in 13 years. No teams today can realistically be expected to do that simply because the playoffs are more than double what they were back then. Before the Heatles no team had been to the Finals in 4 consecutive years since the mid 80s. Not Jordan's Bulls, nor the Shaq-Kobe Lakers. Nobody.   That shit grinds teams down nowadays, and it's not always just injuries. Teams get simply exhausted, both mentally and physically. If you read about what the reaction was from many of the Heat players once they lost to the Spurs in 2014 and LeBron left a lot of them reported relief that it was just finally over.  The league is just vastly different now, it just is. And it's not just about the kind of players who are in the league, it's the league itself that's so different, with the number of teams and the amount of playoff games. LeBron James has played 3 full seasons worth of just playoff games in his career, 239 games. Tim Duncan played 251 playoff games. Kobe Bryant played 220. Shaq played 216. Bill Russell played 165 despite going to the Finals 11 times. You can't really compare what the league was like before the NBA-ABA merger to what it's like today. It's a totally different entity."

Cause anytime the Cavs aren't great it could never be the front offices fault. The only criticism you can have about Cleveland's front office is that they did absolutely everything for LeBron James and he shunned them. This has nothing to do with LeBron? Well it's LeBron's fault because he should've never left.  How dare you imply that they might be a trash heap of an organization kept afloat by the socialist structures of the CBA?
The team with LeBron James
"I’m saying Steph doesn’t have the same ability that a 7 footer with possibly the best scoring arsenal of all time, but stop acting like he’s a deficient in creating his own shot.  He’s always been in the top decile in ISO PPP.  There are more dimensions to basketball other than scoring, the best scorer is often not the best player.    AD was top 10 in PIPM last season, one spot ahead of Harden, despite playing for the lousy Pelicans...  Steve Kerr d riding so that KD wouldn’t leave or throw a fit is not of my concern, I can form my own opinion...not to mention he made those comments when KD was playing better than anyone in the league.  ESPN’s playoff run rankings according to WARP put Steph within the top 25 so I’m not sure what you’re referring to.  His runs in which he was injured for multiple rounds are obviously not there, big shocker.    The list of current players with postseasons ranked above Steph’s best according to WARP is: LeBron James.    And there clearly is a contest between LeBron and Steph, if you consider a 3/4 for Steph contested.  Harden had a good series vs the Warriors, and Steph was off all series with the finger injury and the constant mugging by Austin “Daddy’s Little Boy” Rivers that the refs (no surprise) allowed, but he showed up when it mattered and sent your boy home.  Awkward.    Warriors second unit often played with Kevin Durant, and Quinn Cook is terrible but did not play that much as Curry’s backup save for the pst season.  Steph’s best season in terms of teammate true shooting was in 2017 when the Warriors had their best bench with David West (the bench GOAT lol)."
"[The “80 Point Club”](https://i.imgur.com/un5y3wT.png)   &gt;Since 1947, there have been only 31 confirmed cases of players hitting 80+ PRF in a game. Despite having thirty cases, there are only 20 players who have reached the 80 PRF mark. As indicated earlier, the king of PRF is James Harden, who has hit this threshhold 6 times!  &gt;The next frequent player on the list is Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook with three entries. A curious note about Westbrook is that he is the only player to hit 80 PRF in a playoff game. Only one. Ever.  &gt;If you’re keeping track, this means there are only two players remaining with two 80+ PRF games. Those two players are Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James. That’s it.  [The “80 Point Club” by squared2020](https://squared2020.com/2019/04/21/the-80-point-club/)"
" “Of course Steph cannot simply shoot over defenders, he’s only 6’3 and not an explosive player”  That’s precisely why he’s not the best player in the world. If you can’t create 15-20 quality looks for yourself and you rely on open shots and a very heavy screening scheme to get open, then you aren’t the best player in the world. No superstar in the league shoots more open shots than Steph with no defender within 4-6 feet.   “So it is by definition  an individual statistic”  PM stats don’t specify what the individual is doing on the court. For example, What Plus/Minus  data actually tells us is “Philadelphia is 3 points per 48 minutes better than the opposing lineups in stints that included Tobias Harris.” Unfortunately, we do not have an unlimited parentheses unfortunately, we do not have an unlimited amount of Trials to test out every possible lineup featuring Harris. This means that we cannot know how much of the three point differential is attributable to Harris. We also will not be able to tell us how those lineups would perform without harass against the same opponent lineups.   “Steph has been the best player in the league since he overtook LeBron in 2016”  Even Steve Kerr disagrees with you, This is simply not true and not corroborated on every level. Per Kevin Pelton’s WARP (championship over replacement rating) LeBron James has had 4 postseasons in the top 25 all time playoff runs ever (his last 4 postseasons). Steph doesn’t even have one in the top 45 the past 5 years.   There is simply no contest between LeBron and Steph.   “Harden is just not as effective as Steph”  Harden is a one man offense whose team was 1st in offensive efficiency the past 5 years. This is with no draymond green, klay thomspin (or later Kevin Durant).   Harden averaged 35 on 61 TS% against the warriors while Steph averaged 24 on 55 TS%.  The only difference was one team had draymond green.  Harden has been better than Curry the last 3 years and so has Durant. LeBron is on an island alone.  Your teammates TS improving doesn’t mean you’re the best player in the world. It has more to do with having the worst backup in the league by a large margin."
"It's spelled ""LeBron James"""
This is insane. 1% of the Knicks or Lakers is a lot of money. Plus why would a majority owner want to give away a piece of his team.   The only way this would work is if this is like Lebron James and you reach an agreement he has to sell all equity back if he leaves
"Again, I just told you LeBron was better due to his off-ball defense, Those types of players don’t rack up as many blocks or steals, and even then, counting stats are a horrible measurement for defensive ability. That being said, LeBron block percentage is a bit higher, with Jordan’s steal percentage being significantly higher.  Andre Drummond gets more blocks and steals per game than Draymond Green, who’s the better defender?   Even in his first Cleveland stint, LeBron was already a phenomenal defender and would regularly be one of the least foul-prone players in the league. Jordan became a good defender and was initially considered a pretty weak defender, LeBron was arguably elite by his third year in the league.   http://www.backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/  Here’s a good writeup on it, feel free to read up on the defense section."

"1. (i did an actual top) Lebron James.

Phenomenal Scorer, A not bad playmaker, and became a really great defender with time, no real weakness in game, except than he actually injured, and we can say he's not loyal too lol. 3. Kawhi Leonard, Definition of an Elite defender, and he probably as good defender as he is in scoring. weakness is probably his playmaking, if he was an as good playmaker as Lebron he would without any doubt be the number 1 today.  4. Stephen Curry i guess, Best shooter of all-time, bring so much spacing on the floor because of this, a really good finisher and playmaker, weakness is probably  his lack of seriousness sometime and even if he's good he's not the best defender so is often target in defense. 5.  i won't put Harden here like everyone would probably do but Anthony Davis, i think he's one of the most unstoppable player,  never really saw him got lockdown by someone, and can be MVP like he can be DPOY, weakness is probably he didn't won anything. 6. still not Harden sorry.. Giannis Antetokoumnpo, he's unstoppable inside the paint, Same he can be MVP like he can be DPOY, weakness is he still don't have a good shoot but he keep improving. 7. James Harden, best Scorer in the NBA statistically (just 36ppg..) also an incredible playmaker, weakness is even if he made some effort , he's not a good defender and also not a really nice teammate. 8. I think Joel Embiid,definition of a beast, so powerful and skilled at the same time, also a DPOY/MVP caliber, Weakness is probably the regularity and shot selections,he take a lot of 3 for someone who average 30% at 3. 9. it may be shocking people but i believe Paul George is 9th, also an Elite Defender, amazing scorer and shooter, and an not bad playmaker, weakness is without any doubt his regularity. 10. its tough i really don't know, i think Nicolas Jokic is 10th , Great player at everything, he's known for the fact than he a really good passer for a center, averaging 7 assist per games, i don't really watch him so i think the weakness point is his athleticism lol, pretty slow and almost never dunk."
"&gt; You can’t just assume he’ll win finals mvp if they won. Maybe if they won, bron plays better? See how stupid it is?   Play better for 2 games while completely stinking up the other 3?  I said Pippen overall was better since he spent his entire prime on the Bulls while Wade's window was small, but if a guy has a case over Lebron James as the FMVP on his own team, what do you think it says about the guy?  &gt; Bron had to carry those heat teams when they won.  Okay, today I learn that Lebron literally plays all 5 positions and guarded everybody on the opposing team."
"I mean it's not the metric's fault that Playoff Lebron exists and that he and the Cavs coasted through most of the regular season lol. It's even become something of a running joke on the site  &gt;It’s become a rite of spring. Every year — or at least every year since LeBron James returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers — our NBA Elo ratings are skeptical of the Cavs when the playoffs begin. And every year, LeBron and Co. have smashed our poor algorithm to bits.  &gt;In 2015, the Cavs entered the playoffs with a lukewarm 1631 Elo rating. That’s perfectly respectable, but the sort of rating you might associate with the Los Angeles Clippers or another 50-something-win team that you’d expect to lose in the second round or the conference finals. Instead, Cleveland reached the NBA Finals, losing to the Golden State Warriors in six competitive games even with a depleted roster.  &gt;In 2016, the Cavs had a similarly good-but-not-great Elo rating — 1642 — when the playoffs began. But they blew through the Eastern Conference playoffs before beating the 73-win Warriors to win the NBA title, famously overcoming a 3-1 series deficit along the way. Their Elo rating finished at 1759, ranking them among the top 25 teams of all-time and implying that the system had massively underrated them initially.  There was also [another entire article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-the-cavs-overrated-or-underrated/) on the topic which was a fun read"
"hmm the Silver stuff fits the bill, but I guess I'm more interested in reddit's criticism of the ""no comment"" players/coaches - seems so hostile coming from folks who didn't speak up any of the other countless times the NBA has worked with China.  I see a lot of ""Player X's inability to denounce China shows they only care about issues that make them money"" which feels like an effort to undermine BLM / trans rights / whatever else those players were outspoken about in the past.  It's possible to have values lol, they didn't have to stand with the other causes they supported.  I think it's everyone's responsibility to educate themselves but Reddit definitely seems to latch onto certain issues over others and then claim hypocrisy when other people have different priorities.  China is definitely fucked up and I applaud those who use their platforms to speak up and raise awareness.  I applaud those who speak up for any just cause.  Idk it kinda just seems like this sub is mad they didn't let Morey tweet  idk I'm waiting for the ""when will so-called activist LeBron James take a real stand and publicly denounce loot-boxes"" post"
Lebron James is not a superhero lmao and yet again his comments don’t just have an impact on him but several of his peers and the people he works for. People love not considering the consequences of actions
"After China cancels regular season games, Adam Silver will announce Lebron James and Steph Curry have been traded to the Beijing Ducks for Jeremy Lin in a purely basketball move"
"Wtf is LeBron James gonna do with a tweet.  Reroute the world's manufacturing?  Stop are reliance on Chinese goods?  Nobody in America can tell the Chinese to do anything and make them listen, and if you think anything different your wrong. Vote for Donald Trump he is currently doing more to stop the Chinese than anyone in the world😂😂😜. China has the second highest GDP and 1/7th of the world's population, wtf can LeBron do?"
"Hear me out. I think I'll get downvoted for admitting it but I am a Trump supporter, and I have felt personally attacked by the way NBA players and coaches have conveyed their opinions on Trump and anyone who supports him. I was definitely in the shut up and dribble camp, I thought these guys were just grandstanding... but I'm ready to forgive all if these guys show some back bone and stand up to China. One of the biggest reasons I have supported Trump is because I don't want China to be the future super power of this world and I thought Trump was the only one with the stones to stand up to them and fight back against the controlled gradual decline of our country. Everyone is on the take, politicians, corporations, and stars alike. The Chinese have SO much influence over us that we do not see...   This feels like a pivotal moment in our history. We need real leaders. Lebron James, please be more than a basketball player. Lebron James, please stand up to China. Have true courage and be on the right side of history when it matters. Right now. I won't want to hear it later when it becomes ""safe"" to criticize China."
"You have no idea what I do or have done outside of looking at my Reddit history.   LeBron James has frequently spoken about how important it is for athletes to use their cultural and economic power to speak out. Heck, the LeBron-produced 2K20 MyCareer story is all about that! It's just become pretty clear that he only means it about stuff that affects the athletes and their friends, not their fans in places like Hong Kong and Xingjiang."
This statement is finally appropriate enough to throw back at Lebron James.
"I get what you’re saying, but what are their incentives otherwise. Lebron James or any other star doesn’t want to/shouldn’t want to/can’t make the US go over and fix the real injustices happening in China like profiling or the concentration camps. So they’re doing what they’re doing now and not pushing on something that frankly very few of us understand."
"So we should go to war to stop them or what? What do you want the NBA to do about it? They do the same evil shit in South America and Africa too. Should MLB and the NBA never have partnered with them to spread the sport and league internationally? I don’t think it matters one bit one way or the other. Lebron James or Kerr saying they don’t like it either doesn’t help anything, just creates more tension."
Subreddit sensationalism at it's peak right now.  As if James Harden and Lebron James have to be global politics experts and bring peace to the country of China. Equating a political issue of a Chinese territory to the black civil rights movement is peak reddit disingenuity.

Remind me what AOC said about lebron James?

Former No 1 Pick LeBron James
"BREAKING: In order to appease the Chinese government and repair Sino-American relations, the NBA has announced that Lebron James will be representing the People’s Republic in the Olympic Games in Toyko in 2020.    China is hoping to capture their first gold medal in Men’s basketball, a prize that has eluded them to date. Even with their achievements in other Summer events like gymnastics and diving, it is no secret that China has longed to get the top honor in the American sport that has grown in popularity among their people.    The consensus among NBA analysts is that China will need more than just Lebron to win the gold, but it remains to be seen which American players will participate in 2020, making the road to gold a clear possibility for Lebron and China.  In recent international contests, marquee names have quietly dropped out from the U.S. team, citing nagging injuries, or the need to rest from a grueling NBA season.    There is also uncertainty over which other players China may demand, with Nike managing the negotiations. Asked for comment, a Nike representative said “We welcome this opportunity to allow the Chinese people to buy more Nike gear and jerseys, and at the same time show loyalty and  patriotism to their Motherland.”    Sales of the red and gold 2020 China Lebron jersey have already sold out on pre-order online."
"&gt; My man, they'd have no qualms whatsoever making him disappear if he threatened their image. And there's no extradition treaty with them either.  Yes, they do. Russians might be crazy enough to pull off something like that, but China aren't. They may be a dictatorship, but they're a highly rational one.  If an American person of such celebrity as LeBron James ""disappears"" in China, nobody is going to be talking about extradition treaties, there's going to be carrier groups heading for the Chinese coast in a matter of minutes.   China is a power to be respected, no doubt, but military speaking, the US can and will absolutely steamroll them.  &gt;For pete's sake, they banned Winnie the Pooh in the whole country because somebody made a meme where they said the leader looked like him.  I don't think any nuclear powers are likely to go to war over Winnie the Pooh. Not comparable at all."
"America ideologies are not being spread in the slightest. They share the love for a game, that’s it. This whole issue should make that very clear they have a completely different ideology than us. They are willing to back out of billions of dollars because of fear of our ideals spreading to their country. They don’t want their citizens thinking about why Lebron James is supporting HK. It terrifies them.  What also should be clear is how the unintended consequence of doing business with China under the current climate is putting our freedoms in jeopardy. Corporate America does not care about you. They only care about growth every quarter. China is the market with massive growth potential, not us. They will pick China over us every time unless we hold their feet to the fire. Washington isn’t going to fix things either. It’s on the American people to hold the powers that be accountable for their actions. They don’t do the right thing under any other circumstances. People like Lebron and Steph have already shown they have tremendous power to sway public opinion and bring light to important issues. This is a very important issue to the future of our country and the world. China doesn’t want to just be a country that makes things for cheap forever. They want to be the dominant super power in the world by 2025. They are a totalitarian communist government! They are investing billions in western companies to gain power and influence!   Staying silent only tells Chinese people that their government is right in the eyes of NBA players. They don’t have hope of spreading our values if they believe the NBA stands for theirs. The whole idea of business opening China up to western ideals in unfounded. Their ideals will stay what they are. It’s a lie being told to us so rich people can get more rich in China without having to be held accountable for overlooking their human rights violations. We should only do business with China if the terms are reasonable in the eyes of the American people. The same goes for everywhere else in the world."
"""then why would Lebron James expect a bunch of middle aged white men to help his causes?""  **answer:** i  mean, they did enslave his ancestors and the effects of that are currently why they're in the position they're in. it's not really difficult to understand.   I  understand where you're coming from, but imagine if lebron took on every societal problem facing the world and even directly facing the nba. it'd be near impossible. lebron does 10x the average person and compared to other athletes the guy's a saint."
"""Hong Kong isn't China. I'll explain later"" -Lebron James"
"Relevant section at the end:  &gt;James came right into the room, sat down, and we quickly learned with his first answer that he wasn't going to shy away from the issue.  &gt;""I didn't sign the letter right then and there so now it's blown up,"" he said. ""No one heard my side of the story, but automatically it's 'LeBron didn't sign the letter, he doesn't care.' But for me to try to create awareness of the situation that's going on in Darfur and other places, for me, in the position I am, I should speak on it and I am gonna speak on it.""  &gt;James told us he spent time over the previous year educating himself about China. He realizes that his voice is powerful and he will be heard. He has yet to sign the letter but said he will continue to speak about the conflict as the Olympics draw closer. He said he hopes the NBA Olympians will band together with a plan on how to address the situation. He spoke eloquently for 15 minutes, and insisted he didn't care about endorsements or contracts or anything but doing what he felt was right.  &gt;""At the end of the day we're talking about human rights,"" he said. ""And people should understand that human rights and people's lives are in jeopardy. We're not talking about contracts here. We're not talking about money. We're talking about people's lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract.""  &gt;James basically refuted what everybody had written and said about him a year ago. Maybe it's because he was criticized, maybe not. Maybe he would have come to these conclusions without Newble's letter.  &gt;But maybe Newble accomplished, finally, what he had set out to do. He got LeBron's attention and his support, if not his signature. And in a few months, James will be playing on the world's biggest court in front of the world's biggest audience. It remains to be seen what, or if, James will say then, but the stage has been set.  &gt;&gt;And at the very least, James showed he's no Jordan at least off the court."
"&gt;  if I were lebron or James harden  But you're not, so it's a bit odd that you'd go around preaching that they should risk what they've worked hard to earn on issues they know nothing about - and not knowing a damn thing about the issue is probably the only thing you'll ever have in common with these guys. What are you risking?"
"LEBRON JAMES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CEDI OSMAN'S MENTAL HEALTH DECLINE, HE LITERALLY GIVES HIS TEAMMATES DEPRESSION"
"As someone who makes roughly 30k a year, I’d be pretty fine holding to my morals considering if I were lebron or James harden I’d already have more money than I’d ever see in my lifetime. Guess it’s not enough"
"Read my post with an open mind. I never said ""all"" were stupid. I said that by and large they didn't pay attention in school or live the life of an average American, which, to me, cheapens their political opinions.  Also, Lebron James had no problem casting the aspersion that &gt;60 million Americans who voted for Donald Trump ""was uneducated"", but you keep defending these naturally gifted millionaires and their ignorant opinions being cast from their ivory towers."
"&gt; it will likely lead to the repeal of chinese censorship policy   You lost every ounce of credibility when you said the above statement.  Do you actually, honestly, believe that Lebron James or the NBA has enough pull to end whats going on in China?  Let's put in perspective that the US and other countries aren't even willing to get involved, yet somehow the NBA and one player bring an end to this...."
"This has been such a disappointing response from men who I grew up respecting, and who weren't afraid to voice their past political opinions in the past. In Hong Kong a group of people are fighting for for freedom and paying in blood against an oppressive government. Regardless of race, this is an issue all Americans should understand and support, and to see guys like Steve Kerr, James Harden, and Greg Popovich, Steph Curry, and most notably Lebron James censor themselves for the sake of revenue is unforgivable. These men are the face of an organization that is partened with a government that is putting people in concentration camps, and remain silent. In my opinion, to back down on this issue, or even plead ignorance is a cowardly act."
"I agree with most of your post but this  &gt; If we’re setting the precedent that it only makes sense for people to speak out agains injustices that they personally faced then why would Lebron James expect a bunch of middle aged white men to help his causes?  makes zero sense and is still not a good comparison.  It's sad that this whole ordeal seems to be mostly just making ammo for the ""shut up and play"" crowd."
There are many athletes sponsored by Nike who receive far less money from them and might stand to get harmed if someone as prominent as LeBron James spike out. Not saying he should though but it’s a consideration.
"I agree with you, but it's definitely very different in terms of a regular non-celebrity taking a standpoint about something.  And I definitely think it's a morally correct thing for someone like LeBron James to take a stand on social issues, it's an absolute madness that people are looking at him and others in a negative light, for trying to make the world a better place.  I think that says a lot about those people. Colin Kaepernick should have been a guiding light, and it's a tragedy what happened with that movement."
To be fair there’s nothing wrong with butting out of foreign affairs you don’t have to have an opinion especially if you’re uneducated on the matter.   I don’t think particularly James or Westbrook ever spoke up about domestic affairs either that was Lebron.  The nba is saying to it’s players if you want to speak out you can.  I don’t blame them for not answering this question in China or Japan or wherever They are at the moment.  Let’s not paint the nba with a broad stroke some players will be outspoken some won’t.
This would be so amazing and terrible all the same time! I can't imagine how the world would respond as China holds LeBron James hostage...  would Trump just be like... &gt; Forget LeBron! He doesn't come to hang out with me the White House.  &gt;If it were A$AP Rocky though
"If they just say something of substance, that would be fine no? Seeing a non-answer like the statements Marco Rubio gives out every day would annoy me for sure. It certainly has to be better than Steve Kerr’s response.   All the criticisms to the players and coaches are 100% valid. But I wouldn’t expect Lebron James to start listing human right watch statistics. But I agree. They need to say something. Silence...is the wrong way to go."
I haven't watched an NBA game since LeBron James left for the Miami Heat... I was so turned off by it that it made me sick to watch a game... this is just reinforcing that point.
Exactly. LeBron could be going on CNN and talking about this issue but he will remain silent because it will cost him money to speak out. LeBron James only cares about LeBron James.
"If we’re setting the precedent that it only makes sense for people to speak out agains injustices that they personally faced then why would Lebron James expect a bunch of middle aged white men to help his causes?   Basically Lebrons fight was that he’s more than just an athlete and should be allowed to use his platform to help people. Whelp. This is the biggest possible opportunity for him to do that. And he’s crickets.  Could you imagine if Lebron came out today and said, “I don’t agree with the Chinese Govt”  It would raise SO MUCH awareness to this. And he wouldn’t lose his job. The only reason he doesn’t do it is because he’s lose some money. And “some money” is more important than human rights to him."

"Isn't it possible that his sorry was more along the lines of ""I'm sorry that y'all got upset""?  Also, James Harden is a great player but he's a basketball player at the end of the day. I don't think he had his off the cuff remarks vetted by anyone.  However you take the ""apology"", he still followed up his comments stating he's with Adam Silver on this issue. That's alot more than any other star in the NBA has said. Curry, Lebron, Durant have all stayed silent on this issue."
Now is the time for people with clout and plenty of F-U money like LeBron James to take a moral stand.
cause they are not same type of players. Not everyone is James type of player. There is not many James type of player. Many say it is Lebron James but they are straight lying. The real thing is James Jones. Without him that pleb Lebron wouldnt have rings
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible.."
Thats not lebron James what the fuck lmao
"And neither of those players are Lebron James. Also I'm sure there are stipulations about testing positive for PEDs. that would be a protection the company has. But good luck using one of those as a reason to breka contract because someone used freedom of speach. They're an american based company, and are subject to American laws."
"Well I think they could but they are choosing not too because Russ and Harden themselves would lose money. Like if harden wanted to he could've just went off and been like yo fuck China. But he wants his money. I don't even care about most players like James being silent on this cuz they have never really been vocal about stuff. But LeBron, pop and Kerr do look really bad in my opinion"
"You seem to mean well. So I’m going to leave this alone.. federal law requires you be 21 to buy a firearm I was qualifying I’m not a child.  But most people commenting on these post are just raging racist conservative just getting some payback at liberal Americans. So Yes, I’m going to stick up for black Americans that care about speaking out about American black issues or American politics. Most of these same people hate when Blacks or Anyone speak up about American injustice. But now of course they want them to speak...   I can care about what’s going on with People in Hong Kong. I can certainly feel empathy as well. But if I have limited time for boots on the ground activism it’s only going to be for African American cause.(I expect the same for LGBT groups &amp; Feminist groups) Im saddened when I think about slavery in Sudan or How bad Saudi human rights are. But you can’t fight every battle. MLK if he wasn’t killed by these whites that cared so much about him. Would still be focusing on black issues. I doubt he’d be putting the majority of his energy towards China.  The majority of white people don’t care about black people. It has been shown time &amp; time again. They may have some sympathy. But most are not willing to but time &amp; money towards African American causes. In fact I’d argue Most actually hate thinking about the fact that blacks still protest.. “It’s not the 60’s anymore / Just get over it”  So if me focusing on The black struggle that I see family &amp; friends consistently deal with takes precedent over international human rights issues. Im fine with being called a hypocrite. And I will continue to stand up for the lebron James &amp; Steph curry’s who probably see the world very similarly to me."
"Celebrity worship culture has warped public opinion lol, actors and athletes don’t know any more than anyone else and using their platform to attempt to sway people to their side, while not illegal or immoral, is pretty fucking weird when seriously considered.  That said, pretty much every recognizable pundit is compromised and spouting whatever views their corporate ownership demands of them, so it’s not like LeBron James is any less credible than Maddow or Hannity...damn America is fucked lol."
"Everyone's dancing around the central point with deflections and non-answers.   It's not a ""there's two sides to this story"" issue - China is pushing the puppet leaders they chose for Hong Kong to pass laws allowing China to extradite Chinese government critics and put them in concentration camps like those they have for the Uighurs, against whom they are committing ethnic genocide. Then China is using their economic power to censor anyone who wants to do business in China from telling the truth about the situation.  It's pretty chilling, but from a practical standpoint, it's not like Steph Curry or LeBron James coming out and saying ""China sucks! Support Hong Kong!"" is going to do anything but damage their own brand in China. It probably won't bring about any real change in HK tbh."
"Why would anyone care what they have to say at this point? They’ve proven that while they don’t like to be told to shut and dribble, they will fold quickly when their bottom line is affected in any way, coaches included, and do just that.  Suddenly everyone in the NBA has no opinion of substance to share. Especially the fakest SJW of all that has been exposed by his silence: LeBron James."
Even the Chinese government wants to see LeBron James.
"SHANGHAI — The Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets tipped off on Thursday night in Shanghai in, undoubtedly, the most geopolitically important exhibition game in N.B.A. history. Yezi Zhang, a college student, was there, too, and her emotions were decidedly mixed.  Ms. Zhang, a 24-year-old from the city of Hangzhou, was among a few thousand Chinese fans who showed up at the Mercedes-Benz Arena despite the N.B.A.’s clash with the Chinese government. Beijing officials have put growing pressure on the N.B.A. to apologize after an executive at the Houston Rockets tweeted his support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The N.B.A., citing free speech, has said the executive won’t be punished.  If the league doesn’t fully apologize, Ms. Zhang said, then she and the league might be over.  “At first I was quite happy about the game, but then after the recent issue I started feeling quite awkward,” she said, adding that she dare not post images of the game online for fear of disapproval from friends.  “It’s O.K. to chase the star players,” she said, “but we shouldn’t do it at the cost of the dignity of the motherland.”  The game on Thursday could represent the beginning of a thaw between the league and a country that accounts for a huge number of its fans. Patriotic vitriol against the N.B.A. appeared to subside online in China late on Thursday before the game began. Still, it was not clear how long it might take for China and the N.B.A. to fully resume their decades-long embrace.  Basketball once united China and the United States, the world’s two largest economies, offering perhaps the most visual symbol of bonds so deeply intertwined that some big thinkers have referred to the two as “Chimerica.” Now it threatens to drive them apart.  Image Mr. James, center, in a gray T-shirt, leaving his hotel for an N.B.A. game in Shanghai on Thursday.

An American backlash prompted Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, to defend the right of the league’s athletes and officials to say what they like.  HONG KONG’S PROTESTSHow the demands of demonstrators have broadened. Chinese companies are now suspending their sponsorships. The Chinese state media is blocking exhibition games. And China’s millions of N.B.A. fans are caught in the middle.  Severing that bond — built over decades of cultivation by an American sports league that long ago saw promise in a growing, prosperous China — won’t be easy. But if pushed, many fans said, they will sever it for the sake of loyalty.  “This year I think the Lakers have a good chance to win it all,” said Lin Wenwen, a 21-year-old student and longtime Lakers fan who was crushed by the cancellation of the team’s open practice on Wednesday because she could not afford a ticket to the game. “This was a great chance to see them. It’s a shame.”  Still, when asked who was to blame, she thought for a moment and said, “The young losers in Hong Kong.”  The game on Thursday kicked off in an arena where plenty of seats still stood empty. The usually prolific array of advertisements were absent from the stands and rafters. People outside the arena waved small Chinese flags. On one popular basketball forum, funds were being raised Thursday to buy 10,000 national flags to bring to the game.  Many Chinese N.B.A. fans said the choice was an easy one. Support for the protesters in Hong Kong, they say, constitutes foreign meddling in Chinese affairs. Thanks in part to China’s propaganda arms, many also mistakenly believe the pro-democracy protesters are broadly calling for full independence from the mainland. (Some are, but independence is not among their official demands.) Many see that as a direct assault on Chinese identity.  Mr. Mao, a 23-year-old law student, is such a big fan that he spent hours on Wednesday in front of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Shanghai, hoping to meet LeBron James at a fan event. He also plans to fly about 900 miles to the city of Shenzhen on Saturday for a Lakers-Nets exhibition rematch.  But he equated support for the Hong Kong protesters with racism, echoing a common point in the state media, and said that patriotism comes before fandom. He questioned the difference between the N.B.A.’s support of free speech and the lifetime ban the league put on Donald Sterling, the former owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, in 2014 for his racist comments.  Image Fans waiting outside the Shanghai hotel where the Los Angeles Lakers players were staying. Fans waiting outside the Shanghai hotel where the Los Angeles Lakers players were staying.CreditHector Retamal/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images “It’s a double standard,” said Mr. Mao, adding that “the issue of sovereignty is as serious as the issue of racism.”  Basketball’s roots in China go way back. Christian missionaries introduced the game in the late 19th century. Mao tolerated it when other Western entertainments were discouraged. In 1979, after Mao’s death led to China’s opening up to the world, the Washington Bullets became the first N.B.A. team to play in China when they came to Beijing for a pair of friendly games with the Chinese Army.  The N.B.A. sensed an opening. In 1985, the Chinese national team toured the United States at the invitation of the N.B.A. commissioner David Stern for what later became known as the N.B.A.-China Friendship Tour. Then in 1990, the league struck its first big revenue sharing deal with China Central Television, China’s state broadcaster, to air N.B.A. games in China — just in time for Michael Jordan’s first championship run with the Chicago Bulls.  A love affair was born, making the N.B.A. one of the first American brands to win a following across China. A generation of Chinese fans grew up crowding around dusty desktop monitors in college dorm rooms to watch fuzzy streams of N.B.A. games. When Yao Ming was drafted by the Rockets in 2002, it seemed to many in China like the completion, not the beginning, of their hoop dreams.  N.B.A. stars suddenly won millions of new followers — and sometimes awkward nicknames. LeBron James was “The Little Emperor.” Michael Jordan was the “Gang Boss.” Shaquille O’Neal, the hulking 7-foot-1 center, was “The Giant Shark,” though the historian Nick Kapur noted he became “O’Fat” after he began to put on the pounds.  Rong Qiang, 40, cut school to watch N.B.A. games in the 1980s and remains loyal to Mr. Jordan and the Bulls. “Their moves were just unbelievable,” he recalled nostalgically.  Mr. Rong was one of the few shoppers perusing the normally bustling flagship N.B.A. store in Beijing’s central shopping district, the league’s largest outside North America. Idle workers adjusted displays of jerseys, shoes and memorabilia. At one entrance, life-size bobbleheads of Stephen Curry and Kobe Bryant clutching Chinese flags greeted would-be shoppers.  Despite his decades-long love of the league, Mr. Rong, a clothing merchandiser, said he was prepared to withdraw his support. He was hopeful that the fervor would eventually die down, as it did after previous flare-ups between China and Japan.  Still, he said, China seemed to be in a new era in which nationalistic sentiment had become the norm.  “Everyone is feeling very patriotic,” he said.  “And we still have the C.B.A.,” he added, referring to the Chinese Basketball Association. “Though of course they’re not as good.”  Some N.B.A. fans said the game would still find love in China.  “A complete ban would never work,” said Liu Zhe, a 29-year-old Kobe Bryant superfan who himself goes by the name Kobe. A resident of the northeastern city of Harbin, he made headlines last year when he unknowingly bought the former Lakers star’s stolen high school jersey. (He later returned it.) “If they can’t hold the games in China, fans can still travel abroad and jump over the Great Firewall to watch them.”  On Thursday afternoon, Wu Shengjie, 22, came with a group of friends to play at the outdoor basketball courts in Dongdan in the heart of Beijing, China’s rough equivalent to New York’s Rucker Park.  Image The N.B.A. flagship retail store in Beijing on Wednesday.  The N.B.A. flagship retail store in Beijing on Wednesday. CreditKevin Frayer/Getty Images Chinese hip-hop blared over loudspeakers. Giant Nike posters of Yi Jianlian, a former N.B.A. player who now plays in China, loomed over the courts.  “They really hurt the hearts of the Chinese people,” Mr. Wu said dejectedly as he watched from the sidelines while his friends played a pickup game.  “The incident happened so suddenly, I can’t understand it,” said Mr. Wu, an electrical engineering major who has been playing basketball since the age of 7. “Now, my heart is very lost.”"
"Bill's podcast with Jason Gay was pretty interesting. Gay kinda held his feet to the fire now and then when Bill was waffling back and forth. My favorite part was when bill hand waved the idea of Lebron speaking out, saying ""Is lebron james really our best political thinker? Is his take really the take we need for this?"" Twenty second later, after Gay reminds him how powerful it was when Lebron called trump a bum, bill can't help himself and gets absolutely giddy and goes ""oh man, that was awesome!"""
I mean you have these two guys called Lebron James and Anthony Davis you could watch.
"A lot of people don't know what Freedom of Speech means.  It means that the GOVERNMENT can't fine or throw you in jail for your speech.  However, businesses can do whatever they want such as fire you or block you from entering their store.  So NBA teams have every right to deny you into the arena because they are a business.  However, I find it to be extremely hypocritical for the NBA to allow Lebron James to write DIVERSITY on his shoes but not allow a fan to raise a sign that says FREE HK."
"I honestly *did* legit forget about Dwight Howard.  They were like ""Dwight Howard"" oh riiiight...""AD""...dayum...""Lebron James!""  Shiiiiit."
*Chicks dig the long ball*  – LeBron James Sr.
Chinese : we will boycott NBA. we will not back down.         LeBron in       Chinese : JAMES JAMES JAMES AHHHHH WOWWWWW YEAHHHHH
Lebron James and Chris Webber have identical college stats/ numbers.
LeBron James isnt real.
Kawhi Leonard is superior to Lebron James 🥴
Make the playoffs before you talk shit. Yall couldnt even make the playoffs with Lebron fucking James.
" Just like this podcaster said. https://youtu.be/_CNqqAPBfXI We  now learned people Lebron James, Kerr are fake. They can criticize Trump and won't shutup about it. You have wonder if China pays them to talk shit about US and Trump."
"What does Lebron James stating the obvious going to help? Steph/Lebron aren’t saying anything negative about Morey so how is saying, “ he’s right about the obvious “ gonna help them? Stop looking at these athletes like they are hero’s, they are regular people who play ball and they help when they can which we should be appreciative, they can’t help the issues in China and thinking they can is foolish."
"Zion is the greatest player of all time he's better than Michael Jackson, LeBron James and Babe Ruth combined."
&gt;Players were allowed to wear I cant breath shirts...... Kyrie Irving has entered the chat (*ahead of LeBron James btw) like way before!
"They should ask LeBrob.  Reporter: “Mr James, what’s your thoughts on Trump after he criticized Steve Kerr?”  LeBron: “He’s a bum.”"
This is LeBron James. He'd make one call to Nike and ask to borrow some of their sweatshop workers for the day.
"Steve Nash, Sam Jones, LeBron James, Bill Russell, Wilt C."

Lebron James and Anthony Davis play for my team.   Who is your star? Oh yes the dude who lost to France
"&gt;Lebron James can Absolutely change things here in America, but not in a place that can literally erase him from all social media outlets.   he doesn't need to directly change things in China.  by affecting how America spends its money and America's public opinion, he can exert some degrees of financial pressure.  &amp;#x200B;  if everyone did that, we could change things.    &amp;#x200B;  YOU need to look at the bigger picture.  Lebron's clout in this comes from the fact that he can influence spending habits of both corporations and consumers.  that matters.  it doesn't matter if Chinese people know he exists or not, because his power comes from influencing international money.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm not asking him to do this in china either."
"You’re missing my point. When they talk about domestic issues like black lives or gun violence, they do so because 1. Most of them understand those topics easier since it either involved them or is them because they are black. When Lebron James speaks on topics that he can possibly influence then it makes sense for him to do so.   They can use their platform to help make changes or draw light to those issues. International politics and speaking on a dictatorship in another country won’t influence or change anything in their country because of their censorship and the fact that they would just cancel/erase anything he’s involved in or the NBA. So from his prospective why would he speak out against a dictatorship when it won’t improve their situation at all? Yes he can say he stands with Hong Kong or dictatorship is bad, obviously, but none of that will fix any issues there so why are people crucifying athletes for not being international politicians or quitting their jobs to fight alongside the protesters.   Everyone here just wants more headlines and radical actions to be taken but since when was the NBA supposed to fight these international issues when we have our own issues domestically that they do actively involve themselves in and actually contribute unlike most online sjw. The only reason the NBA was brought into these issues is because Morey spoke his truth, which is obviously right but China’s issues have been going on for longer than that. So now all of a sudden it’s the nba’s fight and if an athlete doesn’t speak up then they are a Chinese puppet.   We as the people are the real hypocrites because we want some basketball players to fight our fight and speak for us, when we have a voice just as they do. We’re the hypocrites for crucifying these players when we won’t get off our own asses and do something.  The president of our own country blasted Steve Kerr for being a basketball coach when he should be the one speaking and not bowing down like everyone else."
"&gt; there’s nothing the everyday person can do about this situation besides sit back and laugh. Unless you have a god given talent for inciting civil protests and public speaking like MLK or Malcolm X, or you have a large public forum willing to listen to you like LeBron James, you can’t do shit.   putting aside the laughter part, this sort of complacency sucks and is part of the problem"
So you're waiting for an NBA player to be responsible for makkng the NBA and Chinas already crumbling relationship completely irrepairable.  Why does that responsibility lie with Steph Curry or Lebron James who're mearly doing their job and not the owners and executives who actually create their buisness with China?  Wish reddit would stop be just SO naive at the entire situation. You all seem so very brave from your keyboards.
"yeah so Josh Hart, Trevor Ariza &amp; Spencer Dinwiddie are better than Klay Thompson since they have a better BPM right? &amp; i’m sure those stats don’t take into account that fact that he played with Lebron James last season &amp; a terrible shooting team. that definitely had negative impact on his numbers because of how badly there games did not mesh with each other. BI isn’t a spot up shooter &amp; needs the ball to be most effective i.e. his second season where he showed the most growth as a player, even playing well at PG that season when Zo got hurt. guys only 21 &amp; the lakers player development staff has to be one of the worst in the league at this point. he hasn’t been forcing it for 3 seasons dude, he forced it maybe last year because he was essentially on a try out for the team that drafted him, give it a break these young players need some time &amp; decent situation. BI &amp; Zo definitely didn’t get that LA, and their growth probably stunted to some extent."
"Lol the list isnt in order tf, i dont think anybody has tony parker over lebron james."
"Lebron James can Absolutely change things here in America, but not in a place that can literally erase him from all social media outlets. If he speaks up WHILE he is there, he can put his life in danger as he’s still in their country plus they already cut off the Rockets who was their most supported team, so no he can’t make a difference in a dictatorship that would just erase his existence from any outlet. Y’all have to look at the bigger picture and not just the headlines and think “ oh Lebron James called our own president a bum so he can do it to theirs too!”"
"This needs to be higher up. I think this is the case as well.  Everyone is mentioning Lebron James speaking power, buy nobody is mentioning he is *in* China.  Let homeboy come back to the US before speaking out against the CCP."
"Look I understand what the dude is trying to say, but he needs to face reality that there’s nothing the everyday person can do about this situation besides sit back and laugh. Unless you have a god given talent for inciting civil protests and public speaking like MLK or Malcolm X, or you have a large public forum willing to listen to you like LeBron James, you can’t do shit. I mean sure you can talk to your senator or whatever, but considering the fact something like 90% of all elections in the US are won by the side who spends more money on their campaign, then you need to realize almost nobody in the government gives a shit about their constituents, they only care about the corporations who got them elected. And I can assure you the corporations who got them elected are certainly on the side of keep China placated and happy rather than protest them. So why not just laugh? Isn’t that our right when it comes to freedom of speech to be able to make fun of them and laugh? Isn’t that one thing that separates us from China?"
"Just Anthony Bennet? You don't see former No 1. pick Lebron James, right?"
"LaMarcus Aldridge, Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Steph Curry, LeBron James"
"They suspended a contract, albeit a big one, which is slightly less aggressive than kidnapping LeBron fucking James"
"&gt;Anyone projecting Golden State to miss the playoffs needs to rethink that take. Arguably they still have the league’s best offensive player (Steph Curry) and the league’s best defensive player (Draymond Green).  &gt;Don’t sleep on this team if it gets off to a sluggish start. Once the Warriors land a buyout guy or two and [Klay] Thompson (hopefully) comes back, they could emerge as a postseason terror once again, despite a middling playoff seed.  &gt;With LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Lakers have an awesome foundation, and unlike last summer they actually imported some decent help in free agency.  &gt;L.A.’s superstar combo assures a playoff spot, but to advance deeper requires more work. This roster still has considerable shortcomings, and recent front office decisions don’t inspire confidence that they’ll be fixed."
"&gt;How is Lebron James or Steph Curry gonna change anything in China by stating the obvious?   its that exact attitude that hinders change.  &amp;#x200B;  Someone with LeBron's profile DOES add a little bit of pressure.  &amp;#x200B;  its cumulative, it all counts."
"&gt;Players are going to comment on issues that effect black Americans because they are, by and large, black Americans.  I imagine you've heard the poem ""First they came"". If that's too vague in the off-chance you haven't heard of it, this is it:   &gt;First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—      Because I was not a socialist.  &gt;Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—      Because I was not a trade unionist.  &gt;Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—      Because I was not a Jew.  &gt;Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.  Now obviously China isn't going to invade the country and come for specific groups one by one. But the point of the poem is that people watched as injustice occurred because ""it doesn't have to do with me"". There were people of other races involved in the Civil Rights movement when that happened. There are people of other races involved in BLM. It's almost like it isn't a ""well *I'm* not black/living in HK/etc"" issue, it's a *human* issue.   Imagine someone saying ""I don't care for BLM because I'm not black and don't know anything about it to comment"". Someone's response would be ""What is there to know? Do you agree that black people shouldn't be murdered by police or not?"". You'd be labeled a racist for saying you don't care.   You make a fair argument that obviously they're going to comment on issues that have more to do with them. But that's also how injustice to persecuted groups is able to continue to occur. Where would the Civil Rights Movement be if the only people who participated in it, were people affected by it? If everyone else just said ""eh I don't care, it doesn't have to do with me"".   Also to be fair, it *is* hard to sympathize with players worried about losing money when they're already set for life. Plus, LeBron James isn't going to be fired by the NBA for speaking out for democracy and human rights. So speaking out wouldn't even lose him his current lifestyle, much less his entire livelihood. Yeah, regular Joes are probably hypocrites because they have nothing to lose so speaking out is easy. But that doesn't also make it okay that a guy making millions upon millions is worried about losing a few for speaking in support of a colleague that got thrown under the bus because he voiced his support for people being shot and killed by a government operating concentration camps and committing genocide.   Finally, would LeBron James alone speaking out against what's happening in HK have any impact? No. But it's something. And he sure as hell has a **lot** more influence than the regular Joes with nothing to lose who speak out against it. If he doesn't speak out, fine. But he definitely can't be labeled or label himself as ""pro human rights"" when it's more like ""pro my rights""."
But let’s keep asking political dynamo Lebron James about political issues...
"Yes, Lebron James not playing a preseason game is gonna change sooo much"
"China does not have freedom of the press, everything there is heavily censored and filtered through propaganda. Maybe that’s what you don’t understand. This is a geopolitical entanglement with a sovereign economic power. It isn’t the same as speaking on a domestic issue where everyone can go write a letter to their local congressman. They don’t give a shit, they’ll just remove Lebron’s shoes from their stores and keep it moving.  “US and most of Europe should issue real sanctions” is Lebron a politician? Because that sounds like something for the government to deal with not Lebron James. He should tell Congress to issue sanctions against China right, because no one has thought of that before?"
"Adam Silver yelled, ""We support free speech!"" Daryl Morey gave a look of pleasant surprise. Xi Jinping belted, ""We got a fucking conflict now."" And before Lebron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Yao Ming looked on with inner turmoil and said, ""I am extremely hot."
"People on here want nba players to start wearing free Hong Kong shirts apparently. Like these aren’t politicians they are basketball players that grew up and became famous for basketball. Sure, they speak on topics that are domestic because they can possibly change things her in America. How is Lebron James or Steph Curry gonna change anything in China by stating the obvious? When they speak on NCAA or black lives it’s because it’s a topic that they have spent literally years or all their lives thinking about.   Curry saying something is like Lebron calling trump a bum. Yes woohoo! An athlete insulted a public politician! But what did that bring, how did Lebron speaking on Trump impact our domestic situation any? Everyone online are speaking their mind and stating what we all know and believe, but y’all are doing it ONLINE and behind an account, yet none of y’all are doing anything else but saying the same things we all know. Steph Curry saying I support Hong Kong or suddenly becoming an international politician literally wouldn’t impact their situation positively AT ALL, it would absolutely negatively impact the NBA and his team. I don’t know why y’all expect these ball players that have their jerseys hung up in strip clubs to become well-informed international politician or American HEROS. These guys are basketball players and are getting crucified by AMERICANS for not speaking on international issues when they will donate more money than anyone on these sites to domestic issues. The real hypocrites are everyone here criticizing Athletes for being Athletes."
"And there is Lebron ""Mr.Nike"" James?"
"You’re talking like Lebron is just some random rich guy . He is essentially a corporation unto himself. There are hundreds, probably thousands of people who go home to their families and put food on their table as a result of Lebron James.  When you’re in his position every word that you say can have unintended consequences. Someone like Lebron , Harden havr to be very careful about the people who depend on them for a living and not unnecessarily putting them in harms way.  If Lebron knew for a fact that him speaking up will save lives , I believe he would have done it. But this is a very complex situation bc the Chinese gov’t and media doesn’t work how it does in the US. Him saying something could easily backfire in unintended ways. This is why I believe players should wait until Adam Silver gives them a briefing and then they can release a joint united statement."
"Bullshit. The Pacers shouldn't have even had the ball on that possession as it was wrongly called out of bounds on Cleveland.  &gt;The NBA said LeBron James' block in the closing seconds of Game 5 on Indiana's Victor Oladipo should have been called goaltending.  &gt;The NBA's report also said the Pacers were incorrectly awarded the ball on a play with 27.6 seconds left. The ball went off Indiana's Thaddeus Young and went out of bounds, but the referees gave the ball to Indiana.    https://www.nba.com/article/2018/04/26/nba-says-referees-missed-lebron-james-goaltending-call-game-5"
"&gt;Lebron James has faced the same amount of all nba **1st and all nba 2nd team players**  IT played 2 of the 4 games in the 2017 series but fair enough.  &gt;For comparison, the 2010 celtics faced 4 first team all nba players and a 3rd team in just 2010 alone  No, they faced Lebron, Wade, and Howard. That's 3 first team all-nba players."

It’s also kinda perfect in a r/fakehistoryporn way.  (2019) LeBron James ignores the pleas of thousands of Chinese prisoners to collect his PayPal payment from Nike and the Chinese government
"But that's what a forward is.   There are 3 positions: Guard, Forward, and C.   Then there are modifiers: ""point"" ""3 and D"" ""Stretch"" etc  LeBron James is much more like Paul George than he is Damian Lillard or Steph curry, even if he passes.   Here's a better question: if LeBron James isn't a point forward, then what does that term even mean? Who *is* a point forward?"
"Just because you handle the ball, doesn't make you a guard though.   I'm not arguing their role on offense is so different. I'm saying LeBron James isn't a guard.  I don't think that's really anything arguable either. He's objectively a forward. That's why he's a point forward. You're a forward that plays the point role"
"Idk if I’d want to play on my dads team. Granted, my own father is probably whatever the opposite of Lebron James is. But still"
"Hes making score, he’s dishing dime But blazing trail ain’t Lillard time A year of nothing, a year must sting Pass on the super-max, just for a ring? Money talks but so does the fame and so does winning games ‘I’m going to L.A, to play with LeBron James!’"
By their new mouthpiece Lebron James.  First the China bullshit and now LBJ is shadely criticizing other players. What happened to prioritizing social justice and player's rights????  10/10 sellout
"exactly, cleveland fans just want that man home.  they won their championship all they wanna see now is watch lebron james play in a cavs jersey chip or not"
They have a single reliable wing defender in a conference with LeBron James and Kawhi/George.  Find another one of those. Preferably one who isn't an offensive zero.
"hey! we’ve sucked for a couple years but we have *not* been the laughingstock of the league - i’m looking directly at you, wizards.  i’d also like the ECF but let the kids play it out! let’s see how the squad pulls together over the year. the cavs are not lebron and the james gang anymore so expectations shouldn’t be the same from jump - the young guards, sexton garland and porter jr, are good but not *that* good"
"My name is LeBron Raymone James, Commander of the Armies of the Lakers, General of the Nike Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Xi Jinping. Father to many murdered sons, husband to a Taco Tuesday™️ hating wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next."
Very sad he's gone the LeBron James route of projection and saying that people are ignorant and misinformed when he's the only who is completely batshit foolish.    Watching that vid of him parroting CCP propaganda seriously just gave my brain cancer.
Lebron James literally signed the Hong Kong hangover and instituted one country two systems after committing two Tienimens

"Definitely think people are underestimating the ceiling Dallas has. Porzingus is coming off a full season where he didn’t play. He hasn’t fully adjusted yet and is clearly not producing at his best. Our bench is starting to come together with us getting spark plugs like Jj Barea coming off the bench.   Luka is literally playing like he is European LeBron James as well. Not exaggerating, not trying to boost, but he is literally playing like he is a less athletic LBJ clone but it’s super effective. He alone will be more than enough to take us to like a 7th or 8th seed. We are lining up nicely and I fully expect us to finish around 4th or 5th seed after working out a few kinks in closing out and consistency. We tend to play to our opponents level which is a problem of itself, but that can be taken care of with our coaching."
"Yes I did and I lived through it. That was one of the many narratives that finals originated. Also it did help that KD was pretty much unanimously regarded as the only one on the Thunder that showed up   [Article giving LeBron James his props and calling out OKC youth written by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/22/miami-heat-oklahoma-city-thunder-five)   I'm not saying it was the only narrative in place. I'm just saying as there were people claiming LeBron was finally crowned, there were many others hating because he beat the Thunder who underperformed (as you said the Thunder entered the series as favourites). Also refereeing was a thing IIRC"
LeBron James
LeBron James hasn't looked the same in the last two games. Ironically against two fast paced team. The guy is looking tired.   I'm not saying he's washed but maybe they should consider limiting his minutes to keep him fresh. Dude played big minutes.
Trea young = LeBron James conformed
This Lebron James fella might be pretty good someday if he works on his free throws!
This Lebron James fella might be pretty good someday if he works on his free throws!
Lmao a redditor questioning Lebron fucking James
"Lebron ""King of Free Haircuts"" James"
"Why must you complain about that? You have LeBron Fucking James on your team, man..."
Lebron james
"No it's not a dumb argument. The average NBA height is 6'7, let's put Tako at 6'10, above the NBA avg height, he still wouldn't make it in the league because he doesn't any elite basketball skills. Handling, court vision, passing, shooting, driving, nothing.  Compare him to someone like Kevin Durant, who is also 6'10, and it would be a total joke to even compare the two.   idk why u bring up lebron james, that guy is like the epitome of a skilled basketball player, u could cut a few inches off of him and he would still be a great player, maybe not as dominant as he is currently due to his size but still NBA caliber. Tako fall would be a COMPLETE JOKE of an NBA player if you took away his ability to just tower over everyone."
I want to be that little white boy that hands out towels to AD and Lebron James.

"I said the last 30 mvp years. What do you think is the modern era?  2018-19 Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks (Voting) 2017-18 James Harden, Houston Rockets (Voting) 2016-17 Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder (Voting) 2015-16 Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors (Voting) 2014-15 Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 2013-14 Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City Thunder 2012-13 LeBron James, Miami Heat 2011-12 LeBron James, Miami Heat 2010-11 Derrick Rose, Chicago Bulls 2009-10 LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2008-09 LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2007-08 Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers 2006-07 Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks 2005-06 Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2004-05 Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2003-04 Kevin Garnett, Minnesota Timberwolves 2002-03 Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2001-02 Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2000-01 Allen Iverson, Philadelphia 76ers 1999-00 Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles Lakers 1998-99 Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1997-98 Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1996-97 Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1995-96 Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1994-95 David Robinson, San Antonio Spurs 1993-94 Hakeem Olajuwon, Houston Rockets 1992-93 Charles Barkley, Phoenix Suns 1991-92 Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1990-91 Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls   This is the modern era 90s and beyond. There are only 4 unique back to back MVP winners in the entire span of 30 years, which is once again the modern era. Steph Curry, Steve Nash, Tim Duncan, and Lebron James. if you count MJ who already had multiple MVPs in the 80s as a unique mvp back to back winner than at best you're talking 5 people who have done it in the modern era. That is an extremely uncommon individual feat.   Individual back to back winners are extremely uncommon."
LeBron James is 1 Championship away from singlehandedly having as many Larry O'Brien as the entire Boston Celtics organization.
"I don't mind resting a few games, especially as they get older, but if a players are in good health, they should be on the court. They get paid millions of dollars to play a game, and fans pay money to see their favorite players. James Harden doesn't take time off. Beal played 82 games last year, Drummond 79, Vucevic 80, Aldridge 81. Towns, Jokic and Westbrook play. Curry played almost every game during the Warriors run. There are exceptions (Rose, AD) but no excuse for someone like LeBron to sit 10-15 games."
"Yeah I will feel free to not give full credit when LeBron James joins your team because he and Bosh hooked up w Dwade at the Olympics and they wanted to play together, so you scrambled up a team to put around them...  Conference 5th seed the year before?  The Raptors won't have a chance at Giannis if they're a 5th seed unless. They will need to be ""Obvious contenders that just need a lift from a star"" to have a hope at hooking him.  Go back to their championship w Shaq, and *that* was a ""Teambuilding"" ring.  Spo found a way to succeed with... Lebron, Wade, Bosh, and a decent supporting cast."
But can get finally defeat LeBron James in a single game of basketball??
Fuck LeBron James.
LeBron James has never been on the Hornets
"Of the last 21 unique mvp winners, only 4 unique players have experienced back to back seasons. Giannis odds of experiencing a back to back season as someone who has never done it before are 4/21 or 19.04%.   Because Lebron James And Michael Jordan both boast multiple back to back mvps that means yes the league has had plenty of back to back seasons but very few individual players who actually experienced a back to back."
"Well technically with Draymond, Thompson, dlo, curry, and Eric ""literally LeBron James"" paschall we're gonna have 5 all stars next year"
Lebron James exists
that lebron james guy too
Kemba Walker is LeBron James.
Kemba Lalker has never beaten Lebron James
Is Lebron 6'9 250 born to Gloria James?
"If it wasn't Lebron Ramon James we are talking about here, I'd swear that trading your young players away because your superstar wants to play with proven veterans, pretty much condemns you to hit the bottom of the barrell as soon as said superstar leaves.  But that clearly can't be the case"
LeBron Ramon James starts promoting tacos and Popeyes chicken sandwich related murders start to skyrocket... COINCIDENCE?!
LeBron James also had 6 more assists.
LeBron James is a Chinese boot locker. Need I say more? Oh that’s right who owns ESPN? Disney! What’s Disney’s biggest market? China! Need we say more?
&gt;LeBron said everyone rooting against him would have to wake up the next day with their plebeian lives/problems and tomorrow he'd wake up as LeBron James.  He was technically right. I did not wake up as LeBron the next day and he did.
"Don't forget the part after the '11 Finals where LeBron said everyone rooting against him would have to wake up the next day with their plebeian lives/problems and tomorrow he'd wake up as LeBron James. After his 8 point meltdown and this quote, his public image was at an all-time low."
"Lol you're point is not even slightly made dude. It's hilarious that you actually can't comprehend basic facts. I don't know how many more ways to try to simplify math for you. The odds of Giannis having a back-to-back MVP season this year are exactly precisely 4/25. Not extremely common. Now can he be a Lebron or an MJ and beat the odds? Sure. Is it extremely common to do so? No.   Let me break this down for you with the actual list from your timeframe since you can't seem to comprehend basic math or facts.   2018-19     Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks (Voting) 2017-18     James Harden, Houston Rockets (Voting) 2016-17     Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder (Voting) 2015-16     Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors (Voting) 2014-15     Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 2013-14     Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City Thunder 2012-13     LeBron James, Miami Heat 2011-12     LeBron James, Miami Heat 2010-11     Derrick Rose, Chicago Bulls 2009-10     LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2008-09     LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2007-08     Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers 2006-07     Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks 2005-06     Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2004-05     Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2003-04     Kevin Garnett, Minnesota Timberwolves 2002-03     Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2001-02     Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2000-01     Allen Iverson, Philadelphia 76ers 1999-00     Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles Lakers 1998-99     Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1997-98     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1996-97     Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1995-96     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1994-95     David Robinson, San Antonio Spurs 1993-94     Hakeem Olajuwon, Houston Rockets 1992-93     Charles Barkley, Phoenix Suns 1991-92     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1990-91     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls   As you can see, outside of MJ and Lebron James the only players to experience b2bs are: Tim Duncan, Steph Curry, and Steve Nash.  The top 2 players of all time won 8/30 of the last 30 MVP seasons. Even including them, one unique person per decade gets to experience this feat. The 2010s already had theirs in Steph Curry, it'd be a statistical outlier for it to happen again this year. It's an extremely uncommon feat.   Nothing about what you are saying jives with the actual data which shows a host of MVP seasons dominated by MJ and Lebron with one other person per decade pulling in a b2b which already happened."
And of those 14 how many were unique players? Bruh you've got to learn how to contextualize stats. Go watch youtube thinking basketball if you need an intro into this stuff. Lebron James and MJ had multiple multiple back to backs while Bird had his 3 peat. The number of unique players who win mvp and experience a back-to-back are staggeringly low. The stat is skewed by the fact the two greatest players of all time are in this era and are considered all time greats partially for that reason. That is not a common occurance. if you're saying the odds of Giannis becoming a top 5 all time player is high and so it's not unlikely for him that's a fine argument but arguing it's extremely common for the average MVP winner is not a tenable argument that would be completely ignoring the dominance of MJ and LBJ.
"Yes you finally did the math correctly. 10/34 is not ""extremely common"" and if you do the stats for the modern era (where MJ and Lebron James own almost all of the back-to-bacl 'real estate') the odds are even worse."
"you just made the argument that 6/11MVPS have been back-to-backs but 4/6 of those were the same exact player, Lebron James. Proving it is extremely uncommon for a unique MVP player to experience a back-to-back. Delete your account."
Another way of stating that is that only one player outside of Lebron James has had a back-to-back MVP season.
"Those stats are skewed heavily by the top 5 players of all time having multiple back-to-backs and 3peats. Michael Jordan, Wilt, Kareem, Lebron James, and Larry Bird skew those stats heavily. If you look at *unique* mvp winners odds of having a back-to-back MVP they were 10/64 all time and 3 or 4/25 in the modern era depending on what you count as modern. That is how much LBJ and MJ dominated those stats. Tim Duncan and Steph are the only other two to do it. It's not ""extremely common"""
"Imagine being presented with cold-hard facts and continuing to be a stick in the mud. Here is the list of all the back-to-back MVP's in the league: https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/02/22/stephen-curry-lebron-james-michael-jordan-magic-johnson-wilt-chamberlain/80604040/  Anyone with a brain can see this is one of the most uncommon occurances in the NBA. I see no source for your stat the above is what has actually happened and maybe MJ has skewed something but I assure you only 10 guys have done it out of 100000s of players. If you think it's ""extremely common"" you are truly the kind of person who never changes their mind about anything and only has preconcieved notions based on homerism assumptions that have nothing to do with reality."
"[According to ESPN](https://theundefeated.com/features/lebron-james-and-trash-talk/), ~~James~~ Green responded to ~~Green~~ the ref by saying he was “the father of three kids and a man.’’ “You’re still a b—-,” ~~Green~~ the ref reportedly retorted. And that apparently caused ~~James~~ Green to go ballistic."
Dude chris Boucher outscored Lebron James and Kahwi Leonard in the past two Raptors games.
Can someone remind FVV that he's a PG not Lebron James.
Actually Toronto lost OG this game who did a good job defending LeBron James last night.
ESPN is biased towards a very famous/in-famous and popular player. So what they would do to any player if they were as popular and well known as Lebron James. ESPN is here to sell entertainment and that's one of the content sells. More at 11
Idk man:  These are clean as hell:  https://www.jordanupdate.com/nike-lebron-16-lebron-james-basketball-shoes-white-gold/
Lol I watched basically all of Dirk's prime. I have no idea how you watch a 20 year old Luka average 28/10/10 and not think that's on pace to be better than Dirk. Luka as a 19 year old averaged 21/8/6.   He's basically having a better start to his career than fucking Lebron James.
LeBron James would be the face of any franchise
well toronto is canada and lebron james  is popular outside america..... they can be biased
It's more like the majority of the cable TV-watching American public are attracted to LeBron James and don't care about the rest of the league rather than ESPN is biased for bias's sake. They're appealing to the lowest common denominator for (casual) sports viewers. If people didn't have viewing habits like this then they wouldn't do that
"Look, nobody is sleeping on the Raptors.  ESPN is a company that wants to make money.  The Lakers, I don't know if you've heard this or not about them, are one of the most popular franchises in the NBA, across all sports, and in the entire world.  LeBron James is arguably the best player of all time.  And the LA market is huge.  Of course they're going to show his highlights of a triple double.  The Chicago Bulls weren't shit until Jordan played there, guess what, he won 6 championships and the Bulls became a relevant franchise.  They've been slowly fading into obscurity since then (in national coverage) because they haven't won anything or haven't had any players worth covering (aside from D-Rose).    The Cleveland Cavaliers became relevant as winners only because LeBron played there.  (Losers because of Elo and Jordan's shot).    The Miami Heat only became relevant outside of Alonzo because LeBron went there.  Dwayne Wade only made them semi-relevant.    Guess who's always been relevant?  Magic Johnson, Shaq, Kobe, LeBron, Anthony Davis, Rick Fox, Robert Horry, Kareem, Wilt, Jerry West (the logo of the NBA), Derek Fisher, Elgin Baylor, Lamar, James Worthy, etc..  They've won 16 championships (11 if you count them in LA and outside of Minneapolis), and 31 Western Conference championships (25 in LA).  This team gets national coverage when they suck balls, but they're actually good this year.  So yeah man, of course they're going to get media coverage.    You sick of it?  Go win 16 championships.  Your team, the Warriors, just started getting national coverage in the past 5 or 6 seasons.  Prior to that all you guys had was Nelly and that 8 seed with Matt Barnes.  You tired of Toronto not getting coverage?  Win more than one championship or draft another showtime guy like Vince Carter.    Otherwise, learn your NBA history bro."
Lebron James couldn't give a damn about an Unghur kid in a Chinese concentration camp
hes kinda right... look at Lebron James and what his paid..
"When he was in Cleveland and we were making runs at (and winning) championships the only story ESPN would run was: ""LeBron James Free Agency Countdown - where will he go when Cleveland contract is up?""  They ran a piece like that the day after our 2016 Championship. If ESPN had their way there would be 100 pro teams in LA and 100 pro teams in NYC and they would all just play each other every single day."
1. Luka Doncic 2. LeBron James 3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Kemba Walker
I don’t see why people don’t understand this lol. Same thing when Zion Williamson was in the ncaa. They’re not here to deliver unbiased news the way actual news is supposed to. There’s no “journalistic” integrity. It’s whatever gets clicks. And there are tons of people who just care about Lebron James and not the nba as a whole.
"No matter how comfortably he gets to live in your head rent free, he’s still LeBron James and they’re still the Lakers."
AAU Coaches are to students what Lebron James is to anyone that gets in the way of massive profits for himself.
"Buddy, it’s the LA fucking Lakers and Lebron fucking James. Obviously they’re going to cover that story over most other headlines.   As a Warriors fan you should understand how the league is covered, you just enjoyed 5 straight years of being in the spotlight over every other team."
"ESPN doesn’t care about sports at all. They care about lebron james. What he’s doing, what he’s eating, when he takes a shit, that’s what their priority is. They know about as much about sports these days as I know about quantum physics."
"I am PERPLEXED by the EGREGIOUS DENIAL OF THE BALL that a \`Mr Boucher\` would even attempt, let alone execute on Mr Lebron James"
"ESPN cares about less than these things in no particular order; Cowboys ND SEC Lebron James Yankees/Cubs/Red Sox Kevin Durant   Dono where’ve you been for since, Like 2000 but it’s always been like this. It’s why I like watch MLB/NFL network. More comprehensive coverage of all teams."
Is that the Chinese agent and race traitor Lebron James that you're referring to?
Lebron james lmao
I can’t wait until Lebron James goes back to just playing basketball and not having opinions
Lebron james lmao
"dont you think you should be controlling for minutes played and or usage, and giving less weight to counting stats and efficiency, and more to shot selection?  what I mean is that it seems like star players are always going to have a high unicorn value because they have the ball more, they play more minutes, and they score more. im assuming thats why harden was rated so highly, his PPG and 3PA were off the charts. i feel like there should be a nonlinearity to the weight of these things; guards are expected to shoot 3’s, so yeah, it’s rare that a player takes as many as harden, but i dont know if i would consider him a “unicorn”, because his skillset is honestly not that strange for a guard.   it also seems like if you have a player who plays identical to lebron james, but plays only half of James’ minutes, he’ll have a much much lower unicorn score, even though they should ideally be very close in score.  i guess maybe this is a problem with what we mean by “unicorn” but i always interpreted it to be a player who plays a position much differently than his peers or has a skill set that is more typical for a different position. i dont think something like a high PPG or minutes played should have nearly as big of an impact as shot selection."
"My opinion that Steph Curry is 2nd best player in the league (well he considers him best) is echoed by Ben Taylor, someone who has watched  thousands of hours of basketball film analytically.  I certainly watch every Nuggets, Rockets, and Lakers game. I accept your position on KD,  Its unlikely he'll be at that level again,   But don't act like it's ridiculous to believe that either James Harden or Stephen Curry are better than Giannis. Curry is by far the most underrated player by people like you who are obsessed with the ""eye test"",  Most people on this sub, including myself, know little about winning basketball from a strategic perspective. Almost all of the stathead film watcher combo basketball people I follow say that Steph is the best player in the league.    In fact, you're regurgitating one of the most trotted out lines by ""forum fans"", which is that a player like Giannis's offense is equal to to Curry or Harden, and because he's better at defense he's better overall. This is complete bullshit. Defense is important, and offensive players like Lou Williams are overrated in comparison to defensive players like Robert Covington, but Curry is so far ahead of Giannis offensively.  You're just asserting that Giannis is in the top 5, and acting like it's insane, or unbelievable to think that LeBron, Kawhi, KD, Steph, and Harden are better. It's not. We can get into myriad of arguments on this. I even said that Harden vs. Giannis is a toss-up for me,  And btw, your opinion that Giannis is top 5 and possibly the best player in the league is much, much more popular than my opinion on this subreddit, as well as the general ideological stance about ""watching the game"" (which I do). So this whole strawman about ""forum fans"" esposuing my opinion is not even true."

"Before anything else, I just want to say that this is great work! Super interesting to look at the rankings, and amazing graphics / presentation/ open-source code.  When I was looking at the unicorns list, however, it struck me that the unicorns (outside of Svi) were mostly just a list of the best players in the NBA. You point this out a lot in your post, and your top PCA factor loadings reflect this by prioritizing usage states and counting stats. This makes sense, seeing as part of the reason we call people unicorns is that they're really good, in addition to being really weird.  But still, I wanted to see what the process would look like if it de-prioritized usage and effectiveness. To do this, I re-ran your code subtracting all counting stats (e.g. PPG) and advanced effectiveness stats (e.g. VORP, BPM). The subtraction of those stats were a little arbitrary, but had some interesting results.  |Guard Components    | Factor 1                   | Factor 2                  | Factor 3                  | Factor 4                   | Factor 5                   | |----|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------| | 0  | TOV%                | TIME_OF_POSS       | AVG_DRIB_PER_TOUCH | AST%                | AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH   | | 1  | 2P%                 | eFG%               | DRIVE_FG%          | FG%                 | TS%                 | | 2  | PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH | DRB%               | BLK%               | ORB%                | TRB%                | | 3  | TRB%                | ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%    | POST_TOUCH_FG%     | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH  | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | | 4  | 3P%                 | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH | POST_TOUCH_FG%     | ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%     | 3PAr                |  | Wings Components | Factor 1            | Factor 2        | Factor 3           | Factor 4            | Factor 5            | |---------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------| | 0             | PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH | TIME_OF_POSS    | eFG%               | TS%                 | FG%                 | | 1             | 3PAr                | 3P%             | eFG%               | AVG_DRIB_PER_TOUCH  | AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH   | | 2             | C&amp;S_FG%             | 2P%             | FT%                | BLK%                | ORB%                | | 3             | DFG%                | 3PAr            | TOV%               | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH  | PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH | | 4             | FTr                 | ELBOW_TOUCH_FG% | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | STL%                |  | Bigs Components | Factor 1        | Factor 2            | Factor 3            | Factor 4            | Factor 5            | |-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------| | 0               | 2P%             | TRB%                | 3PAr                | ORB%                | FG%                 | | 1               | DRIVE_FG%       | AST%                | AVG_DRIB_PER_TOUCH  | TIME_OF_POSS        | AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH   | | 2               | PAINT_TOUCH_FG% | ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%     | PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH | TOV%                | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | | 3               | eFG%            | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | 2P%                 | PAINT_TOUCH_FG%     | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH  | | 4               | BLK%            | PULL_UP_FG%         | C&amp;S_FG%             | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | DRIVE_FG%           |  For guards, it seems like the first component reflects people who hold the ball a lot, the second component those who are good scorers, and the 3/4/5 reflect more play in the paint.  For wings, 1 is overall effectiveness, 2 might be propensity for threes vs driving, 3 I have no idea, and 4 for post play.  For bigs, 1 is hard to say, but 2 seems to reflect ball handling, and the rest I don't really know.  So how does this shake out with unicorns then? We get some weirder ones, with fewer past/future MVPs.  Charts here: https://imgur.com/a/FmuMJtf, Rankings:  | Unicorn Ranking | Guards            | Wings                   | Bigs                  | |-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------| | 1               | Ben Simmons       | Svi Mykhailiuk          | Gary Clark            | | 2               | Russell Westbrook | LeBron James            | Giannis Antetokounmpo | | 3               | Hamidou Diallo    | Doug McDermott          | Joe Ingles            | | 4               | Jamal Crawford    | Derrick Jones Jr.       | Mitchell Robinson     | | 5               | Jose Calderon     | Rondae Hollis-Jefferson | Tyson Chandler        | | 6               | Allen Crabbe      | Kevin Durant            | Blake Griffin         | | 7               | James Harden      | CJ Miles                | Rudy Gobert           | | 8               | Pat Connaughton   | Thabo Sefolosha         | DeAndre Jordan        | | 9               | Shaun Livingston  | Kawhi Leonard           | Ed Davis              | | 10              | Frank Ntilikina   | Jonathon Simmons        | Davis Bertans         |  So is this interesting? Honestly, I can't tell because I'm not as familiar with the play styles of players like, uh, Gary Clark/Hamidou Diallo/Svi. Maybe others can chime in on that. It does preserve some players that we know are weird even we subtracted their effectiveness, like the Greek Freak (dribbling death-center), Ben Simmons + Russel Westbrook (rebounding triple-double machines), Joe Ingles (super-shooting big), and Lebron (Lebron). The least unique guard is Bogdan Bogdanovich, wing is Jayson Tatum, and big is Zach Collins, which all feel kind of right to me.  Food for thought, anyway! Again, great post, thanks for putting in all this work."
"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and Svi Mykhailiuk."
Mao Zedong was a dictator is still didn't have more control ver the NBA than one Lebron James.
"ESPN showed Raptors highlights in the actual game highlights, and there was also a lot of praise spoken about the Raps last night. You only watched the video titled, ""LeBron James and Anthony Davis highlights.""   Please just stop now, it's embarrassing for other Raptors fans."
"LeBron James says need for social justice stops at my front door: ""uninformed people couldn't give a damn about my bottom line"""
LeBron James says need for communism starts at AAU level: 'I couldn't give a damn about Hong Kong kids'
"Full health (injuries discounted and assumed to be fully healthy during playoff run. If factoring for availability this changes with projected playoff LeBron from 2017-2018:  1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Anthony Davis 9. Joel Embiid 10. Damian Lillard  My list is pretty standard, with 2 exceptions, the higher placements of Jokic and Curry. I believe Curry is still the most impactful offensive player  in the league closely followed by James Harden. He warps defense like no other. My next controversial placement would be Jokic above AD. AD is a an amazing defensive player, but overrated on offense due to his lack of creation, Jokic also had one of the best postseasons in the last 10 years last year statistically, and in advanced metrics was second to only Kawhi in value.   This whole list is pretty tentative considering the uncertainty of a 2 year older LeBron, and Steph and KD's injuries. Giannis certainly has a argument over Harden, as well as AD over Jokic."

"How long before Lebron James hits up his old pal James Jones and asks for a favor  Lebron: Hey buddy member them rings I got for you in Miami  James Jones: Yes Sir! What you need King? I gifted you Tyson Chandler last year..... you threw him away like trash.... I mean (gets interrupted mid sentence by Lebron screaming)  Lebron: Exactly!!! you gave me garbage trash!!! You saw how people laughed and called me washed up last year. I went from a King to a pauper.... yo member them rings man... I know people that know people that can come take them rings from you - literally with your fingers and everything  James Jones: okay what you want?  Lebron: Hmm... I'm reading a book right now about....   James: NO.... NO NO...Lebron don't do this... not him, not Boo...  Lebron: Hey relax man... I'm just actually reading a book... but go on, what were you gonna say  Jones: nervous laughter... Oh wowzers for a second there I thought I heard you say Booker hahaha lol  Lebron: Well since you brought that name up..... Booker for Kuzma... make that happen... member them rings man... (slams phone down)"
Superstar??? I’d say there are 2-3 of these in the league max. KD is out and LeBron James is washed. So really Kawhi that’s it. Maybe Pascal Siakam :-)

"Lebron refused to sit. It looked like the coaches tried to rest him half way through the 4th quarter and he only sat for like 30 seconds. Raptors scored a lot of points on match ups, and James wasn't event letting them go through rotations.   We definitely got ahead with some nice runs off the bench tonight, but I don't understand why a player with his IQ can't defer to the staff sometimes."
"I just realized that if the John Collins situation happened with say James Harden or even Lebron, it would be an unprecedented level of shit storm."
Lebron James is washed-up old superstar. Probably his last season. He is slow now. Just milking money in LA. Its not even about basketball for him now its about business. He also steals his sons spotlight. And he is bald.
[Terrorist version of Lebron James](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_drUMJ9HF-tQ/S5ehclpMJFI/AAAAAAAAKB8/ZOBt9Lv7lvI/s1600-h/lebron4.jpg)
"now that I think about it, if doing business with china = selling out our country and values   then probably ~95% of Americans aren't loyal to our country either.  that includes you, me, most of this sub, daryl morey, lebron james, donnie, pop, stevens, whoever else you can name"
"Chinas' Chairman Xi on Lebron James (trashed his legacy for a shoe deal): “His nickname is frog. Every time he opens his mouth, its a bootlick.”"
"This is the more important point. Obviously LeBron isn't completely washed up, but there's a lot of grey area between LeBron James arguably the best player ever and being a scrub. He can both be declining and be really good, but him declining still matters."
I’m as Kobe Stan as they get but I love me some LeBron James and can’t make an argument that Kobe was better than James.

"Steve Nash won it over Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, and LeBron James - three of the most marketable players of all-time. Jokic is more than capable of doing the same against current big market stars."
Would LeBron James Still Be The Best Player In The League If He Literally Played In Quicksand?
"Doesn't excuse the lack of effort. I mean he's Lebron fucking James so you live with it since he'll turn it up in the playoffs, it's just annoying to watch so people will call it out"
"If you had told me mid way through 2013 that Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard would be on the Lakers, with LeBron James, and AD would throw a lob pass to Howard, I'd have laughed in your face at how ridiculous that notion was.  If you had also told me that the Seattle Supersonics still were not back in the league after all these years I'd have been very upset."
"Oh bro i don't give a shit about Kawhi's ranking anymore than i care about Lebron's.   If Lebron or Kawhi or James, or fuckin Jokic can lead their team to a ring, that's all that should matter to their team.   I'm just trying to be honest with the way i see it. I'm cool if i'm wrong, but this is how i call it."
LeBron James looks...quicker than last year? He's about to turn 35 yrs old.
"I get that he sells out to China but damn man it's just fucking impressive not only his film study but memorization of the games.   The quote about LeBron I can never forget is that I forget if it was Mark Jackson but the quote goes something like ""in 2009 LeBron James would look over at huddle and figure out what plays we were running and on 2013 LeBron James called out the exact plays we were running"" something of the sort.   This guy is just simply amazing. LeBron is probably one of the probably less than 10 athletes to actively try to get to the max potential that he can. I heard LeBron spends up to 7 figures each year trying to maintain his body in peak form. He always controlled his future. After his rookie his first rookie scale extension he made it in a way he can leave after 3 years. His contract with the Heat is the longest contract I think he ever signed with a friendly contract to surround himself with talent. Then he signed Short contracts with cleveland and forced the Kevin Love trade and brought Cleveland their first championship in forever. I don't think we will ever see another athlete like LeBron who not only had the talent to be one of the greatest if not the greatest and made damn sure he lived up to that billing.  I rarely ever say its an honor to watch a person a sport but in LeBron's case man I'm so grateful to have watched and experienced the LeBron era in the NBA."

Is LeBron James back?

It's not interesting to compare careers. LeBron James is clear cut better  He's a great defender but idk about goat defender

"if you don't think LeBron James is in the top 50 passers all time in NBA history, then you should just stop watching NBA basketball, because you don't understand what you are seeing."
All of the below players are better than Kawhi. The list isn't in order and I've probably forgotten a couple people. He needs a lot more longevity at this level before he can get into the top 15.  Michael Jordan   Kareem Abdul Jabbar  Lebron James  Magic Johnson  Kobe Bryant  Time Duncan  Larry Bird  Hakeem Olajuwon  Wilt Chamberlain  Shaquille O'Neal  Bill Russell  Kevin Durant  Karl Malone  Kevin Garnett  David Robinson  Dirk Nowitzki  Charles Barkley   Steph Curry  John Stockton  Isiah Thomas

How bout being shills for any dictatorship is wrong but Saudi Arabia are our “allies” and the NBA is a way bigger league. You know all the stars. Lebron James is bigger than John Cena who’s the biggest name I can think of besides the rock who’s mostly famous from movies rather than wrestling
"We'll see this season just where exactly a 35 LeBron James is in terms of athleticism and stamina but even if he takes enough of a step backwards for Kawhi to be better than him Kawhi has not approached LeBron at his best.  Also I'm not ready to say that LBJ isn't still better even at 35, we need to see more of his play this season."
"So basically: ""other than  being better at half of the game of basketball, I don't think Kawhi can do anything better than LeBron James"""

"Kawhi is a much better shooter than James. Especially when it comes to free throws. LeBron is a better passer, better handles I think, better at playing point guard by a mile, better at driving maybe. Kawhi is better on defense, better at rebounding, better at getting to his spots and knocking down tough shots."
"While I recognize that brilliant defense, particularly from an individual player, does not have the same impact on the game as brilliant offense, defense is still not a singular thing.  Maybe the quote should read ""Other than man to man defense, zone defense, help defense, steals, blocks, post defense, perimeter defense, quarterbacking the defense, chase down blocks, bodying someone up, chasing people off the three point line, recovering, trapping, icing, and reading passing lanes... I don't think Kawhi can do anything better than LeBron James."""
&gt; Clippers are gonna go 82-0  yes  &gt; Who is worse at basketball?

Test them for PEDs  definitely  &gt; Should rockets trade Harden and get some shooters around Westbrook?  for sure  &gt; Can Duke Blue Devils beat the Warriors?  likely
"Shit take on Ray Allen. It’s hard to put up 20 when you have to play with LeBron James, Wade and Bosh. When you’ve got arguably the greatest shooter of All Time in a specific role, you’ve got a solid supporting cast. When Wade and Bosh are options 2 and 3 on offense, you’ve got a great supporting cast.   His 2 years in Miami, Allen put up 10 points a game shooting 50% from 2, 39.8% from 3 and 90% from the line."
LeBron James
"[Haynes] In the Lakers’ locker room, LeBron James was having some fun with some of the Rockets front office members who supported Hong Kong. “Y’all a little different without freedom of speech, I see. Uh-huh, y’all cheated the NBA out of money long enough. It’s OK. Y’all had a good run. Back to reality"""
What? Lebron James is evolving!  Congratulations! Your Lebron James evolved into James Lebron!
"Where's the James Harden 2-13 thread? There's already a few threads here about Steph's poor game. The Lebron hot takes threads are stupid, and so are the curry hot takes. Just cause Lebron got the stupidest hot takes after one game doesn't mean people need to do it for every off game a star player has."
"&gt;  You’re comparing your situation as a justification to LeBron James sitting or coasting? Jesus. Give me a break. He’s a professional athlete.  The purpose of that comparison is to show how much more he has to deal with and how clueless you are of it.  &gt;  He gets paid gigantic sums of money. To play. Not sit out because of “load management” after 18 games.  The franchise pays him, and they are the ones who want him to ""load manage"".  &gt;  LeBron is one of the best athletes in sports history, not some D3 scrub with bad knees and ankles. He can handle playing.  And where did you play D1?  &gt;  I could give 2 fucks less if LeBron cares or not. Doesn’t change the facts.  The facts are that nobody cares if you whine about LeBron missing 12 games so that he doesn't tear his meniscus before the playoffs.  &gt;  Jordan had 3 years off at 35, 36 and 37. Came back at 38 and 39 and played 60 and 82 games. This wasn’t him taking time off in his mid 20’s. Injuries the whole time??  He retired 3 times, idiot.  He missed almost 2 full years between 3peats.  He was 30 and 31.  So that would be a total amount of off time of 5 years.  Not only are your arguments disingenuous, they're wrong.  &gt;  Even better! The guy played hurt then. He played a complete season. Really speaks volumes about Jordan and James’s internal makeup. He’s soft.  Jordan was playing with 60 fewer lbs on him.  I noticed when I put on 10 lbs every landing and direction change.  In today's NBA, players play fewer minutes with more muscle.  Jordan's NBA was greyhounds running the floor.  Jordan is the goat.  He should be able to do things nobody else did.  But what you're arguing is...again...just goddamn stupid.  You really come off as a whiny kid who didn't get the present he wanted for Christmas."

"Everything you just said is moronic.  You're acting like certain behaviors don't increase injury risk.  You're acting like age doesn't increase injury risk.  You're acting like these players are puppets dancing for your amusement.  LeBron James is trying to win championships.  ""Load management"" is a way he makes it possible for him to be physically able to play his best when it matters, the playoffs.  And he crushes it, every playoffs.  LeBron James couldn't give a shit if you think he's soft for coasting through the regular season at 35 years old.  You ever play basketball?  I did.  My knees and ankles are shot and all I did was red shirt at a D3 and play some practice squad ball at a D1.  I'm 31, 155 lbs and 5'11.  LeBron is an athletic monster on a 265 lb frame whose tendons and ligaments have to carry all of that on much more intense and dynamic movements than I am capable of.  Jordan had almost 4 full years off of basketball as well as having extra years of a lighter college schedule to be able to play into his late 30's.  And when he came back at 38 he had injury problems the whole time with the Wizards.  He also did it on a leaner frame.  Not to mention, he's the fucking goat.  You want everyone to be able to do what MJ did?  Dude seriously, you're just fucking wrong here."
"Yeah but Kobe and Larry Bird I understand. If it was LeBron I’d understand if it were Kd I’d get it, if it were James harden or steph, fuck it idc. But coming from a guy so cocky cause he just got a one way ticket to the finals is just not deserved. But I also don’t think anyone would act this way after having blown out the other team it’s something called respect and integrity which I know now you have nothing of. So you’re telling me that after you’ve blown out the other team you’re just gonna kick them while their down?"
"Shut up and worship at the altar of LeBron James, the only man that played basketball employng ""passing"" into his playstyle"
"We ain’t talking about the Thunder, we talking about lebron. Stay on topic. You support a player who loses more than winning. Lebron “Participation Award” James"
"Listen, and understand. Kawhi is out there somewhere... He can’t be bargained with. He can’t be reasoned with. He doesn’t feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And he absolutely will not stop, ever, until LeBron James is dead."
That lebron James is now washed up after 1 game playing with basically a new team. 1 game. LEBRON JAMES
"&gt; I mean James Worthy and Cooper contributed regardless of Magic. So did GP, big shot Bob and Kobe when Shaq was on the bench. So did Kyrie, DWade when LeBron wasn’t playing. Those players won games by themselves without necessarily a high contribution by their best player   And the Clippers made the playoffs regardless last year. And set the NBA record for the largest comeback in playoff history.   &gt;You act like Kawhi is the only great player that played on good teams.  That’s you shoehorning your view. I never implied this"
"I mean James Worthy and Cooper contributed regardless of Magic. So did GP, big shot Bob and Kobe when Shaq was on the bench. So did Kyrie, DWade when LeBron wasn’t playing.  You act like Kawhi is the only great player that played on good teams."
"An injury can happen at any time. During a game. At practice. What kind of dumbass logic is that?   Jordan played 80-82 games every year. Played 40 minutes+ every game. . . .during a far more physical era of basketball. He carried the offensive load for the Bulls his whole career and still played All NBA level defense. Somehow he turned it up a notch come playoff time. The deeper they went in the playoffs, the better he and harder he played.   LeBron is supposed to be this physical specimen. The guy spend millions of dollars every year taking care of and preparing his body for the NBA schedule. Why do that if he’s only going to play 65-70 games? Is he that soft? I’d have a lot more respect for LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard or whoever if they just came out and said they don’t give a shit about the regular season. They can’t. They’d look like a douche, but at least it’d be honest.   This “load management” shit is a joke. If I were a Lakers fan, you better believe I’d want the guys ass out there if he was physically able to play."
"My favorite part of the bucks article:  &gt; When LeBron James played in Cleveland, he and then-head coach Ty Lue would use booster seats to elevate their perches, but the cushions were not available to every player.  I'd like to think that this isn't Dan Gilbert being cheap but LeBron mandating to ownership that nobody else be allowed to use them."
"Small decreases in efficiency is how it starts. You think LeBron James is gonna show up one year and be trash?  For a player as talented as him, his decline may come over the span of 5 years.  I'm just saying those momentary breakdowns is what gets people talking."
that's just not true lol the lakers have the biggest bandwagon player of them all in lebron james. hordes of fans cross team lines to follow this man
"I know when I tell people that I am a Cowboys fan I have to always follow it up with, but I am actually from Dallas. It’s annoying how many bandwagoners there are for the cowboys sometimes. Many of them are insufferable. I mean Lebron James is a Cowboys Fan( and I think Yankees too)..."
"Lebron didn't spend the possessions dribbling the air out of the ball. He was trying to get it to Ad the whole game. The Clippers took time off the shot clock by playing full court defense. Only the Clippers do that.  &gt;Those are not max numbers. Especially with his TOP. If anything, those are the lowest values we expect.  James Harden just scored 19 points on 2/13 shooting with 7 turnovers in his opening night game. Steph Curry just dropped 23 points with 8 turnovers. Do you think these guys are washed too? Relax man. Go look up Lebron's stats in his first game back with the Cavs. Exactly the same as the other night 18 points in a loss. Overly passive passing the ball all the time to Love and Kyrie.   Once Lebron gives up on the idea of (again) trying to make someone else the number one option, the Lakers will be fine. Ad needs to be the sidekick rather than the focus. Lebron is one of the best team carriers of all time and he will do it again if that's what it takes to win."
"Tell me, what would Lebron James or Anthony Davis or James Harden or Giannis do against this Clippers team if they had Steph's surround cast?  Lebron and AD are literally on the same team and are both top 5 players and they still lost by 10 points.   If you take the Warriors current team unless you put a prime Michael Jordan in Curry's place then of course the game would be a blowout against this Clippers team."
"The whistleblower who was confirmed to have supplied steroids to MLB's A-Rod and Ryan Braun (both were suspended) in Miami also was reported to supply LeBron. He had NBA players on his official list but it wasn't publically released.  There was a kinda shady report where one of his assistants for 3 years claimed to give a box of ""medicine"" to ""Mr. Paul"", it's not conclusive though lol  &gt;Jessica said that a man who went by the name of Mr. Paul came in every month, once a month to pick up products for the initials “LJ.” As for what those products were, Jessica doesn’t know. However, she did say that Mr. Paul, the person who picked up the products for “LJ” was a friend of James’s.  https://www.si.com/si-wire/2013/07/25/biogenesis-whistle-blower-nba-players  http://dystnow.com/2013/03/04/lebron-james-jameer-nelson-linked-to-miami-steroid-clinic/"

including the commissioner LeBron James
"LeBron shriveled up like a frozen nut sack against the Mavericks in 2011. Game 4 he went for 8 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists with 4 turnovers on 3-11 shooting.   Game 5 2010 Eastern Conference Semi Finals 15 points 6 rebounds 7 assists on 3-14 shooting.   2008 Game 1 Eastern Conference Semi Finals 12 points 9 rebounds 9 assists 2-18 shooting 10 turnovers.   2014 Game 5 Eastern Conference Finals 7 points 2 rebounds 4 assists on 2-10 shooting.   2017 Eastern Conference Finals: Game 3: 11 points 6 rebounds 6 assists 4-13 shooting 6 turnovers.   For an All Time Great, this dude has had a shit ton of moments IN THE PLAYOFFS where he didn’t show up.   He had 11 games in which he shot under 30.8% in a game. He is team went 3-8. Jordan had 6 instances where he shot less than 30.8%. His teams went 4-2. 7 of those games, James scores under 20 points. Jordan never scored under 20.   How did they respond in the game after? Jordan had a chance to respond after four of those off nights, and he averaged 37.8 points per game in the ensuing game. Jordan responded to the worst shooting night of his playoff career — a 3-of-18 effort against the Knicks in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals — with 54 points in Game 4. Chicago won both games to advance to the NBA Finals.  James averaged 24.9 points per game in the follow-up game. James' teams are 5-4 in those games.   James may have more buzzer beaters, no thanks to the 60 extra playoff games he has over Jordan, but LeBron had a shit ton more instances where he just disappeared. Can’t say that about Jordan. He had an off night, but he always came back with a vengeance."
"Honestly you should be mad at him, but you should also be mad at damn near everyone else on the team. The problem wasn't JUST Kyrie at all. In fact Kyrie kind of acted the way we'd expect him to act. If LeBron James came to a franchise, regardless of their past success we'd expect the team to cater to him and give him more shots/control of the offense.  &amp;#x200B;  Lots of the Celtics guys had the mentality that they don't need him, and lots of them were trying to make a name for themselves. As someone that loved the Celtics unit last year, and still likes most people involved, i'm sad they couldn't just pull it the fuck together and accept their roles. They had all the tools necessary to at least make the ECF but they fell short."
2012-2013 Lakers would’ve been disgusting.  PG - Steve Nash  SG - Kobe Bryant   SF - LeBron James  PF - Pau Gasol  C - Dwight Howard
Did you know LeBron James is slightly not as good as Kawhi Leonard?
"There's also the aspect of how well their skill-sets fit for their eras. 2011 is before the 'analytics movement' and before 'splash-brothers' came onto the scene and showed just how important floor spacing was for offenses. So back then, the court was essentially smaller because there were less shooters (really only the corner threes and transition threes were highly coveted). Wade's combination of speed, strength, and effort allowed him to cover the smaller, confined space with ease (same with Bron). They essentially choked teams by preventing them from running proper offenses because the ball took so damn long just to get inside the three-point line. Like those Miami teams were ridiculous on defense because of Wade, James, and later Battier; it was part of their identity.  Davis as great as he is defensively, has yet to have an actual defensive scheme based around his talents. Now some of that is just the Pelicans not having the personnel, but another part is he's never been a talker either. He's not KG, Noah, Draymond in-tune Lebron or other 4/5s who 'anchor' your defense and shot out exactly where everyone needs to be and where. He's a great piece to have, is a defensive plus, but hasn't ever been part of your defensive identity the way Wade was."
"Daryl Morey and Lebron James have two very different levels of influence.  I can almost guarantee Daryl Morey doesn't have a PR advisor.   The Rockets have a PR advisor who works with Daryl Morey because Daryl Morey currently works for the Rockets.  There's a difference.   And this tweet supporting Hong Kong was not a basketball related tweet, nor was it released on the Rockets social media accounts.  Should he have run it by someone with some expertise on public relations? yeah probably. Should have given thought to what the consequences of a tweet like this could do should China react harshly? yeah probably. I don't find it that hard to believe that he heard about bad stuff taking place in Hong Kong and thought he'd send a tweet out voicing his support for oppressed people."
"Alright guys, I hope this isn't a rule breaker...….I was hoping you could help settle a work disagreement. Which one of these teams would win the most titles in a 5 year window. I know this may not be a normal type post but I imagine a thread like this won’t fly on the NBA board. (We simple snake drafted a starting 5 with the only stipulation of which team wins the most championships in a 5 year window) (The number next to their name is where they were drafted) Team 1: Kyrie Irving (12) James Harden (7) Lebron James (6) Anthony Davis (1) Kristaps Porzingis (13) Team 2: Damian Lillard (8) Klay Thompson (11) Kawhi Leonard (2) Kevin Durant (5) Karl Anthony Towns (14) Team 3: Steph Curry (4) Luka Doncic (15) Paul George (10) Giannis Antetokounmpo (3) Joel Embiid (9) Any thoughts on our disagreements would be great. If there is a better place to post this please let me know!"
"""you guys know that thing where the employee almost got fired, why doesn't he do that again and again?""  Acting like Daryl Morey and Lebron James have the same leverage and leeway within the league to speak their minds is funny."
"how are people still complaining at this point. Jesus. Its about Lebron James, not the NBA."
"&gt; I've been saying that team would be a bona fide disappointment all off-season.   I mean this devalues your position, rather than enhances it. You're reacting this way because you have a 1 game sample size that reinforced a pre-existing opinion rather than due to genuine analysis of their play which is impossible at this juncture.  &gt; I don't need 20 games to say it.  Yeah, you do.  &gt; They have two basketball players capable of bringing the ball up the floor.  Even if this is true, one of them didn't even play which makes your comment all the more ridiculous.  &gt; LeBron James is not the same player he was, and they're asking him to do more and be more than he's done in years.  Again, after one game?  &gt; They'll be a playoff team. But they're a first or second round exit at best.  You can't say this with any certainty 1 game in when there's still the trade deadline and buyout market to come which will drastically change everyone's roster. Not to mention injuries."
"I've been saying that team would be a bona fide disappointment all off-season. Their roster construction is ridiculous.   I don't need 20 games to say it. They have two basketball players capable of bringing the ball up the floor. LeBron James is not the same player he was, and they're asking him to do more and be more than he's done in years.   It is silliness.   They'll be a playoff team. But they're a first or second round exit at best. And for Lakers fans, that's a disappointment.   I don't think they're in the tier of Clippers, Sixers, Bucks and Nuggets."
"  In the 2015-16 season, Drummond averaged 16.2 PPG, 14.8 RPG, .8 APG, 1.4 BPG, 1.5 SPG, 1.9 TO on 52% from the field in 32.9 MPG  In the 2015-16 post-season, Drummond averaged 16.8 PPG, 9.0 RPB, 0 APG, 1.5 BPG, .3 SPG, 1 TO on 51.9% from the field in 32.8 MPG.  As to why his rebounds dropped and everything else basically stayed the same, the answer is simple – he played a championship team with 2 good big-men (Love &amp; TT) for 4 games rather than beating up on bad teams.   How you can look at those numbers are say he “disappointed” as a 22 year old player amazes me. And if you watched the games, you would have seen that his performance was not even close to the reason we lost. The team was starting a 20 year old rookie to guard Lebron James."
"He won’t make it past this year and will ruin any hopes the Kings had of making the playoffs, can’t believe people actually thought he could be a decent coach when the Kings got him when he was ass his whole tenure with us (even with LeBron fucking James on the team)"
Because people aren't educated on the LeBron James situation
"“Since his rookie season” thats just false. Dude has dud games 4-5 times a regular season, which is still super incredible considering the number of games played. You dont need to oversell Lebron fucking James, his resume speaks for itself"
"I think you meant “rarely just dip out”, but we can name just a few since 2017:  * Gordon Hayward leaving UTA for BOS  * Paul George requesting trades from small markets IND and OKC for LAL and LAC, respectively  * Kevin Durant leaving OKC for GSW  * Jimmy Butler pushing for a trade from MIN to PHI (LAC and BKN were included as other options)  * Bojan Bogdanovich leaving IND for UTA  * Giannis Antetokounmpo threatening (I dunno what to call it) to leave MIL if things don’t go right  * LeBron James leaving CLE for LAL  * Kyrie Irving requesting a trade from CLE to BOS  * Anthony Davis requesting a trade from NOP to LAL  * Kawhi Leonard requesting a trade from SAS to LAC, eventually leaving TOR to get there.  I think that’s a pretty fair amount.   Also /s about the Bojan one"
Right? Fuck James Jones for cutting him for nothing because LeBron wanted a center if anything.
"No, dude. I'm a huge, huge Luka fan but y'all making it a bit ridiculous now...are you forgetting LeBron is literally one of the greatest basketball players of all time? I think Luka can get there one day too but it's LeBron fucking James man.."
"Its utterly ridiculous.   Lebron James shooting percentage =  .368  Kobe bryant shooting percentage= .447  Jordan percentage = .49  steph curry = .477  kevin durant = .49  I swear I hate when the commentators call him that. You literally dont even see it in his ability on the court, his numbers are padded with all the shots he takes. He's not the best dribbler, shooter, defensive player,  scorer, closer, or free throw shooter. Its literally dumb as fuck to call a person who's physical abilities are pretty much average the best in the world."
Andrew Wiggins has more wins this season than LeBron James and Anthony Davis combined

James Ennis runs offense like he's Lebron but my man's always screws up lol.
Ohhh LeBron James not James harden gotcha
The game will start at 8PM after we talked a lot of Lebron James probably brought to you by ESPN
"Pretending Kuzma is trash and makes no difference to a game is just as fucking dumb as that but yea I already know that about these  flaming hot takes after games by a lot on here lol   Pointing Kuzma had a great game and a win in his second year, as the primary offensive catalyst,  without Lebron James playing is a great example of how dumb that is.   But yea I get downvotes for pointing out the over reactionary bullshit.  Can’t wait until someone posts a single thing a single fan/person did or said and then applies to all their fans."
"The Finals were a complete afterthought to the media compared to whether Kawhi and AD would join LeBron. I'm convinced Steph Curry, James Harden and Nikola Jokic could all die of a heart attack tomorrow and ESPN would still be talking about LeBron"
Believe it or not but Lebron reached out to Kia initially because he wanted to check out the K900 before it was released.  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/lebron-james-i-drive-a-kia-i-swear-1449170963](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lebron-james-i-drive-a-kia-i-swear-1449170963)
"I'm not protesting the US treatment of Honk Kong nor am I protesting China's treatment. I'm specifically against the unamerican traitorous cunt, Lebron James.   Him selling out to China makes my movies shittier because they can't say or do things they normally do. It makes my society shittier because media affects society, so if a show doesn't have gay people in it because it wants to shill to China, that's less LGBT representation in media, and that matters. It creates a chilling effect that limits my freedoms right here.  I don't need my reps to change their ways. I need Lebron to grow some fucking balls and stop being such a pussy ass bitch."
"It's First Take, the only basketball they care about are the Lakers, LeBron James and sometimes the Knicks because SAS likes them. And two of those are the same thing these days."
"IT was probably the best example of why it wouldn't happen.  An ultra efficient 29 points a night and leading an other mediocre team to the 1 seed *should* beat out a stat stuffing triple double average for a 6 seed.  Very hard to argue that IT was not the *most valuable player* in the league that year.  If IT's name was Lebron James, that MVP vote ends up looking very different."
The guy is an idiot. You can tell he doesn't watch any LeBron James and is basing his opinion off one game against an elite defensive team. How is that fair to LeBron? Come on now.
No I don’t think a team with Lebron James could win the East
"I can’t give a lot of pity honestly    Couple summers ago I said “I haven’t watched sports center in awhile, maybe I can catch some baseball highlights”  They instead covered lebron James singing happy birthday on Instagram.   Fuck ESPN. Fuck sport center. I hope they crash and burn honestly"

"With a ~10% chance of landing top 3.   Holy fuck Danny really traded away a 10% chance at a Michael Jordan / LeBron James type player, lmfao."
But Luka is better than LeBron James and I would rathwr start a franchise with him  - Luka stans
"Without a nod to Damian Lillard?   Top 3 offensive win shares:  * James Harden 3.1  * Luka Doncic 2.8  * Damian Lillard 2.6  Top 3 Offensive Box Plus/Minus:  * Luka Doncic 11.3  * James Harden 10.7  * Damian Lillard 7.5  And Damian is the only guy on this list in the top 20 Offensive Rating at #16. Also the only guy with a 60 point game.  I don't know how Lebron gets a runner up nod. I guess it's just Lebron bias.  Honestly, as crazy as James Hardens point total is, I'd still give the nod to Luka for overall Offensive player of the year...Currently."
"I think having LeBron fucking James joining your team kinda helps that cause. The best teammate Kemba ever had was Al Jefferson, followed by Nic Batum I guess?? Most any other star in the league would've tried to get out of here much sooner."
"KD, Magic, and Bird (in that order) would give him the most trouble but yes he'd probably win still. Prime Magic could play all 5 spots at the highest level and he had a slight height advantage on LeBron. Transition would be so crazy to watch. Fucking Showtime on roids on coke on PCP.   Depends on which version, too. If it's younger LeBron before his shot got better I say Magic wins but Miami LeBron doesn't lose to anyone.  KD is interesting cuz he definitely beats James on the perimeter but would get bullied in the post. But having 5 of him is so much length on D I dunno if that could tip the scales. At their absolute primes the two are so close talent-wise."
Not everything has to tie into his family back home. He got into it with Lebron on the court and then went to social media to call him 'Queen James'. Has NOTHING to do with his family getting jailed.
"I see some improvement. He’s generally looked more confident and aggressive. Most of his raw statistical jumps come down to being in a better personal situation. Also playing alongside LeBron James has its effects. He’s great at finding you in the right position but he takes up most of the ball-handling responsibilities. Given that Ingram benefits from being a primary playmaker and until this season has not been a prolific catch and shoot player, it’s not hard to see why his raw numbers have increased. Hope he continues to find a niche in NOLA."
Dude LeBron fucking James and Dwyane Wade in their primes? Ray Allen was a big signing in 2012. You have to be trolling rn. Coming from a Knicks fan whose big signings in the last decade are Melo and a washed Amar'e no less.

It's because these guys are good enough to do it that they can do it so much.  &gt;(2019 it's at 1 and will drop).   Why? Last year Lebron was a 0.97 and the year before that with 'shooters' it was 0.96. In 2017 it was also 0.97--the exact same as Harden.  &gt;Also his FG% across the board has dropped, not just FT%.  I know, but it will all go up. FG and FT%. We're not even 20 games in."

You have literally no counterargument so you resort to talking shit about my team? That's so fucking pathetic lmfao. LeBron James is my favourite player of all time.
Why is his PPG low? Because he plays 23 minutes per game on a team where he's backing up LeBron James/Anthony Davis.  TS% of 64th in the league is also objectively high. It really isn't that hard to understand.
Skip Bayless makes 4 million per year because he slanders Lebron James every day of the week.  Let that sink in.

"The thing is it's true though. The Magic is a really good team, they got a lot of guys with a lot of potential, and the coach has done a good job utilising their defensive potential too.  But you guys aren't getting talked about at all, because your team isn't the Lakers and you don't have a guy called LeBron James. Kyle Kuzma is probably not even as good as someone like Jonathan Isaac or Aaron Gordon, but he is on the Lakers and he gets a lot of attention because he is an above average player and he plays well with LeBron.  Just simple as that. In a way it's harsh (like really harsh, Kuzma never had to mention them at all) but it's just true."

ESPN: Lebron James supports re-education camps for referees
Nah more like LeFans. I once talked about how LeBron needed his rest or else we'll se LeThargic defense in playoffs. They thought I was insulting King James instead of suggesting something. It was crazy.
"Not from me. I'm too tired. I'll just let kyrie live. Honestly, does anyone really give a fuck? Seriously. I don't care if he has mood swings or that he didn't work out with other teams. Still fun to watch. He's not the leader of the nets. Kevin Durant is, so I don't get the whole moody angle as if its matters. If KD is able to curtail his mood like lebron james did, then who cares."
"Lebron is more physically gifted and a better scorer. I would never disagree with this. Wilt is a better scorer too. If you had a player that scored the most was very on the best efficiency but only had one move....(a big, athletic 7 footer more dominant than Shaq)....than they would be the best scorer ever.   Lebron is a better scorer than Kobe because he scores more on better efficiency. It's that simple. But there is no one that has scored close to Kobe, on Kobe's efficiency with such a vast array of moves, skills, and footwork save for arguably Michael Jordan.   Michael Jordan and Lebron James are better scorers than Kobe Bryant. Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant are the most skilled scorers of all time.   But the scoring output/to skill ratio needs to be pretty close. You can't say Jamal Crawford is a more skilled scorer than Lebron despite having a more ""skilled"" arsenal. Because those skills don't come CLOSE to being nearly as effective. That's why I am comfortable saying Kobe is a more skilled Scorers than Lebron and Lebron is a more skilled scorer than someone with ""Kobe"" moves who isn't that good."
I’m gonna be honest and just say it....   it is insane to me that LeBron James plays the way he does at this age.  This man is CLEAR cut the best player in the league at 34 and it doesn’t make human sense. I love it.
"I thot lbj only just passed 33,000 cp? [nba](https://www.nba.com/article/2019/11/28/lebron-james-fourth-reach-33000-points)"
i think james harden is going to surpass lebron in points
"After being reluctant, Lebron James just walked into the referee's locker room after being invited in by crew chief Zach Zerba and said ""I don't want no smoke"""
Lakers received a top 5 superstar that fits perfectly with Lebron fuckin James and NOLA got some guys with potential
Nets fan so here it is:   1)  Vince Carter (my favorite player of all time)     The rest in no order:   2)  Damian Lillard (dude plays with so much heart)   3)  D'Angelo Russell   4)  LeBron James   5)  Trae Young
"&gt; Bron didnt feel like turning it on til the 4th  Seems like this is every game by the Lakers lol; Bron coasts for 3 quarters and focuses more on distributing/playmaking, but then 4th quarter he's like ""oh yeah, fuck, I'm LeBron James"" and then decides to score at will"
Lolol that's lowkey perfect. I guess that makes LeBron [Jay Z](https://kingjamesgospel.com/2017/03/28/cleveland-cavaliers-lebron-james-jay-z-beef-deshawn-stevenson/)
1) LeBron James 2) Anthony Davis 3) DeMar  4) Delon Wright 5) Danny Green
1)  LeBron James 2)  James Harden 3) Luka Doncic 4) Stephen Curry 5) Aron Baynes
&gt; Lebron James’ name starts with an L   I'm going to need an additional source for that before I believe it.
The review determined...... In the case of 35 year old LeBron James....... you were NOT out of bounds.

"Lebron James is still the best player in the world  On offense, he's still ridiculously varied and elite at so many different aspects of running an NBA offense. His BBIQ was on full display tonight with textbook lobs, handoffs, kickouts, etc. In addition, he was scoring pretty much at will without forcing them through fast breaks, 3's, fadeaways, post ups, etc.  On defense, he was everywhere, jumping passing lanes, plugging in leaks made from bad Lakers defensive rotations, denying easy layups, closing out on shooters, etc. Players rarely even tried to score on Lebron, instead taking advantage of Lakers switch defense to find a better matchup but Lebron routinely denied them this too.  Absolutely ridiculous. Makes the game look easy with his combination of BBIQ, athleticism, finesse, experience, and leadership."

Would you rather play for the Lakers and possibly win a title with LeBron James and live in Los Angeles or play for the losing Pelicans and live in New Orleans?
"Crowd is booing AD’s agent, LeBron James lol"
"That's no surprise. He's on the third axis of transcendence right now. Kyrie Irving moves in anti-planar reality (or prime-planar reality, shouts to my qmech nerds who really buy Frisch-Hayes.) While guards like Mike Conley or Chris Paul see the game from an x and o perspective, Kyrie has vision of the omega and delta factors surrounding any given basketball event. There's a reason Kyrie was able to lead LeBron James to the 2016 Finals. Put simply, Irving is visuospatial jazz. Think of Ornette Coleman or George St. Breux, not Goran Dragic or PatBev. The dorian stylings of a Eric Dolphy better describe Irving's game than a monotone listing-off of conventional basketball skills. Ball handles? When you're in constant tune with the precise Hz pitch of the hardwood like Irving, English words like ""good handles"" cannot encapsulate even a fractoid of the scientific and metaphysical majesty of Kyrie."
"Noones fucking forgotten how good AD is, we watched him for years, we were the only fanbase in history that was super supportive of his trade demand and were happy it happened at the time. We were annoyed with the constant pressure from the media, Rich Paul suffocating our trade partners, the bullshit at the all-star game in an intreview talking bout he never had a list then saying ""all 29 teams are on my list"", the obvious collusion with LeBron James and Rich Paul starting in September 2018 when he signed with Klutch then telling Pelicans teammates that there was a chance he would demand a trade mid-season, him not speaking up about it to Pelicans media and instead Coach Gentry and Jrue Holiday having to be his mouthpiece, the stupid fuckin t-shirt he wore in the final game, he took the piss out of the franchise, that's why we are booing."
"I was going to give you a legitimate response until I read your username.  The Heatles record without James was 9-9...I don't think you know how bad the Cavs were or what the word horrendous means..  I'm also not sure if all of those games had both Wade and Bosh playing.   Do you know how many games Bosh, Wade, and Dragic actually played the season after LeBron left... I'm going to guess you don't."
Imagine if LeBron James came to the Pelicans in 2018 and joined AD and Jrue
your team was one of the worst in the league last year with Lebron James on the roster.

"I did read it before, otherwise I wouldn't have commented my opinion on the matter. The article itself sees the the critical point, but avoids confronting it and instead just tried to vouch for Paul, only arguing the one side of it, his side, while never delving into the other sides besides the remarks below.  &gt; ""No one accuses Paul of writing shoddy contracts: He leaves such detail to attorney Mark Termini, focusing on the modern agent’s game—recruiting, caretaking and strategic planning. Few argue that he’s not superb at the first two, though the LeBron connection makes it hard to parse where his talent ends and James’s aura begins. &gt;  &gt; Paul and James officially went into business together—with Carter and Mims—when they formed LRMR Marketing in 2006. Paul’s decision to depart for agency work was less a break than an expansion; in 2008 he began training under Leon Rose, James’s CAA agent, and within a year landed his first first-rounder, Syracuse guard Jonny Flynn, then in quick succession Bledsoe, Tristan Thompson and Cory Joseph. NBA rules prohibited LeBron, as a player, from having a stake in Klutch when Paul opened shop in 2012—and the league has reportedly investigated Klutch to make sure there are no financial ties—but in a sense that doesn’t even matter. The perception then, as now, was that James had a proprietary interest in Rich Paul. It’s an asset Paul has never had a problem flashing. &gt;  &gt; “He is supportive,” Paul says. “And here’s my thing: When you got the hammer, you use it. """
Lebron James - 27/7/7
I think I could get acclimated to playing with LeBron James
"Its much more nuanced than that.  I highly suggest reading the sports illustrated article for starters.

"you lakers fans are *so* fucking tacky.  PG arguably betrayed my team and i should probably dislike him, but i don't.  his game is smooth and he plays some of the best perimeter defense in the league.  i can't help but enjoy watching good basketball.    yet you fuckers troll every single clippers thread or post.  i've never seen anything like it.  how insecure can you be?  you got fucking lebron james and anthony davis FOR NOTHING.  you ought to feel blessed instead of spending your time trolling a historically awful team from the same goddamn town."
"To keep all things fair, we keep Luka Doncic, you get LeBron James"
I don't think it's bullshit that LeBron took offense to Phil Jackson reducing the accomplishments of himself and his business partners by referring to them as a posse. It's not something that's overtly racist but the casual dismissal of the achievements of POC is a tough subject for a lot of people. But this is a 'Fuck LeBum James' post so we can just do the thing where we pretend race relations aren't complicated and there's nothing wrong ever because people aren't out here calling other people the N word
Fuck Lebron James
Yeah no I understood you're good. Truthfully for almost any top player you can find over a several hundred poss sample size at least one defender they perform alot worse against. Im not on my laptop right now so I cant post the specific stats but some ex   LeBron: Aaron Gordon  KD: Tony Allen back in the day  Steph: Ricky Rubio(not so much now)  Harden: Andre Iguodala and back in the day JJ Redick   Giannis: James Johnson   Anthony Davis: Marc Gasol   Paul George: Jrue Holiday   Dame: Back in the day Mike Conley and Chris Paul(not really now)  Kyrie: Klay Thompson and back in the day especially Chris Paul  KAT: Marc Gasol  Westbrook: Eric Bledsoe   Blake Griffin: Draymond and Al Farouq Aminu  We could go on and on but you get the point.
"Utah, New York, Deep down south, Texas, even some parts of LA. Especially near Lebron James house"
Lebron James and his group of people.... idk man sounds just as racist as posse imo. Neither are racist unless you make them racist in your head.
"Since we're talking about dreams:  Siakam hits the game winner to win our back-to-back  AD decides that LA is not where he wants to be after the Lakers get swept in the first round and enters UFA to join the Raptors  A starting lineup of Lowry, FVV, Siakam, AD, Gasol lead Toronto to three-peat in 2020 with Siakam winning his first MVP  The CBA negotiates a salary cap raise in 2021 allowing the Raptors to get another max agent slot to sign Giannis to form a lineup of Lowry, Giannis, Siakam, AD, Gasol with FVV, Ibaka, RHJ, OG as the bench.  The Raptors become the first team in history to go 83-0 and 16-0 in the playoffs. Adam Silver revives the Vancouver Grizzlies as a reward, Masai Ujiri becomes Prime Minister leaving the Presidency of the Toronto Raptors to the newly retired Lebron James, MVP runner-up Wiggins decides he wants to play closer to home and joins the Raptors on a vet-min."
"For those that don't want to get bombarded with ads from CBSSports:     Back in 2012, San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich caused quite the stir by sending Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker and Danny Green home ahead of the team's primetime matchup with LeBron James and the Miami Heat, which was the last game of a six-game road trip. The league acted swiftly, fining the Spurs $250,000 for what then-commissioner David Stern said was a ""disservice to the league and our fans.""  Seven years later, the debate about resting players is still going strong. Last season, the Toronto Raptors' load management plan for Kawhi Leonard seemed to be a tipping point. It's hard to argue with the results, as Leonard led the Raptors to their first title in franchise history, but the process still bothers many people -- including some in the league office.   As a result, the NBA has tried to clarify its rules on resting players, as well as using the term ""load management."" In a memo obtained by ESPN's Zach Lowe, the league indicated to teams that they are no longer allowed to say that players are sitting out due to load management. If they use that designation, they will be in violation of the league's resting policy, and subject to subsequent fines.   &gt;The short version: Load management is now rest. Period. If you see that term, it will mean a healthy player is taking the night off. If skipping that particular game violates the league's resting policy, that player's team will be penalized.   The resting policy prohibits teams from sitting healthy players in ""high-profile"" nationally televised games. It requires teams rest players at home absent some ""unusual circumstances,"" the idea being that home fans get many chances to see their teams' stars. The league also has instructed teams not to rest multiple healthy players in the same game, barring those same ""unusual circumstances.""  To ensure that teams are not tricking them with injury designations, the league has in-depth procedures that include submitting documented proof of examinations by team medical staff, as well as treatments players have received. Furthermore, if they want to sit a healthy player for rest, they must call the league at least 48 hours in advance.   While there are pretty easy ways for teams to get around these and other guidelines, it does put a procedure in place and tries to regulate the issue. At the same time, Lowe reported that the league has been flexible with the rules, allowing exceptions in cases of players with chronic injury histories, such as Leonard and 76ers center Joel Embiid. Furthermore, not all national TV games are treated the same by the league office.  As long as the league continues to play an 82-game regular-season schedule, the topic of resting players is never going to go away. The season is too long, guys are too athletic, games are too physical and travel is too demanding. Players get worn out, and over the long run they need to take nights off to rest.   At the same time, this is a sport played for fans, and they should be taken into consideration. It's a bummer to turn on a big national TV game and see stars sitting out, or buy tickets months in advance, only to find out your favorite player is taking the night off.   These points on both sides have been made time and again, and by now the various positions on the issue have been staked out. Unless there are major changes to the schedule, the league will continue to try and thread the needle to keep everyone happy, which is an impossible task, and will always result in some lackluster games, and unhappy fans. But at least with these new guidelines, there is some further clarity surrounding load management. "
"Dude. I assure you. If you watch us play basketball you'd understand people's gripes. It's an incredibly ugly outdated confusing brand of basketball that's just not fun to watch. I completely get the criticisms of not having a proper PG on the roster, but the solution isn't to turn Julius Randle into Lebron James. This is probably the most egregiously stupid thing that Fizdale won't walk back on. Starting Kevin Knox at SG when he's spent the last two weeks being beat on defense and looking dejected on offense. He bumbles around our roster, and even if something worked well he will simply abandon it so he can try out some stupid scheme. He's not a good coach and it shows through even with our roster."
"OP seems like he might be referencing [this](https://heatnation.com/rumors/cavs-executive-on-dion-waiters-problems-in-cleveland-dion-was-f-g-us-up-on-the-court/).  &gt;“After LeBron James returned, the Cavs finally moved on from Waiters and the offense roared to life with J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert supplementing an All-Star trio,” Lloyd wrote.  &gt;“‘If J.R. fucks up, it’ll be off the court,’ one team executive told me in the days after the trade. ‘Dion was fucking us up on the court.’  &gt;“As the Cavs start to put together pieces of this rebuild, it’s an important lesson to remember. When they became contenders, Waiters never embraced the role the organization envisioned for him as a catch-and-shoot 3-point specialist.

Kevin “LeBron James” Durant
I think Lebron James is the most realistic answer. I personally wouldn’t trade Anthony Davis for 22 year old anyone. That dude is more bananas than Donkey Kong and really doesn’t get enough acknowledgment for how ridiculously good at basketball he is.
"LeBron James: “Think we found Lonzo’s motivator.”  Lance Stephenson: “I’m gonna blow him so hard...”  LeBron: “WHAT?!?!?!”  Lance: “I mean in his ear... you know, like what I did to you a few years back?”  LeBron: “Oh okay, the ear part makes it normal.... maybe.” "
"depends on the odds obvi, but i'd side with lebron james. dude takes care of his body like no one else in NBA history"
"When Lebron James leaves our team, sure. "
"The award lost all it's flavor, we all know the actual player, with the most $$ value, is Lebron fucking James."
One team already has lebron james on it to be fair
&gt; LeBron James has been beaten by 2 teams in the past 7 years.  no?  18- dubs 17 - dubs 16 - win 15 - dubs 14 - spurs 13 - win 12 - win 11 - mavs  he's been beaten by 4 teams in the last 6-7 years and 5 teams in the last 8. 
He traded James Harden  and Lebron for Aldridge after tonight. 
"How many games did LeBron win against GSW?  (Hint: 0)  And yes, I know it's a team effort/cherry picking to say that.  And I'm not even saying James is better than James necessarily.  Just pointing out that a man led a team to a single digit game 7 against the greatest team in history, and if that doesn't change the bullshit ""Harden is a choker"" narrative, I don't know what will."
"Yeah I don’t think that matters. LeBron James has been beaten by 2 teams in the past 7 years. I get that he had different personnel, but his teams would always crumble without him. Look at what he does to the Warriors every year. I don’t see anyone in the west definitively beating the Lakers besides Golden State. "
Yea that’s what happens when you don’t have Lebron James come into town. You act like Lonzo didn’t average 7 assists with low turnovers last season lol... 
"this is the dr. j and james worthy side of ingram that needs more exploring. he is lethal in the semi-transition with his handles and length and creativity, we need to run lebron-ingram pnr after a 5 screens ingrams man as we bring the ball up, freeing up a mismatch for both lebron with the ball and ingram slipping or spotting up after the screen."
"That's not true at all. Lebron has a better defensive rating than Harden and guys like Durant and Kawhi and other MVP candidates and defensive specialists. Lebron is 190th in the league James Harden is 421st and this out of all 497 nba players. And if you actually watched the Lakers play Lebron has been very good on defense since November.  Giannis plays the Hawks, Cavs, Knicks, Bulls, and Wizards 4 times a year. I agree Giannis is the MVP though based on conventional MVP criteria. "
We’re also missing out second point guard and Lebron Fucking James on the road on the second half of a back to back. 
"Even if players don’t want to play with LeBron James, they probably want to play with Josh Hart. Honestly if I was in the NBA I would love to play with Hart. He’s a low-usage efficient player with high energy. He’s everywhere on the floor. "
We could have drafted Kwame Brown and Jahlil Okafor after those tanking years and it wouldn’t matter because we got Lebron James lmao.

No one told D'Angelo to rat on a teammate causing all those locker room issues and I'm not sure any amount of strict coaching staff would have prevented it.    When we traded D'Angelo Russel it raised some eyebrows but lets not forget what we got for it: the 27th pick  (KYLE KUZMA??) and getting rid of Mozgov's contract which ultimately turned into LEBRON FUCKING JAMES.  Yeah it would be nice if every player the Lakers drafted became all stars and I realize that report that went out about their infrastructure has fans shook, but Magic Johson and Jeanie Buss have been a god damn GODSEND to this team so lets cut them some slack here.  Also saying something like ""our player development suck"" just reeks of recency bias.  Was Julius Randle poorly developed?  He went to NOLA, saw his minutes rise, and his production has rose accordingly.  We've also ""poorly developed"" some late round draft picks into rotation/starters on good teams (Larry Nance, Kuzma, Josh Hart).  The Lakers free throw shooting needs to be addressed in the off season, 100%.  But to say the staff is to blame for Lonzo Ball or Brandon Ingram's offensive limitations is straight up ignorant in my opinion."
The Lakers fans victim complex is insane for a team that literally has LeBron James.
Lmao no one gives a shit when he plays well and efficient like the last two games. Y’all need to chill out. If he chucks everyone trashed. If he plays passive and efficient everyone says he needs to be more aggressive. Chill the fuck out it’s his second year. He’s not Lebron James 
should we be talking about James Harden in this thread instead? Or Lebron? 
I'd imagine there are like 3 dudes in the NBA with the strength and lateral quickness to actually guard Harden: Kawhi/LeBron/Maybe James Johnson. Crazy. 
Yeah if they offer the Pelicans Lebron James and Kuzma for AD
Yo Kelly Oubre or lebron James ? 
Bruh imagine a west playoffs with lebron James and AD on one team in Los Angeles. Shits gonna break viewership records
"His 07 team was bad, the current Heat are top 5 in defense and top 3 or 4 in rebounding. Even if you add LeBron to this team it doesn't make them good. I think his 07 playoff run was only impressive because he was 22, I don't think people would have cared that much otherwise. That Spurs series he had no chance if winning either way but Pop and the Spurs really disturbed him. They basically forced him to take jumpshot on the biggest stage in basketball at 22, realistically I don't think he could have done much better. Even if you put 22 year old Kobe or Jordan on that team who were much better shooters Pop would have schemed something to stop them since they were still young and relatively inexperienced.  All your other points are agreeable except for 2015/2016.  That series for LeBron is legendary, and will continue get more legendary as time passes on. I personally don't buy that Curry was injured, or injured enough to drastically effect his play that much. While Kyrie played like the 2nd best player Curry was still the 2nd best player in that series, or the best as many people thought Curry took that title from LeBron that year. I think we give to much shit for players not performing well and not enough credit to the opposing teams coaching and defense, the Cavs slowed down Curry not his ""injuries"". And the Draymond suspension doesn't really hold up when LeBron scored 41 anyway when he came back, we obviously don't know. The Bogut injury was definitely the biggest reason the Cavs won, but it's something that will be forgotten. Just like how no one brings up Magic and James Worthy missing games in the 91 finals.  I think people play up the 3-1 thing before the Warriors were far and away the better team, and how LeBron brought his team back when his back was against the wall. And no matter what winning 3 straight games against a Finals team is impressive regardless of circumstances."
"The only thing missing was which MVP candidates were yet to be rejected by Jarrett Allen at the rim, there's not many left I don't think.

"They’ll do the same if the Lakers move Lonzo or Ingram. It’ll be “LOL Magic” but let’s forget that they basically gave these guys up in a long-term plan to get LeBron James and managed to get back Kuzma, who I’d rather have over both Randle and Russell. "
"One season is not a credible sample, lebron has never won a title being the only star, I don't care how close he got if he didn't do it, nobody cares that jordan made it real close in '89 against the pistons, its rings or bust and lebron has echoed that himself. If after three championships your still using 'almost' to bolster lebron's career your doing him a disservice.  What I'm saying is that  KD is going to be 30 years old with 3 championships and maybe even 3 finals mvp's, same as ol' bron bron. He also has plenty of time to leave and try to carry his own team like lebron did at age 30, or he can stay with golden state, rack up a russell amount of championships and drop 30k+ points. If lebron never wins a championship again and KD has 5+ rings with the numbers he regularly puts up, he would easily be put in the conversation right there with james if not above.  These two players are both so good, I don't know why reddit chimpos like you have to compliment one by blasting the other, especially with shitty arguments like 'he never won a ring in that one season he didnt play with an all star' despite the fact lebron has not either."
"As an unbiased laker fan who loved D’Lo I’d take Lonzo at this point of his career than sophomore D’Lo. Not to mention the fact trading D’Lo was the reason we signed Lebron fucking James, it seems like you guys dissed us for our cap situation for 2 years and seemed to forget all about it when we traded Mzogov and Deng.   Not to mention that guy Kuzma that you’re saying is our best young player by far was in the D’Lo trade and has been better than D’Lo. I don’t care about some “technically you had the 28 pick and could have still got him” that’s still unknown and spurs could have traded for the nets pick as they were interested in him. You guys only use technicalities when it’s against us but when we say “technically getting rid of D’Lo made us get Lebron you guys come up with other bullshit.  You guys don’t even try credit lakers lmao “ugh you got a super promising prospect at 27, that ain’t shit you’re supposed to take risks at that position in the draft” bro what kind of fucking excuse is that.  "
"**Hedo Turkoglu, now a chief adviser to the president of Turkey**  These are words that I would have never bet on hearing.  3-1 Comeback - I'd believe it over this  Delonte West and Lebron James' Mom - I'd believe it over this  Paul Peirce shitting his pants against the Lakers in the Finals - I'd believe it over this"
"Exactly, D’Lo is playing decent but he’s averaging 18 points on 50% TS in his 4th year, the pick we traded him for is averaging 18 on 56% TS but somehow it’s always “you could have always drafted Kuzma” like the spurs weren’t interested in him lol.  Not to mention that cleared the space to sign Lebron James lmao, the guys talking shit about us would trade their whole team to sign Lebron let alone a point guard who can’t defend and has terrible efficiency."
I think it worked well for both teams. Lakers got LeBron James from the cap space they acquired by shipping away DLo and Mozgov. Nets get a young talent they can develop. 
"well if you find can similarily talented players who can shoot that aren't named LeBron James, please let me know."
"[Nope, no HGH here](http://upl.stack.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/LeBron-James-New1.jpg)"
"    Both do things the other couldn't. I think lebron has a better overall game when it comes to understanding every other player's role on the floor and being to play virtually all of those positions; and if it's possible, is a better athlete. He's (james) definitely a better passer. Jordan was a better scorer and a better man up defender, a more consistent three point shooter, and developed a much better isolation game. Jordan's heart and will to win are unmatchable. That dude was a machine. Competitive in everything he did/ does... once MJ got to the top, it wasn't taken from him, he only relinquished it...      It's hard to argue across a generation gap. Being born in 81, I'm fortunate to be old enough to have seen the prime to the end of Jordan's career. I don't remember his struggles against Detroit... to me he's invincible... To say MJ isn't the best is just wrong. If you're a millennial... you just can't understand how good the dude was. In 20 years we'll see if there's a three way argument between MJ, Lebron, and the next big thing..."
"Lakers GM Lebron James walked into Luke Walton’s office and fired him after the Lakers loss, league sources tell ESPN. Walton was not surprised at the timing, had an idea his ouster was imminent. Lebron hadn’t been a fan of his assistant coach."
"Michael &gt; Lebron  Lebron James playoff campaign last year (34 ppg, which people thought was absurd) was what Michael Jordan did in almost every single playoff campaign in his career. "
LeBron James has been the MVP every year since his return to Cleveland. 
I'd like to punch a frozen condom full of shit into LeBron James ass hole.  
"I didn't say TMac played in that series, I'm just using it as an example of a team that took the eventual champion to 7 games that no one cares about. And again, I'm not comparing him directly to TMac. I'm saying in context of TMac not being remembered and talked about because Kobe, Shaq, Iverson, Carter etc are, Harden won't be remembered and talked about because LeBron, Steph, KD and the next guys up will be. Maybe I'm wrong, and again I don't think Harden is worse than TMac or Iverson or anyone there, but I think he'll be forgotten a bit when we look back in 10 years. We'll look back at LeBron and Harden will have a little blip on the stats table, like TMac did in this one, and it'll be look oh cool, James Harden."
AD LAKERS LETS GO. I don’t care who leaves as long as it’s not LeBron James I don’t care
"Long ago, the two conferences lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when LeBron James attacked. Only the Raptors, master of two countries could stop LeBron, but when the world needed them most, they vanished. A full year has passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, a weird laughing nibba named Kawhi, and although his basketball skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he can laugh in public again. But I believe Kawhi can save the world."
"And he’ll say the same about any stick thin perimeter big.   Man, people are so useless. LeBryan Nash from OSU was meant to be a huge star and they hyped him up on SLAM, ESPN etc.   He was fucking shit. But his name was a mix of LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash. I literally kid you not. He was touted as the next big thing when he went to State because of his fucking name.   He did 4 years and now probably has a 50k a year 9-5 job.   “High ceiling tho”"
"LEBRON JAMES, STOP LEAVING AND MAKING TEAMS WITH 2-3 OTHER SUPER STARS"
We will draft LeBron James Jr! 
"0.0  Ball-dominant players rarely make who don't play well off ball better. They just share positions on the court. Lonzo doesn't compliment Lebron like we hoped he would, and I really wanted him to.   http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23684417/kevin-pelton-weekly-mailbag-does-lebron-james-make-teammates-better "
"He's attacked just about as often as any other hyped up young player.  Any young player in the spotlight is gonna have the the magnifying glass put up to their faults.  Especially if they play on the Lakers.  With LeBron James.  It's fine, it's part of NBA fandom."
"LeBron: “Man, Magic we need a new coach, I just don’t think things are working out right now.”  Magic: “You got it, and I know just the guy....”                     Tyronn Lue: “LeBron James, how’s my favorite head coach been doing?!?”         "
Lebron will take the Lakers to the finals as well.  Durant is great but not as great as James.
"He didnt add Lebron James his second year. And I am not the one comparing the two of them, you are now."

Cavs woulda swept them. Do you know who LeBron James is?
Harden is a career 23.5 scorer. In the playoffs he's a career 22 point scorer.  Lebron is a career 27.2 scorer. In the playoffs he's a career 28.9 scorer.  Lebron is the better scorer. Stop overreacting to a bunch of December games. And don't ever put Harden in the same breadth as Michael Jordan and Lebron James again.
"Oscar Robertson, LeBron James, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson...  Do these names mean anything at all to you ?"
ah bc drose and cov are comparable to lebron james
"None of the guys are. Ingram is the most experienced in his 3rd year. We were all calling Oladipo a bust too in his third year.   People just like shitting on the Lakers even though plenty of teams would struggle when they are missing fucking Lebron James especially with how he plays. (Not faulting him, teams just become dependent on him.)   I’d love to see Denver without Jokic, Philly without Embiid, Jazz without Gobert. Even the Warriors were struggling without Steph and they had 2 other stars to pick up the slack. "

It's not but does it really make sense to post a reddit link that takes you to a twitter post that then takes you to WaPo without adding any value to the content?    Example A: Reddit link to retweet of an NYTimes article from Lebron James Example B: Reddit link to retweet of an NYTimes article from Lebron James with a comment or emoji as additional commentary.     You'd probably be down with Example B getting posted here but Example A is kinda dumb... just post the original article from NYTimes. 
"&gt; “If Luke asks me, I’ll give him my perspective. He’s a fantastic individual and extremely smart basketball player,” Brown said about James. “He knows the game inside and out on both ends of the floor. Luke should feel extremely lucky, blessed and fortunate, like anybody who has had a chance to coach LeBron and be able to work with him. There’s no magic in it. He’s a great guy and you coach him as you see fit. He’ll buy into anything you say. Best of luck to them both, except when they play us.”  This is what Mike Brown had to say"
"Lebron James for Anthony Davis, who says no?"
I miss Bosh. When he had to step up he did. I remember Lebron and Wade were out once and I think Wade missed a couple of games during one of the seasons as well (looking at NBA ref he missed a whole bunch) and it was Lebron + Bosh. He played his role so well.  https://nationalpost.com/sports/basketball/nba/heat-survive-triple-overtime-thriller-without-lebron-james
"“Let me trade!” Lebron James shouted at Lakers GM Rob Pelinka after hitting several players in a scrimmage 2 weeks ago. After another hit, James pleaded: “give him a motherf—cking Peicans jersey!” Pelinka wouldn’t — only Lakers — and now Walton, Lakers are headed for divorce”"
"Kevin Durant has literally been on the all NBA first team with LeBron James multiple times.   Gobert won DOPY last year, so he was voted a better defensive player than Joel embiid, so it's pretty safe to say that he was better than Embiid.  "
It was exactly a salary dump. It was always a salary dump. Now the Lakers have Lebron James.
The traded cleared enough cap space to get Lebron James really backfired man.

"Honestly lol. James Harden and Paul George are fantastic players and are on a tear right now but if you're trying to stay true to the name of the award....

"Lmao Salt. Lebron James effect, and Kuz is something like 3 years older"
Hot take: The lakers **needs** LeBron James
What a great game by L0nz0 Ball. He scored the same amount of points as the Lakers two scoring leaders Kyle Kuzma and LeBron James combined.
"As I said before. Jokic and his cast aren’t better than the curry, Klay, dray warriors. Lebron pulled out a win on them.  I am not discrediting was your team at all, I really like your guys. But you’re talking about LEBRON JAMES. The guy that’s only topped (arguably) by Michael Jordan.  Anyone short of golden state (a team with two guys who will be top 15 all time) isn’t going into a series with Bron as the favorites to win it.  Joker is a superstar. Gary and Jamaal are studs and then you got my guy trillsap, but vs Lebron you literally need to assemble a team that’s all time level to defeat him.  As for LA making the playoffs, we’re not worried right now. LeBron has a whole level of play that he reserves for emergency situations and if shit hits the fan a little later in the season we’re gonna watch him drag that overrated lakers squad into the playoffs regardless."
How quick people forget about PG13 and LeBron James epic battles. 
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

The fact that they were a game above when one team has LeBron James and the other features Tobias Harris as its best player is pretty significant. I can't believe I'm having to argue that having the GOAT GM involved in your team's front office is actually a good thing.
You think   &gt;But the man can pass the rock as good as any Small forward in history not named Larry Bird or LeBron James  Is reasonable?   None of this shit is reasonable at all
Is LeBron James the most OVERRATED superstar this league has EVER seen ?
"1. Giannis Alphabetsoup  2. James Harden  3. Kevin Durant  4. Lebron James  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Anthony Davis  7. Steph Curry   8. Paul George  9. Kawhi Leonard  10. Joel Embiid   If you don't have the Greek Freak top 2 then you aren't watching.   I fucking hate Harden but if you look at that supporting cast and look at the standings you can't deny he's amazingly effective.  I'm weighing health a little more heavily than most. Kawhi has gotten a lot of scheduled rest and Curry has missed a bunch of games. Now Lebron is missing this stretch he may drop a few places if Jokic and AD continue on like this.   I'm still on the AD bandwagon and the Pelicans essentially play without even a backup level SF.   It's just my opinion but I feel like Joel Embiid still has some attitude issues that takes his team out of games, he's overall a huge net positive and the true driving force behind their success, I just feel like they could be even MORE successful."
"People forget every year.    I am on this sub for some time already and I see this kind of post every damn year.    LeBron James is not the best player in the league because od the regular season. He is playing on ~70% usually and you can clearly see that when playoffs come. He turns into a whole new level, the level on which other players can't (or can, but not consistently for years)."
Lebron James’ decline will BREAK THE NBA!
"MJ is the Zeus of basketball. There shouldn't be any debate. The numbers speak for themselves.  LeBron James would never come close to breathing the same air as MJ.  MJ average 30+ ppg for a career while shooting 50%. Played in a more defensive era. Prime MJ would be averaging 40+ppg in this offensive centered era easy. Took two years off in his prime which is the reason why the rockets have two championships. 6 for 6 in the games biggest stage. LBJ has literally flatout choked in the Finals 2011,2014 and 2015. You can't call yourself the GOAT if you have choked those many times in the finals.   For the ones that say, ""oh well MJ had Pippen and he couldn't had won without Pippen."" They didn't win rings when MJ retired in the mid 90s eventhough they were competive. MJ comes back from a two year layoff and they go on a threepeat. Every championship team has had a superstar with at least one sidekick. So to say that MJ only won because he had Pippen is dumb. LeBron James has needed more than one to win.   The fact that you can take two years off and then comeback and win three straight that's unbelievable. Speaks to the otherworld basketball powers that MJ posseses. I am under the assumption that he is the only player that you can drop in any era and would dominate everyone easily.   Not saying LBJ is not one of the greatest but comparing him to MJ is disrespectful. MJ sits on Mt. Olympus by himself. This LBJ vs MJ debates are getting silly.  "
"Yea, honestly I feel like some of these athletes are happy to enjoy easy PR and don't do nearly enough to facilitate the harder discussions.   LeBron James totally brushed off the issue of rappers using anti-Semitic tropes in their lyrics.   Men having children they don't raise is a massive problem in the black community, strongly correlated with all kinds of negative outcomes from education to incarceration to future earnings.   Dwyane Wade shat out a love child he's not raising and STILL went out there promoting his book about what an amazing father he is to the children he is raising.   I've always thought that was such a damaging message, it really changed my opinion of Wade. "
"oh I didn't know we were referencing players like we knew them personally.  I see James alot when it is referencing LeBron like ""BLOCKED BY JAMES"".  And James is hardly a unique name like Kobe or LeBron.  Just my first time seeing someone use his name so personally."
"Does James Harden have more emphasis on the fact that he won MVP than any other MVP winner ever? It doesn't seem like it can be a good Harden day without every single poster mentioning that he won it, whereas you usually see it mentioned offhand for guys like Westbrook or Lebron."
"A little story about LeBron tonight  I haven’t seen anything about this yet, but during the first half of the Lakers and Warriors game,  Bron went up for a layup and came down hard on a camera man. Lebron seemed hurt on his right shoulder and the camera man had his hand over his face and was unresponsive. However the was no whistle so play continued. LeBron went to get up to run back but saw the man was hurt and was hesitant to run back. There was a foul on the other end while he was running back. He immediately walked back to the man in the floor and yelled at the cameraman ""That one right there made me the greatest player of all time""  The camera man got up after a couple of minutes and the crowd cheered for him. Nice to see the small act of power from James. "
"This is indistinguishable from the Harden travel that he does every God damn game. Honestly I love the warriors, I think highly of Steph, but this is an entirely separate issue  James Harden is allowed to do an illegal move that affords him extra room that no other NBA players have the luxury of receiving. His foul-seeking playstyle and his ability to travel without penalty are infuriating from a NBA Fan's perspective. His playstyle and incredible numbers are not the result of him being incredible at basketball, even though he could be, they're the result of favoritism and league support.   I used to be frustrated with great players like LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Paul Pierce. I was frustrated because of how they played. They beat teams. James Harden wins games and fills stats without a shred of basketball dominance. He doesn't earn respect from a basketball standpoint. Basketball is something that transcends the NBA.  If you ever played against a James Harden style player in pickup basketball you would probably call him a bitch. That's all I can see during Houston games.  If you ever played against him in beer pong, he'd be trolling.   The basketball fan in me wants to see Harden become an all-time great player. But as long as every uncontested shot ends up with him on his ass, and he shoots over 15 free throws in a night, he is the exact opposite of what basketball should become.   If the league ever sees players become more like Harden, the sport will be vastly worse for it. And ultimately, that is why I am glad that they blew the whistle on Steph. I hope it leads to more.

You literally signed Lebron James dodo
When I was constructing fantasy trades to acquire LeBron James in a sign and trade during the offseason some dingus tried to tell me that Derrick White wasn't an asset.  Dingus!
"That's just patently false, the no respect part. He's been (erroneously) compared to Lebron fucking James. I'd say that's a lot of respect. "
"What kind of moron down voted this?   LeBron James is still the best player in the league.   Jesus, some people have a memory of a goldfish."

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever.

Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

Arnold trained with him and said he was freakishly strong. Modern nutrition and workout regimen would create some kind 7ft Lebron James-Shaq hybrid.
He wanted a long term deal and we weren’t willing to commit to tie up our cap space.   With Lebron signing we had both Kuz and James at the 4 and AD potentially on the horizon.   Randle is fine as your 3rd or 4th best player but his game has serious holes. 
"Here’s the statistical comparison to the other top shooting guards.  Harden is statistically very similar to both Kobe/Wade (ahead in WS/48, slightly behind in PER), while MJ is way ahead of all of them as far as playoff performance goes.  At some point we may need to ignore team success when evaluating these guys, as Harden has never played with an in prime superstar, outside of maybe 1 season with prime Durant before getting traded. Otherwise he had post prime Dwight Howard and post prime Chris Paul, who he didn’t even get for an entirety of a playoff run and likely would have won a championship of Paul had stayed healthy.  Wade had post prime Shaq and then prime Lebron/Bosh, and Kobe got prime Shaq and prime Pau Gasol.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Michael+Jordan&amp;player_id1_select=Michael+Jordan&amp;y1=2003&amp;player_id1=jordami01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kobe+Bryant&amp;player_id2_select=Kobe+Bryant&amp;y2=2016&amp;player_id2=bryanko01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Dwyane+Wade&amp;player_id3_select=Dwyane+Wade&amp;y3=2019&amp;player_id3=wadedw01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id4_select=James+Harden&amp;y4=2019&amp;player_id4=hardeja01&amp;idx=players"

James Jones and LeBron
Offensive performance alone it’s one of the best seasons we’ve seen maybe ever. But he’s still James Harden on defense.   Kobe LeBron and Jordan played defense along with their offensive performance. 
Yeah Lonzo knocking down those open 3's from Lebron James is the perfect fit. He look like Kyrie Irving out there with Lebron.
"You kind of unintentionally aid my point here. Maybe Wade does win another if LeBron posts up Barea, but maybe Wade never sniffs the ECF if LeBron doesn’t rescue him from purgatory. After Wades first chip, he was either knocked out in the first round or missed the playoffs entirely for the next 4 seasons, in the much weaker eastern conference.   James Harden has never had the talent surrounding him that Wade has, and when he has had anything remotely close, he’s made the team a legit championship contender in the more difficult conference. Two of those occasions, he’s faced the *greatest team of all time*, and maybe even beats them if his team is healthy. That’s why I don’t boil it down to rings when discussing the two.   Sampling their primes (harden since joining Houston and wade from 04-05 through 10-11) harden has averaged more points, rebounds, and assists on a higher eFG and TS, higher oRTG, more win shares, higher VORP etc. "

"I think it's because, in the weirdest way (which is my way of saying, this is based on my gut more than statistical evidence), the Bucks and the Sixers most closely resemble the Lebron James Cavaliers, the team that these Celtics were originally constructed to defeat.  We're 1-1 against the Bucks this season. We only lost to the Bucks by 13 and we had a sophomore PF and a rookie as our centers. I fear the Raps and the Pacers. I think we can take the Sixers and the Bucks."

How is his whole game based on refs blowing the whistle?  He's averaging 25ppg if you don't count ANY free throws as well as 8.3 asts.  But why should he be punished for drawing contact?  Look at the top 10 Free Throw shooters in the NBA this season:  |Rk|Player|FT|FTA|FT%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|James Harden|9.8|11.3|.863| |2|Joel Embiid|8.0|10.0|.801| |3|Giannis Antetokounmpo|6.5|9.3|.701| |4|Anthony Davis|7.4|9.1|.813| |5|Kevin Love|6.8|8.3|.818| |6|LeBron James|5.3|7.8|.682| |7|Kevin Durant|6.9|7.6|.911| |8|Kawhi Leonard|6.5|7.6|.846| |9|Blake Griffin|5.8|7.6|.759| |10|Damian Lillard|6.0|6.7|.904|  Should none of these guys be getting calls?  Surely Embiid and Giannis shouldn't be going to the line this much either right?  Do you think their entire game is based on refs blowing the whistle?

"since this is hypothetical i guess we are not taking contracts into consideration. otherwise trading 4years of a generational guy for an expiring kyrie doesnt make sense.  lez say u get full 4 years of both player but the health question-mark (for james) remains.  i wouldnt trade my franchise-player away, bron is better than jokic or giannis but he has no relationship to the fanbases same as those guys. those kind of players get some special love from their fanbase and an simple upgrade wont be enough to satisfy the fanbase.  a player like kyrie isnt ""boston"" for me. there are rumors of him leaving, i dont see him as attached to boston. same with kawhi, lebron would prolly perform worse in those 4 years but i could sell more tickets.  curry? no  harden? no  in summary, franchise-players i wouldnt, very good - not franchise-defining players probably."
If you can't think of any players feel free to comment yes or no to whether you would trade the following players for Lebron James. No meaning that you would rather keep the player.      A) James Harden   B) Kawhi Leonard   C) Giannis Antetokounmpo   D) Devin Booker   E) Luka Doncic

"&gt; I've always found it interesting that despite the difference in popularity of the actual leagues themselves, NBA stars are often bigger celebrities than guys in the NFL. I don't think any NFL player is as much of a household name as Lebron James or Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant.  Basketball is an international sport and the NFL isnt.  Just take a look were  NFL stars are in this list:  http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/page/WorldFame/espn-world-fame-100-2018"
"NFL regular season games have higher viewership than NBA finals games.  There's a fairly vast ocean of difference in terms of popularity.  And honestly, it's a lot to do with a couple things.   Football is extremely easy to follow as a casual fan. There's only 16 games in the regular season, there's a pretty decent parity level (relative to basketball, in particular) and the playoffs are single elimination.  the NFL's marketing is far far better than the NBA's. Sunday in the United States practically *belongs* to the sport. You ask someone what they're doing on a sunday, there's decent odds that football is a part of that. It's also seen as somewhat patriotic, as people outside the U.S don't really care about the sport. Patriotism is important to people in the U.S.  I've always found it interesting that despite the difference in popularity of the actual leagues themselves, NBA stars are often bigger celebrities than guys in the NFL.

"The ""company"" James Harden had on his team last year is 10x better than the Lakers supporting cast outside of LeBron. "
hate agreeing with this guy but Lebron is definitely right below Jordan all time and James Harden is in the regular season
Curry plays on a better team and that gives him the luxury of being used less. Again I'm not disrespecting curry's game or his workload. He's the greatest shooter of all time. But he still hasn't ever had the workload James harden has. Only lebron has carried his team the same way harden is currently.
Wtf does Lebron have to do with James Harden’s MVP chances.
this james harden delusion on this sub is so fucking bad. its eclipsing the lebron/lakers delusion
"I mean there are valid reasons to dislike him. He flops a lot. He gets away with travels because a good portion of his step backs are legal under new traveling rules, so even the ones that aren't get ignored. He scores a ton off of free throws which people don't enjoy watching. It's like watching a quarterback who can do it all but, mostly gets scores off checkdowns in the red zones.  It gets the job done, but it's not necessarily interesting. A good example is comparing say Alex Smith versus DeShaun Watson. Alex Smith is a good quarterback, but Watson is a lot more entertaining. If James Harden was in the NFL, he'd be a checkdown QB who could make big plays. Curry would be a Mahomes type. LeBron would be Cam Newton type.  People rather watch a bomber like Mahomes or a versatile player like Cam than a checkdown QB who once in a while makes a big play. Now this is obviously oversimplifying things because Harden makes plenty of big plays, but the dude averages 10 FT on 22 shots. His FTr is .487. Which means he's expected to take a free throw every two shots.  Kobe eclipsed .400 5 times in his career. Over .450, 3 times in his career. Over .500 twice. Harden has never gone under .415. .487 is his lowest besides that .415 year which was his rookie season.  I'm not on that fuck James Harden train, but you must be kidding if you think people don't have valid reasons to dislike him."

"Stephen Curry is the better player.   James Harden is the better scorer.  Stephen Curry is the better defender.  I would start a team with the greatest shooter of all time, a top finisher in the league, and has a gravitational impact on his teammates that only LeBron can compare to."
"Well, when you trade Anthony Davis and then re-sign him to a contract, on top of already having LeBron James signed through 2021, you probably aren't as concerned with your future so much as your present. The Lakers would still have Kuzma, Hart, Zubac, Wagner, Bonga, and Svi all under contract for cheap going forward still, and you still have all that cap space for the summer of 2019 to either add another superstar type player and fill out the rest of the roster accordingly.   Maybe they can save themselves from giving up every pick but New Orleans will want multiple, and other teams, namely Boston, will be willing to oblige them of multiple picks for Anthony Davis, and the Lakers only have their own to bargain with.  And really, building a title team is not really about having young guys on cheap rookie contracts. That's just the beginning of the process. The point is to maximize the value of those players while they are still on those rookie contracts. Either trading them for players that are already excellent players while their value is highest (Andrew Wiggins for Kevin Love, or Daario Saric + Covington for Butler), or, if you hit big on one or two of those cheap rookies, you use the cap space you hopefully preserved by having cheap guys on rookie contracts, to sign an impact player before you have to max out those rookies. Having those late draft picks in the 20's can help preserve your team after you've built them into a contender if you hit on them consistently, but not everyone is the Spurs in that regard, and most of the time 20 year olds aren't ready to win basketball games at the highest level anyway, and while a 10 year vet is more expensive and less valuable in the long run, if you're willing to pay extra, the value on return for the minimum salary vet seems to be a better buy for a team trying to win a title than paying a late first round rookie scale for two years.   The Warriors have kept most of their 1st round picks over the course of their run, and it's resulted in Jacob Evans, Damian Jones, Kevon Looney, and Jordan Bell. Jordan Bell is a nice hit in the 2nd round, but after that, all these guys basically help contribute to the narrative that the Warriors are thin beyond Iggy/Livingston now.  They make it work still because they're the Warriors, but it doesn't really work out well for most other teams.   "
"In an interview earlier in the season he said this:   ""We talk about patience but you can’t have reoccurrence of the same thing,” James told reporters. “If you are doing the same things over and over and over and expecting the same result then that’s insanity.   “So we have to get better. We can’t keep having the same mistakes over and over.”  “You probably don’t want to be around when my patience runs out,” James added. “I’m serious.”  So I think it's fair to conclude that while LeBron is probably willing to see this season through, and he's publicly said he knew what he was getting into, he's probably not going to be very happy if the Lakers don't get another marquee player and keep struggling next season.

Pat Riley is considered a top 5 coach of all time. Yet the showtime are mythical beyond belief.   Also, Wade won a championship without Lebron, and was a top 5 player in the league. People (rightfully) lauded his unselfishness to hand the keys to Lebron despite being the greatest Heat of all time. Yet Steph is getting knocked for it. That’s hate. "
Still have LeBron James. 
"Lebron James on Kyrie Irving: “Anxious to see him. We don’t talk at all. He’s always going to be a part of my thoughts. I always felt like a biological father to him over the years, and he’s been my son. He’s just a kid for life, and somebody I will always care for.”"
"LeBron is the single most valuable player in the NBA over the last decade plus, I don't think many will dispute that. As a lifelong cleveland fan, it was readily apparent what his impact was on our team. Who are your ""good number of players"" though? Watching a rookie baker Mayfield damn near sneak into the playoffs after an abysmal start and previous season, it's hard to compare that to an NBA rookie. I mean, that would be like taking a 10-72 team, putting a number one pick on it, having him sit the first 12 games to watch then start 0-12 and then finish the season with 40 wins. Tom Brady has pretty much as much roster turnover as LeBron has had in his career, and rarely has elite offensive supporting cast. He's had gronk for years, but how often is he healthy? Either way, if you gave me a choice between starting a football team with James harden or Russell Wilson (Fairly comparable amongst their peers in their sports) I take Wilson 10 times out of 10. A mediocre supporting cast won't win you crap in the NBA, but a mediocre team with a star QB can definitely win you a superbowl. "
James Harden is going to have to go into LeBron mode with all this carrying yes going to have to do.
I love Luka as much as the next stan but Jesus fuck this is ridiculous.   Does LeBron James not exist?
"That’s a myth, most good players perform almost exactly the same once you adjust for added volume coming from playing extra minutes (which doesn’t apply to Kyrie, who played almost exactly the same number of minutes in the playoffs). Even James Harden’s only notable change in the playoffs is his efficiency, and even that isn’t a massive drop.  Guys that perform significantly better in the playoffs like LeBron and Kawhi, or significantly worse like DeRozan, are actually extremely rare."
Lebron James....
When lebron James and rajon rondo (both in the top 5 apg leader last year) are on your team - 5.3 is a pretty decent average.
"The Lakers have LeBron, which automatically puts them into ""try and win now"" mode before James gets too old; they no longer have a choice about whether to develop naturally or not. That said, the media's constant LA free agency whining isn't about that so much as it is about hyping up a big media market."
"What crushed LeBron was only being able to rely on Korver who had no business being worked on so much vs the Celtics and Raptors, Love did show up a lot but TT , Jeff Green and Hill were question marks and the trade deadline addition s along with JR were mostly just wasting mins.   James bailed them out of Indiana in game 7 then took over vs Toronto to get rest and still had to give it all to push Boston while trying to have a solid 3rd player.   I remember very well LeBron laying flat after beating Boston with his knees iced out while the rest of the starting 5 was struggling to tell Doris how it's a team effort. It was shown that this Cavs team had one of the worse supporting cast (showing LeBron really carried them there).    I too wanted LeBron to win 2 but you just knew Kerr would patch around LeBron (finally) doubling down GS's plan to let LeBron score and tire himself as long as the rest of the Cavs are kept useless."
LeBron James
"Playoff Giannis, if you’d prefer. Significantly better over the last two years than Kyrie has been, who may be the single most overrated playoff performer of all time.  Here’s an outstanding comment by u/dropdatdurkadurk about his playoff history:  &gt; Yeah it really is the LeBron effect.  &gt; In no way is Kyrie a bad playoff performer by any means. But his ""clutch playoff assassin!!"" reputation is overstated and a byproduct of literally one shot.  &gt; 1.	⁠For his career in standard crunchtime settings in the playoffs Kyrie is a 28% shooter. Ive looked these stats up for many players that 28% figure is bottom level amongst stars this century. For ex CP3 scores at about 2X the rate that Kyrie does in such situations. 2.	⁠The privilege of playing with LeBron meant that people only focused on Kyrie's good playoff moments and whenever he didn't play well it got overlooked or if they lost all the blame went to LeBron  &gt; a) The first 2 games of the 2016 and 2017 NBA Finals: Kyrie averages 20 PPG on 45% TS. Look at the history of teams down 2-0: their success rate isn't much higher than being down 3-1 we just only remember the cases when teams come back from it(like in 2016). Ie sucking the first two games of the Finals matters.  &gt; b) First two rounds of the 2017 NBA playoffs: 50% TS. But LeBron goes HAM those two series and the Cavs sweep so nobody says anything.  &gt; c) In game 6 of the 2016 NBA Finals Kyrie was AWFUL the 2nd half. 1/7 for 3 points. The Cavs were doing all they could to have a 2015 Game 6 LAC vs HOU type collapse as a 24 point lead got cut to 8 early in the 4th. But LeBron goes king kong mode so nobody notices or cares about Kyrie.  &gt; d) The first 4 games of the 2015 East Semis vs Chicago: Kyrie 18 PPG 36% FG. But LeBron hits a GW to prevent Cle from going down 3-1 and bails everybody out so NBD.  &gt; For perspective: Kyrie the ""playoff assassin stats"" in playoffs: 24/5/3 57% TS. James Harden the ""playoff choker!!"": 28/7/5 57% TS while in Hou in the playoffs. Kyrie benefits from people just loving his style of play"
"Then James Harden is not more valuable than LeBron James. LeBron not with the Cavs, they go from Finals to the worse team in the league. Lakers looked playoff bound, now back to pre-LeBron Lakers."
"Sorta like how NFL refs give much more benefit of the doubt to people tackling Cam Newton than Drew Brees. You HAVE to either perfectly form tackle or hit the fuck out of Cam. A stiff wind could knock Drew down.    LeBron ""Super Soldier Serum"" James is a little harder to muscle out of the paint than most."
"You can check my top 20 list. It's a bit inconsistent though.   1. Michael Jordan   2. Bill Russell   3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   4. LeBron James   5. Shaquille O'Neal   6. Tim Duncan   7. Larry Bird   8. Wilt Chamberlain   9. Magic Johnson   10. Hakeem Olajuwon   11. Moses Malone   12. Kobe Bryant   13. Oscar Robertson   14. Julius Erving   15. Charles Barkley   16. Jerry West   17. Dirk Nowitzki   18. Stephen Curry   19. Kevin Durant   20. Elgin Baylor   It's easy to rank top 10-12 due to the names are pretty set and done and you can shift your criterias to match your opinion. But when you extend the list to 20 or 25, things start to get complicated.   BTW, the reason why I rank Bird and Magic a bit low is their longevity. This is purely about being the better basketball player. If you think like what he's done for the game, Jordan-Bird-Magic, these 3 would be the top 3.   Another side note, Kareem's college record makes me think about the list because this is mostly about NBA play. Entire career? Kareem dominated the all levels. "
Or Lebron James
It's good trade for you to talk now but back then it def not worth it if we trade young core for George when he is rumored to come anyways AND we didnt have Lebron James which won't get us anything. 
"That LeBron James pre-decision jersey OP linked is the only basketball jersey I own. Bought it in 2006 when I was 12 years old. I mean, my mom bought it. Good thing she insisted to buy the adult size, since it still fits me now. It's cool that now it's starting to be sort of vintage. "
"""LeBron James with no regard for human life!"""
LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE
"""There's a little bit in all of us that wants Lebron to be the GOAT, to be legendary and the best, to win titles and dominate.""   Um, thanks for telling me what I want. I DON'T think LeBron is the GOAT nor do I think he's close to it. And i also don't wish he wins another Chip. I respect Kobe way more than LeChoke &amp; LeFlop James. The Chip LeBron won against the Warriors doesn't prove his greatness to me either, to me it proves how much influence he has controlling the Media &amp; the League. He's a sore loser to me tbh. And I'm not salty about anything, i Just think he cries &amp; complains a lot. He always blames his teammates and never credits them the other way around.  He took all the Credit for the win against GS, yet the last time i watched that Game Kyrie made that unbelievable shot. Really, he doesn't belong into that GOAT conversation at all when it comes to me but thats just my 2 Cents."
Lol at you.  Here you go:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/report-kyrie-irving-has-issues-with-how-much-lebron-james-controls-the-ball/amp/
LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION!
"He doesn’t “have it all”. He doesn’t pass, isn’t much of a defender, and has no semblance of a shot, which is probably the most important part of today’s game.   I’m a Duke fan, so I watch him. He’s fun to watch, and he’s probably gonna end up a solid player, but giving up LeBron fucking James for him would be perhaps the dumbest thing ever. "

hear me out.. how about Lebron James
"Since the day I was born, my mama has always told me that I’m “too white” to do the things that I love to do. If I had a nickel for every time she said “you’re just a lil’ white boy,” I’d be sittin’ pretty. I wouldn’t have all this student debt, either. That’s for sure. Here’s the thing— she ain’t wrong, though. I’m what you call a “reverse Oreo.” On the inside, I’m an Atlanta-based trap lord who balls bigger than LaVar in his dreams. But, on the outside, I’m whiter than a fresh jar of marshmallow fluff. I know, it's tacky. But, I am what I am. I love to rap. . . which is not a particularly “white” activity. I love to play basketball, which is also not really known as a “Caucasian pass-time,” if you will. I even have dudes on my Y-League team that say I “talk gangster.” No one ever wants to be that guy. Alas, here I stand. Based on what I’ve said, one could understand why I have a certain appreciation for guys like Larry Bird or Steve Nash. Those were two dudes that, despite all odds, made it to the NBA looking like milk-truck drivers. Overall, LeBron James is my favorite player. But, it's always a little exciting when you see a white dude block him twice on the same play. That white dude is a man by the name of Luca Doncic. For us white kids, the athleticism of a LeBron James or a Russell Westbrook just isn’t really in the cards. I mean, we have Mac McLung at Georgetown puttin’ on for the honkeys. . . but other than that, there just isn’t that much God-given bounce to go around. I mean, the movie White Guys Can’t Jump didn’t just come out of nowhere. Stereotypes exist for a reason. However, Luca Doncic is quite athletic. He was doubted during the pre-draft process because scouts didn’t think he could adjust to the speed of the NBA after coming over from Europe. Yeah, I think he’s doing just fine. He hasn’t seemed to miss a step after being the MVP of the Euro League. He might not blaze past people like a Kemba Walker or Kyrie Irving, but he holds his own and makes it look easy around the basket as well. Speaking of finishes— for us white kids, the Euro-step was a staple if slashing was your game. It was a glorious move that created new space and angles for guys like Manu Ginobili. It was a cornerstone of white boy ballin’ until James Harden went and appropriated it. But, Luca Doncic did it right back. He went and appropriated that step-back jumper The Beard loves so much. Have you ever seen Doncic hit a step back that’s smoother than Harden’s? Because I have. I see it in every highlight reel that Luca has. And, he doesn’t sport a wack-ass beard while doing it. Double win. Now, this last one is something all basketball fans can relate to, especially if you play a lot of pick-up. You ever see a white guy make some nice moves on the court but he still looks really white while doing it? Like SO WHITE it kinda makes you a little itchy? Cough cough Joe Ingles cough cough. You know what I’m talking about, right? Anyway, Luca does all of these moves and looks smoother than butter dipped in olive oil. His game has so much finesse that he attended the same academy that Gunna rapped about on the hook of “YOSEMITE.” He’s out here making dudes look foolish, like they can’t believe they’re getting crossed up by a saltine in Nikes. Not only is Luca Doncic a baller and should be around for the next 12-15 years in the NBA, he puts a smile on my face. He is the next Great White Hope. He gives all of us charge-takers a glimmer of pride as we watch from our couches and talk about our JV glory days. He's our hero"
How? The Lakers were 22th in 3 PT shooting with Lebron James. Their 27th now
there are def players that have arguemts... or does lebron that many more accolades and championships than lez say KAJ that would make james the undisputable nr2?
He's covered like he's LeBron James.  Tyreke Evans did the same thing his rookie year and fell off once teams learned how to defend to. 
The best comfort I can think of is that if Jackson tries to pull the same shit he pulled with the Warriors on a team that has LeBron James on it he will last about *five fucking seconds*.  No way in hell will LeBron stand for that kind of fuckery. I think we'd find out what *actually* happens when LeBron James throws the fuck down with the front office.
LeBron James fucking dies this summer 
Curry has had 5 games of 45 points or more in his career with less than 5 FTA in the game. Jordan did it 4 times. LeBron James has done it once. Kareem did it 3 times. Most recent besides Curry is Jamal Murray
"When that player is LeBron James, yes, it is."

"Boss fight:   LeBron James Harden, legendary superstar"
"I always argue this over and over. Anyone who has played basketball at a relatively high level knows what I mean. 1 player having high assists is no way the better than a spread. It shows that 1 player has the ball for a long time. You need to pass and keep the ball moving.   LeBron stans never believe me when I say this, but it's 100% facts. If he actually runs more sets, learn to move without the ball, his teammates wouldn't always shit the bed (the narrative that LeBron's teammates always suck), and they would play within an offense.   Granted what harden is doing is phenomial, it is still being a ball hog and won't get him deep into the playoffs. The difference between him, Kobe and MJ is that they knew how to play off the ball and play off their teammates. Notice how their role players often went bonkers in playoffs series e.g. metta world peace?   When was the last time a role player went berserk on LeBron James' teams in the playoffs? "
"Again, I know why it's done, but I think that fear gets in the way of getting off the best possible shot. Yes, there is a lower chance of a turnover, but there is also a lower chance of the shot going in.   I know it's a small sample, but I found this:   ""Here’s a look at those four players and the field goal percentage of them in the following situation: - 24 seconds left in the game - game tying shot or go ahead shot  Kevin Durant 28.8%  Carmelo Anthony 47.7%  Kobe Bryant 29.4%  LeBron James 34%""  Would it go higher if they ran actual plays? Who knows? "
"He's also leading the league in USG% by a mile. Guess what, when you're trying to score a bunch people will foul you a bunch.

"In theory. In practice, it tends not to work.  Warriors built their championship dynasty starting from picks at 7, 11, and 35. Most championship teams are built on players picked lower down.  Here is a list of players selected #1 in the past twenty years who have won championships:  - Kyrie Irving (because LeBron James)  - Andrew Bogut (with the Warriors)  - LeBron James (because LeBron James)  That's it. List complete.  Bogut got one at the very end of his NBA career. He was a valuable contributor, but not the main star force of the team. Kyrie Irving got one because LeBron went back to Cleveland. LeBron has several because he's *LeBron fucking James*.  It's a bad strategy."
" Idk man, i think if a player could do that and win games (rockets are 16-6 on this streak) he would. Most players would get tired.  I don't remember seeing a player carry a team this way ever, not with an injured roster and a lack of any consistent scoring options. At this point defenses know it's all up to him and yet he keeps doing this.   Maybe it's my homerism coming in but i don't see any other player with the possible exception of one Lebron James who possesses this kind of otherworldly drive"
Hilarious that I can tune in to hear about LeBron James minute by minute updates when he hasn’t played for a month
"LOL WTF. What is this based on? Harden is having a down year from 0-3 feet this year, but for their careers Harden shoots 64% at the rim with Curry on 65%, Harden does so on a much higher volume with defenders usually closer to him.   In isolation Harden is pretty much one of the greatest ever. His volume and efficiency is unheard of. James Harden for the last few years:  [https://fadeawayworld.net/2018/08/04/top-10-best-isolation-players-last-season/](https://fadeawayworld.net/2018/08/04/top-10-best-isolation-players-last-season/)  12.2 isolation ppg last year, doubling LeBron. Steph is not even top 10. Lead the league in points per play as well with 1.22 points per play, so he was the most efficient iso player in the league.   Let's talk about driving. Harden is much better than Steph at drives. Harden generates 13 points per game on drives, shooting 53%, for instance doubles KD's points, at the same %. Steph shoots 1% better on drives at 5 points per game. So yeah I'd say Harden is much better at drives.   James Harden is better than Steph at many things, but Steph is better than Harden at many things as well. They're honestly very different players in terms of their strengths.   In terms of passing, Harden has averaged 11+ assists before. And is currently averaging way more assists than Steph. "
"""we feel like we have a good shot this year"". lmfao. Rockets will have to go through a Lebron James team, A strong Nuggets team, A Strong OKC team and a fucking dream team just to get to the finals, Where there are like 2-3 good teams available in the east that would give Rockets trouble. They blew it last year, That was their window. "
"So, LeBron James can talk politics and get on this sub, but Trump saying he loves the NBA can't be here? Why?"
"He is.  He rests here and there if you watch for it, saving it for crunch time. His legs were tired causing him to miss a ton of second half threes.  Lebron shared a similar style.   http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23384071/lebron-james-plays-rests-keep-cleveland-cavaliers-hopes-alive"
"Actually, players say minutes aren't the biggest deal. Like playing 6 extra minutes isn't going to break the threshold for soreness the next day. His first season back in Cleveland, Lebron talked the experiment on shorter games (44 minutes) and he said its number of games played and not minutes that wears you down.   *""It's not the minutes, it's the games,"" James said. ""The minutes don't mean anything. We can play 50-minute games if we had to. It's the games that I think we all as players think is too many games in our season. 82 games are a lot. But it's not the minutes, taking away minutes from the game is not going to shorten the game at all.*  source: https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2014/10/lebron_james_says_shortening_t.html"

"Outperforming... Well, I don't think so, since the Lakers are LeBronless for now, and even with James they have less assets that boston, we have to think that Kuzma is more close to a primary option if not the primary option without LeBron. Tatum is not even close to that, first is Kyrie, then it should be Horford, and then almost everybody takes a decent amount of shoots, at best he's the Third option, should be fourth if it wasn't for Hayward's low level"

"I really don’t think our draft history is bad at all. We’ve hit on a lot of late first, second round picks, and I’ve been happy with pretty much all of our lottery picks. We don’t have an extensive draft history this decade because of the previous front office’s affinity for trading our picks, but that’s what you do while you’re contending.   I also think it’s pretty amusing to hear “a core of two #1’s” like they weren’t some of the most exceptional first overall picks we’ve had in recent memory. Kyrie went #1 barely playing any games at Duke, that’s how much of a talent he was. And the other #1 is fuckin LeBron James. Even though we’ve had the #2 pick, the difference in value compared to a #1 cannot be understated. "
I'm not denying that was a bad game but I think his leadershio since then has vastly improved.  It's similar to how many people were saying LeBron gave up on the Cavs against the Celtics in Game 5 back in 2010 before jumping ship to go to Miami.  James got his rings though and that quieted the hate down.  It isn't like Harden has run out of time to get a ring although the odds are stacked against him.
"I wouldn’t be. You guys went from a perennial 6 and 7th seed in the old competitive East to 4th in the currently pathetic East.  It was 5+ years of losing. Embiid and Simmons look fantastic, but who to say in those 5 years you didn’t find somebody else in the middle of the first or you attracted a star or whatever. Same with us here in LA. So much losing to be stuck in 9th with LeBron James. The best players we drafted from the tank were in 20s and 40s. "
"The later. They normally get pushed into a prime-time spot. ABC (ESPN) keeps the money for advertising by the way not the NBA. The NBA gets paid on contract by ABC and they get paid the same regardless of whether there is 4 games or 7. ESPN is paying $2.4 Billion a year and that's expected to increase to over $3B after the contract is up in 2024.     &gt;NBC then succeeded the broadcast rights from 1990 to 2002.[1] During NBC's partnership with the NBA in the 1990s, the league rose to unprecedented popularity, with ratings surpassing the days of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the mid 1980s. Upon expiration of the contract in 2002, the league signed an agreement with ABC, which began airing games in the 2002-03 season. NBC had made a four-year $1.3 billion ($330 million/year) bid in the spring of 2002 to renew its NBA rights, but the league instead went to ESPN and ABC with a six-year deal worth $2.4 billion ($400 million/year), a total of $4.6 billion ($766 million/year) when adding the cable deal with Turner Sports.[2] Partially due to the retirement of Michael Jordan, the league suffered ratings decline after ESPN and ABC took over the rights. NBA extended its national TV package on June 27, 2007 worth eight-year $7.4 billion ($930 million/year) through 2015–16 season,[2] during which the league had its new resurgence leading by renewed Celtics–Lakers rivalry and LeBron James. On October 6, 2014, NBA announced a nine-year $24 billion ($2.7 billion/year) extension with ESPN, ABC and Turner Sports beginning with the 2016–17 season and running through the 2024–25 season[3] - the second most expensive media rights in the world after NFL and on a par with Premier League in annual rights fee from 2016–17 to 2018–19 season.[4]"

"How many times do I got to hear Stephen A. Talking about who the Lakers should pursue? It's like can he be anymore biased?

I love when people say players today wouldn't last in the 90s and dont even get me started when they say Lebron James wouldn't last lmfao
2008 olympics I was introduced to basketball via Lebron James. Incredible.
"Even then, the example he uses of the Raptors last year is a little misleading. They lost game 1 when it was EXTREMELY unlikely they were going to after leading and proceeding to miss 123 bunnies around the rim. And then lost another game to an unlikely LeBron James buzzer beater. Sure they were swept but they that's the lazy way to look at it. If he actually watched the games he'd know it could be a 6 or 7 game series just as easily."
"If I remember correctly that game 7 win against clippers had nothing to do with Harden.  It was those 10 guys who were out of the league carrying Harden.  But I do agree with you, taking 1 game from the Shaq-Kobe should not be an accolade, and carrying a weak team shouldnt as well.  Otherwise Lebron James would be the unarguable GOAT."
Anyone with Lebron James on their team will do the same thing.   Lebron James.
"Those people just love bashing the Celtics and being reactionary. Celtics have years of finals runs in front of them, but a decade is a long time in the nba. 10 years ago Derrick Rose was a rookie, Dwight Howard led his team to the finals, and Lebron James had just won his first mvp "
"He was nicknamed LeBron ""1-through-5"" James during his Miami days for a reason."
"Lol my friends asked me why I thought Cavs would make the Finals last year. I just kept sayin’ Lebron James as they scoffed.  My friends are Lakers fans. When I ask why they think the Lakers will make the Finals, they say Lebron James.  Lakers fans switch so fast LOL"
"you know kobe had shitty playoff games too, right? you know lebron did too, right? you know jordan too, right? you know curry has too, right?  there's not a player in the history of the nba that has a great game in every playoff game/series. only james harden seems to be able to be the best player in game 7 of a series yet all people like you can remember is game 6.  the only reason harden doesn't have the rings those guys do is because of his teammates. he's never played with a prime shaq, pippen, wade/bosh, klay/kd, etc. his best running mate was a past his prime dwight and a past his prime chris paul who he still would've got a ring with if not for a torn hammy.  put james harden in steph curry's spot and i guarantee you he's got rings right now."

"29/6.3/8.6   Harden's best 4 seasons (not counting this 1) The season before that would lower that average  Counting this season he's been averaging what you said going for 5 years only.   Just to answer your question there's a guy named LeBron James averaging 27/7/7 for his entire career.   Kobe averaged 28.6/5.5/5.2 for 9 years while playing All Defensive 1st team level defense.   Wade has also had a 5 year stretch comparable to Harden's but with better defense and playoff success.   Harden is having a historical season no doubt, and a great stretch in the previous years, but don't start acting like what he's doing in his prime is unprecedented. There are a lot more greats that have done that. Chill with your takes."
Didn't Lebron James make y'all his dino bitches?
Lebron James
"Blame the rest of the league for not giving Cousins a decent contract.  The Cavs had THREE overall #1 picks, plus 2 more top 5 picks. Then signed Lebron James as a free agent.  How this that any different then the Warriors drafting 3 All Stars and then signing KD as a free agent?   Don't blame the Warriors for drafting so well. If they didn't draft 3 All Stars out of the top5 they would never get KD. KD basically was the prize for drafting so well outside of the top5 and building an awesome culture."
"Chris Paul  Kobe Bryant  LeBron James  Tim Duncan  Bill Russell  Bench: Isiah Thomas, Paul Pierce, Kawhi Leonard, Dwayne Wade, Anthony Davis"
Their last name can also be a first name. Chris Paul - Paul is also a first name. LeBron James - James is also a first name. Andre Iguodala - nah i don't think someone is called Iguodala
Right now:  Jamal Murray  Donovan Mitchell  LeBron James  Aaron Gordon  Anthony Davis
Not Lebron James 
It's where you go to get mutilated by LeBron James 
"If you read carefully you will see that it was a question, and I stated how I would feel.  Then I said I'm not a pro basketball player to show that my opinion it doesn't worth much.   So I don't really understand for what you rant about.  If there was a team of James Harden, Lebron, Giannis, Embiid and AD then GSW would compete in same level. But now GSW compete against lesser talent which makes the achievement for the individual player less worthy. This is how always has been in sports."
"Solid point. And really, your team isn't ready to contend this season - it's not worth risking serious injury in the first of four years with LeBron James to win any given game."
"Starters  James Harden Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant Anthony Davis Paul George  Reserves  Nikola Jokic LeBron James Damian Lillard Rudy Gobert Karl-Anthony Towns   ( Same as Zach Lowe’s, but Davis, Jokic for me was 6’s)   Westbrook is averaging a triple double right now, but his numbers for me aren’t as impressive in terms of effectiveness this year. That said he would be in.  The last spot is hard because in terms of impact and how they play I really want to give the last spot to Steven Adams. But L. Aldridge has been a beast for the Spurs, especially as of late. I watched his career night a couple weeks ago and he looked like a spry chicken playing out of his mind. I’d give the nod to Aldridge.

"You’re trying to tell me lebron “I’m Injured” james stands a chance against Steph, Klay, and Dray? Or Kevin “Basalisk” Durant?  This teams only hope is if Jaylen “the next Kawhi” Brown fucks around and goes for 17 pts on 39% FG"
"Lebron is clearly behind Jordan as a scorer. I'm just saying he is not so far away that it gives Jordan a big advantage.  Scoring titles are meaningless because there is no consistent criteria. One year a player can win the 'title' averaging 29.1ppg the next year he can lose it averaged 29.9ppg. It's all relative to the other great scorers in the league at the same time as you.   The only great scorer that was competing with Jordan for the scoring title in 1990, 1992, and 1997 was Karl Malone. In 91 Karl Malone and Bernard King were the elite scorers competing with Jordan. In 93 it was Malone and Dominique. In 1997 it was just Malone. In 1998 it was Malone and Shaq.  Lebron was competing with Tracy McGrady, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, and James Harden. Not to mention guys like Gilbert Arenas and Anthony Davis popping up here and there.  Lebron is 2nd to Jordan in scoring in so many ways. MJ has the most 30 point games of all time. Wilt is 2nd. [*And Lebron is 3rd.*] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=career&amp;year_min=1947&amp;year_max=2019&amp;is_playoffs=E&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=30&amp;order_by=pts). Lebron is well ahead of guys like Kobe and Kareem and they played 20 years to Lebron's 15.  By playoffs alone [Lebron is 1st all time in 30 point games nobody else is close to these two](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=career&amp;year_min=1947&amp;year_max=2019&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=30&amp;order_by=pts). Lebron is also first all time in playoff points.  He's [2nd all-time to Jordan in playoff 40 point games](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=career&amp;year_min=1947&amp;year_max=2019&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=40&amp;order_by=pts)  And if you factor in efficiency one could easily argue Lebron is as good of a scorer as Jordan--but that's not my belief or my argument. My point is, Lebron is 2nd or 3rd all-time as a scorer to Jordan and Wilt."

"https://www.si.com/nba/2018/07/03/demarcus-cousins-lakers-warriors-lebron-james  Your own Lakers turned him down before he contacted the Warriors, on a similar deal too"

Karl Malone played against both Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James.  
"Obvious bias but I'm drafting Giannis in front of anybody. After him I would think Steph Curry, Chris Paul, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, maybe in some order of those players."
I’m pretty sure Lebron James played all 4 years too...
Lebron James JR
"&gt; MJ was the best offensive player of all time  Scoring isn't the same as offense. Kareem, Wilt, and LeBron are all better, partially because it's hard for a guard to generate offense as automatically as a big; Shaq and Magic probably are better as well. The one interesting case is Steph, who will have a case by the end of his career.  Jordan's case for greatest all-time depends on his defense and his perfect Finals record/clutch baskets/""will to win."" His offense alone was elite, but in more of a James Harden kind of way. Generational, not best ever."
"Years from now, young basketball fans are going to be saying, ""Wow, it must have been so great to be able to see those Warriors teams play. At the same time as LeBron! I wish I could have seen it.""  And these same salty fucks are going to be like, ""Yeah, you kids today just don't know what it's like to see true greatness.""  None of them will have the honesty or the balls to say, ""No, I whined and complained constantly about how it just wasn't fair and basketball sucked. I'm just glad I was too young for the 90s and the Jordan Bulls and Hakeem, I would probably have just cried myself to sleep every night for eight years.""  Funnily enough, it's been eight years since any team in the Eastern conference has been good enough to beat LeBron James but they're *still* whining about the Warriors going to the Finals for *four*."
"I can't find it now, but I believe there was an episode of Planet Money where they talked about how a lot of players sort of ""pay their dues"" making less than they're probably worth early on in their careers because most teams follow the convention of paying the big superstars really well towards the end of the careers, which is actually when a lot of them are being overpaid. It's sort of a backwards system sometimes.  It might be [this episode](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2013/01/04/168627825/episode-427-lebron-james-is-underpaid), but it's too late here for me to listen to it again right now. Interesting episode either way."
Since 2016.  2015 was the last the time [Lebron was first in jersey sales](http://www.nba.com/2015/news/04/14/nba-most-popular-jerseys-2014-15-season-lebron-james-still-reigns/)
"It is absurd reasoning from Lowe, and his buddy Bill Simmons. When Simmons and Lowe went on each other's pods about a week ago or so, prior to the posted piece. Both of those guys talked about Lebron missing too many games to be starter. That's was their sole critique. There wasn't a discussion about someone having a better year or team success. So, if we actually go by their criteria (of missed games) and compare Lebron to players that both Lowe and Simmons list as starters we see their argument is nonsense.   Games played:  * Steph Curry - 36  * Kawhi Leonard - 36  * Lebron James - 34  If you want to argue that Player X is having a breakout season, go ahead and do that. But, I feel insulted that they're acting like Lebron only played 15 games. "
"Last year he was primed to be the all-star MVP even, before Dantoni benched him in favor of an ice cold James Harden and team Lebron won shortly thereafter. Even when he gets into the game, he can't always get into the game ya know?"
  I'm getting downvoted but if these are the locks:  * James Harden * Steph Curry * Kevin Durant * Anthony Davis * Paul George * Nikola Jokic * LeBron James * Damian Lillard  You need to pick 4 of these guys to fill out the all star roster  * Rudy Gobert * Karl-Anthony Towns * Russell Westbrook * LaMarcus Aldridge * Mike Conley * Jrue Holiday * Luka Doncic * Danilo Gallinari * Tobias Harris * DeMar DeRozan * Donovan Mitchell * Jamal Murray * Klay Thompson
"You think a team with LeBron James is really going to tank? Jesus man...  This is a massive overreaction, they have a bunch of players injured. No one was suggesting this when they were winning with LeBron and Rondo."

"I love Blake and he's balling out of his mind, but LeBron and Kawhi have just been better.  |Player|Games Played|PTS/G|REB/G|AST/G|TS%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Blake Griffin|44|26.0|8.1|5.2|.597| |LeBron James |34|27.3|8.3|7.1|.601| |Kawhi Leonard|36|27.6|7.9|3.1|.613|  LeBron is outperforming Blake in literally every category (other than games played). Kawhi doesn't have as many ast/g, but he's been elite on the defensive (and he's scoring more efficiently). I don't know if 8-10 games is enough to give Blake the nod over Kawhi/LeBron yet.  &amp;#x200B;"
"They’re not in danger. They’ll have Lebron fucking James. Y’all really have got to stop it with this. Everyone counted out the Cavs last February and they still ended up in the finals. Lebron isn’t missing the playoffs. If they need to win he’ll will them to win.  I’m not even a huge Lebron fan or anything, but if you’re still doubting any team that has Lebron James idk what to say"
All their injured players combined stents as valuable as LeBron James

"Not really. There’s a half of a season left, Rondo’s maybe coming back next game, oh and we have LeBron James."
LeBron James.
It's really not comparable. An injury to Ricky Rubio is not the same as an injury to LeBron James.
"There's not a lot of teams worse than the Lakers when they're missing their three best playmakers, one of which is fucking LeBron James, and have no point guards."
Now you know why director LeBron James was on hand for filming
"Shaq - His overall body as the frame of our perfect basketball player. We will also take his big man athleticism and low post skill.  LeBron James - His muscles, joints, and organs will fill out the Shaq frame of our perfect basketball player. His longevity and ability to play hard and largely avoid injury will be essential. We will also take his vertical, basketball IQ, and drive to improve his body in the off-season.  Larry Bird - He will be half the brain of our perfect basketball player, primarily the offensive half. His basketball intangibles, killer instinct, and skill will program our Shaq/LeBron cyborg into an elite killing machine. We will also take his passing ability, shooting ability, shot selection, high release shooting, quickness (stemming from knowing where to go and what to do before the opposition does), and right hand scoring ability.  Shane Battier - He will be the other half of the brain our perfect basketball player's brain, primarily the defensive half. His defensive intangibles and ability to learn the oppositions weaknesses and adapt in real time will be crucial. We will also take his IQ and willingness to be a glue guy, box out, take the charge, and bring teammates together. He will be the compassionate side of our killer cyborg.  I really only need these 4 players but might as well use 5. So our last player is:  James Harden - He will add another element of athleticism to upgrade our cyborg to another level. We will take his ball handling, step back shooting ability, Eurostep ability, left hand scoring player (now our player is ambidextrous), and foul drawing ability.  This is the perfect player."

"No single person had to start it. That's what free agency is. Players exercising their right to go to a better situation. Whether it be for notoriety, legacy, or financial gain. If you want to narrow the goal posts then to HOFers, sure, the list gets shorter. But plenty of HOFers changed teams or forced a teams hand via trade to get themselves into better situations.   Chauncey Billups going to Detroit Carmelo Anthony leaving Denver Amare Stoudamire leaving Phoenix Joe Johnson Leaving Phoenix Baron Davis leaving GSW for LAC Dennis Rodman SAS-Chicago (Spurts were a 50 win team with him both seasons) Shaq Leaving Orlando..Shaq leaving LAL for Miami... good case for Steve Nash leaving a really good situation in Dallas too.  Carlos Boozer left one routine playoff contender for another.   I'm probably missing more examples, but you can look t his stuff up yourself. Plenty of players leave good teams to go to better teams a lot.   Is the LeBron James situation different? Sure, but Miami was not a dumpster fire and had tanked the season prior to LeBron coming so they could have the cap and neccesarry opening to bring on 3 max players, wasn't like LeBron just randomly joined Miami. Miami had also just won a championship 4 years prior and still had Wade in his prime..again..not exactly like Bron went toughed out a bad situation in Miami.  And the Bron revisioninst is a full on narrative on /r/nba. The move was completely and utterly despised by people. The same thing that people said about KD, being soft, not wanting to stick it out with a team were all said about Lebron. So are they different? sure, but there's a lot in common between the moves.   If we're talking about players leaving good situations to go to what fans assume as ""better"" situations there is:  "
"He IS bigger than the current Lakers FO right now.  Magic and Pelinka are fresh and have yet to feel they can afford to front LeBron even if they have him for 4 years.  Sure James is no bigger than the franchise, but he has been acting like he has leverage over 2 men whose biggest accomplishment so far is not screwing it up when they were the easiest sell to James and their tenure solely depends on making LeBron want to play a full season when he likely only wants to play in games that matters at this point( not play 42mins to ensure they get a win).  If Magic or Pelinka had the control, they would face the rumors and get James to calm down (because my felling is James wants to keep the Finals appearance streak alive at all cost) so the rest of the team can grow in a system and be legit the next year and then trade with better value."
"I don't get who the people in AD's camp are and why they believe he is leaving, is Rich Paul and LeBron James his ""camp"" or what?

"Forget the market. NY should be pulling top players due to the narrative that they’d be living legends if they can bring a title back to the Knicks. The Decision didn’t work in NY’s favor, but James and Wade’s bond, and Pat Riley tipped that decision in Miami’s favor. LA is a more appealing city for a player like LeBron who doesn’t need to play savior to any other teams and build a legacy. KD signing with GS was an abnormal situation. There really haven’t been any other league shifting free agent signings that NY could have capitalized on yet. "

"I don't know if that's true. If anything, I bet Rich Paul was in his ear when Noel was still with his old agent.  Then Noel fired his old agent and hired Rich Paul, thinking he'd be in line for that big payday.    Unfortunately, just because it worked for JR Smith and Tristan Thompson, doesn't mean that every other FO operates like the Cleveland Cavaliers being held hostage by Lebron James.  You saw this same negotiating tactic with KCP, who, with Rich Paul as his agent, turned down a monster contract from Detroit to seek out a max.  Didn't work out for him either."

"So lemme get this straight...  For 2 years now, people like myself who consider themselves to be reasonably knowledgeable basketball fans have looked at these 2 players and said: well, obviously, Harden is better.  This seemed an obvious take...i mean Steph curry's trainer called him a future hof...Lebron james himself lauded him...surely actual nba players know more than redditors right?   WRONG. Inexplicably, perhaps out of sheer temporary insanity or some team-based stubbornness, Thunder fans and Westbrook supporters have rejected this notion. Forget Hardens stepback or his pesky extra facial hair, or all those ferocious crossovers. The argument over and over again: OUR GUY AVERAGES A TRIPLE DOUBLE. We're happy with RUSS!  \*But... no one plays D. Its an offense driven game\* i thought to myself. Oh well. I dropped it.    hahahaha"

"Alright,  There you go. We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit love Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all love him? The obvious answer: you watched him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 46 or 50 years old. That means you grew up on old school basketball and shouting stupid cliches about winning, championships, and clutch time  And because you're old and watched him in his prime and don't know shit about analytics, you try to compensate for that by citing your age and that ""you saw him play"", as if any of you actually have anywhere close to enough knowledge to have an opinion on this shit. But here's the thing: basketball isn't judged by the eye test. It's judged by excel sheets and analytics. Every good front office and winning team is hyper focused on it for a reason. The moment somebody dismisses ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. That's why we use multiple stats. He's one of the best SGs of all time, but if he was in the game today, he would be clearly outside the top 3/4 players  So when I hear somebody say that Kobe Bryant is better than Lebron James, I laugh, because I know that anybody who who knows basketball wouldn't think that. Unlike you, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time and I know analyics, so I know that Kobe is worse.  You might be jealous Lebrons superior passing, scoring, and shooting, or jealous of his status as the greatest player in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're someone who understands basketball and understands that analytics cuts through the bullshit to tell you how good a player actually is, you don't know what winning, championship basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe is a top 10 player of all time.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players when you don't understand the basics about how to judge them. Talk about your ""greats"" like Kobe Bryant The Best scorer in the World™, but leave the Lebron talk to the adults. Fair?"

"The problem is that in basketball one player can be really important, and LeBron James and Kemba Walker are both all stars, despite LeBron being vastly superior."
LEBRON JAMES HAS BEEN TRADED ~~TO~~ FOR NEW YORK
"First of all to be fair there are a lot of lists that are one player long that are just Lebron James.     Second, look at him as a rookie and look at his ridiculous giant mega-uber-steroid jawline that he hides with that dumb beard if you want an answer to the last bit. "
WELL IM SORRY IM NOT LEBRON JAMES SIR 
"You would need a truly transcendent player, a la Duncan or LeBron James. "
"Yeah it’s bitter sweet. People may not like our young players but when they are clicking they look pretty good. Kuz can go off for 30+ points, Ingram while inconsistent has shown flashes of greatness. Lonzo was playing the best basketball of his career before the ankle injury. Zubac has been dropping multiple 20/10 games.  BUT, you get a superstar in return, a player averaging 29/13/4 with 2.6 blocks a game... and is essentially about to enter the prime of his career. You get to pair that guy with LeBron James, and then possibly sign another B or A tier player this summer. "
"Exactly. I’m a pistons fan, but the best part of the nba is I don’t have to really give a fuck about the pistons. I love James Harden, I love LeBron, I love watching Luka Doncic, there’s so many good players and personalities that you can enjoy the NBA even if you’re a fan of a shit ass team. Baseball and hockey aren’t really like that, and the nfl is starting to get more like that. But god damn the nba is fun"
LEBRON JAMES HAS BEEN TRADED TO NEW YORK
Meh if LeBron James wasn't in the East they would have cake walked into the finals as a rookie and sophomore leading the way  Take the damn compliment from a sixer fan. I don't give em to Boston ofteb
Apparently LeBron James is also moderating this subreddit...
"no way. Harden is actually hurting LeBron's ""GOAT case"" which was already weak. Harden is playing LeBron ball better than LeBron has ever done before. the only thing LeBron ever had over Jordan was rebounds and assists, James Harden is getting the rebounds and assists but scoring like LeBron wishes he could."
"There are a few reports of it, if you google “Rich Paul Miami Drug Clinic” there was a lot of news a few years back of him being a customer at the same place a lot of the MLB players were juicing from. [Here’s the first result I came across](http://dystnow.com/2013/03/04/lebron-james-jameer-nelson-linked-to-miami-steroid-clinic/)  I’m sure LeBron uses drugs but I’m also sure a lot of other players do also"
https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/lebron-james-2257/  He had one on the Cavs but he doesn't have one anymore. 
"Personally I’m not sure who I would choose since they are both great players in their own regards, but neither has shown they can outright carry a team themselves to the finals like Lebron was able to do. From the Lakers perspective I think it’s more of playing the odds at this point. They’re a team thirsty to make a big move to surround Lebron James with talent that presents a ‘win now’ scenario for their aging superstar. LA has gotten blue-baller over and over again with attempted trades or free agent signings (Kawhi trade &amp; PG resigning with thunder) so the urgency to get Davis is at an all time high after so many strikeouts. The same can’t be said for Kawhi who could be content staying in Toronto after this season and I wouldn’t blame him because he really has it made right now."
"NO would never say yes, let us trade our franchise star for LeBron James a GOAT but aging player who we won't be able to build a contender around in 3 years time. "
"*""Here are a bunch of players who could not even get us to .500, and who are out of the playoffs with LeBron James. The same LeBron who dragged Cleveland to numerous NBA Finals.

Everybody but LeBron  Staples center   The clippers selfies they hang over banners at home games.   LeBron James shares of blaze pizza   A free hit on Robey-Coleman in return for the no call. 
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Not calling you an idiot but I am not going to say I wasn't expecting this take to show up about now.   That said you put it forward with good faith and reasoning.  All that said there is no fucking way I would want the Lakers to trade Lebron James away for anybody.

"Y'all all really set on Kyrie staying. You might just wanna talk to some Cleveland fans and reevaluate that. The man left a championship team with LeBron James. You think he's incapable of moving on Jayson Tatum or AD? For all we know Kyrie could start some South American basketball league because he falls in love with the Pan flute.   ""Kyrie might not re-sign"" isn't just some rumor being pushed by Rich Paul. It's a genuine consideration that you should give pause, because of who he is and his previous actions."
Should the league tell LeBron James and his slimy agent not to actively recruit another player and force him to the Lakers?
That was back in October. So much more NBA drama has happened since like [THE YOUNG GUYS DON'T KNOW HOW TO WIN](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/more-sports/kyrie-irving-young-guys-dont-know-what-it-takes-to-be-championship-level-team/vp-BBSaiSv) and [KYRIE CALLS LEBRON](http://www.nba.com/article/2019/01/16/kyrie-irving-called-lebron-james-apologize) plus [KYRIE LEBRON REUNION](https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2019/01/29/report-kyrie-irving-genuinely-interested-in-lebron-reunion). Kyrie hasn't disputed any of these recent stories. Personally I don't think Kyrie leaves but I hope he does cuz you know...Fuck the Celtics. 
And aren't making considerable improvements considering adding lebron james in. Why is it so hard to understand your young core is mediocre to the other offers they could get? 
Lets be real. petty ass comic sans ass dan gilbert sign-and-traded Lebron fucking James to the Heat to not lose him for nothing. There is no way NO doesn't sign and trade Davis in this scenario
Because the Pelicans feel (and it looks like) they tampered with Davis through his agent to get a trade request to a specific team that benefits LeBron James.  That's a bad faith action.  They intentionally caused duress which weakened the Pelicans' position.
"If we’re talking about decline, which we are, it’s a fair comparison.  Horford is a poor mans Duncan with a game that should age well.  James is one of the greatest players of all time.  However, he’s got a very physical game and he has a lot of miles on that engine.  He’s two years older and has a massive frame.  LeBron is just as likely to decline soon.  "

That must be tough to only land Lebron James 
"They just have to trade for him. Are they really not going to sign someone in the offseason just so they can pair AD with 36-year old LeBron James? Every season is precious while they have LeBron on the tail end of his prime. They've already forfeited this season, are they going to do that for the next season too?"
"I understand that argument, but you're assuming ideal conditions. You saying it is ""simply a matter of"" anything doesn't take into account the complexities of the selection - namely it leaves out the possibility that Kobe is getting it based off of name recognition. Were there 4 better defensive guards than Kobe in 05-06? I really don't remember, I was 15 at the time and while I loved basketball I was too busy trying to be edgy to remember. But hell, let's have a look at that season and see if I can't find at least 4 wings with significantly higher DBPM than Kobe's (-1.5) when he made First Team All Defense:  Gerald Wallace (+4.7)  Shane Battier (+3.1)  Jason Kidd (+2.7)  Bruce Bowen (+2.6)  Danny Granger (+2.6)  Josh Smith (+2.5)  All guys that played starters minutes on a significant number of games. Well, maybe that was an anomaly. I just picked 05-06 off the top of my head, and looking at it now it was one of his worst years of defense by the numbers. Which lines up with the eye test, given that he was off scoring shittons of points and decimating the league on a no-talent Lakers squad. Let's try that again with 07-08, the Lakers are back in championship contention with Gasol, Bynum, Odom, and Ariza to help with the scoring load, Kobe is named First Team All-Defense again, and he has a DBPM the second highest of his career (+0.3). Notable wing players with higher DBPM:  Jamario Moon (+3.5)  Shane Battier (+3.0)  Andrei Kirilenko (+3.0)  Rajon Rondo (+2.7)  LeBron James (+2.3)  Bruce Bowen (+2.1)  Manu Ginobili (+2.0)  Again, with the exception of LeBron and Manu these are guys known at that time for primarily defense and (with maybe the exception of Manu given Bruce Bowen's presence on the Spurs) guys you'd take to guard the best wing player on the other team on any given night. All guys who played starters minutes, with a significant number of games played, and who were at minimum 6-7 times better in terms of the analytics defensively. Were they actually that much better than him defensively? Obviously not. But that's an awfully big gap to overcome. "
You just compared Al Horford and Lebron james man lol
"doesnt matter what he said. and those are horrible examples, they were both washed lmao. tatum isn't even halfway on his way to his prime. it'd be stupid to trade a talented young player on his rookie contract for a dude who's represented by lebron james best friend"

"Holy hyperbole. The Celtics aren't giving up every single valuable player they have + picks for AD. Their depth would certainly take a big hit, but Celtics aren't trading the team for him. The picks may be more valuable to the Pelicans, in which case Celtics retain more.of.the present roster. If not l, the Celtics can use those picks to re-tool around their stars. Plus Stevens has shown he can get the best out of average players if they really do lose most of their talent.   Hayward is still recovering. His contract looks bad now and probably still will even if he gets healthy, but he isn't useless by any means. Paul George's was able to recover from a similarly devastating injury - if Hayward can get back to 80-85% of the player he was before, thats still pretty damn good.   Horford at 34 is still good. Also a friendly reminder that Lebron James is 34 as well.    So AD's alternative is to force a trade to LA, team up with an aging Lebron and no one else (since they'd trade everyone for him) then hope another star and some ring chasing role players sign in the offseason. That's totally feasible, but not a guarantee."
"Whenever I hear that “chant” I always think of those LeBron James Miami teams. I don’t know if they were the first to do it, if that’s when I first noticed it, or they just played it way way way more than any other team, but I blame those teams for giving us this abomination. "
"**It’s NOT FAIR!!** -Lakers fans, with Lebron James"
"You're right. I can't believe LeBron James and Rich Paul have a gun to AD's head, forcing him to request a trade to the Lakers. Absolutely disgusting. "

The sluggish response time is perhaps a message that New Orleans places some responsibility onto the Lakers for Davis' trade request, or perhaps an indication to Davis and his agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports that the franchise doesn't plan to easily acquiesce on a trade request to partner with LeBron James.  As of now, the Pelicans see no reason to deliver Davis to the Lakers in a deal with a full season left on his contract -- never mind do it on a timeline that benefits mostly the objectives of Los Angeles and Davis.

What top Anthony Davis trade contenders can actually offer Here's what each team can really put on the table in trade talks.   The other side to the Anthony Davis trade drama As rumors and reports swirl about Anthony Davis' next move, New Orleans is already preparing for life without its superstar.  New Orleans owner Gayle Benson is enthusiastically carrying the small market banner, pushing back on any planned superstar union of James and Davis in the NBA's glamour market.  If Davis wants to be a Laker, the Pelicans' mantra so far is simply: Feel free to join L.A. as a free agent in 2020 -- and potentially punt on the 2019-20 season, with LeBron at age 35, to keep the requisite cap space open.  For now, Demps is following the San Antonio Spurs' initial playbook with Kawhi Leonard from a year ago: accept calls, and listen to deal concepts and offers.  Demps is picking up his phone and returning calls -- just not from the Lakers, sources said. From Paul George to Leonard to Davis, the Lakers front office is growing accustomed to icy receptions from teams enduring All-Star trade demands with a full year left on their contracts.  &gt;When Spurs GM RC Buford finally called back Pelinka after Leonard's springtime trade request, the Lakers were left with an unmistakable impression: Buford and Gregg Popovich would never send Leonard to Los Angeles -- no matter what the Lakers offered. The Spurs always denied any absolute ""no Lakers"" stance, arguing the Lakers' package never captivated them."

"Talking about the Lakers = more clicks = more money lol. Talking about the Lakers will usually always generate more clicks than talking about any other NBA team. Like some other people in this thread have said, LeBron James is on the Lakers as well. Talking about LeBron and the Lakers = cash money lmao"
Lakers are the most marketed team in the nba and added LeBron James (the biggest star in the nba). What do you expect. 
The friendship between Lebron James and Jayson Tatum — Bron and Tate — began in the same spirit as so many legendary duos: with Lebron going up to His locker and telling himself “he boomed me”.
"I mean, this isn’t wrong, or at least, is right for the wrong reasons. In terms of athleticism and arguably even legit game IQ, Brady will never be the player Lebron James is.

Lebron knows there’s more to life than basketball."

"Bron also has the benefit of more modern care and technology at his disposal. James spends $1 million on maintaining his body every year. Just think - back in the day you would play through stuff and no one batted an eye. Jordan also didn’t take as great care of his body as LeBron did. I don’t think anyone from a previous era took as great care of their body as LeBron has. It doesn’t completely offset the extra mileage, but it does lower the overall discrepancy."
Yeah I feel like given the recent Cj McCollum and lebron james comments that KD doesn’t have a problem calling out other players if need be... I don’t follow the warriors but I feel like KDs beef is more with the media than it is other dudes around the league 
It is so annoying that the Lakers draft shitty and sign bad contracts one after the other and then just stumble themselves into lebron James... And now you're telling me they're going to trade those shitty picks for AD. Fuck that's annoying.
"You have a chance to get AD, and right now the Celtics can't do it but could very well do so after the season. You have to take that chance.  Plus, he's only 25! You could have potentially a near decade of so of a top 5 player material big man next to LeBron fucking James. LeBron might not be the best player in the world anymore once he hits 37 or so but it's looking like he'll be a great player until 40."
"The mere concept of Lonzo Ball (assuming he doesn't get traded) developing on a team with Magic Johnson as POBO, Jason Kidd as head coach, and LeBron James and Rajon Rondo as players is kinda hilarious."
"Not biased at all: Kevin Harlan, Cleveland-Boston playoff 2008. LeBron dunks over DPOY Kevin Garnett: ""ohh LeBron James, with no regard for human life""."
"The suns put a top 1 protection on the pick, and the lakers picks are unprotected. Suns might help out since James Jones and LeBron are friends.

"Okay, I'll agree. There's a lot of truth in your comment. But.. you have to admit, you can see how this kind of conclusion is being drawn. Rich Paul has an opportunity to pair Lebron James and Anthony Davis together in LOS ANGELES. Honestly, I'm surprised at how much hate the Lakers are getting right now. They've had exactly 1 halfway decent season since that unfortunate night Kobe's Achilles peaced out, and missed out on every single big free agent they wanted except for surprisingly Lebron James.  ESPN and agents have been using the Lakers as leverage ever since while a lot of folks laughed it up with their painfully awkward jokes and memes. People are way too into their feelings about this. Just because Anthony Davis asks for a trade doesn't mean the sky is falling."

"For real. If Simmons can hit 34% of wide open 3's and just not take contested 3's, that's really all they need.

"It’s really not Luke’s fault, they were playing as a team and one of the best defenses in the league before this year. The players they brought in don’t fit well together or with the young players. The older players aren’t buying into the system and they didn’t consider how LeBron James coming in would change their style of play. "
Name a more iconic duo than Lebron James and low effort defense
I did.   i said he was going to be better than a 34 lebron james in his rookie season.   I’m not wrong
"Most league insiders have made it clear that there is a coalition of GMs who absolutely detest what Rich Paul and Lebron are doing, to the point where they are turning down literal war chests like this, just to spite Klutch and send the message that this shit needs to stop.  Whether you agree or disagree, thats on you.  Lowe mentions that the usual grumblings turned to outrage when *James Jones* literally gave away Tyson Chandler to Bron, and nearly Ariza too.  This Davis stuff likely was the last straw and the Lakers may need to get a bit more creative to find a deal.  Dell Demps should be fired for refusing that offer imo dont get me wrong.  But thats where we are."

Lebron James has a very similar game to Magic Johnson. But your point still stands otherwise.
&gt;adjust to playing in the west  Is this a weird joke? LeBron James won't be adding wins to a team? What the shit kind of delusion are you on?
"Nah, but only the best of the best can get away with it. See: LeBron James and Kevin Durant. Specifically, what LeBron did to Eastern Conference teams in the playoffs last year"
"&gt; if the discussion is who are the 10 best basketball players in the world then 100% the most important factor should be how they are currently playing  This is exactly why I think top 10 lists during the regular season are garbage. To reiterate, applying this logic right now, LeBron James would not be a top 5 player. Steph, KD, Harden, Giannis, and PG have all been better than him this season. Harden would also be the best player in the world the past 3 seasons. Obviously you probably reject this.   &gt; also by your argument (taking playoff success into account) how in the world is westbrook not above jokic or embiid  I never even agreed to this list in it's entirety. I even made the implication that it was probably retarded lol.  &gt; or how is kawhi not better than davis or giannis?  I believe he is though.  &gt; you cant have your cake and eat it too by saying giannis hasnt proved himself in the playoffs so he cant be better than lebron or KD but then say westbrook isnt better than jokic or kawhi isnt better than davis cause jokic and davis have been better THIS season?  You're acting like I was the one who made this list. I never said half of those things. The one objection I had was to YOUR claim. Other than that I haven't really made any arguments for/against anyone on this list.  &gt; also steph didnt even make the playoffs until he turned 24 and that team had bogut, draymond and klay all playing well  The season prior Steph only played &lt;30 games. The other two seasons his team was straight trash in a ridiculous western conference.   And draymond wasn't even a starter that year.  He wasn't half the player he was today. David Lee was our second best player lol.  &gt; giannis is going to make his 4th postseason appearance and be the best player on the 1 seed in the east at 24 and in 2017 his 3rd best player was jabari parker and in 2018 it was eric bledsoe so dont say he hasnt proven himself when all hes done is average 25.3 pts, 9. 5 rebounds and 5.2 assists with 2 steals and a block in the past two playoffs against two vastly superior teams  I never said Giannis hasn't proven himself. I said he hasn't done enough to warrant putting him over Steph or Harden....  "
"Booker is the type of player that is best at being a supportive player next to a mvp player, like  lebron James type player.  He isn’t a star you build around, he is someone you need to help the star on your team.   But that doesn’t mean his bad at basketball "

"I don't think the expectations for the team were unreasonable. The fact of the matter is, the Celtics looked phenomenal in the playoffs, and took LeBron James to 7 games in the Eastern Conference Finals. With both Kyrie and Gordon joining the team, and LeBron heading west, I don't think it was ""to high"" to expect 60 wins and the 1 seed.   And it's not even that the Celtics aren't living up to expectations. It's that they've blown massive leads on back to back nights, the team clearly doesn't know what they're doing, they lack chemistry, and it doesn't even seem like they give a shit that they've played pretty pathetic in consecutive home games. Any team with playoff aspirations would be sorely disappointed with the display the last two games."

"Are you counting if Lebron James, still the most dominant player in the nba, doesn't play 18 games? Cuz if he does and he has PG playing like his is this season I am saying it is not crazy to think."
"Well, actually, and I am 100% dead serious when i say this, I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father. I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know. I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people. and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s. I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better. he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?"" and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league? I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now..... until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..   edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass.

What would Lakers seed be without Lebron James? Celtics without Kyrie?
"To be fair, I’m honestly about to, Kyrie hasn’t been the #1 option in the postseason yet. He’s balled the fuck out in the Finals don’t get me wrong. But having LeBron James to take a lot of the attention off of you is beneficial.   "
"It doesn't matter how you explain it, and I know where you started. When your team wasn't trying to lose they won 35 games. Your young players improving isn't why you're getting more than 40 wins, it's adding Lebron James. "
"So imagine this NBA in the late 00's: These would be 16 best team lineups if every lottery team picked the IMO best available players at the moment in the drafts from '96-'09, and then never traded them away, based on these [redrafts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/aohdgx/rnba_game_threads_index_daily_discussion_february/eg3jzov/) I've done in the past few days. So here's basically if every team played their cards right in the 90's and 00's drafts:   Team | PG | SG | SF | PF | C | Bench including ---|---|----|----|----|----|---- 1. Raptors | Allen Iverson | Richard Hamilton | Rashard Lewis | LaMarcus Aldridge | Chris Bosh | Andrei Kirilenko, J. R. Smith, Raymond Felton, Taj Gibson, Tony Battie, *Kurt Thomas* 2.

Clippers | Tony Parker | Stephen Curry | Peja Stojaković | Josh Smith | Dirk Nowitzki | *Jerry Stackhouse*, Baron Davis, Goran Dragić, Josh Howard, Jamal Crawford, Ersan İlyasova, Aaron Brooks, Brevin Knight, Nenê 4. Grizzlies | Steve Nash | James Harden | Vince Carter | Stephen Jackson | Mehmet Okur | Manu Ginobili, DeAndre Jordan, Al Horford, Caron Butler, Michael Redd, Boris Diaw, *Joe Smith* 5. Warriors | Mike Bibby | Tyreke Evans | Joe Johnson | Carlos Boozer | *Kevin Garnett* | Ben Wallace, Shane Battier, *Bruce Bowen*, Kyle Korver, Devin Harris, Randy Foye, Derek Anderson, D. J. Augustin 6. 76ers | Rafer Alston | Kobe Bryant | Tracy McGrady | P. J. Tucker | *average C* | Trevor Ariza, Ramon Sessions, *Michael Finley*, *Sam Cassell*, *Eric Piatkowski* 7. Hornets | Kyle Lowry | Wilson Chandler | Danny Granger | Elton Brand | Al Jefferson | Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Marcin Gortat, Nicolas Batum, Brandon Jennings, *Alonzo Mourning*, *Dikembe Mutombo* 8. Wizards | José Calderón | Rasual Butler | Ron Artest | *Rasheed Wallace* | Pau Gasol | Luol Deng, Matt Barnes, *Donyell Marshall* 9. Cavaliers | Jason Terry | Jason Richardson | LeBron James | Lamar Odom | Shareef Abdur-Rahim | Luis Scola, Ben Gordon, Morris Peterson, Troy Hudson 10. Timberwolves | Stephon Marbury | Steve Francis | Jeff Green | *Antonio McDyess* | Kevin Love | Jrue Holiday, Jeff Teague, Raja Bell, J. J. Redick, Jarrett Jack, *Robert Horry*, *Eddie Jones* 11. Celtics | Chauncey Billups | DeShawn Stevenson | Ricky Davis | Jermaine O’Neal | Joakim Noah | Andrea Bargnani, Keith Van Horn, Tyson Chandler, Troy Murphy 12. Thunder | Andre Miller | Luke Ridnour | Leandro Barbosa | Blake Griffin | Marc Gasol | Andrés Nocioni, Brook Lopez, Emeka Okafor, J. J. Barea 13. Bucks | Chris Paul | Ray Allen | Anthony Parker | Thaddeus Young | Udonis Haslem | *Jason Kidd*, Kirk Hinrich, Eric Gordon, Cuttino Mobley, Darren Collison 14. Magic | Eddie House | Mike Miller | Matt Harpring | Dwight Howard | *Shaquille O'Neal* | Brad Miller, Keyon Dooling, Andrew Bynum, Ronnie Brewer, *Chris Webber* 15. Trail Blazers | Delonte West | Louis Williams | Kevin Durant | Rudy Gay | *average C* | Ryan Anderson, *Brent Barry* 16. Nuggets | Dwyane Wade | Paul Pierce | Tayshaun Prince | Tim Thomas | *average C* |   Honorable mention: Detroit Pistons with Larry Hughes, Gerald Wallace, Carmelo Anthony, Stromile Swift and Juwan Howard.   Yeah, I can edit those rankings if you've got a convincing argument. I also added counted a couple of players from 1991-95 drafts, mostly notable ones who played into the late 00's, and re-drafted those drafts just with them. Though they're in italics and most likely benched, since most of them declined by then. If a team lacks ideal lottery picks in a position, assume an average player in that position is there."
Harden to me can carry any team right now to the playoffs and he is the only player along with Lebron James that can do that 
"Last season their injured squad of young, talented guys was *thriving* under Stevens. Their motivation was great, their chemistry was off the charts...  ... and despite the fact that you really shouldn't fuck with that kind of setup, the front office held on to Irving and Hayward even though they patently didn't need them (they got to the ECF and took *LeBron fucking James* to 7 games) and all this season chemistry has been fucked because he's trying to fit Irving and Hayward back into the lineup and it *doesn't work*.  Hayward's not even the problem - he's still half-broken but he was okay with going to the bench.  But Kyrie Irving is a problem. He was redundant, but there's no way he takes a back seat to success with the young guys and the thing is?  I'm not sure it's fun to play basketball with Kyrie Irving. At all.  There's guys like that at every level of basketball. If you're played rec league odds are you've known some. It's not that they're bad people, they're just *not fun to play with*."
"Russ is a franchise player. But a tier two franchise player. The way I define it is, a tier one player: AD, LeBron, KD, Steph, Gianis, etc. are players who can go to any team and make them better. Your tier two players: Jimmy B, Russ, James Harden (hot take, I move him back and forth all of the time) are players who have to be in the right situation or have a team built around them to get better.   To make it more clear: KD, LeBron, etc can be traded to any team and will add wins and hide your major flaws. Regardless of who else is on the team, they can elevate everyone around them and make a team competitive. Example: Lakers were a lottery team last year, if LeBron didn’t get injured they’d probably be holding the 7th seed right now  With Westbrook or Harden, if they don’t have those specialty players around them, you get stuck with an incredibly flawed team that peaks as a team that nobody wants to play. They are dangerous but too flawed to have real championship aspirations. Example: with the rangy 3 and D wings on the rockets last year, they almost played for a Chip, the wings are gone this year and the rockets were a mess in their first 30 games and will probably be out of the playoffs in the second round.

"2016 cavs? Only Lebron is a lock right now. Kyrie has a good shot, but other than that no one else. I don't see Kevin Love getting in, nor Jefferson or James Jones or JR smith"
"Yeah it does, and it’s wrong. Harden is an elite playmaker. Good rebounder for a guard. Top-tier efficiency. You put any of that together without his monster volume scoring, it’s not historic. The reason his numbers are historic is because there have only been two people to ever score more points than him.  You can take out Giannis’ rebounds, and the entire list of people with as many points and assists with that level of efficiency is Steph Curry and LeBron James and nobody else. You can take out the assists qualifier too and just look at scoring volume and efficiency and you only add KD, Charles Barkley and Adrian Dantley. Per 100 numbers only give you Steph Curry whether you include the assists or not.  So we’re talking about a guy you claim is unique because he is an elite rebounding playmaker, but even on volume and efficiency alone you’re still only looking at literally the most efficient volume scorer ever that bests him."

He does things that are just unsustainable for most players.  They are saying he doesn't get fatigued like the other players do.

Well he was averaging 20 a game. Nobody thought he would do what he’s doing now. Also lebron James

"You really think Lebron is physically not able to play in those games they rest him?  While players in the 80s and 90s played 75+ games regularly, the best athlete in the history of the league can't?  He played 82 games last year.  Yet he rested before his injury this year.  And you're saying Lebron fucking James is physically unable to play from exhaustion?  No, you're being intellectually dishonest.  You started with a shitty premise that you're only making because it supports your teams' interests, and when called on how weak the premise is you won't even backtrack or admit how stupid and flawed it is.  Get lost."

"The West has had more all-star and HOF level players for the last 2 decades. It was weak before LeBron and weak with him. Joining the 2nd best player in the conference in 2010 also helped increase the divide. Then Kyrie was the all-star game MVP the season before James made his return. It wasn't just competing with Bron, it was him, 2 other all-stars, plus elite shooters. Not only that West teams have managed their teams better and drafter better as well. KG, TD, Dirk and Kobe held the West down for the teams that drafted them. KD, Westbrook, Harden, and Curry have held the West down since. That has nothing to do with Bron."
Lebron James is the goat 
You have LeBron james and are not in the playoff race
"Remember when he said that thing about LeBron James and shows made it sound like LeBron himself made things toxic?  The full quote was about how the media made everything around him into a big show, which was toxic, and some people might not want to deal with that bullshit.

Shaq (along with Kobe) gave you entitled pieces of shit 3 championships, if you didn't love him it'd be a problem. Same with Kobe and Pau. Don't act like Pelicans fans HAVE to love AD just because he was good. Did he win them any rings? I mean, he had Boogie and Jrue Holiday. Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson (When he was good), Tyreke Evans,etc. It just pisses me off when fans in a large market city like Los Angeles or New York look down on small market teams and say ,""Just become good lmao #LOZERS"" FUCK YOU. It's not a level playing field. Why do you think the Lakers can miss the playoffs for 5 years in a row and then all of a sudden land Lebron Fucking James? Why are the Knicks the worst team in the NBA and still the front runners to land KD and Kyrie next year? AD said himself he's not a leader, that he needs a floor general to guide him. That's what the Pelicans had last year with Rondo and that's also why they swept Portland. Guess who Rondo left the Pelicans for? Yea buddy, Fuck you."

There are also tons of shoe companies that would love to get Lebron James to sign a deal with them and would be fine with making a few concessions.   &gt; (Not saying that this is his actual plan, he could just be a greedy cunt in reality)  I don't want to attack this man, because in reality this is how every regular human is. Most humans are selfish and want the most for themselves and their family nothing more. I just don't believe the narrative that somehow he is a super charitable person or a man of the people."
"I think it’s going unnoticed that Lebron James has enough respect for the Coach, in an All Star Game, to ask permission to watch the halftime show.   As opposed to being like, “We’re going to watch J-Cole, it’s All Star Weekend, who cares, whatever” etc."
fair enough.  I don't think any permutation of assets on the Celtics end for Davis would be a win for them long-term though. there is a point where it'd be a bad trade. but I also don't think Anthony Davis is at the same level of a LeBron James-type player either. 
To LeBron James. Y'all lost to a rookie who wasn't even the rookie of the year. 
Young LeBron would win this easily. But today's current crop would be Giannis. Now if James Johnson was here fighting people to the death I would bet him

"I'm not gay, but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with LeBron. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him hitting 3's on the driveway hoop and running cone drills shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Daddy James. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry and sexually frustrated. Sometimes we will look across the table at dinner and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."

In case you think I'm lying check out the ROTY's over a 10 year stretch starting 3 years back(since 3 years isn't enough time to really tell for sure how player's developments will pan out.  2014-2015: Andrew Wiggins(ROTY), Best player of the class? Arguably yes.  2013-2014: Michael Carter-Williams(ROTY), Best player of the class? Giannis, Steven Adams, and CJ McCollum all say no.  2012-2013: Damian Lillard(ROTY), Best player of the class? Anthony Davis says no.  2011-2012: Kyrie Irving(ROTY), Best player of the class? Kawhi Leonard says no, Klay Thompson takes a fat hit and says maybe, Jimmer Fredette says 大概  2010-2011: Blake Griffin(ROTY), Best player of the class? Paul George says nah  2009-2010: Tyreke Evan(ROTY), Best player of the class? Steph Curry, James Harden, Jrue Holiday, Danny Green, Serge Ibaka, DeMar DeRozan, and the entire city of Sacramento say no.  2008-2009: Derrick Rose(ROTY), Best player of the class? Yes but Westbrook's non-ceramic knees argue no.  2007-2008: Kevin Durant(ROTY), Best player of the class? Yes, and a generational talent, we're now 1 for 8.  2006-2007: Brandon Roy(ROTY), Best player of the class? Aldridge, Lowry, Rondo, and Roy's 5 year career say no.  2005-2006: Chris Paul(ROTY), Best player of the class? Definitely, a generational talent? Hard to say yes to somebody who's never managed an injury free playoff run in their entire career.  2004-2005: Emeka Okafor(ROTY), Best player of the class? Iggy and Dwight say no.

"LeBron missed the point completely. It's not that doctors or lawyers or basketball players don't often have interesting things to say. It's that people tend to draw authority from the opinions of celebrities, which gets really silly when the celebrity doesn't know much about the subject they're speaking about. It's totally fair to judge the opinions of LeBron James as the opinion of a high-school educated basketball player, because that's literally what it is. The same way you'd judge to opinion of a doctor, or a lawyer, or a teacher. Everyone has their area of expertise. Just because you're famous and people are willing to listen to you doesn't mean you've automatically gained some deep understanding outside of your field.  "
Was that LeBron James?
"&gt;The small forward’s eyes widened in horror. ""WHAT THE HELL?! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?"" yelled Lebron.  &gt;It was the first time he'd seen the power forward look almost… nervous. ""Look, I am not going to lie. I need to practice my ball handling but there is nothing I can do in such a iso populated area like Chiraq."" Bosh explained, ""I'd travel for Battier if I could but I haven't the time. I was thinking, since you’re practically our point guard and all…""  &gt;Lebron stared in shock as Chris Bosh’s words sank in. ""No!"" he protested, ""No way in hell!""  &gt;The Boshtich smirked, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. ""What's the matter King, afraid I'll play too hard?"" he teased, voice soft and seductive as velvet, making the GOAT shiver.  &gt;Lebron looked away, too confused to try to retort. Stupid Bosh! Lebron was really wishing he had stayed in Miami, forgetting all about D-Wade and his melodramatic attitude. He did not care as long as got away from the power forward with the sinful voice. ""Hmmm,"" murmured Chris thoughtfully, ""I guess I could always ask Wade.""  &gt;”No!"" said Lebron, jumping from the bed to stand next to the dinosaur.  &gt;”Then shall we?""  &gt;""…""  &gt;”I'll take that as a yes then."" said Bosh with a smile.  &gt;”Now, take off your shirt."" Chris instructed, guiding the unsure GOAT to the large hotel bed as he unbuttoned his own shirt.  &gt;”What? Why?"" asked Lebron, flushing slightly as CB1 shrugged his coat to the floor.  &gt;”Well, it’s shirts vs skins and practice can get …messy.""  &gt;”Oh…."" James murmured, slowly striping off the top and settling back against the headboard of the bed.  End Scene"
Lebron James is old now lol 
"probably when we have genetically altered players, which by then will be the norm. every player will be like a fusion of Michael Jordan, Steph Curry, Lebron James and Magic Johnson."
"He's not wrong.  I think the next CBA needs to remove the provision where max players' increased contract extensions travel with them at all when they're traded. Teams don't trade *young* max players by choice, and it seems to be a big part of why they demand trades.  I saw Kellerman making a big deal of how if a player leaves a team in free agency they lose *tens of millions of dollars* like he thought this was unfair instead of *the point*.  A max contract is still going to be a huge amount of money. LeBron James would still be very, very rich off his NBA salary alone, and he's moved around in free agency a lot. The extra money players can get for staying with the team that drafted them isn't something all good players have a right to, it's effectively *penalty rates* for staying with a team they *didn't choose*.  Players don't have a choice in the team that drafts them. After their rookie contract is done, they can leave - but they'll be *slightly less rich*. That's supposed to be the choice they get - more money in a city they didn't choose, or they can walk and get less money in the city they did.  Wanting to get all the extra money *and* play for the team of their choice is like someone demanding to be paid Sunday rates for working weekdays. That's not how it works and *defeats the point of penalty rates*."

"Against Portland he didn’t look like himself until the OT when he made a bunch of deep threes. And after he came back his paint % significantly dropped. He didn’t have the mobility to attack , so all he did was chuck threes the rest of the playoffs. He never looked like how he did in the regular season, he lost a significant amount of burst. He happens to be an amazing shooter so there are times where it doesn’t matter, but he couldn’t attack.  He went from shooting 61% in the paint down to 45%. He had 26 shots blocked Vs 31 all regular season. All numbers via Synergy. You could also just use the eye test, he looked slow going around Love and the very next season made a point to blow by him on every switch. Combine this with the Cavs anyone but Steph strategy and you he a recipe for a bad time.   MCL injuries across sports are really bad and can change the way you play. For example, there was a season where Russell Wilson didn’t hit 50 yards rushing until week 8 because of his MCL injury. But he still could play. But he obviously wasn’t the same guy we know him to be.   He opted not to have surgery but that also meant he couldn’t play in the summer games. This past offseason he said was his best in a while because didn’t have to recover from anything. If he was healthy why wouldn’t he have played with Draymond Klay and KD for the first time on the Olympic team? He had to sit to heal.   Some links for you regarding his injury from the Ws perspective:   https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-steve-kerr-finals-injury-lucky-cavaliers-lebron-james-081016  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-stephen-curry-on-the-finals-i-wasnt-100-percent-but-who-cares/  Complex.com/sports/2016/08/Steve-Kerr-admits-warriors-changed-playoff-gameplan-Steph-curry-injuries   Nytimes.com/2016/06/07/sports/basketball/Stephen-curry-rio-Olympics-United-states-injury.html  Good for them for not trying to pin the blame on the injury but they do acknowledge how it altered things for them. This wasn’t the 73 win team with Steph leading the charge by the end. They had to make uncomfortable adjustments because his physical ability wasn’t there.   As for the Cavs coach I’ll look for it for you if you want to see it . It’ll take time to find because it was quoted anonymously from a Cavs exec a few years back now. But if you care that much about seeing it I’ll try and find it, I’m really not trying to BS you I just don’t like revisionist history regarding this injury. During broadcast they talked about it a lot and there’s so many instances where it was clear even in other series. If you want to try and find it yourself the quote talks about how they noticed the Ws offense wasn’t being ran the same to try and mask his ailment and they looked for that in film. "
"There has been some reports about the Bobby Portis' trade that I think reflects, to a certain degree, what happened in the DeRozan trade. What is useful is seeing the player's view and then his agent's comments.  This is what Portis said after the trade:  *""They told me how much they loved my energy, my heart, how hard I worked, how much I loved playing for the Bulls. Them telling me that I’m going to be there [through the deadline] and telling me that they want to work things out this summer [in restricted free agency]. We weren’t able to agree to a contract extension [before the October deadline], but they said they wanted to agree to something this summer before free agency hits.  “I think back on everything they told me. All this stuff was said and then I don’t even get notified when I’m getting traded? (pause) It’s just a crazy feeling. I guess I’m getting my first taste of the business. Business is business, I guess. I just don’t think it was done the right way.”*  Sounds similar to DeMar right? They said they weren't going to trade me, then they traded me but didn't even give me a heads up, etc...  Here is what Portis' agent said after the trade:  *""(General manager) Gar (Forman) made it very clear to me they had no interest in trading Bobby and wanted him there long term,” Bartelstein said. “However, like with anyone else, they had to listen to offers coming in. A day before the deadline, he didn’t think anything was going to happen. There’s no doubt in my mind that Gar and (executive vice president John Paxson) were sincere about their desire to re-sign him.*  *I told Bobby: ‘They love you. They want to get a deal done this summer and have no interest in trading you. But if the right offer comes about, absolutely you can get traded.’ The analogy I said to Bobby — these weren’t Gar’s words, they were mine — was, ‘If the Warriors offer Kevin Durant and the Lakers offer LeBron James, you’re getting traded.’ Basically, if somebody offers something the Bulls can’t refuse.”*  It's not hard to imagine something similar happening with DeMar. The Raptors would have been idiots not to ask the Spurs what they wanted for Kawhi when everyone knew he was on the trade block.  Imagine if Toronto asked what the price was and the Spurs said: ""We want DeRozan, Poeltl, Siakam, and an unprotected first"". Masai Ujiri/Bobby Webster would have responded with with: ""No, we aren't giving up all that for what could be a rental"".  Time passes, DeRozan is told he isn't being traded, yada yada.  Then RC Buford calls Masai/Bobby and says ""What about Kawhi and Danny for DeRozan, Poeltl, and a top 20 protected first"". That's a done deal for the Raptors. They agree and get the league on the phone for a trade call."
LeBron James and Jaylen Brown are two high profile drinkers that have said no when asked. I wouldn’t assume Zion will say yes if asked. 
"I would be interested in sharing some of my thoughts on Jordan vs. LeBron. However, unlike Russell vs. Chamberlain, this discussion has been very much played out among younger fans, so rather than focusing on ""who was better/greater?"", I wanted to focus some nuances to arguments that fans may not recognize (e.g. the argument for Jordan over LeBron based on X is not as significant as it may seem, but his advantage in Y is even greater than it appears at first glance; conversely, LeBron's advantage in A isn't as impressive, but B actually is). I would want to avoid repeating vapid talking points that really don't add anything substantive (""Jordan went 6-0 in the Finals"", ""LeBron beat a 73-win team"", ""Jordan never teamed with Magic and Larry"").  After having read Ben Taylor's amazing series, I would probably frame the discussion in the context of what he has already laid out (in much greater detail at both the scouting and statistical level than I can possibly imagine), although adding my own thoughts. I think the relative rankings of the two players are less important than recognizing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. I'm not sure what the best format to do so is, since I am reluctant to add a millionth ""Jordan vs. LeBron"" post to this subreddit. I would like to touch upon one issue though, at more length: their different team situations and how it pertains to what Taylor describes as ""ceiling raising"" vs. ""floor raising"".  For what it's worth, I think Jordan was the more impactful player at his peak and the more accomplished one, although that has a lot to do with his fortunes regarding the strengths of his team relative to the rest of the league by the time he was ready to compete. I would also give him an edge in intangibles. LeBron has a significant edge in longevity, and after reviewing Taylor's interesting statistical analysis, I think it is reasonable to argue that if players were assigned to random teams, over the balance of his longer playing career, LeBron would have been expected won more championships than Jordan, even as he continues to add to his career. This is a less results-oriented approach that better adjusts for individual player misfortune, but controversially assumes ""clutchness"" does not exist. (Even if that were to be true, I think it's abundantly clear that some pressure situations are more high leverage than others: Jordan's steal and layup sequence to close out the end of Game 6 in the 1998 Finals meant much more than if he had unleashed it in Game 3 of the same series, which the Bulls won by a 96-54 margin.)  One interesting nuance that was either implied or outright stated in Taylor's articles, which I accept. Jordan was better at lifting a great team to all-time status (""ceiling raising""), whereas LeBron was likely better at lifting an otherwise mediocre roster to strong records (""floor raising""). Part of this has to do with the construction of the roster: Jordan's Bulls featured excellent defenses with solid offensive players and elite offensive rebounding, perfect for a transcendent volume scorer, whereas many of LeBron's teammates were roleplayers who were elite perimeter shooters but limited ball-handlers who were dependent on his shot creating ability. This also reflects their relative strengths, Jordan the better off-ball player (and actually extremely underrated for historically low turnover rates for a player in his role) and LeBron the better passer. That is not to say the two could not flourish if roles were swapped: Jordan famously averaged a near triple-double to conclude the 1989 season when moved to PG, and LeBron used unleashed off-ball cuts and a new propensity for the post to devastating effect in Miami to take advantage of Dwyane Wade's skills as the second ball-handler.  In considering their roles in floor/ceiling-raising, I should note that two differences between Jordan's era and the current era that may be lost on current fans. The first is that offensive possessions (as measured by time spent in possession of the ball or similar metrics) during Jordan's era were not nearly as monopolized by the primary handler as they are with current offenses in a manner not represented by usage rate alone (a metric of shot attempts, turnovers, and box score assits). This is not a phenomenon exclusive to LeBron, but the ball runs through him (and his contemporaries such as Westbrook, Harden, and countless others) much more than it ran through Jordan (and his contemporaries such as even Magic and Bird), and statistics need to be evaluated through that context. The second is that while star players have always tried to exert control over their team rosters, Jordan among the most vocal during his day, players have never wielded as much influence as they do in today's era, partly due to the effects of numerous CBA changes and increasing player salaries paradoxically giving players the financial freedom to actually explore their own values beyond the highest bidder. I mention this because while LeBron's contending teams have never been as stacked relative to other contending teams as Jordan's best teams (1992, 1996, and 1997) were, slightly decreasing his probability of achieving championships in any particular season, but they were incredibly talented in their own right. In fact, his teams were on several occasions selected from all 30 teams for the best championship opportunities, with all young assets and future draft picks hastily tossed aside for short-term considerations to maximize the window of competition under James. (While I despise this strategy from basketball viewership, as someone who has staunchly supported players in labor disputes, I thoroughly applaud James for realizing that his market value far exceeds what he is able to be paid under the CBA and using his leverage accordingly.) I mention this because even though LeBron's team situation may not have been as ideal as Jordan's for winning championships, as a result of the unprecedented control he had over his choice of team and roster situation (no one had ever prompted so many teams to repeatedly clear salary cap space years in advance), it was the best situation for him to repeatedly compete in the Finals, as well as to maximize his box score statistics as well as his on-off stats by ensuring that he would be placed in ball-dominant offenses full of players that can ensure maximal spacing, but who would crumble in his absence (whether due to injury or rest) as their role players were entirely dependent on his shot creation. And of course, when he left these teams, this phenomenon was further exacerbated due to the above factors as well as the exodus of veterans/ring-chasers, the shift towards tanking towards the future, and the absence of young players or draft picks as a result of trades made to improve their championship window during the LeBron tenure. Long story short, because of these factors, it is entirely unfair to criticize LeBron for not matching Jordan's six rings as his team situation was different, but by the same token, that same team situation that he sculpted allowed his statistics and his on-off impact to look much more favorable in comparison."
"I think there’s era’s...2009-2011 I’d say Dirk was, his one legged fade-away was fucking butter. Then 2012-2016 I’d say Lebron. Right now it’s a tie to me between James Harden and KD."
"ok well you have your definition of household name and the rest of the thread has a different definition of household name. the point being made here is that to people who don't follow sports *at all*, its pretty much Lebron James and Steph Curry as players who are very well-known. anyone past that is not prevalent enough in major headlines to be known that well.  anecdotally, i'd say Harden is more of a household name than Irving, and its less so his name and more-so his beard that people recognize.  your options are   &gt; A: continue to be obtuse and have your own definition  &gt; B: get with the program"

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
to be fair he got the nickname in like high school so it stuck with him forever.  it would be like if lebron was just called king james his whole career and no one ever called him lebron
"If K Love is healthy the Cavs win in 2015, that’s what I was talking about. The warriors still won every year other than the year the Cavs won.   Also, the most obvious you dont watch or understand basketball take is saying Steph was hurt. Steph wasn’t hurt. He was tired. Cavs made him switch onto everything so he couldn’t carry the offense because he was tired from playing so much defense. Kyrie and Lebron targeted him. If K Love doesn’t have his concussion he probably bullies him down low too too. To use one of my favorite quotes, Cavs out tacticed the warriors in 2016. That’s why getting KD was so huge for the warriors, it got rid of their one flaw which was outside of curry, they weren’t that great of an offensive team, but were merely the best defensive team ever.   Also, Bogut played like 10mpg. Other than his 4 block quarter he wasn’t relevant. That’s like saying James Jones was amazing in 2015 because he hit a bunch of 3s in a quarter. (I know bogut was much more important than Jones but I was just throwing a random example out there) "
"Arvydas gets overrated as a passer these days.  Sabas and Walton Sr. used to be the benchmark for passing big men because back then, it was a goddamn miracle when someone over 7 feet dribbled the length of the court without looking at the ball.  That's not to disparage Bill and Arvydas, who were excellent passers by any standard, but it's absolutely unfair to compare Jokic to those two just because of their height and skill color.  Nikola Jokic has the kind of court vision and passing touch that's more appropriately compared to guys like John Stockton, Magic Johnson, Chris Paul, Steve Nash, and Lebron James- in other words, the best passers ever regardless of size, skin color, or position.  The guy is basically Tom Brady in the Michelin Man's body- I truly believe he's the best natural passer I've seen since Magic Johnson."

"Harden is only known among sports fans. If you say James Harden to somebody who never watches basketball they would have no clue.

"Anyone should be allowed to talk about politics. Nobody should be surprised when they talk about politics and people disagree with them publicly.  Lebron isn't being silenced. Nobody's forcing him not to state his views. The dude described NFL owners as ""old white men with slave-owner mentality"" and wasn't penalized by the league, his team, or the law.  The only thing Lebron has to deal with is the public's response to his opinions, because he's a public figure with a big audience. Sometimes that response is ""hey, you're maybe not the most qualified to speak on this issue"" - and when he gets that response, he gets pissed.  Why should anyone be entitled to never have their opinions challenged in a public forum, whether they're a coal miner or Lebron James?"

You’re arguing that basketball players are a good resource for political and economic opinions but you’re calling me dumb? Ok. I guess I have no choice assume that you also think the earth is flat."
"The bottom line is someone like Lebron James making up racist stories absolutely hurts those impacted by real racism. Everything you believe to be true and the result of racism (systemic or otherwise) is belittled when someone like Lebron James uses racism as his PR mechanism.   The fact that you didn’t know the story was made up is a problem, too. Maybe many of the things you use as examples are also made up? For example, that recent hoax from the empire actor who made up being attacked so he could claim supporters of the president are racist and homophobic. "
"Because they can’t stand that Kobe is better than the NBA’s and the Media’s wonderboy, Lebron James...."
The time Lebron James hit Steph Curry with a slide tackle in the finals and it was deemed a legal problem play.   IMO a really obvious foul and dangerous play. I remember here on r/ nba a lot of people down voting anyone mentioning it and explain how it was a “clean play”. One of those times I felt like I was taking crazy pills.
“ LeBron James TO AD”
what if you get your news from Lebron James...
"Household Name is when you can walk into any house and say the name and they have an idea of who he is, even if they know nothing about the sport.   Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Lebron James are household names. "
Yes. Lebron James peddles fake news. It’s a disgrace. 
"He has a point, there's probably less than 10 household names in the NBA.  Vince Carter, Dirk, LeBron, Wade, Steph Curry, Kyrie, Kevin Durant, James Harden and possibly Giannis are probably the only players that actually fit the true definition. "
I’m not the person who posted that but I think they might be talking about this:  https://www.outkickthecoverage.com/lebron-james-alleges-racist-graffiti-still-zero-evidence/
"Injured guard Lonzo Ball yelled, “Off we go! Off we go.” Non-freethrow sharpshooper Brandon Ingram gave a look of unpleasant surprise. Swing center Kyle Kuzma belted, “We got [expletive] locker room problems now.” And before Rich Paul hit LeBron James' private jet's door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett glared at him &amp; said, “Y’alls energy look so different.”"
"Again, your opinion of the President doesn’t imbue Lebron James with extra knowledge or insight into politics or economics. I give him all the respect he deserves as an athlete but that’s all. There’s nothing wrong with admitting that you shouldn’t get your political opinions from a celebrity and it’s pretty obvious that Lebron and other nba players have other priorities and responsibilities (like training, playing 80+ games a year, endorsement commitments) that don’t leave much extra time to research. Should I also accept Kyrie’s opinions on the shape of earth or Jaylen Rose’s opinion on the moon landing with equal value to Lebron’s views of politics?  You can be a good role model without calling millions of people “uneducated” because you don’t know enough to understand why half the country voted differently like Lebron did. The irony is Trump won because many Americans are tired of being called stupid by celebrities like Lebron calling them stupid and telling them they know better than us what’s good for us.   So ya, he can shut up and dribble for all I care."
"“Commissioner LeBron James updated the Illegal Defense rules today, making it a technical foul to come within 5 feet of him while he has the ball. When asked for comment, he only replied ‘LeFuck You, I’m the LeCommissioner’”"

Traveling doesn't exist in All Star Weekend (or the NBA) ~ Lebron James
There is no way Lebron James comes off the bench for that team unless you mean for the first quarter of a game until everyone realized he was anally shafting everyone on the court 
Imagine the narrative of Lebron James coming into the league and right away beating Kobe and Shaq.   My goodness.
"&gt; **After college I spent a year playing minor-league pro basketball in Bavaria, and even at our level the social hierarchy was strict. Inequality on court played itself out in lots of ways off it. Better players talked more on the bus and in the locker room, won the arguments, made the jokes that people laughed at. For some reason, benchwarmers like me let them have their way. The season left deep marks on me. Being an athlete teaches you pretty quickly where you belong in the scale of things. Five-year-olds often think they're the fastest kid in school. And then they learn. It's a pretty basic thing that happens to everybody: You realize that other people are better than you. Except LeBron never had—until last season, maybe. For the first time in his life his teammates were good enough to win a championship, and the reason they didn't win is that LeBron got outplayed—by Dirk Nowitzki, who happened to be the star of the league I played in 15 years ago.**    &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; **The whole place, in fact, had a slightly imaginary feel. The W itself, someone suggested, had been built on a strip of reclaimed land, a long lagoon added to the old city and taken over by international hotel chains. Hotel flunkies, friendly, Spanish, handsome, their English faintly American, Hollywood-flavored (another unreal touch), opened doors and carried bags. Rich ugly men came in and out with half-dressed women. You got more vividly than normal a sense of the sexual economy at work. Pretty young Spaniards got jobs; pretty girls got holidays; rich men got company. Two thirds of the way up the curving implausible silhouette of the hotel was a series of bright lines, hundreds of feet long, made up of lights. Apparently these described the outline of the suite LeBron James was staying in. The idea that I might meet and talk to him seemed as unreal as everything else.**   &amp;#x200B;"
Who are lebron james and cristiano ronaldo?
"He's only been the best in that period, but what it means to me is that he's the best offensive player at least this century. He hasn't been dominant in all of that period but he's been the most dominant out of anyone who has played in it. That's obviously debatable because you could make strong cases that players like Kobe, Lebron, Shaq, KD, or James Harden are better and I might do that, but Curry is probably the best. "
do your numbers take into consideration that the lakers have lebron james? and that lebron james teams have historically played much better after allstar break?
Yeah and James brick Harden would have stood zero chance against any LeBron led Cavs team.
LeBron has never won a title without James Jones. 
Bradley Beal told me he has one goal in mind during All-Star weekend: Kill LeBron James 
"You can't compare Zion to Barkley- Barkley doesnt have enough tools. Just cuz u see them flying down the court and play the same position and have close listed weight, doesnt mean theyre comparable. Lebron's game is ""lazy"" compared to zions.   Zion has better ball IQ, slightly better vision, way better passing, and WAY, WAY better ball handling than James. There's easy proof to this if u can train ur eye. James looks stiff with his ballhandling, and Zion doesnt dribble anywhere NEAR as much as James, but is also nice and fluid.   Also more physically imposing. This kid handles the ball like a guard but can play the forward even center spot. Zion puts the BANG in banging in the post, yet lebron doesnt have those skills. And that was the only thing Barkley knew how to do because he had zero guard-style ball handling.  The kid is ridiculously athletic a POWER Guard - which is the true evolution of a position in basketball. Unless there's a mastermind of a coach like Belichick in the NBA, i highly doubt Zions skillsets will ever be used to stop strengths of championship teams, which i believe he can. Did u see his close out block on that corner 3? This guy has the freakish ability to strike fear in the hearts of 3 point chuckers like harden, curry, doncic, etc not by making them alter their shot, but by sending their shot into the 15th row.   Barkley or Lebron cannot even compare, in fact these are comparisons made by fans with low ball iq. Barkley &amp; James are on mount rushmore, but this kid has his own mount zion for a reason. His own coach knows him best, and even he says theres no comparison. He's the first Zion"

I assumed that the audience in a NBA subreddit would have a baseline of understanding where it wouldn't even be considered that Karl Malone was a better scorer than a guy like Kobe, Durant, etc.    And for Lebron, I'll write it again for you.  He's never averaged 10 assists per game in his whole career.  A baseline that the actual top passers of all time hit regularly(especially considering how much Lebron handles the ball).  And he has a much worse assist to turnover ratio than the top passers of all time do.   "

" Since returning to Cleveland, LeBron has repeatedly transformed from an average rim protector in the regular season into an elite rim protector in the playoffs.  In the 2015-2017 postseasons, LeBron has held opposing players to 46.1% shooting around the rim in the playoffs. This would rank him among the best rim protectors in the league.  Keep in mind is that he faces much better teams on a nightly basis in the playoffs than in the regular season.  Comparison of LeBron's rim protection in the Regular Season VS.

Then you had Rodman and Harper after that along with Kukoc was a solid defender.     2016 LeBron.

Had James not stopped those shots (everyone knows the blocked shot on Iggy), Warriors win.     The guy not only led them in scoring and creating offense for others, he led their perimeter defense AND was one of the best rim protectors in the entire 2016 NBA playoffs.   Now, Zion, if he mainly ends up playing big man type of defense he has a chance to be better but it's way early to say he's definitely going to be better than one of the greatest wing defenders of all time.

It gets even harder when considering active players, players who played before we had full box scores, and so on.  But since you asked, here are 19 players who **it could be argued** are or were better, or had better careers, than Kobe Bryant, in some approximate order: Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, David Robinson, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan, Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Shaquille O'Neal, Julius Erving, Kevin Garnett, John Stockton, Bill Russell, Dirk Nowitzki, Moses Malone, Oscar Robertson and George Mikan.

I still think both are top 10 based on accolades, and what was written and said about them at the time. There just aren't 10 overall resume's that can compete with them so I think they are both top 10.   &amp;#x200B;  If i think two players from the past are in the same tier based on their accolades I don't really get all that invested in the debates if I haven't watched them. If someone tries to tell me Reggie Miller is better than James Harden however I don't believe I need to watch a single Reggie Miller game to say, ""James Harden is about to get his 5th 1st team all-nba selection. Reggie made 5 All-Star team's and 0 2nd or 1st team All-NBA's.  In other words, James Harden has been selected as top 2 player (by mvp) 4 times. Reggie Miller was never selected as top 4 guard in the league.""  &amp;#x200B;  I can say with complete confidence that I don't need to watch a single Reggie Miller game (even though I have) to conclude that Harden is clearly better.  I feel the same way about say comparing someone like Oscar to Lebron. Oscar was never the best player in the league, LeBron has been the best player in the playoffs 7 years in a row. Now if the comparison is LeBron vs Jordan I don't really have a strong stance because I didn't watch Jordan and he can actually compete with LeBron's complete dominance of his peers.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;"

"Only ""stans"" like [David Griffin](https://youtu.be/oVh1DSJ4YKw?t=169) and [Ranaan Katz (Heat minority owner](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2612073-pat-riley-responds-to-claims-lebron-james-wanted-erik-spoelstra-fired) and [Pat Riley](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/pat-riley-denies-lebron-james-ever-asked-for-erik-spoelstra-to-be-fired/) would ever claim that LeBron avoids GM decisions."
Is LeBron James Jr. going to have a better career than his dad? 
"As long as Lebron James is in the NBA, he will be worth a max contract  This whole take is terrible and you should feel bad about it"
yeah i get where you're coming from. its just that basketball is such a day to day game that it's hard to rank how good they are and if they'll make the playoffs. IMHO i don't think they will but jesus it's lebron fucking james i wouldnt be surprised if they made it lol
LeBron James    This seems to be consensus on r/lakers
Lebron James Ganondorf? 
"It's expected at this point. I don't think it's ""bad"".  It's bad for Lebron, but the Lakers have missed the playoffs for years now.  No continuity for the players.    year 0: Randle suffers season ending injury 1st game  year 1: Kobe going away party, D'Lo's first year  year 2: D'Lo playing ok, Ingram's first year  year 3: D'Lo kicked to the curb, Lonzo (kuzma, hart) 1st year  year 4: Randle kicked to the curb, acquire Lebron James and the looney tunes.   Zero continuation and you can't even say the roster has gotten better, other than the addition of Lebron James."
"James ""I want to be my own boss"" Lebron only wants yes man type of coaches."
Opponents shot 1-10 FG going at LeBron James last night.  LeBron forced an incredible 10 turnovers defensively.  Lol downvoted with no valid counter arguments. But that’s r/nba I guess
So r/NBA is a LeBron James circle jerk? Got it.

"I guess that’s to be expected though. I mean they lost LeBron for a month and then when he got back, he killed the team himself by throwing all his players under the bus in the form of making a push for a Davis trade. Knowing damn well that’s break the spirit of the young stars on his squad.   This might be the first time I’ve said it. But my fingers pointed at James here. "
"the Warriors are so fucking OP you can take the team that took them to 7 last year and nearly beat them (the Rockets), add Lebron-fucking-James to that squad, and the Warriors still have a decent shot at winning that matchup"
"Lebron James 'is pretty much still injured,' so Lakers should shut him down - Rich Paul"
"This guy is uncoachable, unfortunately for him everyone's been telling him how great he is since he was a freshman and thus wanted him to coast off of his athleticism without taking criticism from a teacher. This problem became exacerbated as he got older and he never allowed himself to be coached except for Miami, where Riley put his foot down.  Dude is basically a basketball ""know-it-all"" except his Finals record is shitty and his teammates hate him.  Lebron 10/25/17: “I think the best thing for me personally is that ever since I was a kid I’ve always learned every position on the floor. When I started playing ball, for some odd reason, I could learn every single position on the floor all at one time, as a point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center and know all the plays, what they’re doing and what’s the reads.” James said.  “To this day, still, if I’m able, if coach slides me to the one, I know every set. If he slides me to the five, I know the five. I know the four, I know the three, I know the two. I know every single play at every single position. It makes the job a lot easier for me because I know where I should be and where my teammates should be.”"
[from Brian Windhorst](https://sports.yahoo.com/rumor-lebron-james-weighs-280-150002281.html) 
"Yeah, and why do you think that is?  Because people with money in Georgia *stayed in Georgia* and started making movies.  If Lebron James wants to build a multimedia empire in Cleveland, he could get it done."
"Idk if I’m too far gone with memes or not, but after about 2 minutes of looking at this data, I started looking to see if someone made a rough outline of Lebron James’ face inside the graph. "
I'd go with all assists or all steals. 2x Lebron James or Jordan+2x Pippens+Hakeem
"Lebron and LA, I wouldn't want to be anywhere near James Dolan.   TBH I'd rather sign with the Nets than either of them. That management seems smart, live and practice in Brooklyn, playoff team already, wouldn't have to deal with nearly the scrutiny. Plus they have no bad contracts so you could hopefully recruit someone down the road."
"Yeah I would normally agree, however LeBron doesn’t fit with the young group the Lakers have. If you add Zion 19, to the young group of Ingram 21, Kuzma 23, Ball 21, Booker 22. That could be your future for a long time. LeBron James is going to be 35 next year and wants a star or two in their prime to join him. "
Yet 34 year old LeBron James is averaging 27 9 rpg &amp; 8 apg &amp; people are calling it a dcline.
What he did in the Finals 8 months ago on a different team in a different conference has nothing to do with the situation he’s in now.   Yes. Obviously he’s LeBron James and cant be counted out. But to act like he’s GUARANTEED to still make it “because it’s LeBron” is ignoring a whole lot of glaring issues. 
I think that Kevin Love - Lebron James thread takes the cake. That was definitely our lowest point as a sub.
Lebron james is the goat
Kyrie has yet to play a playoff game without LeBron James on his team. He's never been the first option in the playoffs like Giannis.
"&gt;I can't explain why but if LBJ came and we did win a chip, it would feel cheapened somehow.  Fuck no it wouldn't.  Not in this city.  I've been watching the Hawks for about 25 years now, LeBron freaking James playing for ATL and winning a title would probably be the biggest thing sports wise to ever happen in the city.  Way bigger than the Braves title in 95, if only for LeBron.   "
How could the players not like him [comparing coaching an NBA playoff team to being a fighter pilot or his experiences coaching in Israel](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/05/david-blatt-fighter-pilot-lebron-james-cavaliers) which he would constantly use to try to convince players he knew what it took to win in the NBA? You mean some players might not be too enthused by such buffoonery? 
That's my point.  Poster said  &gt; Both James ... must be regretting their decisions to partner up  like LeBron isn't getting what he wanted on the move.
LeBron's pathetic lack of effort on defense needs to be called out. James Harden got so much talk for his bad defense a couple of years ago but LeBron right now is worse than Harden ever was.
Hot take: LeBron isn’t even the best James in the NBA
Breaking news- the lakers have traded LeBron James to the cavs for a 2nd round pick.   “Doing it for the land y’all!”
"apparently its only obvious to me that he already conceded this season and is looking to turn this clusterfuck of a roster into a superteam by next year when the warriors would be less stacked. this is lebron fucking james, if he gets AD i am 100% sure another borderline all star player would sign with the lakers as well. LeBron, AD + 1 would be the team to beat given that KD leaves golden state. "
"I think he may have had enough of dealing with James. Mark Jackson, on the other hand, is a Klutch Sports client and lives in the LA area. Also, he's a massive hypocrite so he and LeBron would have something in common."
"16. Jaren Jackson Jr. Memphis Grizzlies Forward/center Age: 19.4  Just as it looked like we were going to see Jackson get extended run as the man in the middle after the Marc Gasol trade, the rookie will be forced to sit out indefinitely with a deep thigh bruise.  He arguably has -- and often shows -- more defensive potential than any other player from this most recent draft. He can stay with ball handlers and more than holds his own at the rim. But he can score, too. And he'll be a legitimate problem for the league if he ends up being anywhere near a 40 percent shooter from deep. -- Herring   T-17. Jamal Murray Denver Nuggets Guard Age: 22.0  Having recently celebrated his 22nd birthday, Murray is already the second-leading scorer for a Nuggets team contending for the top seed in the Western Conference. That thumbnail sketch overstates Murray's current value; he scores with below-average efficiency and benefits from Jokic handling much of Denver's playmaking.  Given the typical development curve for point guards, however, Murray will likely improve his shooting accuracy and give the Nuggets a star-caliber perimeter creator to complement Jokic. -- Pelton   T-17. Deandre Ayton Phoenix Suns Center Age: 20.6  By the box score, Ayton's rookie season has been an amazing success. The No. 1 overall pick is averaging 16.4 points and 10.5 rebounds per game while shooting 59 percent. Per Basketball-Reference.com, Ayton's 20.9 player efficiency rating is ninth best on record for a 20-year-old player averaging at least 30 MPG.  In an era where efficient scoring and rebounding are easy to find at center, Ayton must expand his game to help the Suns win. He has made progress as a defender but the 112.1 defensive rating Phoenix allows with Ayton on the court (per NBA.com) would rank 29th in the league. -- Pelton   19. John Collins Atlanta Hawks Forward Age: 21.4  On a roster that features six first-round picks, Collins is the lone Hawks representative on our list. He fits the mold of a prototypical small-ball center.  Collins is multidimensional based on his ability to stretch the floor (shooting 37 percent from 3, including 49 percent from the corner), rebound (ranking eighth with 3.6 offensive rebounds per game) and score down low (76 percent of his field goals made from five feet or less, per NBA.com).  Although he has played only 18 percent of his minutes at center this season, expect that to change in the future, especially with current starter Dewayne Dedmon set to be a free agent. -- Marks   20. Jusuf Nurkic Portland Trail Blazers Center Age: 24.5  Five years into his NBA career, Nurkic cracks the 25-under-25 list on his last chance. After signing a four-year, $48 million contract in 2018, Nurkic is having his best statistical season on both ends of the court. He ranks No. 7 among centers in win shares (6.64), No. 6 in RPM (4.02) among centers and No. 6 in defensive RPM (3.62) among all players.  The question moving forward is if Nurkic can stretch his game outside the paint -- 82 percent of his field goal attempts this season have occurred within nine feet (per NBA.com). -- Marks   T-21. Marvin Bagley III Sacramento Kings Forward Age: 19.9  Bagley represents an even more extreme version of the disconnect between box-score production (20 points and 10.4 rebounds per 36 minutes) and impact (he ranks 91st among power forwards in RPM) than Ayton. At best, Bagley's combination of size and athleticism looks unstoppable in the paint. At worst, he develops tunnel vision offensively and is often in the wrong place on D.  We've seen players overcome poor RPM early in their career to become valuable contributors, and Bagley can follow in their footsteps by improving his weaknesses while reinforcing the strengths that made him the No. 2 pick last June. -- Pelton   T-21. Caris LeVert Brooklyn Nets Guard Age: 24.5  The Brooklyn swingman was fortunate to avoid what, at the time, looked like it would be a season-ending injury when he suffered a dislocated right foot. But in the time he missed, D'Angelo Russell became an All-Star, perhaps forcing LeVert to take at least a half-step back in the offense while he regains his bearings.  Nonetheless, the 6-foot-7 wing has shown the ability to potentially average 20-5-5 in extended minutes, all while playing above-average D. It just may take him time to shake off rust -- or an opportunity to showcase his ability without having to split the ballhandling responsibilities with such capable players in Russell and Spencer Dinwiddie. -- Herring   T-21. Kyle Kuzma Los Angeles Lakers Forward Age: 23.6  We are giving Kuzma the benefit of the doubt based on his upside, and not what he has done for most of this season. If we are judging Kuzma solely on analytics and not the eye test, the forward would not be on this list. He ranks No. 36 among power forwards (behind Noah Vonleh and D.J. Wilson) in RPM (minus-0.12) and has seen his 3-point shooting take a dip this season (from 36.6 to 31.8 percent).  To be fair, some of this can be blamed on the revolving point guard situation in L.A., with Lonzo Ball and Rajon Rondo each missing time after injuries. The top seven lineups for the Lakers this season feature Ball alongside Kuzma. -- Marks   24. Lonzo Ball Los Angeles Lakers Guard Age: 21.3  Nothing has reinforced Ball's value to the Lakers during his second season more than his month-plus absence due to a severe ankle sprain, during which L.A. has gone 4-9 despite LeBron James' return midway through that stretch.  Ball has struggled with confidence in his shot during Year 2, making just 42 percent of his free throws (though he has improved his accuracy on both 2-pointers and 3-pointers). Nonetheless, the value Ball brings as an unselfish playmaker and defender gives him the potential to develop into a key part of a contending team. -- Pelton   25. Jaylen Brown Boston Celtics Forward Age: 22.3  Is this three-spot drop from last season's rankings due to Brown peaking prematurely during his sophomore season, the realization that he could be best suited coming off the bench or a lack of confidence based on an undefined role? The answer could be a combination of all three.  One thing to keep in mind is that Brown is still only 22 and one year removed from being labeled one of the NBA's elite young wings thanks to his size, strong frame, wingspan and ability to play downhill. -- Marks  "
"Still not sure about *needs* to shoot righty. There just aren't examples of a player shooting with one hand his whole life (even if it's the wrong hand) and then becoming a good shooter after switching hands (even if it's to the right one). There are plenty of examples of players who learned to become solid-to-good shooters shooting with their off-hand (Larry Bird, LeBron James) and even someone who was not a good shooter who became good by working on shooting with the off-hand (Mike Conley). However, the main difference is that Simmons is a non-shooter, not just a bad one. He seems to have good touch with his right hand and he was essentially starting from scratch when working on his lefty shot in the NBA.  I just don't think we should assume switching hands will fix anything. He'll probably be a bad shooter with his right hand."

Is Pat Riley lying too? https://heatnation.com/media/pat-riley-reveals-lebron-james-wanted-erik-spoelstra-fired-2010/
"If James Harden can keep the Rockets with Eric Gordon, Chris Paul, and Clint Capela all missing time and carry that roster, which has the biggest depth problem in the NBA to being solidly in the playoffs LeBron has no reason to be getting bodied by the Grizzlies.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm not throwing shade and i'm not moving the goal posts. I'm just holding him to the same standards other players are at. He doesn't get to transcend standards because of the past, if he can't do what another guy is doing then he's not better than that guy."
Can't wait for Lebron to be replaced by Will Ferrell then James Spader
"All you're saying is that the Warriors are really fkin good. We already know that, I don't think you can knock Lebron for losing to them in the finals, lol. He still walked through the East with an awful supporting cast. We don't know how well the Cavs would've done in the West, seeing as they're an EC team and all.   But yes, the Lakers are awful this year. Nobody is denying that. I still reckon they squeak into the playoffs, but I'm certainly not arguing that Lebron alone is enough to make any sorry team a contender. Just saying that Lebron James is still a really fkin good, elite basketball player even in 2019. "

"I get so sick of hearing shit like that, honestly. When I put more effort on defense in a PICKUP GAME than LEBRON JAMES trying to make the playoffs, there's a fucking massive problem."
"Time is OP. LeBron has enjoyed the luxury of the East his entire career. Not taking his accomplishments away from him, but it has allowed him to  limit his minutes during the regular season. The West demands more, and trying to make the playoffs is going to be a war just like it was last year.  At this juncture, I think it's 'healthier' for Lakers to hang up this season and focus on keeping LeBron healthy and on limited minutes. But, this doesn't help you going into next season, unless you're able to assemble a formidable cast — And with the west stacked as it is, I don't see how adding two all-stars would alleviate the basic problem of trying to seed in the west and the demands it places on James. There are so many attractive destinations in the West now, not the least of which is Clippers.   IMO James has become a white elephant for the Lakers. I don't think a solution exists for LA that results in serious championship contention — If they had Jerry West helping out the FO maybe I'd feel differently."
'With LeBron James becoming the only player to rank top 10 all-time'   Such wrong statement from ESPN and fans fall for it.       When Oscar Robertson retired he was leading the assist numbers and was 2nd in points charts.      LeBron isn't the only or the first one.
"Sorry I think that is absurd. For arguments sake let's say Garry Payton played today. He is going to get picked on because he can't credibly guard wings. He is going to get switched on to the better wings like KD, Kawhi, LeBron ect and it's a free basket without help.   Two reasons why wings are more important one you mentioned. First, at the highest levels you can't really play conventional PnR defence. You literally can't play that way vs James Harden or Steph. You pretty much have to switch it, its irrelevant how good your guard is. And, teams will hunt those switches and bully the guard because they can't credibly guard bigger wings. A Steph/KD PnR is going to get switched and a guard is toast trying to switch on KD. Second, most good teams have bigger wings that demand a wing to guard. Like the Raptors vs the Cavs. Literally had no one to guard LeBron for years. You can put Garry Payton on the Raptors he is just not going to have the impact Kawhi would/will have.   It's pretty simple. Paul George can guard a point guard very well and can guard KD pretty well. Marcus Smart can guard point guard really and can't guard KD without help. It seems pretty self explanatory why a wing is going to have a bigger impact than a guard. "
People got so heated at Kobe-stans early this season for not liking LeBron James. Seems like the circle jerk has come full circle.
"LeBron James: 239 career playoff games Kobe: 220, 200 if you don't count his first two years playing off the bench.  Yet the same amount of field goals. Stats don't display fear"
Nah.   Giannis hasn't even proven he can play in the big game.  At this point he is just like 2007 Lebron James. His lack of shooting will be exposed in the later rounds.
They almost beat prime LeBron James... Dumb comment.
"Pelicans receive: LeBron James  Lakers receive: Randle, Holiday, Okafor, 2019 1st Round, 2021 1st Round, 2023 1st Round  Rich Paul receives: termination letter (James), termination letter (Davis)"
A TEAM WITH LEBRON JAMES AND ANTHONY DAVIS WITH A 20 PPG THIRD OPTION WOULDNT MAKE THE PLAYOFFS???  This sub is fucking retarded. Goodness gracious. 
Game-tying/go-ahead field goals with under 10 seconds left in the postseason:  Michael Jordan: 7/15 (47%) Kobe Bryant: 5/22 (23%) LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)  In a class of his own  Sorry try again.
And LeBron has been consistently named LeBron James for good entire career.  Gotta respect the consistency
Are you really comparing dwight howard to lebron james? Lebron's had a legendary career regardless of how these years in LA will play out. People are going to give him his due. Don't be ridiculous.
"Absolutely not. The two biggest problems this franchise has been cursed with this year is Luke Walton and his ineptitude + LeBron James not giving a shit + injuries.  Bytheway, I don't know whether you watched last game, but we were literally playing defense 4vs5 with him on the floor. "
"Lebron is 34 years old bro, he already showing signs of decline. Mufuka been play'n James Harden level defense this year. And he getting injured missing a month of basketball.  That is a big deal in year 1 of his deal is it not?"
"Lebron joining the Cavs isn't a great example cause that team had a lot of veteran presence including Mike Miller, James Jones, Shawn Marion, Perkins, J.R, KLove etc. Really the only young star that they had to worry about was Kyrie. The vets far out-weigh the youngins "
&gt;There is this dude named Giannis who will playing DLo’s entire career  That doesn’t mean anything. LeBron James was playing Kevin Durant’s entire career but he won an mvp. And they were playing for Stephen Curry’s entire career and he won 2. And now Paul George is having a top 3 season in the league

There's not a lot of bigger stars in the world than Lebron James dude
"I agree with you, but LeBron very rarely is the best player during the regular season anymore. He'll have a handful of **amazing** games per year, but he's been ""coasting"" the regular season for 5+ years (which is still in the top 5% of the league of course).  But in a Game 7 in the playoffs, my first pick is still LeBron James, and I think that's what makes him the best player in the league still. He has the capacity to be the best player on the floor in any matchup. But he's finally in a position where ""coasting"" won't bring him to the playoffs. There are plenty of criticisms I have of LeBron, but I still think he's the most skilled and most clutch player in the league right now."
If I’ve learned anything from my decade of being disappointed because of LeBron James - unrealistic isn’t the same as impossible.
"The only reason this foul is ""an issue"" is because it's about Lebron.   That was a CHARGE, period.   Reason (obvious one) is that Noah didn't move laterally and was in the path WAY before James came in.   Lebron expected the superstar call and didn't get it - as he SHOULD NOT. It was a knucklehead bully superstar (lazy) play and shouldn't be rewarded.   Just like that 3 airball that Lebron was lebitching about - and it was leclear ball was not touched (or even contested).   Ledrama continues to lecrumble. "
Except that LeBron James didn't want to be in Ohio any more.
Dude. He also has a higher career field goal percentage than Jordan. Relax. Jordan is the GOAT. But you sound like an idiot. What I said was factually true. LeBron James got there on fewer shots and a better field goal percentage. Just stop.
"Bron Stans on twitter already crediting James for the comeback, they are absolute filth and have no respect for any ballers other than Lebron."
"I don't know, you might wanna ask Lebron about that,  ""I would say that I don't really have an individual rivalry. I think the closest would be Paul Pierce,"" James said. ""I would say Boston is a rival of mine because I've met them so many times in the postseason. I've been able to advance against them, they've sent me home fishing a few times. So I would say Boston and Paul Pierce would kind of be that guy, if I had to name just one guy.""  Since you like having links and all.  https://articles.masslive.com/celtics/index.ssf/2013/06/lebron_james_paul_pierce_bosto.amp"
A rested Lebron James to finish out the fourth.  This could be interesting.  
"Fuck outta here bro lol. The Lakers are the biggest embarrassments in the NBA. Y'all dysfunctional as fuck and you're gonna come after another (recently established, small market) team? Fuck you hiding behind?      Get off your high horse and face reality: You *really* have to place to be talking shit as an Lakers fan. Y'all managed to ruin Lebron-fucking-James. "

"It's also Kobe's huge stardom+LA ties, and that many of the MPAA members are likely Lakers fans. Were Tom Brady, Lebron James, Tiger Woods (w/out scandal) etc. to have retired before Kobe and made a very similar film, there's NO WAY it would win an Oscar."

is Lebron James a big fan of James Brown. because his name is The Brown James  translated to French so it would only make sense that Lebron is a fan of James Brown.

"I did. Have you followed literally anything about the Lakers in the last year?  ""They wouldn't do that, that's a stupidly high risk to take for a stupidly low chance of it paying off!""  Like  that's their entire strategy right now  How do you look at a team that got LeBron James then signed a bunch of non-shooters with poor chemistry and argue that they wouldn't do a thing because *that would obviously be a bad idea*?  How do you look at a team that had Zubac absolutely beasting and traded him for scraps and think, ""There's no way they'd fuck up a trade situation!"" That traded a second-year future all-star for a salary dump?  If you're looking at a situation and one of the explanations available is: ""the Lakers would do that, but only if they were fucking morons"" that is in fact *the most probable explanation*."

"Sure, but as we do with LeBron (2011) and any other player aiming for *Top X* status, we have to weigh their flaws when looking at their accomplishments. James Harden has come up short twice now in the post season through poor shooting performances. If he can win a ring or two, along with surpassing Wade in all those categories, I could put him Top 3 SG. "
"And also have us flexibility to add Lebron James and another FA this upcoming offseason. If no one is added with that cap space then it could be considered a bad trade, but everyone with any sense knows that trade wasn’t supposed to make the Lakers better immediately.   Lakers make a move for the future and get killed for it. It was the smart thing, especially because DLo needed that reality check of not being untouchable. "

'LET'S CONTINUE THIS ANOTHER TIME' HE SAID IN A SERIOUS TONE TO JJ. JJ, STILL WIPING CHAMPAGNE OFF HIS CHEST, GAVE A PLAYFUL AND UNDERSTANDING NOD.

THE FINGERS HAD A DELICATE YET FIRM TOUCH, THE KIND OF GRIP THAT COMES NATURALLY TO A MAN WHO SHOOTS 3 POINTERS FOR A LIVING. LEBRON SMIRKED AND LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER TO COYLY PEEK AT MIKE MILLER.

"&gt;Contract negotiations between the Cleveland Cavaliers and free agent LeBron James haven't begun, according to ESPN's Brian Windhorst. While everyone considers LeBron re-signing with the Cavs a mere formality, negotiations are on hold for now.  &gt;Windhorst reports that LeBron's agent, Rich Paul, has ""made it known"" that no talks will take place until free agent Tristan Thompson gets a new deal. Paul represents both Thompson and the four-time NBA MVP.  &gt;ESPN originally reported that Thompson and the Cavs had ""essentially come to terms"" on a five-year, $80 million contract on the first day of free agency. However, talks have reportedly broken down since then. Windhorst reports that the two sides are now no longer currently talking, and, until they do so, neither is LeBron.  &gt;""LeBron has made it clear, 'Look we're not going to talk until Tristan Thompson is done.' Here's the problem, Cavs talks with Tristan Thompson have stalled,"" Windhorst said. ""They're going to have to figure something out with Tristan Thompson before LeBron James. That's leverage. And Tristan Thompson, his agent Rich Paul, and LeBron James are playing that game right now.""  Cavs then sign Tristan to $82m/5y  &gt;""Negotiations are always two-sides but J.R. did his part,"" James said. ""He showed up every day. Worked his ass off every day. Became a two-way player, a model citizen in Cleveland and he's a fan favorite, obviously we all know that. All of the sudden now he's a season ticket holder at the Indians games.  &gt;""We just miss him. We miss having him around. He's a big piece of our team and they just need to get it done.""  &gt;Smith, the Cavs' starter at his position for both runs to the Finals the past two seasons, is represented by James' agent, Rich Paul. The Cavs' offer to Smith was somewhere between $10 million and $11 million annually, and Smith rejected it.  Cavs then sign JR to $57m/4y"
"Because Rich Paul, one of the most powerful people in history, deemed that LeBron James shall always be the GM for which ever team is blessed with his presence."

"Easiest reason is that because the minutes a player played throughout the season is easier to find than the number of possessions a player played all season.  If you were to instead do 28 pts/8 assts per 100 possessions, then there are instead only 189 such occurrences, but there is one more pair of teammates (LeBron James &amp; Kyrie Irving in 2016-17)."

"Lebron on-off: +6.9 for these Lakers. KD on-off last year: +1.4. Curry on-off this year: +4.3. James Harden this year: +2.8 net, +0.7 on-off.

LeBron James won 4x more MVP’s than Kobe Bryant 
"It's the opening scene. LeBron has 12 points, and the game is tied with 5 seconds remaining. He gets the inbounds pass, dribbles at the top of the arc, drives hard to the basket, and gets SWATTED by Nikola Jokic so hard that the ball goes all the way into the other basket and the Nuggets win by 3.   A James Bond type theme begins to play as the camera zooms out from Nikola Jokic's goofy face, and the title appears on the screen:  PASSING THE TORCH  THE NIKOLA JOKIC STORY"
"Thank you for posting such a long response!         As I said earlier, if it gets worse from here the fans will turn on lebron even more so, especially in the shadow of kobe's retirement tour where now lebron is getting paid more and has done nothing for the lakers. They were expected to at least make the playoffs this year and it's not looking like they'll be able to do it and you can make these excuses about how imperfect their season has been and it has but now since the all star break lebron's play has been extremely underwhelming in the middle of trying to make that playoff run. This is why he personally is being booed by fans!   We'll see what he can do tonight against the nuggets.     Lebron talking about how there's no rush? That's because he's 33, 34 now and not taking this seriously. That's why in his prime he was signing single year contracts to keep pressure on those franchises to surround him with talent and keep himself free to leaving. He went there to retire, clearly. Maybe to compete, in the event they sign superstar free agents. There have been all kinds of narratives about this but in the end the Lakers don't seem to have much of a plan when they attempted to trade all of their young talent which lebron was supposed to help develop for anthony davis. The lakers don't have all that much faith in their young players and are willing to shop for any potential superstars. They just didn't see it as a bad thing to sign lebron james. As I said earlier, we'll see if this was a truly a good thing for them. "
"Harden will likely surpass Wade in points, rebounds, assists, and steals in the next 5 years. Harden as a rocket has never missed the playoffs and has led 2 separate iterations of the rockets to the WCF. After winning a championship, wade either lost in the 1st round, or missed the playoffs in 3 of the next 4 seasons until LeBron came to Miami.   Wade won 2 championship by virtue of being on the same team as lebron. wade only played in 248 of a possible 328 regular season games in lebron's 4 years in miami. Meanwhile, the best player james harden has ever had as a rocket was post back surgery dwight and 33 year old chris paul. If not for the 2 extra championships lebron brought to miami, wade's legacy looks a lot more like Clyde Drexler than he does the #3 SG of all time. "

"Well the point is the superstars and stars outside of Harden were injured for large parts of the season. LeBron definitely has a better roster than Houston when it was trotting out the likes of Nunnelly. Austin Rivers was a huge pickup and starter for us. We played James Ennis and MCW, even Chriss.

"Headline: LeBron James passes the GOAT in points, not legacy"
Still going to the playoffs with ‘old ass Chris Paul’ can’t say the same about you with old ass Lebron James  
"Lebron jame enter basketball arena. He is killer, he is scorer, he is elderly. elobrn try to see young guys with killer too, but all his children teammates just like to touch basketball and not become winners. Lebron scores 1 point, 2 point, 3 point, he sees the ticker on the scoretron. He smiles but is sad inside. He scores point 13 and sees fan sign. A child is holding. Sign says, ""No longer lebron james; now lebron game. GOAT"" Fan is crying, mr. game is crying, MJ is crying. Lakers lose by 15 and lebron gets game ball signed by everyone that had ever scored in the nba, retires"
Michael Jordan is about to have less points than Lebron James on more shot attempts
Lebron James is not the best player in the world anymore 
Lebron James net rating is +1.5 this year for 100 possessions.  He is not even close to top 10 in impact. He just isn't. You just can't handle the facts. 
"Victor ""not LeBron James"" Oladipo"
"You're misreading the Lonzo and ""capable"" comment.  I put ""capable"" in quotation marks because that was the word you used to describe the team.  I didn't say Lonzo wasn't capable; rather, it was the opposite: I said that the Lakers team without LeBron and certainly without either LeBron or Lonzo are definitely NOT a capable team.     The disconnect is that you keep calling the Lakers a 4th place in the West and called it a ""monumental failure to not at least make the playoffs.""  But that ""4th place team"" was the 34-game stretch to start the season where the Lakers had LeBron (and Lonzo).  Then LeBron went out for 17 straight games (of which Lonzo played the first 13) and when LeBron returned to the team, the Lakers were in 9th place and out of the playoffs.  Regardless of anything else, what is an incontrovertible fact is that until LeBron got hurt, he helped the Lakers get to 4th in the West and when he then returned from his injury, the Lakers were already tied for 9th and therefore out of the playoffs at that point.  Whether other pieces were missing or not during that span does not matter because I'm not arguing that LeBron was the only reason for the success/failure.  What matters is that LeBron had zero ability to prevent that slide because he didn't play in any of those games while he was hurt.    So this ""monumental failure"" was largely in part due to the Lakers going from a 20-14 pace, to then going 6-12 in games LeBron couldn't help his team win.  He then returned to a team on the slide and to make matters worse, the team he re-joined was without their starter in Lonzo.  As far as the other thing, it's not about saving the Lakers.  Again, I never said anything close to that.  LeBron wanted to go to LA for a number of reasons that had nothing to do with basketball (business, lifestyle).  But it's also true that the Lakers had a lot of young pieces and cap flexibility that would enable them to make moves over a couple years that could restructure the roster to bring in other stars and build a contender.  That was undeniably part of the appeal of going there.  So one of the reasons that LeBron signed a four-year deal was because it signaled publicly that he was committed there-- that it wasn't just a one or two-year stint-- and that provided the Lakers with time to try and bring in other stars to construct a championship contender.  ""Much was made of the Lakers quest to acquire Kawhi Leonard from the Spurs or sign Paul George from the Thunder as a precursor to landing James. Johnson, already jilted by George, didn’t have either in hand. James explained that he was in no rush, even at 33, and did not have a problem being the first headliner through the door. He wants to build a contender that lasts and believes the Lakers possess the recruiters, the assets and the salary cap space to do it.""  (Lee Jenkins, SI, https://www.si.com/nba/2018/07/02/lebron-james-lakers-cavaliers-nba-free-agency-magic-johnson)  ""The Lakers have caught roughly everyone off guard with their after-LeBron moves. They did not sign another superstar free agent. Nor did they trade for Kawhi Leonard.  They re-signed Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. They added Rajon Rondo. And JaVale McGee. And Lance Stephenson. And then, most recently, they scooped up Michael Beasley for good measure.  These moves are, apparently, all part of a larger plan. Though they are directionless in the interim, a series of one-year deals preserves the Lakers' long-term flexibility. Stretching Luol Deng's contract gives them a clear path to more than $35 million in space ahead of 2019 free agency, by which time James will have been putting down roots and recruiting fellow megahumans for an entire year."" (Bleacher REport, https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2787007-how-lebron-to-la-will-impact-2019-nba-free-agency#slide1)  ""Back to LeBron: I have never quite bought all-in on the idea that he absolutely needs a superstar partner in the bag to go to the Lakers. It would probably help, but LeBron's decision Friday may be a tell that it was never essential. Leonard could also be on the move soon. We'll see.  Regardless, transactions don't stop in mid-July. A Lakers team with LeBron, enticing young players and cap flexibility would instantly become one of the league's most appealing trade and free-agency destinations over the next 12 months. A second star could come in August or anytime before next season's trade deadline. A third star could come next summer. Sources have denied reports that LeBron texted Kevin Durant about possibly joining him in L.A., but if Durant signs a one-year deal this summer (or a one-plus-one with player option in Year 2), you can bet your life savings that every desirable team will be circling him all season. Durant's motives remain a mystery to everyone in the league."" (Zach Lowe, http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23938913/zach-lowe-nba-free-agency-preview-lebron-james-paul-george-kawhi-leonard)   "
"&gt;in what world was lebron ever comparable to mj in his first 3 years? or are you actually trying to act like 21yo lebron was as good as mj?  Are you being serious or did you not watch LBJ? LBJ was 100% compared to MJ for every season he ever played and their accolades through every age/year played from the year he stepped in the league? I personally am a D-Wade fan, see the flair, but you're delusional if you think that didn't happen to LBJ. It's not being comparable it's about being compared. LBJ and MJ's first 3 years were constantly compared. The King vs Your Airness.  &gt;ok then according to your absolute braindead logic and while ignoring everything but achievements: collin sexton must be one of the worst players ever, he never won more than 16 games in a season and his teams best standing was 3rd worst in the nba. is this how you wanna compare players?  By one measurement sure. He has a terrible record. Then by another metric such as scoring, assisting and rebounding there is no way to say he is one of the worst players. A better example would be comparing Tatum versus let's say LeBron James first two years in the league or his accomplishments at 20 or Kobe. But you can keep trying to swing the argument in bullshit ways to paint a bullshit point I wasn't making.  Also, Sexton is one year in the league not 4. If at 4 years in the league, he's the same player, he deserves to be shit on and taken to the cleaners. Same as Wiggins."
"Always a fun discussion, i always enjoy listening to their reasoning and inputs. Above all i recommend listening since they go into the major awards and go over the several players considered and why they chose a specific one. (The MVP discussion, top 3 in that award, why they chose certain players over others in the All NBA teams and who was cut, DPOY, COTY, 6MOTY, ROTY... with the many considerations for those.)  But here's something to get going if you don't want listen to it:  1st Team All NBA:  * Stephen Curry * James Harden * Paul George (Danny) / Kevin Durant (Nate) [Danny's MVP Pick] * Giannis Antetokounmpo [Nate's MVP pick] * Joel Embiid  2nd:  * Damian Lillard * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Durant (Nate) / Paul George (Danny) * Kawhi Leonard * Nikola Jokic  3rd:  * Kemba Walker  * Jrue Holiday * Lebron James  * Blake Griffin * Anthony Davis"
"1. Healthy Lebron James   2. Rim protection/team defense  3. Jordan Clarkson?  Randle gets overrated in these discussions now because it's fun to imagine that the Lakers fucked up super hard. Dude is amazing in controlled, focused bursts, but can be a complete liability on defense and still gets tunnel vision sometimes. How is a frontcourt of Ingram and Randle supposed to stop big men?  D'lo is not a great defender either (unlike Lonzo) and Jordan Clarkson is ass"
What Wade has to do with the conversation I have no idea.  Spurs with Robinson were one of the top teams in the league. You're moving the goalposts on what makes a top team.  Shaq/Kobe won 3 rings in 5 years just like gasps Lebron James (Mia/Cle).  Umm Lebron went to 8 straight Finals with two different teams and won with each. That shows not only can Lebron consistently lead a team to the top he did twice with 3 different coaches. That's not a black mark that's a gold star for Lebron. 
"""I don't think a lot of people was educated,"" James said at Cavs Media Day. ""And I think that's one of the biggest problems when it becomes vote time is that people are just not educated on either the individual or what's going on ... I don't think a lot of people are educated, and they make choices and say things that's uneducated.""  -Lebron James.  MJ cheated on his wife."
Lebron James is such a hard player to build around.  Because of his weak shooting and weak defense you need to stack the team with elite shooters and defenders. 
Look at the Kings. They had a young core. Most would say the young core of Hield/Fox/Bogdan was worse then the Laker core at the beginning of the year. The Kings will win 15 more games then last year. 15.  This Laker team has alot of talent. Problem is it is very hard to fit lebron james on a team.  His lack of shooting and defense means you need to surround him with shooters and defenders. Good luck with that.  The other Super Stars in the league are either great shooters and even great defenders. Thus they are much easier to fit on a team. Look at KD. You are able to put some weak shooters around KD because he is such a great shooter. But with Lebron everyone needs to be good shooters around Lebron or the offense won't work.
Answer the question. You are avoiding the question. What has David Robinson and Popovich accomplish BEFORE DUNCAN. Absolutely nothing.   A player like Manu and Parker would never happen on a Lebron team. Manu/Parker would never get the opportunity to develop. Lebron would simply trade them away for a vet to win now. It is no wonder that not a single rookie has ever developed into a low level Star with Lebron James. And we have 15 years of proof. Not one.  Stop making excuses for Lebron.  You keep bringing up Cleveland. Why are you avoiding Miami?  Elite front office? Pat Riley. Check.  Elite coaching? Spostra. Check.  Elite player development?  See Wade. Check.  Free agent destination? Miami Beach. Check.  Owner willing to pay luxury tax. Yes. Check.  Lebron was giving all the tools to build a dynasty in Miami. But instead of powering through a rough patch he ran away to a better situation.  Not being part of a Dynasty is a BLACK MARK on lebron's career.
"David Robinson was an MVP and in 1995 the Spurs were in the Western Conference Finals. This was two years before Duncan was in the NBA. Who was the GM of this team? Greg Popovich.    Manu, Parker, and Kawhi&gt; Love and Irving.   Cleveland didn't draft Bosh or Wade. Lebron had to leave to play with those two.  Cleveland never had an elite coach because they hire terrible people: Mike Brown, David Blatt, Ty Lue, and Byron Scott. Not exactly the tippy top of the coaching tree there.  San Antonio don't bring in top free agents either all of their top talent is through the draft. Something the Cleveland Cavaliers are terrible at. In the past 25 years the only all stars Cleveland has drafted: Lebron James, Kyrie, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas. That is horrible.   The reason Lebron is in win now mode is because he's the best player in the world and shouldn't have to wait 5-7 for a player to hopefully develop (Spoiler alert: If this is in Cleveland the player would be terrible).  That same management you are telling Lebron to be patient for drafted Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins in back to back drafts.   Jordan, Bird, Magic, etc didn't figure out how to build a  dynasty because they never drafted anyone. Magic was drafted to team that had KAJ, Bird had great players drafted alongside him, and Jordan didn't win a thing until Scottie and Phil Jackson got to Chicago.   You know nothing of what you speak.  "
"The Lakers have huge problems with the roster, though.  It's just baffling to me that a 34 year old is averaging 27, 8.7, and 8, is fighting through a serious injury, and he's being crucified for not playing hard enough.  The Lakers would be the worst if not bottom 3 in the league this year without LeBron.  Their youth is not developing well at all, and while certainly some of that can be attributed to James, it's his *first year* on the team."
"This Tim Duncan dynasty you bring up omitted Greg Popovich, David Robinson (both were there before Duncan), Manu, Tony Parker, and eventually Kawhi.  San Antonio gave Duncan better coaching and teammates than Lebron ever had in Cleveland. Also Lebron was in Cleveland for 7 years his first run that is more than enough time to build something.   Kevin Love put up big numbers for a losing team in Minnesota. Lebron won K Love a ring. Miami didn't take off until Wade and Bosh took a backseat to Lebron.   Again you're trying to discredit Lebron for poor management and Cleveland not being top free agent destination. The biggest free agent Cleveland ever signed was Lebron James. "
Eric snow and James Jones don’t get the respect they deserve for carrying lebron smh my head 
I want Kawhi to stay in Toronto but in the off chance he goes to the Clippers and KD joins the Kings this is what the Pacific division would look like:  * Golden State Warriors led by Steph Curry and Klay Thompson  * Sacramento Kings led by Kevin Durant   * Los Angeles Lakers led by LeBron James  * Los Angles Clippers led by Kawhi Leonard  * Phoenix Suns led by Zion Williamson  You would have 4 perennial MVP candidates in the same division on different teams + the 2020 ROY. If AD joins up with the Lakers that makes it even more stacked. The division battles would be intense.
"Lebron James​ was barely trying against the Suns. That included​ a few​​ choice words for Devin Booker, who was yapping at both LeBron and Brandon Ingram...Booker berated them both. “Get to the draft lottery before you speak to me,” Booker barked."
Lebron James
"Every nba player is able to break down an opposing teams defense like this. I understand there’s some sort of amazement with this, but this isn’t only a Kevin Durant or lebron James thing"
I think they should try to trade him for someone better like lebron james or damian lilliard
Not gotten there because he didn’t play with LeBron fucking James
"Lebron James Game 6 ECF 2012, Miami vs Boston. Imo he's best game ever, from what I remember nobody else on the Heat had it going that game and he completely destroyed us."
I was told Kyrie was going to be bad without LeBron James
"&gt; Harden should be  Nah, he COULD be, but it's not SHOULD.   Westbrook won the MVP in 2017 because he did something no one expected - beating Oscar's arguably greatest record. And that happened after the Thunder lost their best player. In terms of most *valuable* player, that's a pretty valuable asset to have. You can definitely make a case for Harden in 2017, but it's not like it's a definitive should.  (And when people ask - ok why didn't Westbrook win it in 2018 or 2019 by doing the same thing - it's really simple, triple double production wasn't as perceived to be valuable.)   And as far as 2019, it's the same thing. Scoring, especially the way Harden scores, is super valuable - but is it the definitive most valuable thing? Not necessarily, and people seem to value Giannis's two-way play and post dominance more than unassisted scoring.   I definitely agree that if a person goes out and just votes for Giannis because he's not Harden, that's nonsense. But I don't think it's a SHOULD be situation by any means.  ----   It's also worth noting that OP is being slightly disingenuous by ignoring 2018.  James Harden: 30.4 + 5.4 + 8.8 + 1.8 + 0.7 = **47.1** - 4.4 = **42.7**  Lebron James: 27.5 + 8.6 + 9.1 + 1.4 + 0.9 = **47.5** - 4.2 = **43.3**  Lebron beat James Harden in 2018 in OP's own metric (but by less significance) but OP doesn't mention this. Hence slightly disingenuous. So did Lebron get cheated out of the MVP award then? Or should we look at things more holistically than just adding up stats?"
Coach is about to Lebron James a whiteborad after the game.  WoW clinic on how not to play basketball poor Coach.
Lmao the people LeBron James hire me
Lol no. The best decision for your franchise even long term is to keep LeBron James as part of it.
"Imagine adding LeBron James and your young core is so stank that not only does he try and trade all of them for one dude, but that your team only improves by a few wins."
For sure! I have basically always rooted against Lebron James. That doesn’t mean I don’t recognize what a tremendous player and athlete he is and respect what a good man and role model he is. Lebron is the man. Even when I’m rooting against him I still want him there playing
"Its me guys, who wants a LeBron James for a couple of second rounders?"
Overachieved is debatable. Were the Celtics not better than the Cavs at literally everything except the contest of who has Lebron James? I mean the Sixers and Bucks were dysfunctional too with their own issues. You could say the Sixers are better on paper I guess.
Michael Jordan  LeBron James  Kareem Abdul Jabbar   David Robinson  Larry Bird  Wilt Chamberlain   Shaq  Jerry West  Elgin Baylor  Kobe Bryant
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Who is LeBron James?  Most of the population of the world asking...
Clippers have a great thing going on but do you think kawhi would rather play with Lou Williams than Lebron James come on
"LeBron James, Influential. !!!"
"I do believe there is some truth in that, but I think it's exaggerated. Is/was there some locker room problems with the 76ers? I do think so, but like any locker room in certain periods. But my question why ""Spurs culture"" problems now? Embiid is with the team for a long time, and Simmons, if you exclude his first injured year, is in his 2nd year with the team, so the Spurs comparisons shouldn't be anything new.  The ""stomach virus"" I do believe there is truth in that. I do believe he skipped the game because he was hungover, but I don't think because he wanted to send a message to the 76ers, and the reporter just wants to tie everything together.  Simmons being tradable, I do think it's the truth, but in the sense ""Hey, if someone like LeBron became available and they asked for Simmons, do I have your permission to do the trade"". That's quite reasonable. I don't think Elton was looking to trade him, but like any smart GM ""I listen to your any offer"", and GM's know which players are available and which are not.  Simmons being uncoachable and only a regular-season player that I'm calling total bullshit. Come on, he's in his second season and you can't really that in only 1 playoff series before this year. Hell, if he was uncoachable he would be taking 3 like he's James Harden. Uncoachable players don't play to their strengths.  Overall, I do believe there's a lot of truth in this reporting, but the truth is very bent to suit the story and dramatized to fit the narration."
"LeBron isn't gonna be All NBA because he missed nearly 30 games, and as such that only applies to this season. James Harden missed it one year because the media hated his lackadaisical attitude. Again, these are one time things for these players. What's Pierce's excuse? LeBron and Harden have many All NBA 1st Team selections between them, Pierce had **zero**. Hell, Pierce only made 2nd Team All NBA just one time and only finished top 10 in MVP voting once (at 7th).   Trust me, as someone who's older than Pierce and watched his whole career, he's not this all time great you seem to think he was. He was a good player, sure, and had a handful of great years, but there is no way in hell he was a top 15 player for 10 straight years. Top 25, yes, but not top 15. You're crazy if you think a top 15 player got shut out of All NBA teams more times than he made them. Pierce just made a lot of All Star games because the East was godawful for most of his career and *someone* had to make those teams (just like most of the East's All Star guards this year), and it's those All Star selections that trick people nowadays into thinking Pierce was better than he actually was."
Bro lebron is making a god damn movie obviously people are gonna talk about it he’s fucking lebron james
"Ok question the year that Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Klay Thompson, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, and Russell Westbrook made all NBA over James Harden does that make James Harden not a top 15 player in the league?  Ill answer that for you actually. The answer is no it doesn’t stupid. Just because someone does not get an all NBA selection does not make them automatically not a top 15 player. You’d have to do some real mental gymnastics to tell me that LeBron James, who most likely will not make an All NBA team due to missed games and stuff, is not a top 15 player in the NBA anymore? Paul Pierce definitely was a top 15 player over the course of a decade"
and just like that all the investors tried investing in LeBron James stock.
No one has ever blown a 3 dragons to one Night King lead... Until Now. LeBron James steps onto the court in this season of *Game of Thrones*
He did actually injure it. You can see the swelling [in these photos](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/06/11/lebron-james-hand-injury-photographic-investigation). They did like a little investigation on it. You can argue the extent on it but Amick reported it as a bone bruise.
"I understand what you're saying and it makes sense. BUT Harden and KD played in the same era and never has Harden been considered a better basketball player than KD. Actually only one guy has and that is LeBron fucking James. That being said, yes if Harden Won against the warriors he would indeed be the best player in the world. YET 1 year of being better than KD should never eliminate the other 12 years KD's been better and greater. Nonetheless i believe anything is possible if very specific situations happen. So yeah it can be an argument but as of right know ? It isn't even with Harden winning over him."
u serious? that team overacheived and he posterized LeBron fuckin James.
"The only thing Lebron James has that I don't is *checks notes* 3 NBA rings, 4 MVPs, 3 Finals MVPs, 15 All-Star selections, 12 All-NBA 1st Teams, and 5 All-Defensive First Teams"
"Ah yes, LeBron. Who named himself King James, and called himself the GOAT, while being carried off for fake injuries. What a face"
You know who has a longer more successful history with Klutch Sports? LeBron James lmao
Is adding LeBron James to a 53 win team make them championship caliber?   Think about how dumb this question is
"Mike Trout has expressed no interest in a LeBron James type role with his sport, which quite frankly is absolutely incredible considering he’s apparently on pace to be the literal best player in baseball history. You would think that MLB would want Trout everywhere."
"Show me proof that Wade/Bosh knew Lebron was coming.    http://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/17853/lebron-james-decision-the-transcript  Stop making lies.  Lebron said this:  ""I think I decided this morning. I mean, I decided this morning I went day to day....But this morning I woke up, had a great conversation with my mom. Once I had that conversation with her, I think I was set.""  This morning was the day AFTER Bosh/Wade signed.  Every thing you said is just a guess. Lebron himself said he decided AFTER Wade/Bosh signed in Miami."

"When you have Lebron James you are mortgaging your future. Joe Harris wasn’t going to produce for the Cavs, and it didn’t make sense for them to give him a roster spot.   The fact is when you are competing for a championship, a lot of the time you need to mortgage your future to do it, but taking on Vets, trading away assets, and making your team as good as possible for a ring."
"Yes, after all this is why everybody talks about how Robert Horry is better than LeBron James.  FOH."
"8 sounds about right, next two games are absolute must wins.  Possibly the next three.  Any loss in the next 3 means winning game 7 in Portland to close the series.  Think teams with Lebron James are the only teams to win game 7 on the road after being down 2-0 in the past 20-30 years."

I thought we were talking about boxing.  LeBron James is producing a boxing documentary.
The same game he did it to Ingram he later did it to Lebron Fucking James......fuck LMA
"As LeBron James walked to the exit from his Al LA Carte Taco Bar, he proudly mumbled ""I passed Jordan"" to himself out loud."
That would be because of LeBron James.

"Ehhh LeBron didn't join one of the best regular season teams ever. The Heat that year were essentially a new team built around 3 free agents (which includes Wade).  The constants from the 09 and 2010 heat were Wade, Haslem, James Jones (14 mpg in 09), Jamaal magloire (13 mpg in 09), Joel Anthony (16.5 mpg in 09), and Mario Chalmers."
Ray was [better](https://www.libertyballers.com/2012/2/29/2832299/lebron-james-kobe-bryant-dwyane-wade-clutch-nba-playoffs-4th-quarter) but they were both very good.
Uh.... so here's an example....2016 here are the teams so you tell me if it matters:  West: - Anthony Davis - James Harden - Steph Curry - Kevin Durant - Kawhi Leonard - Marc Gasol - Russell Westbrook - Klay Thompson - Gordon Hayward - Draymond Green - DeAndre Jordan - DeMarcus Cousins  East: - DeMar DeRozan - Giannis Aafdsfasfasdfaf - Kyrie Irving - LeBron - Jimmy Butler - Paul George - John Wall - Kemba Walker - Carmelo Anthony - Isaiah Thomas - Kyle Lowry - Paul Millsap  See anything vastly different about these teams?????
"WS/48 is an almost perfect predictor of MVP. The leader in this stat usually wins MVP. Not surprisingly when they deviate from the player leading this, these are the most controversial.  For this decade for example:  * 2010 - MVP Lebron James WS/48 - Lebron James * 2011 - MVP Derrick Rose WS/48 - Lebron James * 2012 - Lebron James / Lebron James * 2013 -  Lebron James / Lebron James * 2014 - Kevin Durant / Kevin Durant * 2015 - Stephen Curry / Stephen Curry * 2016 - Stephen Curry / Stephen Curry * 2017 - Russell Westbrook / Kevin Durant * 2018 - James Harden / James Harden  * 2019 - ???? / Giannis Antekoumpo  James Harden and company do too much whining. He’s a 1x MVP caliber player and they gave it to him the year he earned it.  In 2017, Durant was the best player. It was his first year with the Warriors and he played elite defense in addition to elite offense. Kawhi Leonard was 2nd, and since there was no way they were giving Durant the mvp that year, he would be more deserving than Harden.   Golden State won 67 games that year and Sam Antonio won 61.   This year he didn’t even finish 2nd, Gobert finished 2nd behind his beastly 68 TS%.  Harden is nice and has been Top 5 for most of the last 5 years outside of that one down year, but their constant whining about not getting MVP’s they don’t deserve is getting old. Want to win the MVP? Have an MVP season with excellent stats and team success."

Does Lebron James regret signing long term with the Lakers?
"LeBron James is one of the most graceful players to ever play the game. 6'8 250+ and runs the game like a guard, faster than nearly any player not named Westbrook, Wall or Ish Smith. Last two seasons 8+ assists a game. How the hell is that not skilled?   He had a down year and still managed to put up similar numbers to Kawhi in one fewer game."

"This was the era of the volume scorer and two point shot. What are you even talking about? Dude were winning MVP and being considered the best player in the league shooting 45% from the field and below average from 3.   Also he shot 37% from 3, while LeBron was at 34% and jacking them way more frequently. But yeah go ahead and tell us more.   Lastly, let's not act like Hughes was not a top free agent that teams were in a bidding war over. LeBron personally did all he could to recruit him..  &gt;James expressed excitement about the arrival of a young yet experienced sidekick. ""His numbers are huge,"" James said, ""but what makes him special is that he's a creator and he's willing to do anything, at anyplace, on the court."" Nothing less will satisfy Cleveland fans. To them, Hughes will justify his salary only if he helps propel the Cavaliers deep into the playoffs. ""I was looking to be really wanted and looking for a place to call home,"" says Hughes. ""Now let's play."""
"That's all relative. 1m to you and I would be getting paid. Not to someone that wants a max contract. LeBron James signs for 20m a year, that's not getting paid. How is this a hard concept to understand."

"James Harden's production lowers in the post-season. If you want to talk statistics, compared to what he accomplishes in the regular season it's slightly worse. I'm not talking about shooting splits either, because I understand teams tighten defensively in the postseason.  I never said James Harden wasn't great, I said he's a regular season player. I'm not equating his teams success to how good of an individual player he is, but I'm looking at his production during the postseason. These are games that truly matter. His production drops.  Although LeBron was swept, he still produced at a higher level from the regular season.   James Harden has great regular seasons and  never steps it up. He literally has a worse production in the postseason than his regular season and shoots the ball terribly from three.   Didn't he score 8 points against a Kawhiless spurs in a crucial win or go home game?"
"He was fringe top 10 before the season started (8-11 range imo), but is now clearly out of the top 12. Players I have clearly above him (roughly in order of who I would take right now):  &amp;#x200B;  1. James Harden 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Kevin Durant 4. Stephen Curry 5. LeBron James 6. Joel Embiid 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Anthony Davis 9. Damian Lillard 10. Nikola Jokic 11. Kyrie Irving 12. Paul George  &amp;#x200B;  I think there are a few other players that I'd take over Russ next year too like Bradley Beal or Luka Doncic and maybe even Trae Young if his improvement in the second half of the season is permanent."
1. Steph Curry (but Dame is gunning for this spot) 2. James Harden 3. LeBron James (but if he doesn't have a bounceback year next year he will lose this spot) 4. Giannis 5. Joel Embiid  &amp;#x200B;  Harden and Embiid are the most clearly ahead of their competition for their positions in my opinion. I think most agree Embiid and Jokic are the 2 best centers and I would assume most agree that Embiid is a significantly more dominant presence. Harden is just so far above all other SGs that it shouldn't even be a conversation. The gulf their is insanely vast.

"&gt; A report in the New York Post says Wade is being courted by both ESPN and TNT for a role in their NBA programming, starting this postseason.  ESPN has gone through a variety of studio offerings with NBA Countdown in a bid to conjure chemistry closer to the successful formula of TNT's Inside the NBA. Among analysts ESPN has cycled through is Pierce, who recently opined on having had a more successful career than Wade.  Wade previously has appeared on ESPN's NBA playoff coverage, including a one-on-one interview with former Heat teammate LeBron James during the Cleveland Cavaliers appearance in the 2015 NBA Finals.  James praised Wade's effort in that interview.  ""Well, first of all, it's great to always see him and be alongside him,"" he said. ""No matter if it's in a uniform or he's in a suit and I'm in street clothes. I thought he was great. Obviously our chemistry is great.""  Such an ESPN transition could prove convenient for Wade, who plans to relocate to the Los Angeles area to be closer to the acting career of wife Gabrielle Union. ESPN's studio programming originates directly across from Staples Center.  Although TNT's Atlanta-based studio show is locked into the award-winning cast of Barkley, Kenny Smith, Shaquille O'Neal and host Ernie Johnson, the network has created niche roles for additional contributors in recent years, including Kevin Garnett. Turner Sports also has created a franchise featuring ""Players Only"" coverage solely utilizing former NBA players, with former Heat forward and Wade NBA championship teammate Chris Bosh among those cast in such a role.  ESPN has recently utilized former Heat coach Stan Van Gundy as a studio analyst, with Van Gundy out of the league this season following his dismissal as coach and executive with the Detroit Pistons. Van Gundy coached Wade as a rookie in 2003-04 with the Heat."
I just hate this sub sometimes for forgetting and not appreciating Lebron Fucking James. Get your shit together man.
"Derozan barely has any help. He is in a starting lineup that features Bryn Forbes, Derrick White, and Jakob Poeltl. Their point guard went down with a season-ending injury in the preseason. This one should have been expected.  &amp;#x200B;  LeBron was hurt for 18 games and as much as I hate to admit it, would have made the playoffs if healthy.  &amp;#x200B;  PG is just simply playing in a much harder conference and is playing on a team with hardly any good role/bench players.  &amp;#x200B;  Jimmy made the playoffs and had to play MVP James Harden and the Rockets 1st round.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  All of these are very understandable. And it's common knowledge that the best players are in the West, so these results really aren't that surprising."
"/r/nba right now is also trumpeting Lillard's performance, so definitely not racial.  There is no player /r/nba loves more than LeBron James.  So maybe we just like good basketball, which Westbrook wasn't playing. The media thing certainly doesn't help"
So that'd make Sundiata Gaines better than Lebron James?
Bro stop talking out of your ass you don’t watch basketball if you really believe LeBron isn’t clutch lmao  Here maybe you are one of those people who like stats rather then the eye test:  *Game-tying/go-ahead field goals with under 10 seconds left in the postseason:  Michael Jordan: 7/15 (47%) Kobe Bryant: 5/22 (23%) LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)*
"What the fuck are you all smoking. First off, Kyrie played with LeBron James and played a million playoff games with LeBron James. They're both clutch as fuck. Neither more than the other as far as I can tell, with the exception of Lillard's shots being significantly more ridiculous, particularly given this performance tonight (which is his 2nd series clinching, walk-off buzzer-beater three in the playoffs). Just give it time bros."
"&gt; The 3-pointer from way deep is the trademark of Steph Curry, and yet it’s James whose precision from several steps behind the arc is on pace to break records. Through Monday, James has made 52.3 percent (23 for 44) of his shots from 28 feet or farther from the hoop,  1 according to Basketball-Reference.com. That’s not only the best this season among players who have taken at least 15 of those shots, but it’s also the best anyone has shot from that deep since the 2000-01 season, the furthest back play-by-play data is available on Basketball-Reference.com   [Source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-james-is-the-new-steph-curry/amp/) From April of last year. For reference, Curry took 49 of those deep 3’s last year and shot it at a 33% clip"
"from beefing with a world leader, to beefing with lebron james, to getting cut from every org he's been on, to finally winning in the playoffs  this dude is getting the last laugh on everyone. a king"
"Call me crazy on this one but I think PG should have signed with the Lakers to play with LeBron freaking James, lol."
You have Lebron freaking James and you couldn’t make it into the first round. Talking shit won’t make you relevant again
&gt;Lebron James - top 10 player    lmao
"Lakers with Paul George would have survived Brons injury and made it to the playoffs.  Paul George next to Lebron fuckin James in the playoffs would have been better then whatever the fuck Russ is doing in the playoffs.   And if the season was still a big disaster, they’d atleast have tradeable pieces not a roster full of shit contracts."
"Sure, when they were 19 and 20. Not 34 year old 3 time champion LeBron James"
&gt; They got LeBron James  ... for 54 games
"Harden, Giannis and this man named Lebron james"
They got LeBron James and went from 33 wins to 38 wins. That dumpster fire wasn't getting saved by adding one wing. The team legit only has ~20 minutes worth of a center on the roster.
"Dame iced us, but continue to tell us Westbrook can't win when you literally ruined the legacy of Lebron james. Hope we continue to live in your head rent free"
And Lebron James had just won his second MVP averaging 29ppg in a season where he led the cavs to a conference beat 61-21 record. The dudes longevity is legendary on its own.
"I think Lue will be remembered as a great coach when all is said and done. Of course it doesn't look that way now, because the media and the memester fans won't let anyone coach Lebron James and get away with it. But Lue is second only to Spo in Lebron's career"
Here’s a simple analogy:  Klay Thompson = Chocolate Milk  Shaquille O’Neal = Shaq Soda  Giannis Antetokounmpo = Smoothie  LeBron James = Sprite LeBron mix
You beat lebron  James with JJ barea.?? YOU'RE HIRED!...but seriously why didn't lebron just post jj up??
"Absolutely, it was at 109ppg as an average for the 80s whereas for every Westbrook triple double season (which is the past three seasons), the average is still at a very high 107.7ppg.   &amp;nbsp;  I also didn't fail to mention LeBron James and Grant Hill (hell even 91 Jordan could be included), players who showed their triple double forte in much slower paced eras compared to the other guys when they got theirs.   &amp;nbsp;  Grant Hill is easily the lowest caliber player out of all those other past legends and he was EASILY getting triple doubles in the slowest paced eras out of everyone there. I wouldn't put it past any of those guys to average it for a season if they valued that statline so much, especially LeBron James"
"News Report: Jason kidd, Laker head coach, got in a scuffle with general manager and team president LeBron James."
"Roughly, yeah. Their stats the last four years have been pretty comparable. Kyrie is more efficient, but when you factor in that he’s playing with LeBron and a very good cavs team/Stevens and a really deep Boston team instead of the sack of rocks Kemba plays with, that’s to be expected. When you’re the sole creator of offense on your team, unless you’re James harden, you will not be able to play as efficiently as a player with scoring support, especially when you’ve got worse coaching too.   “But otter, watch the games!!!” I have. Kyrie is flashier but flashier doesn’t make you better, it just gives you more highlights. Kemba’s got extremely effective handles that get him open comparably to Kyrie’s.  They’re smaller point guards who get buckets with handles and strong 3 point shooting, set up teammates pretty well (though they’re a tier or two below the elite playmakers), and haven’t given you defense worth calling mom about most of their careers. They’re similar players with similar output and similar tape."
Javale was a good signing? The idea behind rondo wasn’t bad. Rondo just played terribly. Doesn’t negate landing Lebron James
Lets Just Value the greatness of LeBron James he earned it.
"He eventually became either coachable (or just finally agreed with what everyone else was saying), but you cannot deny that him being uncoachable early in his career was what allowed 2011 to happen. Perhaps it's too early for most people to remember, but prior to that Mavs series, Lebron had always maintained that he didn't need to learn a post game, that his skills in other areas transcended needing a post game etc.  Then we see fucking 6'1"" JJ Barea guarding him and James has zero post game to exploit that. He ends up just chucking jumpers over the guy using his height advantage, but he isn't a good enough shooter for that to work well enough. Props to him for finally accepting he was wrong afterwards and turning into a post monster (his heroics in 2015 and then winning in 2016 were completely based off of his post play), but there's almost no denying that a Lebron who was more coachable has at least 1 more ring."
"Lue has proven himself in the NBA?  Dude, he had Kyrie Irving and LeBron fucking James in one of the weakest Eastern Conferences ever (2016 and 2017).   He doesn't have an offensive or a defensive scheme.  He has no style.  That's why everyone's praising LeBron for 2016, because he and Ky LITERALLY for themselves stopped the Dubs.It's one of the greatest performances ever.  IMO Lue had little to nothing to do with it.  Kokoskov is an excellent coach, the Suns are just the Suns."
"Yeah, my buddies close to Lebron James told me the same thing."
Only for James Jones to bail LeBron out again
"Meme answer: Kyrie Irving  Real answers: LeBron James, Reggie Bullock, Jeremy Lin, Gregg Popovich, Steve Kerr"
"Jason Kidd interviewed for the Los Angeles Lakers' head coaching vacancy Monday, multiple sources told ESPN.  Kidd becomes the third candidate to meet with the Lakers, following Philadelphia 76ers assistant coach Monty Williams and former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue, who both interviewed last week. Miami Heat assistant coach Juwan Howard is also scheduled to interview for the job, sources told ESPN, and Williams and Lue are also both expected to have follow-up sessions.   Kidd's interview was with general manager Rob Pelinka, as well as team executive Kurt Rambis and was conducted at the team's practice facility in El Segundo, California. The interview with the Hall of Fame point guard lasted for several hours, sources told ESPN.  The 46-year-old Kidd formerly coached the Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks. He was fired by Milwaukee during the 2017-18 season. In 4 1/2 seasons with Kidd roaming the sidelines, his teams compiled 183-190 record (.491).  Kidd has previous ties to LeBron James, having been an Olympic teammate of his in 2008, winning the gold together in Beijing. Kidd's Dallas Mavericks also defeated James and the Heat in the 2011 NBA Finals."
"Yes he had a good team but he utilized them well. People usually complain talking about all Lue did was let LeBron/Kyrie go to work and run shooters off screens. That’s exactly how you’re supposed to utilize a team like that.  Let’s not forget that he took a team without Kyrie to the ECF too. That roster was literally LeBron and scrubs.   Cranjis does scheme grades. He analyzed schemes for D1 teams and now he does it for the NBA. Ty Lue was 90th percentile in offensive optimization every year he coached. Lue understood every players’ role in the offense. You say they didn’t have a system but I disagree. The system was moving the ball around to exploit mismatches and create chances for other. It was a very Houston Rockets like offense. Y’all literally had some of the best offenses of all time. Yet you guys act like Lue was holding back the offense for whatever reason.  Lue also wasn’t shy to call out LeBron when he was underperforming, contrary to the idea that he’s Lebron’s puppet.  https://fadeawayworld.net/2019/03/27/ty-lue-reportedly-called-out-lebron-james-in-game-7-of-the-2016-nba-finals/  And  he wasn’t shy about calling out the supporting cast when they were off.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2771358-tyronn-lue-calls-out-lebron-james-supporting-cast-after-cavaliers-win-game-2.amp.html  He hold players accountable, and that’s a good trait to have in a coach. He knows how to run an elite level offense with LeBron. Luke bought into the “hustle and play defense which leads to offense” idea. That’s not the type of team you go with LeBron as your main player. Lue had the right idea. Lue also has the most playoff experience out of anyone in the market.   I’m not saying he’s an amazing coach or anything. He definitely is at least solid though. And he’s by far the safest choice on the market."

"That doesn’t mean that you should stay away from other ball dominant players. Every elite guys is at his best on ball except for maybe Klay (if you even consider him elite). Giannis, Lebron, Steph, KD, Davis, Kyrie, Harden, etc are all at their best when the offense runs through them. But there are enough possessions in a game to have two of those guys and thrive. The warriors obviously do it, the Cavs did it, the Rockets do it, the Bucks do it, etc. And besides being off ball doesn’t mean just standing at the 3 pt line unless your scheme is terrible or you have James Harden, it should mean moving through screens and similar things to get open shots or layups. Pairing Doncic and Booker could have been a great combo."
"Lakers also have LeBron James, who when not injured, is the most inpactful player in the world."
"i bet you if lebron was on the raptors casey would have swept lue, my point is lebron fucking james was on that team.  But yes casey sucks and actually angry from a comment above that talked about timeouts"
People really forget who LeBron fucking James is
"&gt;but boston doesnt have lebron james!!  no shit. no one on boston is even close to that good. Besides, Bucks will have the best player in the series, toronto did not"
"what were the records in the Toronto/Cleveland series last year?   Of course, you'll come back with ""but boston doesnt have lebron james!!"""
"[“They just said, ‘We’re not feeling it,’ or something like that,” Riley told Thomsen. “We talked about the typical things that we have to do, have patience and all of that stuff. “They wanted to know what was going to happen with Erik,” Riley said. “They wondered if I was going to be coaching.

LeBron James
"Just to prove your point wrong, please go watch some 2008-2011 era games and see how LeBron and Wade were depicted. Even the announcers (especially for opposing teams) would tear into the amount of bitching they would do about the refs calls. I'd argue that this was even more prevalent than the modern day flopping of James Harden, Marcus Smart, ect, because of the importance of the paint and the 2pt game back then.  You must have forgotten LeFlop and Baby Wade.   However, time has passed and they have let those media personas die down through winning championships and straight continuity of excellent basketball."
"I dunno man, Lebron James couldn’t even hold a basketball when he was first born and some people consider him the GOAT now. That’s a pretty big improvement"
"They're not greatly more talented, though. That's what I mean, you have a Western conference where LeBron James and a promising core of lottery picks couldn't even make the playoffs.  It may have been a rookie-led team last year, but that team also had a DPOY center and a solid supporting cast with an excellent coach that abused the Thunder every time they put Melo on the floor. This year they're going up against a stacked backcourt of Dame + McCollum, a great coach, and with a chip on their shoulder after getting swept.  Maybe they've underperformed compared to expectations, but perhaps in such a competitive conference it's the expectations that are wrong. Look at how competitive even the 2/7 matchup is this year. Unless you're Golden State, it's an achievement to get out of the first round this year. Losing a tough series hurts, but I don't think it's pathetic. OKC have just had some really tough competition."
"Hmm more money, more prestige, Lebron James or less money, young flawed team, and getting fired after a year?"
No it was not. See “LeBron fade-away game”. It was too easy for him. Not doubling or shadow-helping LeBron James is stupid. Even the Warriors with Draymond and Iggy do this.
"&gt; Do you remember how Lebron played in his first Finals?  In Lebron's first finals, he averaged 22/7/7 with a steal but with 6 turnovers. He was 2nd in points, 4th in rebounds, and 1st in assists among *all* players of that series. It's funny that you're only bringing up shooting splits. You're also being (probably intentionally) obtuse to the fact that you're comparing a team that you're calling ""a dynasty"" level team to the 2007 Cavs. And finally, the person who you're responding to - their original point was that Harden did not lead or bring a fire when he had a leadership role off the bench- not that he didn't have an all-star performance. Lebron definitely did that in 2007.   Look kid, you're the one trying to argue that the OKC Big 3 were a clear dynasty. Randomly saying ""uhhhh but look at Lebron in the finals"" and trying to compare a 22 year old James Harden to a 22 year old Lebron James and their perceived capabilities at the time is extremely foolish."
"No matter what metric you use, Danio Gallinari is not better than Lebron James."
I would hate for my team to have LeBron James and still not make the playoffs. Sorry you have to deal with that
Dragan bender is not better than Lebron James

"&gt; Skeptics wondered what Kings general manager Vlade Divac was thinking when he fired coach Dave Joerger on Thursday after he led the team to its best season in more than a decade.  &gt; Divac clearly had a plan. If, and when, his top candidate, Luke Walton, became available Divac would act quickly to make Walton his new head coach. Divac did just that, finding his new coach two days after dismissing Joerger.  &gt; Walton parted ways with the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday and reached a deal with the Kings Saturday afternoon, The Athletic’s Sam Amick first reported. The deal runs through the 2022-23 season, which coincides with the extension Divac signed Thursday.  &gt; Divac was a fan of Walton’s three years ago, when the Kings hired Joerger. But at that time, Walton didn’t even interview with the Kings. He was a hot candidate, and the Lakers, the team that drafted him in the second round of the 2003 NBA Draft, were ready to hire him.  &gt; At the time, the Kings were better known for dysfunction and instability.  &gt; The Kings’ job is much more appealing now, and Walton wasted little time in agreeing to a deal with a roster largely seen as one that should emerge as a playoff contender soon. It will be up to Walton to take the Kings to the next level Divac sees for the team. The Kings won 39 games in the 2018-19 season, a 12-game improvement from the previous season, and exceeding the expectations of most around the NBA.  &gt; Divac, however, believes the Kings could have been better and should be better next season. The Kings stumbled late and blew big leads to limp to the finish line. Divac fired Joerger in the hopes of finding someone who would effectively communicate with players and management, maintain the Kings’ style of play and aid player development with defined roles and a belief in the young talent. So Divac turned to a former teammate in Walton, 39, to fill those needs. They played together for the Lakers in Divac’s last NBA season in 2004-05.  &gt; Walton was 98-148 in three seasons with the Lakers, the same record Joerger had in his three seasons with the Kings. The Lakers were 37-45 in Walton’s final season.  &gt; So why Walton over Joerger? Why might the Kings see this as a better fit than the coach who led them to their most wins in 13 years? Here are some things to consider:  &gt; Walton will still play fast The Lakers finished fourth in pace last season (103.63), right behind the Kings who were third at 103.89. De’Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield both saw their statistics improve once the Kings picked up their pace, so a coach who wouldn’t play that style would not work.  &gt; The Lakers were one of the worst 3-point shooting teams in the league (29th, 33.3 percent). The Kings were fourth, connecting on 37.8 percent from beyond the arc, even though the team was 20th in 3-pointers attempted (29.9 per game). Better shooters on the roster along with a belief in a fast pace meshes well with how Divac wants the Kings to play.  &gt; Walton’s connection to that style of play can also be tied to his time as an assistant coach with Golden State (2014-16), where the Warriors played fast but also figured out how to become a good defensive team. The Lakers’ defensive rating of 108.9 was 13th in the league. Sacramento was 21st in defensive rating at 110.8.  &gt; The Kings never figured out how to defend consistently during the season and that was a major problem. Walton will need to improve that area next season.  &gt; How Walton’s Lakers finished the season was what the Kings wanted Neither the Lakers nor the Kings was going to make the playoffs, but the Lakers played with a fighting spirit down the stretch while the Kings faded. Divac joined the Kings on their five-game road trip last month, in part to remind the Kings how the team finished the season mattered.  &gt; He wanted the Kings to play hard and show vigor, even if the playoffs weren’t a possibility. Divac would see the Kings drop two games on the trip to injury-depleted, non-playoff teams, including the Lakers and New Orleans.  &gt; The Lakers won six of their last 10 games, even while most knew Walton would likely be fired at the end of the season.  &gt; The Kings dropped seven of 10 to end the season. The last two losses were especially troubling to watch, as they dropped their home finale to New Orleans, which did not play its three best players (Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday, Julius Randle) and had only eight players available. The Kings led by 14 before being overtaken by the Pelicans.  &gt; Then there was Wednesday’s season finale, when Portland held out nearly all of its regulars and used a six-man rotation. The Kings blew a 28-point lead after Joerger decided to sit his starters at halftime and lost the game. Those two losses guaranteed the Kings would finish below .500 for the 13th consecutive season.  &gt; Meanwhile, Walton coaxed good efforts from his team, even as LeBron James, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma all missed games. If anything, Walton figured out how to stay connected with the team amid drama and injuries with nothing to play for besides pride. The Kings seemed to lose their edge as the playoffs became less of a possibility.  &gt; The Kings had one game Joerger considered good in their final 10 — a March 31 win at San Antonio.  &gt; Walton and Divac’s relationship should be a plus That Divac spent a season as Walton’s teammate should help establish a solid rapport. The communication between Joerger and Divac could have been better, and that was a factor in the decision to fire Joerger. Walton will have to establish that kind of connection with the players, too. That’s something Divac wanted to see Joerger do more, and it also contributed to the decision to change coaches.  &gt; For whatever anyone thought about Joerger’s relationship with his players, the Kings did improve. Walton will need to continue to forge relationships with the young nucleus, a nucleus Divac has much faith in.  &gt; Walton also already knows forward Harrison Barnes, whom the Kings acquired in a trade with Dallas in February, from their days with the Golden State Warriors. Walton went 39-4 as interim coach for Steve Kerr in 2015-16.  &gt; ""I’m happy for Luke, that was quick,” Kerr told reporters prior to Saturday’s playoff game against the Los Angeles Clippers. “Great opportunity though, really nice young team. I thought Dave Joerger did a tremendous job there the last few years.  &gt; ""They’ve established a really good foundation. It’s a hell of an opportunity for him.”  &gt; That foundation also includes Marvin Bagley III, the second overall pick in last year’s NBA Draft, who never connected with Joerger like Divac would have liked.  &gt; If Walton can build a bond with players such as Fox, Hield, Bagley, Barnes, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Harry Giles, it speaks to why Divac turned to him."
Numbers are numbers but 2 of those teams had LeBron James and the 2018-19 Pistons overachieved this season given their roster.
"People view the triple-double as a useless statistic since, they argue, it's just a random benchmark. The thing is: they're right. How different is a 20/10/10 season from a 20/9.5/9.5 season? Not very, it's just 41 rebounds/assists over an 82 game season.  So I think the best way to look at Westbrook's statistical achievements is to lower the bar by about 20% and see how many other players have managed to leap over it. If it's a lot of players, then it's arguable that Westbrook is being overrated because ""triple-double"" sounds good. If he stands mostly alone, then he's rightly viewed as one of the most impressive players ever.  How many players have had 20/10/10 seasons? 2 players (Robertson, Westbrook) and 3 seasons between them.  Let's reduce rebs/assists by 10%. How many players have had 20/9/9 seasons? Still only 2 players, but now it's 6 total seasons (4 for Robertson). Wow, so far Westbrook's achievements are holding up.  How about 20/8/8 (20% reduction)? Now the list starts to expand. We get 6 players total and 12 seasons. Joining Westbrook and Robertson are: Michael Jordan (1 season), Wilt Chamberlain (1 season), James Harden (1 season), and LeBron James (2 seasons). Magic Johnson has two seasons which almost qualify, one 20/8/8 season where he only played 37 games and a second season where he played 77 but was 9 rebounds short on averaging 8 for the season. Bad luck, Magic.  Let's do one more: 15/8/8. Even by dropping the points requirement by a full 25% we only add a single player and season: Ben Simmons' rookie year. EDIT: I forgot to mention that Magic Johnson's '81-'82 season also qualifies here.  So, to conclude, even by dropping the statistical requirements by 20% (and 25% for points) we see that only 6 other players have managed to achieve anything close to what Westbrook is doing and 5/6 are all-time greats while the 6th is a 6'10"" PG whose career is just getting started. Basically, averaging a season of 20/8/8 is one of the hardest things to do in basketball and any player who manages it (or even gets close) is probably a generational talent.  tl;dr Westbrook is pretty fucking great.

Lucas Nogueira on LeBron James? That shit still gives me nightmares.
Then wouldn’t she go just go at him then when he was at the height of his career and during the middle of the season. Coaching the Lakers and effin LeBron James? This story would be bigger if he was still coaching the Lakers and this was during the season. It would have been a shitshow.
He hasn't played his best all series but this is one of the best defenses in the league. Lets take a look at the players who have ever averaged 28/8/7 on 54% TS in the playoffs for a season:  &amp;#x200B;  Oscar Robertson (x3)  LeBron James (x1)  &amp;#x200B;  That's the end of the list.

"OKC and LAL are both interesting cases of basketball purgatory right now. I would say they are in equally bad situations.  Here is why.   OKC is going to have to pay serious luxury tax shortly with no playoff success to show for it. They have two of the most overpaid players in the league in Westbrook and Adams and they have very little room to build a serious contender as this would require a combination of: 1) more creative coaching, 2) competent shooters and 3) Westbrook becoming much more efficient (20-10-10 on 50% TS type of guy).  In all likelihood, this is not going to happen.   **TL;DR: OKC will be good enough to make the playoffs but will get bounced in the first round.**  LAL currently has one of the most awkwardly constructed basketball rosters ever assembled that managed to win 2 more games than last season whilst adding the best player on the planet (yes he missed 16-17 games but that doesn't change that missing the playoffs with Lebron James comes up short).  LAL does have a ton of cap space but will likely have nothing to show for it as there is every indication they will not sign any of the big name FA this offseason.  Even if AD ends up in LA that will come cost them most of their young core and a lot of draft capital (2 picks at least). Furthermore, the young players are eventually going to want to get paid so they either need better contracts or to be traded. Also, all the cap space in the world isn't going to help if LAL can't put together a contender now as Lebron has maybe one or two elite years left in him and will not play a single playoff game in a Lakers' uniform until 2020 at least.  Also, what's to say that Lebron can stay healthy if he went from missing 0 games to missing 16-17 games?   **TL;DR: if LAL does not get a big name FA this offseason (very unlikely), they are at best a first round exit and Lebron will have reached the end of his elite years.**  I say this is a \*stalemate\* of basketball purgatories. The Lakers have their glorious past to comfort them while the Thunder have the tragedy of losing 2 out of 3 MVPs throughout their tenure as a good team and the fact that had they kept Harden-Durant they would most likely have a title by now.  And LA has sunnier weather ;)"

"I used to 10/10 agree, but after watching LeBron get robbed of calls last season, I grant him exemption.  Here is a list of players who should never complain for the rest of their careers:  1. James Harden"
"And yet we still have LeBron James(top 3 player of all time), cap space for a max FA, and a young core on rookie contracts. The Thunder have one of the most expensive rosters ever assembled(with few avenues of improvement) and they're going to lose in the first round for three consecutive years. Try to answer this as honestly as possible, which situation would you rather be in?"
"You have Lebron James in the roster, that man was dragging the corpse Donyell Marshall and Zydrunas Ilguaskas to the playoffs."
"I appreciate this post because we are absolutely seeing other players get more exposure simply because Lebron is not on a play off team. Some of these early comments are trashing the quality of the games and series, but those series would still be trash if Lebron was in them lol.   &amp;#x200B;  Anyway, usage rate is a big stat for analytics, right? It also applies to media and fan attention. There's a pool of attention at 100%, and Lebron mops up a lot of that. Past 3 years it's felt like 85% Warriors and Lebron (not the Cavaliers, literally the individual Lebron James) and then 15% spread around to the hot topic among the other 28 teams.   &amp;#x200B;  I think it's fantastic this Clippers team made that comeback against GSW and there was a lot of fan fare in the moment. I'd bet some of those rookies will harness that experience in an even bigger moment later in their careers. The Nuggets are cutting their teeth against a mastermind coach. The quality might seem bad to us, but it's exciting for some of those role players or up-and-comers to define the earliest parts of their potential careers. Maybe that's all obvious but definitely worth acknowledging - sweet post OP"
"In no order: Lebron james, Kyrie, Steph, KD, Klay, Dame, CJ , Capella, Harden, Chris Paul, AD, Giannis, Middelton, Simmons, Embiid, DLO, Paul George, Jokic, Butler,  Tobias, Tatum, Siakam, Booker, Oladipo ,KAT"
"It's not about going to the Lakers. There are plenty of other teams that fit that description. They have flexibility and Lebron James. That's *much* more valuable towards building a championship contender than being capped out on a team with no clear path to improvement. At least the Lakers have the option of trading a bunch of young assets on team-friendly contracts for more established talent, or letting 1 years expire and exploring the FA market."

The myth of Russell Westbrook Triple Double God has overtaken the reality that he's a very good player with some weaknesses. Not every player is Kevin Durant or LeBron James.
"I agree but through a slightly different lens.  I've long harbored the suspicion that Lebron James' fatal flaw is the 28/7/7 stat line and he should really be shooting for more like 33/12^reb/4^ast type of player.  In the same way, we should be calling Russell Westbrook ""Mr. Hindsight"" because he should always be 20/20^ast if he wants his team to go all the way."
Lebron James. 2011
"While speaking to TMZ Sports, Johnson said that his love for the Lakers is unquestionable. And while he no longer serves as the top dog for the franchise, the Laker great reveals that he is still heavily involved with the team and it was as if he still holds the job. In fact, he admits that he still talks with team owner Jeanie Buss about team business.  Also, Johnson set the records straight as far as his relationship with LeBron James is concerned. He remains confident that the three-time NBA champion is the chosen one to lead the purple and gold back on track.  “No, no, no, no. I love LeBron. LeBron is going to lead us to the championship, so we’re excited about what he’s going to do. Also, we’re excited that he signed. It’s all good with me and LeBron. And Maverick. And Rich Paul,” Johnson said."
"“Don't talk like one of them. You're not! Even if you'd like to be. To them, you're just a freak, like me! They need you right now, but when they don't, they'll cast you out, like a leper! You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these... these civilized people, they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve.”  - LeBron James to Russell Westbrook after Westbrook blamed LeBron for KD joining GSW, circa 2017"
The answer is LeBron James.
"Space Jam movie star LeBron James is a better player than the Rockets have ever had, or will ever have."
"Basketball is a team game. No man is winning alone and it showed this year with Lebron James and the Lakers.As a hardcore OKC fan,the team just sucks as a whole.Like it or not. Teams that are title contenders should be built with precision and harmony. They need to have the right tools in every position and the versitility in order to adapt to different situation they are put by different teams. Every past champion in the nba was a complete team in almost every position. The bad boys,Bulls, Shaq-Kobe Lakers,Spurs,2000s detroit.The only exception i can make is the Miami heat in 2006 cause that was a heroic effort by a pretty limited team.But even The 2006 Miami team had something other teams did not.A bunch of veterans with tremendous experience and an obsessed Wade."
"Hey, not all of us Lakers fans are ""toxic and delusional"" lol. I hope the OP is just trolling and doesn't seriously think that Lonzo Ball is better than Russell Westbrook right now  Also, I just checked the OP's post history, and it seems like he was a Cleveland Cavaliers fan before LeBron James signed with the Lakers. It looks like the OP has been a LeBron James fan before being a Lakers fan (there's nothing wrong with that), I just wanted to point that out since I found that pretty interesting lol"

"Right at the beginning of next game, a giant cartoon spaceship crashes into the arena. Out steps Lebron James in a Toronto jersey.

"LeBron ""LeGM"" James traded away Rodney Hood"
Lebron would turn James Harden into a spot up shooter
Dude looked garbage last time he played with LeBron 'makes his teammates better' James....
Lebron James shook. Where was this hood at last year?
Lebron James is furiously driving around Portland. He is desperate to find out where this Rodney Hood was on the 2017 NBA finals
I see Nikola Jokic went to the Lebron James School of Clutch Free Throw Shooting
"Rodney ""Michael ""LeBron James"" Jordan"" Hood"
he's the danger of hyping up a college athlete to be the next mj/lebron james. probably screwed his psyche and certainly painted him as a player he was never going to come close to
This is funny. Seems to me that Lakers want someone who can mandate Lebron james to play 45 minutes.
" That's no surprise. He's on the third axis of transcendence right now. Kyrie Irving moves in anti-planar reality (or prime-planar reality, shouts to my qmech nerds who really buy Frisch-Hayes.) While guards like Mike Conley or Chris Paul see the game from an x and o perspective, Kyrie has vision of the omega and delta factors surrounding any given basketball event.  There's a reason Kyrie was able to lead LeBron James to the 2016 Finals. Put simply, Irving is visuospatial jazz. Think of Ornette Coleman or George St. Breux, not Goran Dragic or PatBev. The dorian stylings of a Eric Dolphy better describe Irving's game than a monotone listing-off of conventional basketball skills. Ball handles? When you're in constant tune with the precise Hz pitch of the hardwood like Irving, English words like ""good handles"" cannot encapsulate even a fractoid of the scientific and metaphysical majesty of Kyrie."
You can’t just support LeBron James lol what kind of wack flair is that?
Lue is one of the only coaches to ever call out LeBron. Stop with this bullshit ass take.  https://fadeawayworld.net/2019/03/27/ty-lue-reportedly-called-out-lebron-james-in-game-7-of-the-2016-nba-finals/
"He used to be the guy who initated a large amount of sixers offense, but since the post-season, it's been ""James"" Butler who's been a psuedo-point for the sixers, with Ben being a Draymond type of role for the team. Even if Kawhi switched to guarding Jimmy, it would just allow Ben to be dominant again and push the ball up the court again for a DHO or a Lebron type of kickout pass from the paint to Harris, JJ, or Jimmy, the options for initation on the sixers roster this year is kinda insane lol"
"Okay that’s fucking stupid, that team without Hayward before the injury and Irving took a Cavs team to 7 games. Their best player on the Cavs was Lebron fucking James the Celtics played with one all star Al Hoford who is hardly an actual star player."
"I actually shared a story about LeBron further down in this thread.  ""I listened to a tennis podcast about a year ago where the guest who was dating a relatively well known model shared that she was at a Hollywood house party when her and her model friends were told to leave a bedroom because LeBron James and three thots wanted to use it.. There'S plenty stories out there.""  The model was Elizabeth Turner so she's definitely someone that would be at high profile parties and she probably wouldn't lie about it. LeBron has also been caught sliding into the dms of multiple Instagram thots. I'd be surprised if he was faithful."
"r/nba is an NBA subreddit; The Los Angeles Lakers are an NBA team; The Los Angeles Lakers are in search of a head coach; Lebron James is on the Los Angeles Lakers; Tyronnius Lue is one of the rumored candidates for the Los Angeles Lakers position; Tyronnius Lue coached Lebron James on his previous team, the Cleveland Cavaliers; There's an implication with this most recent piece of news, but I'm struggling to put my finger on it as to why this might be relevant to an NBA subreddit..."
"LeBron cautioned it's a mistake to put too much stock in one postseason. For some, NBA happiness will always be day-to-day, depending on the box score stats and the bank account dollar signs and the team's place in the NBA standings and the court of public opinion.  ""I've been playing playoff basketball a lot longer than some of these players playing the game,' James says. ""I'm an actual god when it comes to this game.  ""If you ask me about playoff basketball, I will talk all day. If you ask me about spacing at the 3:33 mark of the second quarter of last year's finals, I will gladly explain it. I'll tell you what plays worked, about adjustments we make. But when it comes to personal things, or comparing myself to my NBA underlings, like, 'Do you think you are better than this guy?' I'm the best player in the world."

I listened to a tennis podcast about a year ago where the guest who was dating a relatively well known model shared that she was at a Hollywood house party when her and her model friends were told to leave a bedroom because LeBron James and three thots wanted to use it.... There's plenty of stories out there.
"But at the same time, when you are worth millions, the time-value proposition of listening to advertisements makes absolutely no sense.  Your time as Lebron James is worth like a thousand times what Pandora is selling it for."
LeBron James Ennis
"Thats on paper. IRL is different. Also, you cant compare Kawhi to LeBron, LeBron is in a GOAT conversation while Kawhi is not. Kawhi is not a great playmaker either and everybody knows that.   Have you not been watching the game?. His teammates are legit afraid to shoot the ball and if they do they fucking miss. His teammates are too passive and keeps on passing up wide open looks.   James Ennis has outscored the Raptors entire bench."
"Ben Simmons hit Kyle Lowry in the balls, but as Kyle again demonstrated, he doesn't actually have any fucking balls or the courage that comes along with them. He doesn't have the balls to man up and actually play any sort meaningful basketball. Kyle Lowry has no fucking balls, and if he did at some point, LeBron James snagged them long ago.  With all this said, I think this is relatively fair. I don't think the NBA was just going to let that casually fly by. Again, Lowry has no balls to begin with, but this is fair."
LeBron James is beside himself
To second this the results in the playoffs are all that really matters. Look at how James Harden's stock has taken a hit due to some of his playoff series. Same thing happened to LeBron James early in his career. The team can look good on paper and in the regular season but if they choke in the playoffs they take a hit.

"Eh I don’t think I agree with that. It’s one thing when he makes a hot take like (not sure if he said this but take it as an example) “Lebron James is past his prime and the Lakers FO should ship him out ASAP.” Obviously in those cases he is just trying to generate views and buzz for the show. Since it’s just opinion, I don’t have any issue with it. But in the case of free agency or trades, he will make shit up and cite an “inside” nba source and pass it off as fact. That’s when I think issues start to arise."
it's different when you have LeBron James to sel to free agents as well as the city. ain't nobody trying to freeze their asses off without financial compensation
"It’s like how the Lakers traded away Mozgov/DLo to clear cap space and overpaid the hell out of Klutch client, KCP a year prior to signing LeBron James, but folks still make it seem like LeBron just randomly picked LA based on a midnight interview with Magic."
"Player evalutation is all results based too. We have no ability for context.   If OKC beat Portland, you know everyone here would be saying Dame just can't win with the Blazers. If Harden wins a title this year, everyone will be saying he's the best player in the game. If he gets knocked out, we'll say he's overrated.   Stats and youtube are not replacements for defending LeBron James or Kobe on the Break.  This sub can't truly rate players anymore than they can rate coaches. We just like to think we can."
"Meh, compared to regular humans he's a basketball genius but I wouldn't put his basketball IQ in the elite tier of the league. That's not to say he isn't smart but he's no Chris Paul or LeBron James in terms of basketball IQ."
Yeah nobody should be lining up to play a 60 win team outside of LeBron James.
"I need the Raptors to win so badly tonight. I hate the fucking Sixers. In fact they're my least favorite team in the NBA right now and it's not even close.  Fuck Embiid and his trashtalking ass. Shut the fuck Up and go accomplish something first.  Fuck the Process. Fuck Sam Hinkie. It's not adorable to be utter shit for several years by choice. It's pathetic.  Most of all FUCK THE MEDIA for all the attention they spend on these loosers despite them not even trying to win fucking games.  Fuck the Media for celebrating every tweet of Joel ""69% conditioning"" Embiid. I was so happy when I saw Jalen Rose told that punk to shut his mouth and act like a professional.  But most of all Fuck them for crowning their asses before they've done anything. At this point ""James"" (what a stupid nickname) is the wet dream of half the NBA writers across the League. Ben Simmons is LeBron 2.0 and Embiid is basically Shaq with a 3 point shot.  Fuck the Sixers, Fuck Embiid, Fuck Sam Hinkie, Fuck the Process. Also FTP.  EDIT: LOL I see a lot of Sixers fans coming over here acting like fucking childs. Let me just say this:  I have more respect for the 2008 Detroit Lions than for the 2015/16 Sixers as the Lions at least tried to win a game."
"Yeah, like I said, it isn't as if he is a bad passer and he is definitely more than capable of making the right pass (especially when a teammate is open), but it is extremely rare to see him make the exceptional pass that you expect from a James Harden or LeBron James. Even that pass Embiid made two games ago out of the double team is not something you see from Kawhi."
Assuming they dont run into Toronto the finals.   I'm in the belief that eastern teams went win now mode because lebron went out west. If he were still there Philly wouldnt have traded for James Butler and Harris.
Ray Allen (He got Game)  LeBron James (forgot the movie)  Kyrie Irving (uncle drew)  Wilt Chamberlain (?)  Aaron Gordon (uncle drew)
"Or ya know, we just didn't play very well because it was harden vs the warriors. They let the non hardens score and totally heard in on James at that point. Was it a factor? Yea we shit the 3 balll horribly, but using a statistical analogy to prove a point is never a good option. Hell even lebron got swept, and don't even tell me he was by himself, because klove was averaging 19 and 12."

"LeBron James + Kawhi is already a better team than anything the Clippers can offer regardless of their Coach. (Unless you're thinking they get KD too lmao).    Even now the media is filled with Lakers stories and Lakers updates and will continue to be as such even if doesn't sign. Should he not sign with the Clippers, they will continue to be largely unspoken of. There is no argument between relevance/fame. Kawhi's brand with the Lakers will grow absolutely insanely larger than with him on the Clippers. AND he gets the better team, if only because of LBJ. At that point, the old men and women in charge make literally no difference."
"That's the worst comparison though. Choose between:   LeBron James or Louis Williams?  Having your brand explode with fucking glory and fame, or joining the Clippers a largely irrelevant franchise?"

"1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry (I know he’s not playing the best, but if his team didn’t have 4 all stars he’d probably be scoring a lot more) 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden (I don’t like him as a player, but he’s a good player) 6. Giannis"
I rank them as  1) LeBron James  2) this dude Jacob Strain that whipped my ass from Hillside in high school  3) Kevin Durant
The only difference between royce white and lebron James is a couple championships and a few more wins
"Brett Brown knew that referring to Jimmy Butler as James would remind the Raptors of Lebron James, giving them PTSD. 4D Chess."
Give kawhi Lebron James
"Yeah, you're right about that. Back when James Johnson was drafted there was a good competitive rivalry between LeBron and the Bulls. One of the best parts of that early season was when LeBron was doing a little too much talking and then he appeared to back off when he caught James' attention. It was almost certainly a coincidence as there looked to be no reason for a fight, but here I am bringing it up 10+ years later."
"In hindsight, I think signing Lebron James and Dwyane Wade would've been good for us.  Who knows though.."
"Slight Disclaimer: My list FAVOURS playoff performances (although that's not ALL that matters, it's worth more to my PERSONAL rankings than regular season)  1) LeBron James  2) Kawhi Leonard  3) Kevin Durant  4) James Harden  5) Steph Curry  6) Giannis Antetokounmpo  7) Joel Embiid  8) Anthony Davis  9) Damian Lillard  10) Nikola Jokic  Honorable Mentions: Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker"
"You're being down voted but I agree with you here. Prime LeBron (plus tons and tons of talent) would be good for deep playoff runs regardless but that team would disappoint. You need shooters or eventually, you lose.  Bring in Ray Ray, slide everyone up a position and trade Deng for shooting though and it's a different story. Rose/Allen/Wade/James/Noah."
"&gt; I like the theory that in 0.2 seconds, Draymond Green’s thought process went: “Woah this is a 50/50 looseball. Who’s contesting it? Holy shit it’s James Harden. He’s an MVP candidate. He is really important to the rockets. I should poke him. But I can’t do it because I did it to Lebron last year. I gotta make this look unintentional. I mean it’s a bang-bang play so it’ll look unintentional regardless. After it’s done, I’ll go give him a hug to make it known I don’t do these things intentionally.”   Uh... That's pretty detailed. Can you quote where I've said this is my stance? Or you just make this entire shit up on your own and then pretending that it's my stance?  If it's the second one, you've got some serious fucking problems.  &gt;I also like the theory that it really was unintentional because you know, it was fucking unintentional.  OOC, how would you know? Stated another way, if a player did want to intentionally poke someone in the eye but not be completely obvious about it, how would it have looked different?"

"Lakers, Clippers and Celtics do not have a single tradeable asset nearly as valuable as Zion.  The Sixers could top that easily by sending Embiid/Simmons back, but I'm not sure how willing they'd be to do that.  And if Zion+ is not enough then I'd be more than happy to stand pat on Davis and keep the most hyped NBA prospect since Lebron James."
"Fair point. So I have   &amp;#x200B;  Sharper:  \-0.1467 x + 8.296 x - 96 / Kobe Bryant  \-0.1475 x + 9.656 x - 141.6 / Steve Nash  &amp;#x200B;  Flatter:  \-0.03997 x + 2.027 x - 7.312 / Tim Duncan  \-0.05002 x + 2.857 x - 17.59 / LeBron James  &amp;#x200B;  James looks flatter to me, but generally speaking this might not be too hard to do.  Edit: sorry the first term is the quadratic"
"The Phoenix Suns didn’t have to make an offer Friday in Toronto.  That would’ve given the Los Angeles Lakers the power to make a better one to convince Monty Williams to fill their head-coaching vacancy.  But by not putting their cards on the table, the Suns can wait on the Lakers to put theirs out there first and then counter that offer with a better one.  The Republic learned over the weekend Phoenix didn’t offer Williams the job, according to league sources, while the Los Angeles Times reported the Lakers didn’t make Williams an offer on Thursday.   If the Lakers really wanted to hire Tyronn Lue, you’d think they would have by now.  Lue played for the Lakers, coached LeBron James in Cleveland and is unemployed, but they’re clearly not sold on him enough to have made him an offer Wednesday.  So, Williams, 47, is probably the guy they really want."
So it was your 3 year old daughter that posted that top 5 the other day that excluded Lebron. 🤔  Also your username is Tatum boomed me and Tatum only boomed Lebron.  I’ve gathered enough evidence to confirm that u/TatumBoomedMe is Lebron James
"Per cbafaq:  &gt; Player options once were used as a way to give the player more money. The team and player agreed to a long-term deal with a player option after the player obtained full Bird rights (which used to be after one season). The player invoked the option, became a free agent, and then signed a new contract for more money using the Bird exception. However they mostly closed this loophole by making Bird rights ramp-up over three seasons, and by allowing options only on the last year of a contract. The most common usage today is for a player to change teams by signing a two-year contract, with the second year being a player option. In this case the second season acts as an insurance policy, and the player opts-out after the first season (unless he suffers a severe injury). He then signs another of these ""1+1"" contracts as a non-Bird free agent, receiving a 20% raise. He can then either play both years under this contract and enter free agency with full Bird rights, or opt-out again and repeat the process. Both LeBron James (re-signing with Cleveland) and Kevin Durant (Golden State) used this ""1+1"" strategy when changing teams.   http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q57"
How about LeBron James
"Joe: Harden is a fucking monster!  Schaub: oh fersher, but is he a drawl? it's tough man, people don't wanna watch the refs decide the owlcum of the game, does that make cents?   Joe: Yeah look I get it, but i'm just saying as a basketball fan, i want to watch THAT dude play  Brendan: oh 100 % joe i'm just looking at it from a drawl perspective, unless you're Steven Curly, Lebron James or Kevin Deodorant you're simply not a drawl man"
"this is a horrible team, no one is elite enough to run and offense let alone a pick and roll. a team with just one superstar like kawhi, lebron, steph, kd or harden and filled with league average players (like james ennis) would defeat this team"
"LeBron James, Joel Embiid, Russell Westbrook, Luka Doncic, John Wall and Damian Lillard in that order."
Signing LeBron James and then abandoning young talent because you expect more superstars will come join
Kawhi is making case as the greatest playoff performer in Canada since ~~Gretzky~~ LeBron James
"Maybe not on the internet, but irl a lot of people hated Steph because he shouldn't have been as good at basketball as someone as athletic as Lebron James. People also did not like Draymond for the same reasons people don't like Draymond now. The rest of the team was pretty likeable until Zaza and KD."
[Still excited to see what's gonna happen. Let's go!](http://lomotif.com/video/watch?v=lebron-james-pre-game)
&gt; and Kyrie is trash?  One on one?  No.  In a team that doesn't have LeBron James in it?  Kinda.
NBA coaching is different from basketball coaching. Why would coaches who are given more heed in college in Europe going to risk their job security in a league that your job isn't just developing a team but managing their egos.   Some punk player won't follow your play? You bench that motherfucker. You can't do that in the NBA. LeBron James and or Steph Curry just freelanced and pulled up a 30 foot 3pt fadeaway? You can't bench them for poor shot selection like that. Ownership would fire your ass even before the quarter ends. Only Popovich could get away with shit like that
Lebron james
Ben Simmons is not an elite driver and finisher like LeBron James
"He may have gotten a buyout.  Even otherwise, while he isn't short of money, the cavs contract runs out before the Lakers contract would have  https://hoopshype.com/2018/10/28/cleveland-cavaliers-ty-lue-fired-lebron-james/"
"LeBron has said in the past that he considers Kidd to be one of his mentors in the league.  Also don't forget they won Gold together on the best Olympic team since the dream team: https://i.imgur.com/9kzDeTg.jpg  Also LeBron wanted the Cavs to trade for Kidd pretty badly back in the day.  [LeBron would pick Kidd over any Legend to play with](https://www.complex.com/sports/2016/02/lebron-james-play-with-nba-legend-jason-kidd)  Pretty much LeBron has a ton of respect for Kidd, at least as a basketball mind, also Lakers probably think Kidd can help with Lonzo's development."
"Another fun fact similar to this: in the 2015 playoffs, Steph's first MVP season and eventual championship was elected to the NBA 1st team overall team, as one would expect.  As he progressed through the playoffs, he beat each other member of the 1st overall NBA Team that season. Anthony Davis on the Pelicans, Marc Gasol on the Grizzlies, James Harden on the Rockets, And Lebron James on the Cavs."

"One thing to touch on is the awful pressure associated with being in LA and also the fact that you have no time for missteps or failure. You are now working with LeBron James, a person who probably thinks and is smarter than you, the ownership situation is fuckin crazy, the FO has a hard time doing its own job, their are tons of egos to manage both on the team and in the FO, your GM looks like a former crack addict interested in re-entering the fold, etc etc"

Why is today the first time I’ve ever heard of a relationship between Kidd and LeBron James? It sounds so made up. Never once heard anything of the sort before.
LeBron James and Stroh Curry were born in the same hospital.
"The killer mentality exists at the top. You can't look at the Lakers young players to try to find killer mentality just like you couldn't look at the Clippers young players back when Jordan was winning championships.  If you want to see killer mentality you have to first look at the high level players, and then look at veterans. Young guys generally need to develop it. Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid are examples of guys that you sometimes see them with a killer mentality, and then other times they don't have it, just because they're not focused in yet because they lack maturity.  Guys I would say I've seen with the killer mentality: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, James Harden, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antekoumpo, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Lebron James, and probably a few more."
"\[Windhorst\] Tensions were high in the Lakers lockerroom following the signing of coach Frank Vogel. Some players seem tired of the way Vogel handles rotations, and the manner in which he addresses players before and after games. LeBron James was heard muttering ""should've brought in Lue"" after heading to the showers following the Lakers loss on Saturday."""

"Curious about this James Kidd relationship. https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-calls-jason-kidds-hiring-amazing/  Man this article has not aged well... ""The question for Kidd is how the transition of going from playing, being a teammate and opponent, to coaching goes   “It’s going to be a transition, but I don’t know,” LeBron said. “He doesn’t know. It’s the first time for him, but it was the same with [Golden State's] Mark Jackson. He had never patrolled the sideline either, but look at the great work he’s done in Golden State. You play the game and you’re smart, I think it can make the transition much easier for you. And he’s not inheriting a bad team, he’s inheriting a good team. So that makes the job easier, too.”"""
&gt;a strong relationship and history with LeBron James.  RIP Vogel.
"Had the Thunder finished off the Warriors and beaten the Cavs, they would have perhaps the greatest playoffs run in NBA history. Beating the 67-win Spurs, 73-win Warriors, and then Lebron James would have been fucking legendary and we'd be calling KD the best player on the planet for the last 4 years."
"Vogel is not a bad coach, but I've seen no one make any case that he's an especially good one either. That we came out of this search with a dude who is decidedly ""meh"" when we've got LeBron James, a max slot, and 2 top 2 picks on their rookie contracts is not a good sign for the strength of this organization.  Honestly, I don't think anyone is particularly mad about it being Vogel (although the fact that he wasn't in the initial round of interviews is not a great sign), they're mad that this process suggests that everyone in the front office or ownership is wildly incompetent."
"This is crazy talk. Lebron isn't getting fucking traded. Lakers fans held a protest just bc they couldn't land Ty Lue, can you imagine the reaction if they trade **Lebron James**"
"Hmm, this is a tough one but I'm gonna have to go with LeBron James."
Jud Buechler has 3 rings.  Lebron James has 3 rings.  Jud Buechler = Lebron James. It's just math.

LeBron James Teen Titans Go commercial
"Scott perry is doing it the right way so far but we have to see the results of that working out before saying they’ve turned a corner. That could be long term too, they don’t need to sign big free agents this summer, just don’t hand out bad deals, and continue to  draft well.          Lakers signed Lebron which is a massive win obviously, however it makes the stakes much higher. If they waste Lebron James’ last years because of incompetency, then they deserve to be in the conversation for the most dysfunctional."
"So the Lakers fire Walton and short hand Lue for a guy who has been fired twice, win totals dropped over the two years he was in Orlando and he had no idea how to develop Gordon and Vucivic. The locker room collapsed on him in 2014 and they barely made it out of the first round as a one seed.   It seems the Lakers just wanted a name who everyone knows. It didn’t seem they interviewed one assistant other than Williams and Woodson, who were head coaches before. I think Vogel is gonna have the same effect Thibidou had on Minnesota.   Also, Vogel isn’t a coach who attracts free agents. If Paul George really wanted to he could have talked his way into keeping Vogel but Bird fired him because Vogel lost all respect in the locker room, no one listened to him. Add LeBron James who probably is pissed his top coach didn’t get the job and I think Vogel will be thrown under the bus if the Lakers do poorly again."
At least it was fast.   We have LeBron James -- the game here is just don't do anything too stupid.   Lue was already failing that test by making negotiations public. Last thing this team needs is gasoline on a dumpster fire.
"“ Hasn’t coaches a player of Lebrons caliber”   I’m not going to say Paul George is as good as Lebron James, but Paul joined the league as a All-Rookie Second team which is impressive and Vogel helped coach him into a 3 time nba all star by the time Vogel left.   I personally would have preferred Lue over Vogel and have Vogel as an assistant. But I’m just pointing out Vogel is not a bad pick and has some experience coaching."
"Politics.   LeBron James is Michael Scott, Jason Kidd is Dwight, and Vogel is Toby from corporate."
"More like LeBron James is Michael Scott, Kidd is Dwight, and Vogel is Toby"

"Yea this isnt even an argument.  The eastern conference hasnt been anywhere near this decade.  Even when you had 60 win teams, they werent anywhere near contenders.  You had the Hawks and Raptors at 60 wins but had no superstars and it showed when they got swept by Lebron in round 2.  Theres a reason Lecoast became a meme.  He literally didnt have to try the regular season and just had to pump it up in the playoffs.  Meanwhile, you got teams in the west playing hard until the last minute trying to get a good seeding.  Lebron James doesnt give a fuck about seeding in the east."

"Yeah, its a dumb comment. Even if its a joke, its a bad one. He is .500 against Warriors in elimination games.   A better joke would be this: name a more iconic duo, Lebron James and losing to the Warriors in the finals."
He can thank his GM for that.  The same thing fan be said of Lebron James the last 2 years.  Played amazing just didnt have the team around him to support.
"&gt;Vogel makes Luke Walton look like Pop  This isn't a good analogy.

A good coach would've upgraded his assistant coaches when asked at the very least, and Luke Walton didn't even want to do that lol  Luke Walton would go stretches where LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, and Kyle Kuzma aren't on the court.  Luke Walton would put Josh Hart as a small ball power forward and Kyle Kuzma as a small ball center at times. That same Luke Walton didn't even have a real offensive system in place, but sure. Luke Walton is that much better than Frank Vogel lol"

"Idk why I should lay off the subreddit are people who lose supposed to just leave lol obviously I am salty haha, but that doesn’t mean what I say is automatically wrong. And obviously it’s within the rules nobody is saying the warriors should go go jail why are you making strawman arguments?  The honest reality is some teams consider having to max guys like Otto Porter and some teams have money left over since they are able to acquire LeBron James or the like for less than a max.     If the top 10 players in the league banded together and decided to play for Orlando for 9m/yr that would be perfectiy within the rules (assuming Orlando could clear its books) but I doubt we’d be sitting here saying ‘wow the bucks really blew it in the conference finals they really had a chance’ lol; we’d be talking about how we saw that coming from the start of the year"
"https://www.businessinsider.com/nba-cba-changed-over-36-rule-lebron-james-200-million-contract-2016-12  Pretty brief article that sums it up.  Just to be clear, I'm very pro-player and I find a lot of these rules in the CBA that protect ownership groups from making stupid deals to be unfair to the players. That being said, Bron and CP3 made a rule change that explicitly helps 36-38 year old max players, who are very uncommon and basically just them. That's all I was pointing out"
"Lmfao  LeBron James will never have an effect on the playoffs again, huh?  Troll confirmed. Goodbye"
"Ha yeah. It reminds me of that LAUGHABLE rumor about the biggest free agent in the last decade, LeBron James joining us. Just a bunch of silly drivel."
"sometimes flopping is necessary anyway. like that play where gordon got grabbed by bogut so he took the jumper for the guaranteed free throws because he assumed that the ref would see bogut fouling him. nope, it's a situation where players are incentivized for embellishing the contact.   no team is good enough to get over the hump when the hump is beating the warriors, unless you have lebron james playing at the highest level of all-time. they're the best team in nba history and the rockets gave it their all, but couldn't get it done. just shows how good the warriors are  i think last year was their year (because even if they won this yr, i dont think they woulda won the finals)."
I’ve had discussions about dunking on LeBron James.
until LeBron James used ~~an imaginary coaching contract~~  a Wintergreen Life Savers to reel him in.
"I fucking hate James Harden. But it blows my mind that he got shit on for the game 5 ending as badly as he did. He made the right decisions pretty much every time. Sure he didn't score till the game was over, but every decision he made was right.  A lot of this stuff kind of reminds me of 08-10 LeBron, which sucks because I hate defending Harden as much as any NBA player does....and he doesn't deserve this imo. He missed FTs in game 6 sure, but there wasn't too much he could have a done. I feel like everyone else let him down in the 4th of game 6 more than he let the team down."
"&gt; Spoelstra is an excellent coach, no coincidence that's where he had the most success.  Yeah I agree that is why I said most of his career. But hey you get Lebron James you have to deal with this coaching drama. Everyone knew Luke wouldn't last the year."
"Yeah man a damn good position they won 19, 21, 24, and 33 games in a terrible eastern conference before he came back. How many do they win the in 2015 if Lebron James doesn't join that team? With Wiggins and Kyrie leading the way."
If Kyrie joins with LeBron i have no idea why KD would leave golden state. Does he actually think James Dolan is going to put together a good team for him in NY? They wouldn't even stand a chance against Giannis.
"Winning 45 with a ""really good young core"" and LeBron freaking James is already a disappointment lol. Them not making the playoffs is just worse."
The LA media is soft as hell though   we missed the playoffs with lebron fucking James and the la media barely even gave him shit for it.  Just cause it’s a huge market doesn’t mean the media is toxic an will shit on you like say NY
What are you talking about?  He's got the emotions of a moody teenager he'll be unhappy anywhere. Guy wasn't content winnings championships with Lebron James.
"James... Harden, not LeBron."
Lebron “Father Figure” James
"That's a convenient way to circumvent the whole argument to get to the point you wanted to. Also, I disagree with that point on a few levels: Kawhi Leonard and Giannis are great two way players, but do not have the impact on a team that Steph has. Here's a list of things wrong with your point:  1. The MVP vote isn't about who's the better player. It never has been and never will be. Otherwise Lebron James has been fucked out of 10 years worth of MVPs.  The award is given for the most impactful player on a top team. Harden has had the highest impact this season because his team has experienced tons of injuries and he's absolutely carried them through the regular season. He performed well in the playoffs, but definitely not the astronomical James Harden from the regular season. That's fine in and of itself because he played at or above what was expected of him. 2. To make your list, come up with a single metric by which you want to evaluate all the players. Spoiler: there are no practical metrics that Stephen Curry does not come up in those top 5. 3. If you want a more holistic approach, which you probably should seeing as we're evaluating how good a player is, then look at the total impact a player has on their current team. Try to extrapolate how this impact changes outside of their current circumstances. Lebron James is a great example here; he's undoubtedly a top 5 player on skill, but his team situation is shit so his total wins are going to be lower than a player like Kawhi Leonard.    Overall, from a holistic perspective Steph Curry is a top 5 player no matter what conclusion you try to draw from this series. You keep saying that 1 quarter shouldn't dictate who's better, but it seems like your only contention to place Curry out of the top 5 is predicated on this last playoff series."
"HOUSTON — Draymond Green stood outside the visiting locker room at the Toyota Center, greeting teammates as they came in. When Stephen Curry made his way through the crowd, he looked straight at Green — before they slapped hands and bumped chests — and screamed, “Kick me off the court again, boy!”  There is a story behind that.  On the eve of Friday’s Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals, Curry wanted to get some shots up at the Toyota Center. The Warriors’ do-it-all manager, Eric Housen, booked the court from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. so Curry could work on his shot. Somehow, Rockets guard Chris Paul got wind. He decided to go to the Toyota Center to get shots up, nixing Curry’s reservations. The Warriors’ point guard offered to stick to half a court, but Paul wasn’t having it. Curry was kicked off the Toyota Center court.  Hence: “Kick me off the court again, boy!” And Green replied to Curry’s taunt by screaming, “Kick him off! Kick him off!”  The lesson from the Warriors’ 118-113 win to eliminate the Rockets and advance to the Western Conference finals was loud and clear. It’s going to take more than gamesmanship to beat the Warriors. Talent alone isn’t even enough.  Game 6 of this second-round series was a flex by the Warriors. It was a performance that illustrated the gulf between good teams and great ones, and another gulf between great teams and champions. On the road, with Kevin Durant back in the Bay Area watching on television, and with starting center DeMarcus Cousins on the bench in street clothes, they leaned on their championship mettle and revealed Houston to be unworthy of their crown.  And that isn’t necessarily a slight to the Rockets, one of the few teams that dared to dethrone the super team. Houston was indeed a valiant foe that pushed the Warriors unlike any other team without LeBron James.  The present day will take a chunk from the Rockets, from James Harden and Paul, especially. But history should remember them as great. When the final story is written about this era of the Warriors, they might only be looking up to Michael Jordan’s Bulls. And the Rockets, they are this era’s Utah Jazz: incredibly dynamic, led by Hall of Fame players, but just fashioned at the wrong time, in the same space-time continuum as a transcendent team.  “That team was one of the best teams we played during this five-year run,” coach Steve Kerr said of the Rockets. “They put so much pressure on you at both ends of the floor. It’s a tremendous two-way basketball team. We had to scrap and fight for everything the last two years against them. … Obviously, it speaks to our group and their toughness and talent. But I can’t speak any more highly of Houston and their grit and their competitiveness and their talent. That was an absolute grind.”  But there are levels to this. The Warriors are just a class above.  This was the Rockets’ best chance to show they belonged in the same ilk. The Warriors didn’t have more talent in Game 6. They didn’t have a loaded bench. They were down two starters, and their best players had logged heavy minutes. But in the end, the Warriors had too much of something else — championship swag. And they used it to come up with one of their biggest wins of this era, against a team most thought could end their reign.  “It’s all-time greats in here,” Quinn Cook screamed. “We got champions in this, motherfucka.”  This is what Green knew before the game when he predicted the Warriors were going to handle business. He knew it when they walked through shootaround and everyone was quiet. When they huddled, he tried to clap it up, get the energy up, and no one clapped with him.  He surveyed his teammates, looked into their eyes, examined their body language, searching for nervousness. Instead, he found focus.  “Oh, everybody’s ready to go,” Green said. “And I could feel it. Everybody was locked in. Even I got quiet. I knew I didn’t really feel like talking. And I know we’re locked in like that — I know what we’re made of, so I just knew guys were going to come out and bring it. When you talk about heart, you’re talking about just the willingness to do whatever. The willingness to do what it takes. The willingness to step up in a big moment. You can’t buy it. You can’t give it to someone. Either you got it or you don’t. I think we showed that in a major way.”  Klay Thompson was a prime example. He came into Game 6 averaging 17.6 points on 42.7 percent shooting. He’d made just over a third of his 3-pointers, 13-of-36, which is good but beneath his standards. But he came out shooting like he had the hottest stroke in Houston. He made 5 of his 9 3-point attempts and scored a game-high 21 points in the first half. The Warriors needed every basket. But he gave them more than the points. He gave them confidence. He fired the first shots in the mental war that games of this magnitude become.  Thompson famously destroyed Oklahoma City in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals in 2016. In 2018, he burned these same Rockets in Game 6. He came out reminding them what kind of night they were in for, what it was going to take to beat them. Thompson signaled how the Warriors were bringing it.  “His personality, his perspective on life, really makes him different in these moments,” Curry said. “I don’t even know if he really even feels pressure. He’s just out there hooping. The shots he was taking in the first half — understanding the situation, the confidence to knock them down — that was huge for us. We don’t win this game tonight without everybody on the court, but especially Klay that first half to give us life and to give us a reason to be in it in the second half.”  At the 9:57 mark of the fourth quarter, Andre Iguodala checked out of the game. At that point, he had logged 29 minutes, 45 seconds after closing the third quarter and starting the fourth. But at the 8:15 mark, Kerr put him right back in.  Iguodala was stunned. He was spent. He needed a longer breather. He said one moment he was so tired, he felt lightheaded and a little dizzy. He said it was probably the most mentally exhausted he’s ever been.  But experience has taught him some things that come into play in the most intense moments of playoff basketball. He’s learned how to override the fatigue and conquer the thoughts that lead to defeat. Friday, he leaned on meditation principles. He embraces those moments, those thoughts. He lives in those moments — feels them, examines them and then discards them with a breath. It’s his championship pedigree serving as an antivirus for exhaustion, doubt, frustration, weakness.  It was a lesson he learned in the Warriors’ first championship back in 2015, when he first felt what it took to be a champion. It was late in Game 6 of those NBA Finals, and a couple of calls went Cleveland’s way. He remembers complaining to himself about how hard it was, about how the referees weren’t giving them calls, how the mountain seemed so steep.  “The referees were (officiating) like, ‘You have to win.’ That’s the thought I had,” Iguodala said. “We have to win. You’re not just going to win the championship. You have to go get it.  “If I’m ever in a game,” he continued, “and I’m like, ‘Yo, this is hard,’ then I tell myself, ‘That means you’re doing something right.’ … When you know something is hard and you’re doing it the right way — that’s really a championship moment, when you overcome the mind, overcome the body being tired, the mind being dead.”  Iguodala overcame in a big way. His 17 points and five steals, his calming presence on the court. When he checked back in after 102 seconds of rest, his defense helped hold Harden to 1-of-4 shooting with a turnover in the defining stretch of the game that saw the Warriors go from a four-point deficit to a five-point lead.  Behind Iguodala was Green, holding down the back line. He filled the stats as usual — eight points, 10 rebounds, seven assists, a steal, a block, four turnovers, four fouls — but he anchored a defense that held the Rockets scoreless on eight shots over a span of 3:56 that saw the Warriors take control of the game.  “Draymond,” Shaun Livingston said, “we wouldn’t have championships without him. Heart of steel. Steph playing through what he’s playing through — all the expectations, people talking. The character behind those guys. Them two. Klay. Andre. The character behind those guys is unmatched. We stay in the trenches. You’ve got to put us down. We’re like that dog that’s going to keep biting if he’s got one tooth left, but you know he’s going to bite you with it. We all have that mentality. I’ve seen it. That mentality of staying locked in. ‘We can’t give this game up. We can’t celebrate early. We can’t think we got it in the bag.’ That’s what champs do. We’ve just got guys.”  So when it was winning time and the Rockets had to dig deeper to beat the champions and stave off elimination, they couldn’t do it. The Warriors came alive in that moment and the Rockets couldn’t.  Curry seized the moment and carried the Warriors home. He hit the shot of the night, hitting the Rockets’ best defender in P.J. Tucker with a series of crossovers and drilling a fadeaway 3. That’s when they knew, the Warriors and the Rockets, that the gulf between these teams would not be conquered.  Of course, Thompson hit the dagger 3-pointer, the one that punctuated the reality of this most riveting rivalry: The Rockets are great. But the Warriors are champions.  “I can’t remember a situation where we’ve had must-win games and my guys folded,” Green said. “I can’t remember. I’ve seen guys have bad games. But I’ve never seen us in any situation where there was a big-pressure moment and they fold. But yet they’re light-skinned and they’re soft. Fuck outta here. They ain’t never folded in a big moment. But they don’t get credit for that because their jump shots are pretty. Fuck them jump shots. They show up in big moments. They got heart.”  (Photo: Andrew D. Bernstein / Getty Images)"
Greg Oden is Bizzaro LeBron James.
This is why if I was an NBA player I would never want to play with Lebron. All the blame none of the credit. Hell even Kyrie doesnt get credit and without his shot Cleveland probably never win with James
cause people are used to KD's LeBron James Dwyane wades Carmelos of the world that at age 21-24 are already a top 10 top 15 player in the league   hell even Davis and Kyrie
They should also think about trading Aaron Gordon for LeBron James
LeBron James wearing a yellow jersey with Frank Vogel coaching him. Imagine that in 2012
LeBron James
Some kid in africa will come to America one day talking about those great championship seasons of the Cavs and Lebron James except that one year the warriors won 73 games and the title over them and how remarkable it was that the Patriots went undefeated and won the superbowl -- 19 and 0!
"This was a little weird though:  Tyron Lue then dove to the ground and yelled, ""Fishie fishie fishie!"" He flopped like a fish out of water until LeBron James used an imaginary coaching contract to reel him in."
"Jordan won more rings than his ""expected value"" based on finals opponents than lebron did  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-should-lebrons-finals-record-hurt-his-legacy/  &gt; it’s not really a surprise that James has that 3-6 record in the Finals. **In fact, if you add up the pre-series odds in the table above, you get an expected championship count of 2.8 for James — meaning he’s somehow running 0.2 titles above expectation, despite his record. **Although that trails Jordan (who won 1.9 times more than we’d expect from the pre-series odds)**, it’s better than Bryant, whose 5-2 mark is exactly even with what the probabilities would have expected.  So basically Jordan &gt; Lebron &gt; Kobe"
"Jordan found ways to win games. James Harden is an absolutely amazing player, and I appreciate the fact that he didn't go out there and completely choke. He played his best series and tried his hardest to lead the Rockets to a victory, but he just wasn't good enough. That's what separates the top 10-15 players from the top 35-50. Jordan almost always found a way to win. LeBron found a way to win. Curry found a way to win last night. It's okay to admit that Harden just isn't on that level. I hope that Harden can get through these struggles and win a championship one day, but if he doesn't, that's okay too. Not everyone is destined to win a championship. As long as he's out there doing the best he can, I can live with the results."
Iggy got it for guarding James.  LeBron should have won 2015 FMVP.  He carried his broken team to 6 and led the series in every stat.
Also 37 points 12 rebounds 5 assists on 12/23 against the Spurs in game 7  LeBron is 2-0 in Finals game 7s. Not sure there's another player in history with that record besides James Jones obv
"LeBron James, 2016 playoffs."
JJ barea shutting down LeBron James
"If Lebron had the exact same season, with any name other than Lebron James attached to it, this wouldn’t be an absurd hot take.  It’s not stupid to say that looking at this season he’s not top 5."
"As a fellow Curry fan, I agree 100%. His numbers check out, especially his efficiency, but he's not a KD or Lebron-type player where he consistently has average-to-good games on decent efficiency. Curry has amazing games on ungodly efficiency and terrible games where he shits the bed.   Two years in a row now KD has won FMVP over him, and both times I feel it's been because of 1 game - literally 1 - where Curry played outright bad, whereas KD was good in every game. So even though Curry was better than KD in some games last year, he had that game 3 where he was atrocious.  I feel like, if it hadn't been for that game, Curry would have won FMVP even if KD was ""slightly"" better - because of the narrative. But even narrative isn't strong enough to counteract *those* numbers. If they'd given him the FMVP people would have discredited it, just like they try to discredit his 2015 title.  Honestly I'm just waiting for KD to leave. I know they probably won't win another title after he's gone, but I don't care. I want to see 1st option Curry again, I want to see him in a world where Mike D'Antoni and James Harden have said it's okay to take 20 3s a game."

"Let me preface this by saying I hate LeBron and love Curry and KD.   LeBron James took them to 6 games with Dellevadova and Mozgov as his best two players. We all know what happened the next season after that when Kyrie and Love were healthy. After that they go get KD and Curry never needed to play well again, (not that he didn't) but we knew KD took care of it. KD hit the daggers in LeBron's face . When Curry had 11 points in game 3 of the finals and was crying after the game, don't worry, it was still a sweep . All Curry needed to do was be a good sidekick. Even this season, what's the threat? Denver? Portland? Milwaukee? These teams were never title favourites no matter how you spin it. If the Warriors win it, it'll be expected, but if they lose, I don't care how Curry plays that's a huge hit on his legacy and he won't deserve a top 3 spot in this league anymore. But if he does win, *and* the supporting cast plays bad, that'll surely elevate his legacy. But I definitely don't think this was a great game from him. Just good enough, nothing special from *him*. Imagine Kawhi, Harden, LeBron in the Cav having that. No other elite player could have 0 points in a half and not be down 20 in the playoffs. It's not like Harden and CP3 played bad either. It took 17 points from Iggy, elite defensive stops from Klay and Iggy at the end to even *allow* Curry to put them up 5. In the end he ices the game with 8 free throws. This wasn't a clutch performance by his standards considering that goose-egg in the first half."

"I know this comes from my bias as a raptors fan but I really am amused by the lakers situation. They seem to always have  the deck stacked in their favour but they are still fucking things up. With all the success in the history of the franchise it feels good to have some misfortune come their way, this is a team with Lebron James and we can say they have misfortune. They have repeatedly tried to cut corners and cheat the league but it has finally bit them in the ass. I think it’s important for everyone to be humbled once in a while. Hopefully they will learn from this and in a few years go right back to sweeping the free agent market. Or maybe the clippers will get a go."

You hit the nail on the head. TY Lue's biggest asset was always LeBron James. It wasn't Lue doing this or that. They had the best player in the world that whole time and carried the team on his back.
They still had LeBron James.... and they almost won game 1...and KD carried them Game 3
Playing against one of the strongest teams ever with only LeBron James able to defeat them once? lmao I'm glad we were able to contend against a team that's so lucky it can have KD not be double teamed for an entire game because there's another MVP and all stars just hangin around
He’s already got fucking analysis on him at age 14 though lol  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/05/lebron-james-jr-bronny-scouting-report-recruiting-ranking-eybl-basketball
Point Guard. Steph Curry. Plays off ball and doesn’t need to be ball dominant like 95% of Point Guards.  Shooting Guard Klay Thompson. You can’t ask for a better lights out shooter and on ball defender.  Small Forward  Lebron James Unguardable  in  every way as well as being one of the most gifted passers of all time.  Power Forward Giannis The “Greek Freak”. An athletic Animal who finishes right now at the rim better than anybody but also has a pass first mind set.  Center Joel Embiid. Idk If we will ever see his true potential cause he can’t stay healthy  but when this guy is on fire he is  unguardable on every area of the floor as well as an elite paint protector.   Back Up Point Guard  Chris Paul. The best at initiating plays make the right decision in transition and getting 2-3 steals a game for his team.   Back Up Shooting Guard James Harden. Another gifted play initiator but possibly the best iso player of this era. I’d like him in this role to come off the bench and drop 15 points in 10 minutes for team USA   Back up Small Forward Kawhi Leonard. Best defender on the floor At all times who can create his own shot. One of the strongest players in the league going to the paint and can play off ball.   Back up Power Forward. Kevin Durant. One of the All around greatest scorers the league has ever seen I just couldn’t put him over Lebron because Lebron would flow better with that starting unit then I think Durant would. However I feel like Chris and kawhi would be the defensive stoppers who score early in transition and then James harden and Durant would take turns in the half court.   Center Nikola Jocic. He proved in this first two series when all else fails he’s gonna make the best decision in the floor 9/10. I see him setting up everybody on this bench on backdoor and dribble hand offs making this bench unit the best in history.   Reserve 1 Draymond Green. He is arguable the best defender at switching pick and rolls and guarding 1-5. He can initiate the offense especially in transition and when he’s hitting jump shots he is one of the best two way players in the league.   Reserve 2. Anthony Davis. I don’t think you could ask for a better team mate. Somebody who is going to set you a good screen and finish at the rim almost every time. He can create his own shot at will and when he’s hitting pick and pops there’s no guarding him. I’f it was for embiid I would say he’s the best big in the league.

"Oh, can I try a few of these?  The Bulls wouldn't have won any titles without MJ and Pippen.  The Lakers without Shaq and Kobe would have been a lottery team.   The Heat without LeBron James struggle to make the playoffs. The Cavs without LeBron James struggle to get double digit wins."
"I keep reading that the Grizzlies had a 50/50 chance at getting the number 1 pick. Can you imagine Pau Gasol, Lebron James, Shane Battier and Jason Williams?"
"&gt; James was named Finals MVP after averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds and 7 assists.  And 2.3 steals.   &gt;Remind again which one is consider arguably the GOAT   One of the reasons is that Lebron was 21 years old his first finals. Steph was in his prime he was an MVP his first finals so the expectations were much higher. Lebron making it to the finals so young was another reason for him being special since he made it that far with just role players at such a young age.  Lebron absolutely underperformed in the finals. And he was labelled a choker for that. He undid that by never underperforming like that ever again.  Steph Curry had an 11 point finals game just last year."
2017-2018 LeBron James led Cavs
"Quick question why do people still make jokes about rigging the draft lottery for the knicks when we haven't had a first overall pick since 1985, which was itself the first time the knicks had a first overall pick since 1966?  We have actually only had one top three pick since patrick ewing, which was the #2 pick in the 2005 draft and we traded it.  If anything shouldnt you make jokes about rigging the lottery for the pelicans or 76ers or cleveland?   Since the last time the knicks had 1st overall pick, the cavaliers have had five of them including lebron james.  Knicks are actually due to win the lottery."
"* Not at all. We were the worst team in the league for good reasons * You name it. Bad point guard play, first year coach, bad defenders at every position, lots of youth playing.  * Hezonja stepping over Giannis, Hezonja blocking Lebron, Point Hezonja. Also, all of Mitchell Robinson's 3-pt blocks. and Knicks winning on Fizdale's return to Memphis was pretty cool. There was 3 hours when I though Ellenson &gt; KP.  * All those home losses in a row. Just depressing watching loss after loss. Also, Ron Baker getting released was brutal. The KP drama, from requesting a trade to getting it, was a roller coaster of emotions. From NY's favorite player to public enemy No. 1 in an hour and a half.  * All the rookies. You know about Big Meech. Trier was excellent and will carve himself a nice Lou willesque career. Knox kinda sucked at some points, but he's really young and had lots of responsibility so his efficiency was always gonna tank. Showed enough promise to make me hopeful of some improvement (his defense is worrying tho). Vonleh was a nice pickup, hope we can keep him whether or not were competing next year. Damyean Dotson's gonna be a good 3-pt specialist. Kornet might be a decent stretch 5 option in the future. Also happy for Kanter (controversial amongst Knicks fans). * Ntilikina was injured so much and is so unconfident on offense when he does play (still love him). His best hope is he gets traded somewhere he can develop properly (AKA small market). I still have belief. Mudiay is terrible. He has a good game every 10 games. Not much else to say about him. Otherwise I expected everyone else to play about where they played. * First, don't be stupid or cute: draft RJ Barrett. He's the BPA.The Knicks just need to be smart and if they don't get KD or Kyrie (read: tier 1 FA), don't waste the money on second tier FA. Fiz is fine, not much to grade last year.  * Nobody really. Just steady progression from the lot of youngsters.  * DAJ is not a good defender anymore, luckily we'll have Robinson. All the other player are young so they should all improve.  * If we strike out in FA, I'm more worried about just how well we'll develop our youth; Knicks have never had a good track record of that. But if we land KD and Kyrie (which in my expert opinion, I think we will) the drama and coverage will be next level. KD and Kyrie are already a bit much, but the AD trade saga will pile on top, then add James Dolan to the mix, and then put it in the biggest media market in the NBA. It's gonna be a shitshow, but I'm all here for it.  * If we don't get anyone if FA, hopefuls improved play from youth like Knox, Meech, Ntilikina, DSJ and good rookie year from Barrett or whoever. But if we get KD/Kyrie/Kawhi/Kemba, it championship or bust (not really but that's the mentality the FO will have)."
"The craziest thing about that is the fact LeBron James not only lived up to his ridiculous hype, but the fact he surpassed it."
To LeBron James plus with a suspension from Draymond. I just hope KD leaves so the league is a little bit more competitive and we can hope again lol
silver has failed to market the league via online streaming platforms. it has nothing to do with james and changing the entire schedule of western conference games to somehow capitalize on EC viewership seeing more of lebron james is idiotic

I will. Keep enjoying a lifetime of underwhelming basketball with nothing to show for! You also forgot to mention lebron james plays for the lakers and our cap situation is perfectly fine. Plenty of room to sign a big name. Its funny because people really think players choose teams because they are better managed rather than the actual players on the roster. Just remember alex caruso is the reason why yall played golden state in the first round👍
Bah gawd - thats LeBron James music.
Yeah that's basically just posing difference.  Here's a [more neutral picture](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/lebron-james-of-team-lebron-and-giannis-antetokounmpo-of-team-giannis-picture-id1125538448?s=2048x2048). Lebron looks clearly larger even with Giannis standing closer to the camera.
"&gt; I see this take a lot, but it's some pretty serious revisionist history  I disagree. I remember watching those teams. Everyone, even then, was fully aware that it was Lebron James dragging a bunch of role players to the Finals.   In any event, my main point was w/r/t the 2007 team... and my man if you look at that roster and see anything a bad roster getting carried by Lebron you need to get your eyes checked lmfao."
Lebron James got 17.8 ppg on .541 in the finals against the Mavericks. He was 27 year old at the time.
Giannis is not Lebron James.
Lebron James isn't going to play BBall forever and his career will come to a close some day just like it did for MJ... can't rely on one person for TV ratings for your sport.   Let other players shine and maybe you don't have to rely on just ONE guy to carry your sport
"The players are bigger than the league, and that is unique to the NBA in North American team sports. Tom Brady is a huge star, but not in a LeBron James way. The players are the brand, so repressing them would be a terrible business move."
Lebron James
"No, he would have said The Warriors would not have won 3 championships against one of the GOATS, Lebron James, 4-2 4-1 and 4-0 without Wardell Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, and Kevin Durant, along with the great coaches and front office!"
"Honestly, the fact that he has basically built himself a career and massive wealth off of being LeBron James personal mouth piece is ridiculous. He is as far from a legitimate journalist as they come."
The nba has a much larger and way more diverse fan base than the NFL. The NFL doesn't reach anywhere outside the US. All the proof you need is who the most famous athletes in the world are number 1 is Ronaldo who belongs to the biggest sport in the world. number two is LeBron James. No football player makes the list. http://www.businessinsider.com/most-famous-athletes-in-the-world-2018-5

"I doubt it. If players raised legitimate concerns about Obama they wouldn't get crucified for it. I mean most of these people who are defending Trump to the death are the same people who criticized virtually every single thing Obama did so pretending he was somehow protected from criticism is silly. Obama also wasnt openly hostile to athletes like Trump and his administration have been (going after nfl players personally, Lebron James, Steph) so unless its a policy concern I dont see why theyd have a huge issue with him. If they just hated him cuz he was black or some shit then theyd honestly deserve to be tarred and feathered."
"List of all-nba players Steph and the Warriors faced in the 2015 playoffs:  Anthony Davis (1st team all-nba, 2nd team all-defense)  Marc Gasol (1st team all-nba)  James Harden (1st team all-nba, MVP runner-up)  LeBron James (1st team all-nba)  List of all-nba players LeBron/the Cavs played en route to the Finals:  Pau Gasol (2nd team all-nba), who missed 2 crucial games which the Cavs won by a combined 7 points.  That's it.  We really wanna play this game?"
You guys had LeBron fucking James on your roster and couldn't make the playoffs
I’m happy when morons like Lebron James share their uninformed political opinions. It’s just more material for me to use when trying to convince others to not take the opinions of celebrities seriously.
LeBron James surrounded by shooters who can also create their own shot? One of which is Steph Curry   I think they have a shot against the California team
"He won't have any problems at all. Even if he turns out to be God damn awful in college, some team is going to spend a second round pick to get on LeBron's good sides.  If Doc Rivers can get his son drafted, you better fucking believe LeBron James can."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better. You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
You’re forgetting a lot of /r/NBA will do anything to discredit Lebron James and that involves talking down the teams he beat. Doesn’t matter that the Hawks had a winning record against the top 8 (I think even just top 4 IIRC) teams in the West that year.
"It's impossible to react with anything other than sarcasm, because only idiots legitimately think Steph Curry is a better all time player than Lebron James."
"He I has already surpassed Lebron James imo. There have been three key moments in NBA history that forever reshaped the way the game is played:  Those 3 were:  1. The addition of the 3 point line into the NBA  2. Michael Jordan  3. Steph Curry  All 3 of these como,etely reshaped how basketball was played. Curry has almost single handily reshaped how every team is formed in the NBA.   Lebron is a top 50 all time based on pure stats. But when it comes into their impact on the game and how they reshaped the future of basketball, Curry is top 5 all time."

??????????  Do you know who LeBron James is?
Isn’t winning what it’s all about? And what other areas would Lebron James currently have an advantage? Longevity and durability are the only areas I can think of.
&gt; Sam Bowie Even with Darko 2003 is comparable imo.   1. Lebron James 2. Darko Miličić 3. Carmelo Anthony 4. Chris Bosh 5. Dwyane Wade
"He hit the shot of shots and if Kyrie doesn't hit it, Lebron looses. Period. Klay had 1 game where he dominated.  Curry lead the **team** to beat Durant and Westbrook in OKC.   No matter how you slice it, if you want to say ""Curry didn't beat Durant"" then you can't say ""Lebron Beat Curry"".  So either   1.Curry beat Durant and Westbrook but lost to Lebron James and company (Which is literally what happened  2. Curry beat Lebron James the prior year, did NOT beat Durant, But also, did NOT lose to Lebron because Kyrie saved his ass and remains undefeated against Lebron.  I think the first option makes **a lot** more sense than the backwards logic you're trying to produce on the second one."
You know Kawhi isn't LeBron James right? lol...
"&gt;On the surface, the sentiment is unsurprising. Why, after all, would LeBron sign a four-year, $154 million deal at age 34 if he didn't intend to be in Los Angeles for at least a couple seasons? L.A. is also an entertainment hub, and James has not been shy about embracing his flourishing business career outside of basketball."

Bullshit. Green kneed Adams in the nuts in a previous game. Then all out kicked him in the nuts the next game. That should have been a suspension.  The suspension threshold was bullshit. The call on the court was a technical foul. ONLY AFTER THE GAME WAS DONE was it changed to a flagrant because of lobbying by Lebron James. And that only happened AFTER Brian Windhorst showed Lebron the video of the play. Lebron didn't even ask for a flagrant review when it happenned because it was very weak contact if any.
The best player in the nba is lebron james
LeBron - James Jones?
"&gt; They don't run the same way, an NBA coach's role and performance is easily quantified, it's also one of the most prominent roles on the team. You can't compare firing an accountant to firing an NBA coach that is on display for millions night in night out.  Yes, a head coach's job performance is easily quantifiable, and by that measure Luke failed this season, and Magic was blocked from firing him.  This is highly unusual in any sport.    &gt; ...Firing an NBA coach does carry monetary concerns, you still have to pay them and have to hire a new coach.  And losing basketball games also carries monetary concerns. And Luke gained LeBron James yet only managed to win 2 more games than he did the previous year with a team full of rookies and second-year players."
*Lebron James with a rejection !!*
"Turns out Lebron James, Chris Bosh an Dwyane Wade were good players."
Very true actually with a healthy LeBron James and Anthony Davis you might just squeeze past the Clippers if you’re lucky
"LeBron James averaged **22 points, 7 rebounds and 6.8 assists** in the series.  James averaged **17.8 points, 7.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists**.

"First off, flair up if you're gonna sling shit, pussy.   https://www.nba.com/article/2018/07/01/lebron-james-agrees-four-year-deal-los-angeles-lakers  Second, we never did have a chance, but it has nothing to do with not getting a meeting. LeBron didn't meet with any FO's. Magic creeped up on to his lawn in the night, but that doesn't count at as ""meeting"". LeBron had made up his mind to go to LA long before Free Agency even started(could have been years before) so there was no point in any meetings, plus he already knew any team that would have him would give him what he wanted. Obviously it's not a good look for anyone for him to choose LA without any consideration, so numerous sources and reporters said that we were one of three teams in consideration(LA, CLE, and us). LeBron did tour Malvern Prep during the 2018 season, which means he was either in on the ruse, or legitimately covering his bases if LA fell through for some reason. Whether or not we had a chance, we were brought up by pretty much everyone. But after Bron Jr. made his announcement, it was cemented. So fuck you and your meetings nonsense, it had nothing to do with it. We did not have a chance, nobody but LA did, but were still a finalist in the phony LeBron 2018 sweepstakes.   As an epilogue to his decision, LeBron would undoubtedly have been in a better basketball place in Philly with Embiid and whoever he could've gotten for Ben Simmons. The Lakers are a dumpster fire, but I suspect he knew that going in(at least he should have.) So while I like him as a player and a person, I'm hoping he fails professionally in LA. And obviously I hope my team does well."
"James Dolan owns a franchise and does more damage to its players and fans than Steph , Lebron , Tom Brady all combined"

How do you tank the team value by getting Lebron James?
&gt;You're the one saying the Pacers built their team specifically to beat the Heat. So clearly there was something they did to their roster that they wouldn't have if the Heat didn't exist  &gt; &gt;Uhh that is the relative numbers and the Wiz were a top 5 defensive team in the same year you're referencing the Pacers elite defense. And yet they finished with a 29-53 record  I'm talking about what happened. Not some hypothetical what would happen if... Maybe they get LeBron James if the he didn't go to the Heat. There is literally no way to know.   But it's pretty clear giving both David West and Roy Hibbert multi-year deals in 2012 was an effort to challenge the Heat. It's not that difficult of a concept.   &gt;&gt;Uhh that is the relative numbers and the Wiz were a top 5 defensive team in the same year you're referencing the Pacers elite defense. And yet they finished with a 29-53 record   Some random top 5 defense that was a horrible team otherwise has absolutely nothing to do with any of this. This is probably one of your asinine arguments yet and you are pretty good at those.
"Yeah dude I'm not hearing any of that. He played, Kyrie was out after game 1 and kevin didn't play after the celtics series in the Eastern Conference. It's simply not comparable at all. The most important pieces of the Warriors were all there for most of the games. Which simply isn't true at all in 15'. 15' was pretty much Lebron James vs the Warriors."
"I respond with ""LeBron James""."
And they played against LeBron James
That was my second guess since I thought he would have wanted to follow the Lebron James hometown comeback trend. Unfortunately he didn't want to skip the trip to Miami and get his free rings before his homecoming LOL
Literally got KD just for one man. Lebron James.
"you're totally right, im going to go buy a lebron james jersey, then a steph curry jersey then they can both be my favorite player which is convenient because i think they are both going to win the mvp this year.  this discussion did not start with appreciating both, it started with a comparison, now everyone is arguing about different things  im out"
"I saw an article about a year ago that LeBron James was hitting over 50% from the deep 3. It actually credited some Reddit user for noticing.

Remember LeBron’s [rant](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2017/01/lebron-james-charles-barkley-hater-rant-quote-window-cavaliers/amp) about Barkley a couple years ago?

maybe?   why is it specifically a bad thing when the warriors are the super team? imagine if the bulls didn't win 6 rings. would the nba be as popular as it is now without michael jordan?  and then that title got transferred to lebron james as the next anointed one.   problem is that the warriors got in the way. and somehow the wagons haven't circled around the warriors as being 'the next big thing'

He's not going to be in his prime forever.   &gt; I honestly feel bad for the Lakers  I feel bad for Bill Macdonald and Stu Lantz because those two guys are dope.   Aside from that, the Lakers were given an opportunity that 29 other GMs would die for in getting a prime LeBron, coming off one of the greatest playoff runs ever. You don't feel bad for a team that gets a prime LeBron and waste it. That's their royal fuck up. I don't feel bad one bit."
Excuse me?  The LeBron James' reached 8 straight finals.
"That's how I feel. The biggest additions the Bulls made were Ron Harper,Toni Kukok, and Rodman.  Durant is the best player to come into the league since Lebron James. He joined a 73 win squad and coasted for 3 years.   I know grit, that ain't it."
"My rankings right now. I believe players like Lebron and AD (possibly Giannis, Kahwi, Westbrook, etc.) will probably go up next season after proving themselves again  Tier 1:  1. Kevin Durant  2. Steph Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. Lebron James  6. James Harden  Tier 2:  7. Nikola Jokic  8. Joel Embiid  9. Anthony Davis  10. Damian Lillard  11. Kyrie Irving  12. Paul George  Tier 3:   13. Jimmy Butler  14. Russell Westbrook  15. Draymond Green  16. Blake Griffin  17. Chris Paul  18. Klay Thompson  Tier 4:  19. Victor Oladipo  20. Bradley Beal  21. Karl Anthony Towns  22. Lamarcus Aldridge  23. Al Horford  24. Ben Simmons  Tier 5:  25. Rudy Gobert  26. Khris Middleton  27. Jrue Holiday  28. Kemba Walker  29. CJ McCollum  30. DeMar DeRozen  Tier 6:  31. Luka Doncic  32. Mike Conley  33. Tobias Harris  34. Pascal Siakam  35. Nikola Vecevic  36. Devin Booker"
Lebron James has 50 points against us and still didn’t win. That’s Cavs with good role players who are experienced in the playoffs. Lakers aren’t doing anything
So he can play with LeBron James instead of Kyle Lowry
"The obvious members of the top ten players club:   Kawhi Leonard  Giannis  Kevin Durant  Steph  James Harden  Lebron James  Those are the 6 best basketball players on the planet.  There is a drop-off after them to the next tier.    There are lots of players you could argue for to finish out the top ten.  I think Paul George, Dame, Anthony Davis and Embiid are the rest of the top 10.  Kyrie Irving's disastrous two years in have to be counted against him.  If I had to pick a 11th player, it would be Jokic.  He WILL be a top 10 player by next year, he's really good."
1. Stephen Curry 2. Giannis Antekoumpo 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Lebron James 5. James Harden 6. Kevin Durant 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Joel Embiid 9. Draymond Green 10. Anthony Davis
Warriors now 60-17 in playoff games in the last 5 years against teams that did not have LeBron James.  They won all 15 of those series.  I can't be too mad about my team losing to a dynasty like that.
[Lebron James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y_cl3WIO6A)
"Apsolutno. Covjek koji je potpuno podredio svoje brojke za cilj dobijanja titula. U tih 6 godina ima 3 titule i jedno izgubljeno finale, 2 MVP, vjerovatno najbolju ofanzivnu sezonu ikad 15-16, a sve to bez ikakvog forsiranja svoje statistike. Naravno, Lebron James je bolji kosarkas, to nije sporno, ali uticaj na igru Karija je nemjerljiv."
"As an ardent LeBron James fan and Stan, the way that Steph Draymond and Klay move without the ball is nothing short of fucking beauty. They move the ball and pass where the player is supposed to be, not where they are. The motion offense they have is unreal."
"No, LeBron James and Prime KD couldn't beat the Dubs. The fuck do you think?"
"This season has exposed Kyrie as an inefficient iso player with poor playmaking and leadership skills.   When you have Kevin Love and LeBron James on your team, things tend to be a little easier."
"for sure, but we would at least avoid the embarassment of not making the playoffs with lebron fucking james"
The Warriors just swept two GOATs in two straight years: LeBron James and Meyers Leonard
They lost because LeBron James and Co went HAM. I do not see that happening ever again
"DRAYMOND ""LEBRON JAMES"" GREEN"
Yea.. And hope Steph Curry has a heart attack and 2016 LeBron James gets traded to their team overnight.
"MEYERS ""LEBRON JAMES"" LEONARD"
its funny because [Rihanna loves LeBron too](https://theundefeated.com/features/lebron-james-rihanna/)

He would be playing with Lebron James you mean
"davis needs a better group of people around him, rich paul  impact has only made things worse for AD, he didnt get traded at the deadline and was limited to just 30 min a game, all while the impact of the trade rumor affecting rich's other client, lebron james, who's team's chemistry got destroyed with all the trade rumors. I would trust david griffin over rich paul at this point if im AD and want to ensure my best chances of making the best legacy possible."
"he's the GOAT. And I mean that. GOAT. Basketball is comprised of several skillsets. They are: Shooting, Passing, Rebounding, Defense, Clutch, Leadership, Hustle. Name one player who was better at the combination of all these things. Jordan? He wasn't a better shooter, passer or rebounder. Lebron? He wasn't a better shooter, rebounder, or clutch. Magic? He wasn't a better shooter, rebounder, defense, or clutch. There's simply never been a better basketball player than Larry Bird.   &amp;#x200B;  Let me ask you this. If LeBron James had Larry Bird's body and athleticism...would he be in the GOAT conversation. MJ? Nope. The answer is a resounding no. In the toughest era in basketball history, the best decade with the best players...Larry Bird was top 3 in MVP voting for 8 straight years. And he only stopped because of his back. He won 3 straight MVPs with Magic, Isiah, Dr. J, Malone, Olajuwon, Kareem, and MJ all in the league.  &amp;#x200B;  Yet, laughably, he's never mentioned as a top 5, top 3, or even GOAT...and it makes no sense. MJ? I can understand that. He was truly unbelievable and if you factor in defense you can make a compelling argument that he was the GOAT. But he didn't dominate and win championships until well after Thomas, Dr. J, and Larry, Kareem and Magic aged . Lebron? lol. He's just blessed with superior size/athleticism aided by PEDs and a watered down league. No clutch, leadership, rebounding, and shooting in comparison to Bird."
1) The Lakers have won 11 Championships without Magic Johnson  2) The Celtics have won 14 Championships without Larry Bird.  3) The Bulls have not won a Championship without Michael Jordan.  4) The Miami Heat have won 1 Championship without LeBron James.
&gt;An individual players defense isn’t very valuable compared to offense.  Lol. Tell that to Giannis and the Bucks. Offense isn’t why the Raptors are in the Finals.   Also this: https://youtu.be/7bFx-urmQDY  If you don’t know that’s LeBron James. One of the greatest players of all time.
Come on. No one is that Dumb. I have Lebron James for 3 more years so I sign a declining injury prone guard for max money...
"Oh I completely agree with you, Lebron was an absolute animal on defense in his early days.   I just wanted to point out that the criticism he receives is often exaggerated, well because he’s Lebron James."
are we really arguing this? Whats more likely? LeBron staying at or near his level for the next 2-3 seasons or Zion becoming Lebron fuckin James? cant believe morons actually upvoted this lol
"As a Dubs fan you'd be at the very least foolish not to realize just how phenomenal a player LeBron James is after he orchestrated that historic Finals victory in 2016. You can hate him for it, hell a small part of me even resents our own guys for that collapse, but to NOT admit just how amazing a player James is is crazy. Even going up 2-1 against us in 2015 when practically on his own offensively...that in itself was impressive enough.   You ask me about LeBron, the only thing that pops into my mind is the Anchorman vs Vince Vaughn meme."
LeBron James Dean
Kawhi is not that much worse an individual player than LeBron James
His boss is Lebron James.  Not Pelinka.
"Just curious, Jordan had praised Kobe and even Westbrook before, but has he ever said anything nice or praise about LeBron James?"
"Well the thing is, the agent is just a vessel for his client, aka LeBron James.  Silver said he's considering having earlier Western Conference games so that more people can watch LeBron James.  He never considered that concession for KD, Steph, Harden, etc.  LeBron is a different type of player lol"
"&gt;Especially not at a net loss for the Rockets, but for the sake of the thread: James Harden for LeBron James straight up.  Dear god, please no."
"[LeBron James, bringing up Kareem, has entered the chat]"
"Jalen Rose : ""LA is in great position, they have LeBron James, they have good young assets.""   Lmaoo"
" &gt;I mean Kawhi clearly slowed LeBron down. Most of points came against other defenders.  Well yeah. That's smart strategy. Just like LeBron didn't try forcing it against Draymond in all their finals matchups.   &gt;Kawhi was holding LeBron to fewer shots, fewer touches, less drives, and straight up locking him down for critical stretches. &gt; &gt;http://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/91407/kawhi-leonard-wreaking-havoc-on-lebron &gt; &gt;&gt; Only 17 percent of LeBron’s touches against Leonard in the Finals resulted in a field goal attempt. That’s half the rate James had against all other defenders.  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Leonard has been successful keeping the ball out of LeBron’s hands. James was held without a touch on 35 percent of the Heat’s possessions when he wass guarded by Leonard. Against all other defenders he was held without a touch 25 percent of the time. &gt; &gt;&gt; James drove to the basket on 13 percent of his touches against Leonard. That rate jumped to 22 percent against all other defenders.  &gt; &gt;Kawhi held LeBron to 8 points and 7 turnovers over the last 3 quarters of Game 3, he didn't allow Lebron to score a single point on him in the entire first half of Game 4, and then held LeBron to 1-6 shooting against him in Game 5   I'm not denying Kawhi did a great job defending him but this video is just a bullshit exaggeration. ""LeBron didn't know what to do"" like what the fuck...?   And also I have to say these ""when guarded by Kawhi LeBron did this and that"" stats are always super dependent on what happens around the primary defender.   Those two plays I mentioned would go down as great defensive plays from Kawhi when the reality is Duncan had far more to do with LeBron missing the shots than Kawhi did.    No doubt he played great defense and there is a reason he won FMVP but these super cherry picked videos with wrong descriptions don't support that case at all."
No? I didn't think he was childish last year. AD asked for a trade **2 years** before the contract he signed ran out. He did so right after signing with an agent heavily associated with LeBron James and just so happened to want to get traded to LeBron's team
"My theory is LeBron's three children will each be successful in different lines of work, using the three traits that make LeBron who he is:  Bronny is going to be a great NBA player and carry his father's legacy in the NBA.  Bryce will successfully run and eventually take over the family businesses and the LeBron James foundation.  And Zhuri will use the charisma, humor, and personality that LeBron passed on to go on to become an entertainment icon as an actress/comedian/all-around performer."
You think free agents going to make decisions after reading r/nba or after sitting down face to face with Lebron James?
"&gt; This Kawhi circle jerk about 2014 isso tiring.  I mean Kawhi clearly slowed LeBron down. Most of points came against other defenders.

The only multi year contract they have signed is rookies and Lebron James and have gotten rid of every long term contract they’ve had. Don’t give me that BS that you can’t say anything about how they’re run.

"BUYING:  * Michael Porter (people just seem to forgot he existed and really just how good is he when he's not injured) * Ben Simmons once he gets on his on roster built for him (whether that's in Philly or elsewhere) * LeBron James (the man who made 8 straight Finals is not going to miss 2 NBA playoffs in a row) * Klay Thompson (especially if Durant and Boogie leave, Klay will likely go back to his old self) * Kyrie Irving (he's already hit a dagger three in game 7 of the Finals at such an early stage of his career, I'm willing to bet that he'll get back there very soon) * Karl Anthony Towns (did everyone just forget he's like one of the best young players in the world? That whole Butler thing tanked his stock because NBA purist thought he was soft, but he is very talented and will probably end up being an MVP candidate in a couple of years time)  &amp;#x200B;  SELLING:  * Mike Conley (if he gets traded he'll likely end up as a complimentary piece on a really good team, no longer the star of a bad one, I could see Conley being the 4th option on a Finals contender) * Kyle Lowry (great play in the playoffs so far, but how long till he falls back to earth? If Kawhi leaves, he'll become an afterthought in nba circles, outside of Canada)"
"Are you dense? I'm saying if you want to bring up the ""talent is better now argument"", then you need to factor in that the average role player on Lebron's team now would be better than the average role player on Jordan's team back then. OR you would need to show why that isn't the case.   But you can't assume that his competetion is better because talent is increased, and at the same time argue that he had less talented teammates, unless you factor in/show why that is the case.  And you're still deflecting away from my response to your claim that LeBron won less because he faced better teams.  Even when you factor in the better teams he faced, Jordan still won more rings than expected compared to Lebron.  538 calculated how many rings players were expected to win based on their competition, and found that Jordan outperformed his expectation more than LeBron did  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-should-lebrons-finals-record-hurt-his-legacy/  &gt; In fact, if you add up the pre-series odds in the table above, you get an expected championship count of 2.8 for James — meaning he’s somehow running 0.2 titles above expectation, despite his record. That trails Jordan (who won 1.9 times more than we’d expect from the pre-series odds"
"&gt; Silver also addressed a lunch conversation he had with LeBron James' agent, Rich Paul, which ESPN's Baxter Holmes reported on Tuesday.  &gt; ""He was in the same restaurant,"" Silver said. ""There were two people sitting there. He sat down for a second, and I think he said something along the lines that 'Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.'  &gt; ""My reaction was to shrug my shoulders and maybe say, 'Well, who do you think is the right guy to coach?' **And he mentioned a name and that was that. I think as commissioner, I don't want to shut people off who have a point of view.""**  Goddamn Rich Paul really thinks he runs the Lakers lmao"
"narrator: *money, power and fame. it exposes peoples true personalities. their darkest desires.*   lebron james: *“TTAAAACCCCCOOOOO TUUUUESSDAAYYYYYYYYY”*"
"Man I don't buy this argument, what has Lebron James ever done in his entire life that wasn't a basketball decision? This take doesn't add up.  He wants to win. The Lakers are making space for other stars. He believes in himself and he has always said he wants to be the greatest. Lebron did not quit on basketball before his prime ended. He's still the best player on Earth."
"[Early season reports on national ratings said it was for that reason.](https://nypost.com/2019/01/17/lebron-james-lakers-move-is-crippling-the-nbas-tv-ratings/) Adam Silver also just [said it was:](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/adam-silver-lebron-james-missing-playoffs-clearly-impacted-ratings/)  &gt; “Fifty percent of television households in this country are in the Eastern time zone,” Silver said. “And so if your West Coast games start at 10:30 at night in the East, you’re invariably going to lose a lot of viewers around 11, 11:30. I mean, you can just chart it. You see how many television households turn off around 11:15, 11:30 at night, just because people have to get up for work in the morning.  &gt; “I mean, it is something we can address. We’re talking about it. I mean, it would obviously be less convenient to those fans on the West Coast if we played even earlier. I mean, just think about people getting to those arenas after work if you start a game at 6 p.m. local time in the West. It’s not the most convenient thing. It’s not as convenient for a television watcher on the West Coast, either. But when you look at the league from a national standpoint, it may make sense to play a little bit earlier in the West. And that’s something we’re going to talk to our teams about this summer.”"
"I mean, ""they"" is a big generalization.  There have been 45 players who went straight from high school to the pros -- some pretty great ones in fact (Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Dwight Howard, and Stoudemire especially come to mind.  Do you think it would have mattered that much if Zion didn't do one year at Duke? There's definitely junior/senior prospects out there who would be able to compete at a respectable level in the summer league.  The only reason there haven't been more is because of the rules which prevent it."

LeBron James has left the room
Hot Take  Tomorrow will be the first NBA Finals game without Lebron James since June 17th 2010
"He also put CJ Miles on Kevin Love *six* possessions in a row, and also tried him guarding *LeBron James*.  He's never been a good basketball coach."
"From 2003-2005, Darko Miličić had more Finals minutes and wins than LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, and Dwyane Wade combined."
You have activated my trap card! Zone defense! This allows my defensive anchor to block all your attempts to the basket without leaving anyone open. Your Lebron James is useless against me!
"&gt;And then telling a staffer that she would be fired if she made one more mistake.  I don't actually see the problem with that quote at all. There is nothing wrong with that quote at all, if you are in a high pressure job, you are going to be in high pressure situations and you're going to deal with other people in high pressure situations.  She is a grown woman, she doesn't have to be babied and if she does she shouldn't be in the job.  &gt;As the boss, you really don't have to be in the office for a lot of time to foster a hostile work environment. I'm not sure if you're young and inexperienced or just fortunate enough, but in a lot of workplaces we talk about ""seagull managers"" who fly in, shit on everything, and then just leave.  But that clearly isn't the case? He recruited Lebron James, was having a great season before injuries hit the team. His style of managing was working.  &gt;A boss who never shows up and purely criticizes what people do is actually a lot harder to deal with than a hard-ass that puts in the hours because it's easy to feel like they're just throwing out threats to fire people at random, as opposed to someone who is strict but is giving out fair criticism after carefully observing what people do.  Again what makes you think he was ""purely criticising"" everything? It's not a black or white situation like you're trying to make out.  &gt;Magic was the boss. If he was being undermined, it's partly because he didn't have enough control over the organization he was supposed to be leading. Nobody forced Magic to let Lopez walk, sign a bunch of basketcases and then go brag to the media about how he surrounded LeBron with playmakers. Even by his own account, the undermining didn't really start until he was pretty deep into a hole that he dug himself.  This is just unfair and ridiculous. Being undermined doesn't come down to you, he wasn't meant to be leading the organisation that's Jeanie's job, he was meant to be leading Basketball operations and was not allowed to do that, how in the world is that his fault? Should he just start ignoring what the owner says to him?  The Lakers were 4th in the west at one point with a great record, trying to paint a narrative that they had a horrible season throughout is completely disingenuous. They got hit by inuries to key players and couldn't find rhythm again. The undermining started the second the owner stepped in and stopped him firing the coach."
"It's good. I think it will help keep those kids humble/grounded, or at least as much as one can be being LeBron James' kid."
HuffPost: LeBron James’ “Taco Tuesday” video is a problematic misrepresentation of the Latino community
"Because I enjoy watching all time great basketball player, and lebron James is a top 2 player all time"
"&gt;The Bulls were excellent they swept the Heat in the regular season and had the MVP they had tons of hype in their favor going into that series with the Heat. They were the best defensive team in the league in fact the top 5 defenses teams that year were all in the East.  It’s not entirely uncommon for the east to have “good” defensive teams. Some of that has to do with them playing other east teams with weak offenses.   Obviously it’s conjecture, but I believe that matchup would have been pretty bad for Lebrons legacy, regardless of whether they won or not.  In other situations, we saw Kobe make it a point to go directly at Lebron, and for Lebron to avoid that competition and confrontation.    Around that time period, we saw Lebron avoid The Kobe confrontation in an all star game, I could only imagine what it would have been on that stage in the finals. Kobe also wasn’t shy about letting everyone know who was backing down.    &gt;The Heat underperformed though in relation to their expectations not to their talent though. They had two top 5 players. That's like the late 90s and 2000s Lakers with Shaq and Kobe. They were like that.  As good as Kobe was during some of that run, I’m not sure he was that guy yet.  I’ll put the Bosh thing aside, but we clearly disagree on what his impact should have been, and how good he was.   With all that said, Kobe and Shaq were pretty dominate. They had one team they routinely had issues with, and that team was the 2nd best in the league. (Kings)  They tried the super team route with Gary and Karl and it didn’t work out. They underperformed massively.   That’s where I’d compare them most to the Heat. The lakers losing with that team was a shame, and the fault of Kobe and Shaq. (Kobe has taken blame for it, and I’d agree) Even had the lakers won, they were not what they should have been, like the Heat.   &lt;This is where we disagree. The Heat had more talent than the Mavs for sure, but not their other competitors like OKC.  I’ll agree we disagree. I believe you’d have to be basing that on what those players have become, not what they were. The only player in their prime on that team was probably Ibaka. The rest just were not there yet.   &gt;I don't think you would pick any 2 guard in the league over Klay. Who would the Warriors pick?  This actually gets a bit tricky. There are better sg’s in the league, but that doesn’t mean they’re a better fit for the warriors specifically. As a I said before, the beauty of the warriors isn’t just their individual talent, but their fit with the team.    &gt;Klay is arguably the best shooting guard in the nba right now/these past few seasons.  The quick easy answer in James Harden. I don’t believe he would mesh well with the warriors, but he’s clearly a better sg.   The guy who might beat Klay as a fit, and as a player is probably Donovan Mitchel. He’s good defensively, and much better on ball. The warriors already have the elite shooters, so mitchel could bring an entirely different element. He’s strong where Klay is weak, and decent where Klay is strong.   You also have McCollum, Jimmy Butler and derozan in that conversation.   Klay is fairly weak on the dribble, and few teams have the luxury of having a sg that has trouble creating their own shot. The warriors just happen to be such a team.   However, the point you made before was arguing Bosh vs all positions, not just the same position.   I think Draymond is a great player and fit for that team, but there are clearly better players on paper.   &gt;I watched a lot of Laker games this year and in the first half of the year it was very exciting and tense basketball. It's because of the expectation to win so much and I suspect that's why you might get let down by Lebron super teams. You can just expect so much. We all do. Even now everyone expects so much of a team led by a 35 year old Lebron James.  In my life, I’ve been pretty spoiled with sports teams. I grew up a lakers and 49er fan, so I happened to witness some of the greatest talent the sports have ever seen. They were not just great, but had a swagger or style that made it fun to watch.   When Kobe had those bad lakers teams, there was little hope of getting anywhere, but it was fun as well to watch. He’s was a must watch athlete. Same goes for a guy like Iverson, or falcons Michael Vick. You didn’t expect them to win, but you had to watch.   Lebron is one of the more boring mega stars ever, even when he’s winning. He has no flair, and runs pick and roll, to a kick type basketball.   He does the “smart” thing often by switch mismatched defenders on him, and then freight trains to the hoop.   Again, to be fair though, I was spoiled by having super entertaining guys on my teams."
"/r/mademesmile material. Makes you almost forget that this is LeBron James and not just another corny , making his kids cringe , wholesome dad."
Yeah I agree it would be odd if a normal man his age was doing that but it’s LeBron James so I doubt anyone cares.
"You know who else didn't go to business school? Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady."
"Honestly if you were to write LeBron James as a character in a story everyone would just think this person is just too good to be realistic. The worlds greatest basketball player, all around family man and a guy who generally help the less fortunate just sounds like something a kid would make up when thinking of an alter ego for a super hero.   It’s like 10 year old LeBron wrote this story of adult LeBron and he just grew up and became the kind of person he always needed in his life."
"Someone that big, ripped and drinking whatever he’s drinking doing that would immediately ring alarm bells that that person was a very rich athlete. Doubt anyone cares since they probably already know its Lebron James"
"I think Lakers vs Cleveland was what we deserved. A proper kobe vs lebron matchup.

They clearly outclassed everyone talent wise, especially the Mavs.  This is where we disagree. The Heat had more talent than the Mavs for sure, but not their other competitors like OKC.  I watched a lot of Laker games this year and in the first half of the year it was very exciting and tense basketball. It's because of the expectation to win so much and I suspect that's why you might get let down by Lebron super teams. You can just expect so much. We all do. Even now everyone expects so much of a team led by a 35 year old Lebron James."
"Terry torched Lebron for sure. But that doesn't mean lbj played bad defense you can play good defense and be torched. Terry has said he couldn't even see the basket over James and still just somehow managed to make many of his shots.  Well obviously in the case of someone like West we would have to use FG% to compare.   Era does not matter for the greatest players of all time though they be great in any era they would dominate any era they would be great at basketball regardless of 'era' that's why they are the top players in the first place they're great basketball players with few weaknesses.  It's obvious era doesn't matter one reason why is because the top players have their own unique playstyles and refuse to change them. Kawhi, Lebron, Kd for instance still shoot mostly 2s despite this 3 point 'era'. Shaq wouldn't be shooting 3s in this era he would be dunking on people and playing style. Giannis would be trying to get to the rim regardless of 'era'. Kobe was taking fadeaway long 2s even in all-star games he would never change.  Top players like MJ has better stats/efficiency than the stars who came after him regardless of 'era'. He would do the exact same thing play the exact same way regardless of era because he would play the way he wants to play and stick to his guns. He would be the same guy, same personality etc. He didn't give in to the pressure to pass more back in the 90s even when he wasn't winning championships. He stuck to his style of play and proved high volume scorers could win. He wouldn't cave to different era pressures to be more efficient or shoot more 3s. He's do it his way.  Lebron has had stacked teams. Just saying Jordan did too. The standard for what a superteam is just wasn't as high then. Now even a big 3 isn't enough with the Warriors 4 (technically 5)."
"Every single god damn casual basketball fan of any age: ""Brook Lopez is the perfect complimentary player to Lebron James.""  Lakers front office paid millions: ""Release him, but only after we trade an allstar to acquire him."""
"I didn't day Jordan had less help than Lebron.   What I'm saying is that if you're going to argue there is more competition now because the average player is better, you have to factor in that a players average teammate will be better than a teammate from a past era too.  &gt; Lebron faced better teams throughout his career.  Even when you factor in the better teams he faced, Jordan still won more rings than expected compared to Lebron.   538 calculated how many rings players were expected to win based on their competition, and found that Jordan outperformed his expectation more than LeBron did  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-should-lebrons-finals-record-hurt-his-legacy/  &gt; In fact, if you add up the pre-series odds in the table above, you get an expected championship count of 2.8 for James — meaning he’s somehow running 0.2 titles above expectation, despite his record. That trails Jordan (who won 1.9 times more than we’d expect from the pre-series odds"
"&gt; 4. And pay attention because this is the important one. **Lebron James did not join the team that beat him the previous playoffs**.   I’ll type it one more time just in case you didn’t understand.  **Lebron James did not join the team that beat him the previous playoffs**.  You ever hear the expression “can’t beat em, join em”? That’s what KD did.  If you can provide a logical argument to this I will delete my account. Go on, explain to me how **joining the team that beats you** makes you a competitive player."
"[Woj] LeBron James has apologized for insensitive video mocking Mexican-Americans, league sources tell ESPN."
I remember vividly in his first few games for the Nets and he did atleast 2-3 dunks where he did the (what is now a Lebron James signature....you know the one) dunk where he pulls the ball all the way back as far as he can before slamming it down. I was like wtf weren't you bitching about conserving your joints last season?
LeBron James
"Lakers are pretty easy to sum up.  Jeannie Buss - trustfund kid, good with business but in over her head running an NBA Franchise from a basketball standpoint.  Magic Johnson - popular iconic legendary player from a glory era, but in over his head being in charge of an NBA front office.  Rob Pelinka - NBA agent with a good relationship with NBA players and other agents, but in over his head as a General Manager of an NBA franchise.  LeBron James - all time NBA legend who is one of the best to ever play the game and still a very top player but getting older and may not be able to singlehandedly carry a Franchise like he once was.   Lakers Young Core - Overrated, not able to live up to the lofty expectations heaped upon them. The other stuff above could probably all have gone on without much notice if it weren't for this fact."
"Im not saying fair in terms of morality. Saying fair as in fair usage or its ok to do so in this instance. Lebrons endorsements are either Lebron James, James, King James."
"Max Kellerman: Lebron eating tacos on the Tuesday before the Finals shows the disarray of Lakers management and demonstrates why James Harden is the best player ever to play basketball. Kobe Bryant has single handedly destroyed the organization, or else Lebron would be eating spaghetti!"
"Yes, 3 kids. Lebron James Jr. , Bryce Maximus James and Zhuri James"
"Damian Lillard, Klay Thompson, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Rudy Gobert... or maybe Anthony Davis and KAT instead of Durant and Gobert."
"This must be why Kobe is the only good defender with below average advanced defensive stats, while Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Ben Wallace, Bill Walton, Hakeem Olujawon, Kareem Abdul-Jabaar, Kevin Garnett, Rudy Gobert, Dikembe Mutombo, Dwight Howard, Kawhi Leonard, Alonzo Mourning, Joakim Noah, Draymond Green, Shaquille O'neal, Manu Ginobili, Paul George, Jason Kidd, Shawn Marion, Scottie Pippen, Tyson Chandler, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Paul Pierce, Ron Artest, Giannis Antekoumpo, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Al Horford, Tracy McGrady, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, etc. all show up well in the advanced defensive stats."
"Skip Bayless: LeBron James only had soft tacos with his family because that’s what he is! I’m sorry. He is the softest, most over protected star in the NBA. I hope he prays to Ray Allen before dinner for saving his legacy against my Spurs in 2013!"

"&gt;Oh ok. I think it makes more sense to go through the Heat's competition year by year. OKC was a threat in 2012 they weren't ready in 2011. In 2011, LA, Boston and Chicago was their competition according to the analysts and fans from the beginning of the season. Of these teams Chicago was the real threat to Miami because of their offensive and defensive talent, and ofc Dallas surprised everyone.  Maybe. I think people hoped Chicago would be better than they were. The safe choice for competition for Miami was Boston and Orlando, who made the finals the year before.   To be fair though, none of those teams from the east really had much of a prayer.   A big part of me is still sad we didn’t get to see a Heat vs Lakers finals, as I believe it would be possibly the most entertaining matchup ever. Win or not, we know Kobe would have fought.   &gt;Talent for talent Miami was unfairly talented compared to LA I agree, but it was top heavy. It was James and Wade vs Kobe 'alone' which would be unfair. But Gasol is as good (technically better) than Bosh. And then Bynum would murder Haslem/Joel Anthony on the glass he was a huge part of LA's run and why they couldn't win in 2008 because of his injury.  Right. Miami was “unfairly” talented over LA on paper. But also, LA was clearly more talented than anyone else as well.   On paper, or in a video game type setting, that Miami team was crazy in its time.   One of my big points of contention with people is they underestimate how much that heat team underperformed, even their own expectations.  At the time, there were actually debates on tv as to whether they could go undefeated. When Lebron did his “not 6, not 7” speech, no one was really calling bullshit. It seemed like it could be the likely outcome.   The league was competitive because the heat underperformed, showing us they were not as good as what we thought they could be. Not a huge deal, it’s happen plenty of times with other teams.   &gt;In 2012, Boston and OKC were ready to compete with Miami.  I agree they were ready to compete. The heat had already shown they were not as good as their individual parts.   &gt;In 2013 and 2014, the Spurs and Pacers had the talent on both ends.  Sure, but again those teams played better as teams. They didn’t have more pure talent.   &gt;If they had their choice of any player in the league instead of Bosh, there would have been a ton of players they would take over him. Kobe, Durant, CP3, Rose, Dirk, Garnett etc. Comparing Bosh to other forwards is generous. Compare him to other top players and he doesn't sniff their class.  Well since you brought them up, the same exact thing can be said of Klay and Draymond on this Warriors team. There are a bunch of players they’d pick over those two. Hell, there’s even players at their same position.   The difference between these warriors, and those heat teams, is these warriors do a much better job of playing together. Even in games where some warriors players fall off offensively, they figure out other ways to help the team.   You could have given that Heat team an additional all world talent, and they almost certainly wouldn’t play as well as these warriors. The style of game that Lebron plays isn’t helped much by another all star.  &gt;The Mavs deserved to be in the finals I'm not sure why you're implying they didn't. They beat everyone in the West. The Heat's path was not easy in 2011 they went through Boston and Chicago before meeting the best team in the West. The Heat were the favorites for that finals Lebron just had problems with Dallas (he had problems against them in the regular season too).  I wasn’t suggesting the Mavs didn’t deserve to be in the finals. They did what they were suppose to without any controversy. I actually followed that team fairly closely because a kid I knew, and went to school with played for them.   With that said, the Mavs clearly didn’t win that year because they were the most talented team. They played well together and took advantage of opportunities as they arose.   The heat didn’t wind up having an “easy road” because they didn’t play very well as a group. They clearly outclassed everyone talent wise, especially the Mavs.  ————  On a side note, I’m the kind of guy who should really like Lebron. In sports, what I like most is seeing the most talented players doing amazing things.   I wasn’t someone who was upset at all with the heats formation. I thought it was awesome that such a superteam would be playing. As a laker fan, I also loved the idea of seeing Kobe try to combat that, as I believed it would bring the best out of him.   However, I’ve always been let down by Lebron super teams. Whenever I watch them, they seem underwhelming, and largely boring when compared to expectation.   Similar to this year in LA. I tuned into some games and it was as boring as I’ve ever seen the lakers."
"&gt; Obviously without Lebron it went to shit because the whole system relied on a Lebron-like presence there.  The discussion revolves around the talent that exists on their respective teams. KD's Thunder team was much more talented than Lebron's Cavalier team, and thus the argument used for Lebron (which I'm not 100% sold on, but the stats do support), where his team was not good enough to win a championship cannot be used for KD's team. Fact of the matter is that the Thunder with KD **definitely** qualify as a contending team and would've continued to have a legitimate shot at winning the Larry O'Brien, except KD left the team.  &gt; Sam Presti is the dude who traded away James Harden, maybe if he didn't do that then KD wouldn't have felt compelled to leave.  I don't disagree that the wrong player was signed and the wrong player was traded between Russ, KD, and Harden (would've traded Russ and kept Harden) - but that does not justify KD's decision as a *not* bitch-ass move.  Rarely are roster moves entirely perfect. But the roster put together by Sam Presti was good enough to win, and KD had his own failings on making it happen. Using the same arguments that were used by Lebron fall flat because they are different situations and the team KD left was **ALOT** stronger than the team Lebron left - and their records show it."
"Well the Cavs were completely built around LeBron with good three point shooting, rebounding and defense. Obviously without LeBron it went to shit because the whole system relied on a LeBron-like presence there.   Sam Presti is the dude who traded away James Harden, maybe if he didn't do then KD wouldn't have felt compelled to leave."
"Man you're forgetting that LeBron's teams won 66 and 61 games the two years before he left. And you're hyping up that Boston Three Party to absurd heights. They were a 50 win team in 2010. Their one and only championship occurred in 2008. The respective ages in 2010 offseason were: Ray Allen - 35, Kevin Garnett - 34, Paul Pierce - 33. That you've built up a narrative that LeBron James to gather up whatever allies he could scourge because his 66/61 win team was trash in order to defeat the Big Bad Celtics is an act of revionist history. At the rally, they did not declare ""oh man, hopefully now we have a shot of finally taking down those guys..."" but rather declared ""it's gonna be easy"" and started counting off their Championships before ever playing a game together.   Both LeBron and KD bailed after the teams that drafted them failed to win a Championship, they both chose the path most likely to secure rings. The circumstances were not exactly the same given the Warriors were an already built team that added KD on top and gladly sacrificed their bench to do so whereas LeBron joined Dwayne Wade and Pat Riley and they added another Top 15 NBA player in Chris Bosh on top of it to form a three superstars in their prime superteam the likes of which had not been seen before (No, Boston was not a ""superteam"", they acquired two additional 30-something aging stars through Trades, not Free Agency, from rebuilding teams by trading a bunch of young players and futures that they acquired over the years, to add onto their 30-something aging star.)"
"Again - you're trying to bridge the two and equate them, but beyond each being a superstar leaving his original team in free agency, the two are not very similar at all.  Sports are very much about narrative. Lebron having no help. Lebron vs the Big Three. Lebron wanting to win a ring. LBJ's decision to leave definitely shook up how the NBA viewed superstars and their agency in picking their supporting cast, but if you refer back to the three narratives, Lebron was still against his adversaries. He was recruiting allies in his quest to beat the eternal enemy (dramatic for dramatic's sake).  Was he wrong to leave his teammates and give up on winning with that roster? I could definitely see an argument for it. I mean, my goodness, he got to the Finals with stalwarts like *Drew Gooden* and *Zydrunas Ilgauskas* defending the Cavalier paint whilst **clear** HOF shooters like *Daniel Gibson* and *Donyell Marshall* anchored his wings.  Honestly, the more I see it, Kevin Durant was the **real** victim here. Dude got to the Finals in 2012 carrying scrubs like James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Derek Fisher, and Kendrick Perkins. With that cast? No way he could win against Lebron, absolutely zero chance of winning with those cats. Don't even get me started with 2016, he may have had the GOAT Kyle Singler on his team, but the rest of that cast? Russell ""Noah's dad"" Westbrook, Steven ""ball'less"" Adams, Enes Kanter, Andre Roberson, Serge ""just a chef"" *fuckin'* Ibaka - talk about *LUDICROUS* to imagine Kevin Durant winning anything with that team. They probably struggled to break .500 and were bounced early by the Spurs or something...  Oh wait, they crushed Dallas in Round 1, defeated the 67-15 Spurs in 6, and were 3-1 up against the Warriors before losing 3 straight, with KD going 12-31, 10-31, and an admittedly respectable 10-19 in Games 5, 6, and 7 respectively (Russ did have a stinker going 7-21 in Game 7).   I'm going to take off the mask and say definitively - no, KD's situation was not like Lebron's. KD's situation cannot be classified as no help. KD's situation cannot be classified as repeatedly failing against a bigger, better, and stronger team - OKC had faced the Warriors **once**, and had a 3-1 series lead. KD bailed at the first sign of adversity, which explains his insecurity. There could be a serious argument for OKC having enough pieces to win the chip (and good management to bring better pieces if need be), KD's decision was very soft and nobody can or should respect it.   The closest situation to Kevin Durant's case is Lebron James' decision, but that does not mean they are indeed close, just that Kevin Durant's is so absolutely outlandish that nothing else comes close. I'm not a Thunder fan and I thoroughly enjoy roasting Russell Westbrook's selfish play, and I still get extremely riled up thinking of Kevin Durant's move. It was a straight up bitch-ass move and he deserves every bit of calling out for it."
"« I know basketball is pretty popular in France »  There are fans, but NBA is nowhere near what is in the USA in terms of popularity in France.  I showed LeBron James to my dad on TV last year, and he had never heared his name before"

"&gt; The NBA as a whole is much deeper with talent nowadays than ever before.   Which means that while players might face more competition, they would also have more help.  &gt; Lebron went against tougher competition and probably played some part in him not winning as many titles.  Jordan's opponents had a higher average win % in every round of the playoffs (including the finals).  And 538 calculated how many rings players were expected to win based on their competition, and found that Jordan outperformed his expectation more than LeBron did  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-should-lebrons-finals-record-hurt-his-legacy/  &gt; In fact, if you add up the pre-series odds in the table above, you get an expected championship count of 2.8 for James — meaning he’s somehow running 0.2 titles above expectation, despite his record.

"Derrick Rose, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnet"
"If we're just looking starting lineups, it wouldn't be close. Nobody on '96 could pretend to guard Lebron except Jermaine, and that frees up Bosh to score 50. (Well, pick your poison. Between Bosh and James you'd have 75 or so.)"
"Ah, there it is. The classic “but LeBron did it first”. I’ll explain the differences for you.  1. Neither Wade nor Bosh were superstars at the time of LeBron joining  2. LeBron joined a 40-something (can’t remember exactly how many) win team. 5th seed, and lost in the first round. KD joined a 73-win team that was a single win away from the championship. Miami needed LeBron. The Warriors didn’t need KD. They just needed him not to be on OKC.  3. KD left a very good OKC team that was at minimum a conference finals team. LeBron left a horrible cavs team. I’m not suggesting KD *had* to stay with OKC. He could have joined literally any other team and he would have been fine. But its definitely a much more viable option than LeBron staying with the cavs.   4. And pay attention because this is the important one. **Lebron James did not join the team that beat him the previous playoffs**.   I’ll type it one more time just in case you didn’t understand.  **Lebron James did not join the team that beat him the previous playoffs**.  You ever hear the expression “can’t beat em, join em”? That’s what KD did.  Now tell me, are those enough differences for you? I can list some more if you’d like but I think I’ve made the point pretty clear.  &gt;not KD’s fault he just did it better  It actually is his fault. Who’s else fault would it be? Mine? Yours? Lol “can’t blame someone for their own actions that they consciously acted upon”. Excellent logic."
"Carmelo Anthony, Chris bosh, LeBron James, Derrick Rose. Welcome to the Chicago bulls era"
"I'm with you. I don't feel as if he impacts the game as much as a LeBron, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden, a Giannis or a Kawhi. I've never felt this way but the media has parroted the top 5 or even best player in the league narrative for a while now."
And then LeBron James came back and the team still sucked. No more excuses.
"Lmao and when Lebron came back they still continued to shit the bed. We swept Golden State in the regular season series, that doesn't mean shit. Give me a break, you guys have a bunch of absolute pylons and Lebron James supported by the biggest disaster of a front office in NBA history."
"It could be an Eastern opponent thing too, in years past Lebron had enough fans, supporters, and casuals vested in seeing him possibly take down the Warriors. The Cavs created hype by running through some teams or having great series with others.    If the fans don’t feel that way this year, it could be they don’t know enough about the Raptors. I’m a dedicated fan so I know otherwise, but this could be the thinking of casuals. Everybody knows Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, I’m not so sure Toronto has stars with enough fame/draw to make the casual fans to tune in."

It's not just due to Golden State.  https://www.businessinsider.com/nba-tv-ratings-lebron-james-lakers-2018-11  &gt;James' move to the Los Angeles Lakers has been a big reason why. With James now playing on the West Coast, the early time slots have been hit hard. Meanwhile, the later slots, usually featuring Western Conference teams, have done well.  more stats corroborating the same statement  &gt;""For TNT's early windows this season to date, the net is averaging 1.61 million viewers compared to 2.75 million viewers at the same point last season (zero James games this year vs. two in '17).

Meanwhile, ESPN is down 6% overall after 18 telecasts, averaging 1.69 million viewers compared to 1.79 million. But the net is up compared to the same time frame two years ago (1.61 million viewers for 14 games). James and the Lakers also have the top ESPN game this season, with 2.7 million viewers for the Nov. 8 matchup against the Celtics.""   And tbh, why would the Warriors influence whether your fiance watches the Heat or not? They're not making the playoffs or mount a challenge challenge even if the Warriors weren't around..."
Lebron James last 3 games of the 2015 finals: 30/14/9 on 46% true shooting. But he deserved a finals mvp. Idk what you expect from the man when he’s soloing a juggernaut. I guess you want him to win when no one else has. Strange that these lofty expectations are levied on a man that no one trusts to show up in the playoffs
"He also doesn't have one nearly as bad as Lebron's worst choke of all time contender in 2011  Jordan had a higher average GameScore in the finals, and actually won more rings vs ""expected"" than Lebron did (based on opponent strength).  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-should-lebrons-finals-record-hurt-his-legacy/  &gt; In fact, if you add up the pre-series odds in the table above, you get an expected championship count of 2.8 for James — meaning he’s somehow running 0.2 titles above expectation, despite his record.

"Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins.""  Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer.  ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game. I MEAN EVEN KERR SAID THIS 3 years ago"
Nah LeBron James still has that.
"I misspoke, I rooted for the Warriors but I was never a Warriors fan, I am a Lakers fan although right now with Lebron James there, I'm actually rooting against them but you're right, I am not a real Warriors fan, I only occasionally watched and rooted for them."
So you're going to act like your analogy comparing LeBron James facing KD to me or you fighting a pro MMA fighter is the same thing?
Kick LeBron James in the balls

"My comments aren’t necessarily about racism, but social issues.   The NFL had an opportunity to do the right thing and permit Kaep’s kneeling because the protest had ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the military.   Instead of educating their fan base and making a statement about police brutality, the NFL in a calculated move allowed it to get out of hand knowing how much their fan base supports the military.  They also continuously failed on player welfare and the concussion issues.   The NBA collectively stands strong on social issues, and have strong leaders like Adam Silver, Lebron James, and Steve Kerr who regularly just get things right.   They also for the most part keeps their players out of serious legal trouble (when compared to the NFL).   I’d argue if it weren’t for fantasy football, the NFL would be failing miserably right now."
"There is no conceding that Iguodala made a huge impact in the series. I mean the whole defending Lebron thing was his purpose after all.   By relying on stats alone, it’s a bit disingenuous(?). Curry still ended up the best Warrior in the series despite struggling early against Delly. The reason Iggy’s on and off raw and advance stats are so good is because he’s their best defender, but dont act like he defended Lebron alone, who was for the most part the only option the Cavs had on offense.   Warriors defense on James is seen the most effective when 1.) Iggy doesnt lose James to switches, obviously 2.) he funnels James to the help defense (mainly Dray when he’s in the paint, Klay/Barnes on the perimeter)   And the fact that Curry didnt get votes was bullshit because it wouldve allowed Lebron to get the FMVP which they were intentionally avoiding."
Not everyone is LeBron James
"Kawhi Leonard, welcome to the Steph Curry, LeBron James 2015-18 experience"
Lebron James possess the body of Jeremy Lin and puts up 50 points a game.
Yeah I'm LeBron James AMA
"In what universe is LeBron James a guard? Harden played PG for one season, but other than that has always been a SG."
Here’s another article from 2017 talking about how Lebron couldn’t shoot.  LeBron James went from one of NBA's worst shooters to 7th best  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.cleveland.com/cavs/2017/12/lebron_james_went_from_one_of.html%3foutputType=amp
"Two Years Ago He Was NBA's Worst Shooter, Now LeBron James 'As Good as Anyone'  GREG SWARTZ DECEMBER 14, 2017 Perhaps even more amazing than LeBron James' physical gifts is his ability not only to maintain greatness at the highest level, but actually improve upon it.  Two years ago this month, James was the NBA's worst shooter from outside the paint. His 28.5 percent clip ranked dead last among qualified players. Today, he's putting up career-high shooting numbers across the board, including 42.2 percent from three and 58.3 percent overall.

"The Spurs are taking away LeBron's penetration. As a consequence, they're giving him a ton of open jumpers. But he isn't making them.  The ugly stats:  About 46% of LeBron's shots this year came at the rim. In the Finals, about 32% of his shots so far have come at the rim. During the season he averaged 7 free-throw attempts per game. In the Finals, he's taken 6 total free throws in three games. He's 6-for-30 on shots outside the paint in this series During the season he shot 36% from 3-point range.

1. Lebron James  2. Nikola Jokic  3. James Harden  4. Draymond Green  5. Devin Booker
Yes I know but that’s not how LBJ felt.  Here’s an article about it [Link](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/01/26/report-lebron-james-upset-that-cavaliers-owner-dan-gilbert-not-spending-enough/)   While in contrast look at how when in the highest bracket the Warriors use every exception.
"What? Are you from a different dimension? Show one example or article or something about it. Teams always try to keep Lebron out of plays in the corner intentionally. He has never been targeted in his entire career. He literally invited teams to do that because everyone was criticizing his defense.  &gt;“I mean, every team has the right if they want to single me out defensively. Come on with it,” James told Yahoo Sports. “Hey, listen, come on with it. Every team has the right to be like, ‘Oh, ’Bron’s over there.’ Hey, just come on with it. … We’ll see what happens.”"
"Game prompted the best writing of Bill Simmons' career imo:     &gt;You know what happened by now. LeBron strolled out with a creepy look on his face, a relaxed, detached expression that said … well … we didn’t know. Was he pissed off? Had he checked out? Had he finally turned on his teammates? He was barely interacting with them, lost in his own little world, like he was wearing headphones we couldn’t see. He was definitely playing hard, but you couldn’t interpret what the overall vibe meant. Was this like a Dwight Howard thing? Like, “I’m here to do my job, and I’m going to try hard, just know that I’m here because I have to be?” Had the pressure finally broken him? Was he feuding with Wade? What was his agenda?   &gt;   &gt;And then … the shots started going in. *Swish. Swish. Swish.* It’s like Miami realized, “Oh yeah, the Celtics don’t have anyone who can guard LeBron James,” and more important, LeBron realized it. He stopped worrying about sharing the ball, getting teammates involved, swinging it to the open man, *being liked*. Maybe LeBron said to himself, “Fuck it, I’m playing all 48 minutes, I’m scoring at least 50 points, and if we still blow this game, nobody can blame me.” Maybe he said, “Wade already has a ring, it’s time to get mine.” Maybe someone (Wade?) said to him, “Enough with this me-then-you-then-me crap, it’s your team, hog the ball, do your thing and take us home.” Maybe Game 5’s embarrassing defeat, as well as the humiliating “Good Job, Good Effort” kid and 36 hours of “Should they break up the Heat?” stories pissed him off. Maybe Worldwide Wes gave him an awesome pregame speech along the lines of [the chef from *Vision Quest.*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSVqLWgHQbg)   &gt;   &gt;I don’t know what happened. I just know the shots wouldn’t stop going in. After about the fifth dagger in a row (he made 10 straight), the crowd started groaning on every make — shades of Philly’s Andrew Toney ripping our hearts out 30 years ago. If you’ve ever been in the building for one of those games, you know there isn’t a deadlier sound. He single-handedly murdered one of the giddiest Celtics crowds I can remember. Thirty points in the first half. Thirty! All with that blank look on his face. It was like watching surveillance video of a serial killer coldly dismembering a body and sticking the parts in the fridge. Only we were right there.  [full](http://grantland.com/features/the-consequences-caring/)"
I mean too many people bail. Cavs would still be going to the finals had James not left. Not talking about that LeBron loser. I am talking about the OG James Jones.
"Holy shit, yes he is. He was the best player on a 59 win team. He was also the best player on a 56 win team that pushed what I would say was the best Cavs team ever to 6 in the ECF.  He's not a top 10 player. He just isn't. He's not Kawhi Leonard, he's not Lebron James, but he's a damn good player and there's a reason he was the centerpiece in a deal for Kawhi Leonard."
Nah things turned around again when she did the LeBron James one. I think the sub turned against her after the shit show of Draft Lottery day
"How many votes did the best player from the other team got? Since you're an expert.  Or do you believe if West ended up losing the finals, he would lose FMVP too?  You are trying to base your arguments to historical patterns but this kind of shit changes from time to time. No player was an unanimous MVP until Curry was all of a sudden. Years before LeBron was very close but an idiot chose Melo over him.  So your historical patterns are meaningless. James was the most valuable player, only real threat in a depleted team against a healthy one and played great basketball. Shitty efficiency? Yes. Understandable. But he still stole 2 games and deserves respect for what he did.  As for Andre, he wasn't really even MVP in his own team. He did very good and his performance deserves respect too but this is a personal awars and one person stood out much more than others.  That was probably the worst FMVP selection of all time."
Did you know LeBron James played football in High School?
Yea its definitely not an issue when you have LeBron James on your team. The issue is there's only one LeBron in the league.
LeBron James
Ray Allen SAVED LeBron James legacy in the 2013 finals!
The nba confirmed Lebron was fouled by Iguodala on those game winners check the last 2 minute reports. You are mentally ill if you think Lebron fucking James has ever been targeted on defense in his entire life.   The other players didn't make a field goal with Lebron on the bench. He was always looking to pass even in that finals he was forced to chuck.
"[Here's the game thread after the 8 point game](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hu3a3/game_thread_2_miami_heat_3_dallas_mavericks/?sort=top)  &gt;Bold Prediction: Lebron needs to score more than 4 points in the second half for the Heat to win.  -  &gt;LeBron's playing like he's trying to get Mike Brown fired.  -  &gt;Did LeBron even take a shot this game? He was a friggin' GHOST tonight. Not struttin' now, huh?  -  &gt;Is anyone else hoping this becomes a lebron thing? Just fucking up when it matters most. I sure hope it does. Then again I might just be bitter over the last series.  -  &gt;I've very disappointed in Lebron James, not just because I'm a fan, but because it's disappointing to watch an adult and a professional completely disappear on the big stage. He had an excuse against the Spurs. He has no excuses now.  -  &gt;Shawn Marion is absolutely abusing LeBron tonight. Lulz.  -  &gt;LeBron: ""...so you can ask me a better a better question tomorrow.""  &gt;Reporter, tonight: ""Ya, uh, LeBron. What the fuck, man?""  -  &gt;Going to be a crazy 4th quarter... LeBron has 8 points and Dirk has 11.  -  &gt;DAE think lebron looked like he was scared of the moment tonight?"
"[Found the game thread for game 6 of the series, fwiw](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxykb/game_thread_3_dallas_mavericks_2_miami_heat/?sort=top)  Plenty of anti-lebron stuff in there:  &gt;LeBron quit.  -  &gt;Cavs fans, I get it now, about the Lebron basically disappearing. Good lord  -  &gt;Of course Lebron is scoring...It's not the 4th quarter.  -  &gt;It's never been much about Lebron's personality to me, it was always his game. He is a bull in a china shop, with almost zero post game. Yet, the stats fools kept pushing him as ""the best"", when you could see his game could get marginalized with a decent defense. Even when he had a top 5 player on his team AND an All-Star, his team could not get it done in the end.  -  &gt;Man, Lebron is pretty bad at sports  -  &gt;lol, King James here, I'm going to throw this game  -  &gt;How many championships will the Miami Heat win, Lebron? ""Not one...""  &gt;Correct!"

"No excuse for fatigue? So players who completely carry their team aren't allowed to get fatigued anymore?  Look at the team around Lebron. It was complete trash, regardless of shooting percentages - Delly, JR, TT, Shump, Mozgov, and the corpses of James Jones and Mike Miller."
"People make fun of him because he plays hard and crosses the line into dirty play occasionally, thus making himself a target whenever a fanbase is angry.  Happens to every player that does well but also has an aspect of their game that is considered...let's say *unsporting*.  Draymond Green also plays dirty sometimes. He yells at the refs. He receives a lot of hate for these behaviours, just as he receives a lot of love for his triple double performances.  Lebron James has been mocked for being a bit of a flopping baby, because at times he has been a bit of a flopping baby.  Delly made some plays, and he picked up some haters along the way. Happens to every player worth a damn...."
"The problem with that theory is there has been someone on a losing team to win the award and we are arguing over an award called the Finals MVP, not the champion MVP at base value it should be given to the player who was most valuable in the finals series, that year it was Lebron James. while I will agree with you that winning it should have a lot of weight in who does get it I don’t believe it should be everything."
"&gt;unless you're talking the help defense at the rim which is standard of any NBA defense.  This is what I mean. Iguodala is cognizant of where the help his when he's defending LeBron and it influences how he guards him. If Iguodala didn't have reliable help, his defense would be rendered much less effective against James.  So my point is that we shouldn't hold Iguodala solely responsible for shutting down James as is usually hyperbolized."
There were rumors about this going back to the summer of 2017 https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2733528-lebron-james-rumors-star-will-unequivocally-join-lakers-in-free-agency
"In that case, here's someone who took a look at it from a different angle:   https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2015/06/17/andre-iguodala-is-worst-nba-finals-mvp-in-last-30-years/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.ba21baf6fa48  &gt; Bottom 10 Game Scores for NBA Finals MVP  &gt; Andre Iguodola   Also from Iguodala's best night:   &gt; Let’s start with his best performance, Game 6. Iguodala scored 25 points and added five rebounds and five assists and became the first player in NBA history to score at least 25 points in a Finals-clinching victory without recording any 25-point games in the preceding regular season or earlier in that year’s playoffs.   &gt; But Curry also scored 25 points plus added six rebounds, eight assists and three steals, giving him the highest game score of the night.  Another is Kitchen Sink probability:   &gt;According to Michael Beuoy’s “kitchen sink” win probability added, which quantifies the win probability contributions for every box score stat we can measure and attribute at the player level, ***Iguodala ranked fourth overall in the Finals, behind James, Curry and Draymond Green.***  The author brings up which I totally remember how many on this sub (even now) and in the media stated this:   &gt;However that didn’t stop James from being considered by many to be the Finals MVP no matter what the outcome.  The point is, all those numbers are great. He is the x-factor and it appears that because he was on LeBron he won that because people weren't willing to risk giving it to LeBron despite him losing the series.  But he was not the most valuable. Without Curry, Warriors would have lost or taken it to 7."
"Meh, don't feel like doing all that work, this is just about respecting what Iggy did. Beyond the numbers, watching every game of the series, it was crazy how Iggy's defense impacted Lebron James' ability to do what he wanted."
"Kareem, Chamberlain, Mikan, Oscar Robertson, and Russell were before my time, but I have to believe their peaks were as dominant as anyone's in the modern era.  But I did not watch them (except Kareem past his peak) so I'm going with the modern era only.  \#1 Jordan 1987-91, take your pick.  But 1990-91 if you place great importance on team success.  \#2 LeBron James 2008-2009 or 2012-13, the latter if you place great importance on team success.  \#3-10, not necessarily in this order:  Chris Paul 2008-09.  James Harden 2018-19.  Steph Curry 2015-16.  Kevin Garnett 2003-04.  Dwyane Wade 2008-09.  Shaquille O'Neal 1999-2000.  Charles Barkley 1988-90, take your pick.  Larry Bird 1985-86."
"I mean, I think you can figure out the answers to your questions -- for one thing, this summer's class and an MVP candidate trade target are pretty unprecedented.   It's not that different than the Celtics trading for Ray Allen to attract Kevin Garnett, or the Lakers trading for Pau to keep Kobe happy, or the Heat signing Bosh and James as a package deal, or the Cavs trading for Kevin Love to make LeBron happy, or the Lakers trying to trade for Anthony Davis to make LeBron happy, or the Nets trading for KG/PP/JJ so Darren Williams would resign, or the Rockets trading for Harden and then signing Dwight, or OKC trading for Paul George and then extending Russ."
"&gt; This isn't good evidence to back up Iggy getting FMVP. Redditors are dumb too  &gt;Curry was easily their best player.  By your own logic shouldn't I doubt that assertion?  Mostly jokes, I think Lebron James deserved it."
LeBron James is being described as “short and stocky” like he’s motherfucking Danny Devito and not a 6 ft 8 brickhouse  lmao
Nah. Curry still had to beat Lebron James.
I thought Lebron James was was more well-articulated than this.
"Well no shit they would've won a title. Same with the Pacers, Hawks, hell even Orlando. Anyone would've won a title with Lebron James on their team back then."
"safe to say it's lebron.   &amp;#x200B;  Since 2011, Celtics lost 5 playoffs series against him (3 ECF, so 3 potential finals they never played), 20 W - 8 L for James having 31ppg.  &amp;#x200B;  It's almost a decade of pain."
I think you're only allowed to put asterisks on the Warriors.   And absolutely never on a LeBron James team.
"I can respect that.  The NBA is so reliant on having star players per team, so I can see him still fit the window based on his age.  If there were no max salary limitation, I'd be terrified.  I think of it as helping them built more like the past LeBron James teams (big 3) than the pre-KD Golden State approach."

"Nothing especially juicy  1. Rose shares observations about the crime and racism he grew up around in Chicago and his experiences growing up poor in Englewood.  Rose writes that he didn’t meet a white person until high school and calls Chicago “low-key segregated.” He cites the resistance he ran into in an unsuccessful attempt to acquire property downtown so his then-girlfriend could set up a salon near Michigan Avenue.   Though he doesn’t identify who held up the deal or how, Rose writes that it was thwarted by concerns about the sort of clientele it might attract to the area.   2. According to Rose, whatever chance Illinois had of signing him out of Simeon vanished with then-Illini coach Bruce Weber’s reluctance to visit Rose’s home. Memphis coach, meanwhile, not only showed up in Englewood, but also treated Rose’s mother as if they were longtime friends. Rose writes that Calipari treated his mother “with the utmost respect, and for me to see a white guy being honest like that meant something.”   3. Rose is not a big fan of the media, especially Chicago media. He believes Chicago media turned on him toward the end of his time with the Bulls, and he withdrew rather than fight back.  He also clearly still resents players-turned-analysts O’Neal and Barkley saying he should walk away from the game rather than sign with the Cavaliers after the sturm und drang of his post-Bulls stint with the Knicks.   4. Rose believes the media turned Bulls fans against him at the end of his time with the team, and that hurt. “But don’t get me wrong,” he writes. “That was just at the end and it was me who didn’t handle the criticism right. There really was love for so long. I love Chicago, and I still love the Bulls.” Rose also has affection for Bulls Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf.   5. Rose regrets that he didn’t have someone in the media he could go to when he lost control of his narrative. As Rose sees it, Michael Jordan had Ahmad Rashad and [Kobe Bryant] had Stephen A. Smith.   “Who was my reporter?” he wrote. “I’m in a market where if I say something — no matter what it was — it seemed like they were gonna twist my story. I don’t know why. It’s my hometown.”   6. Rose nearly died twice as a youth. At 9 or 10, he mistook a cup full of bleach for water and drank it. And on Independence Day when he was 12 or 13, Rose and a pal thought it would be entertaining to throw lit matches or cigarettes in the gas tank of a long-abandoned tow truck. Out shot a flame that badly burned Rose’s friend.   7. Many of Rose’s teeth are capped, and it’s not because he ate so much sugar as a kid. Rose writes that when Bulls teammate elbowed him in 2015 training camp, breaking Rose’s eye socket, he also chipped nine or so teeth.   8. Rose recalls taping a recruiting video for the Bulls’ failed campaign to land Lebron James in 2010, and he was upset the Bulls didn’t shoot down reports that he wasn’t interested in helping the bid.  While Rose writes he’s not big on “What if?” scenarios — and this probably isn’t going out on a limb — he believes the Bulls would have won at least one title if James had signed with them instead of the Heat.   9. Rose says Nike and ESPN have outsized influence in basketball.  He has an amusing anecdote of Nike handing out iPads to Team USA players when he on the national squad in 2014. Rose sent his brother to get his, only to have his brother turned away because Rose’s shoe deal was with rival Adidas."

"I think the difference between coaches and players is that there's a huge pool of potential NBA-level head coaches who you could sign, whereas virtually all the NBA-level players are already in the league and under contract. Sure, the best NBA coaches have proved their value, but you might also be able to find the next Brad Stevens and not have to give anything up in a trade. You are never going to find the next LeBron James as a random free agent"
"Of course not    1.	Everyone is three years older. This hit the role players hard but not Steph Dray and Klay 2.	Depleted bench. 16 Warriors had one of the best benches of the year, and probably a top tier one in general NBA history  3.	Durant being out means they have no one at SF. Say what you will about Barnes but he’s a better option for them now than whoever they’re playing  4.	This is their 5th year straight in the finals, so they don’t have the same edge or mentality as a team that’s never been there before.   Also: Kawhi will never replicate what LeBron did. That team was completely reliant on James, and the best parts about him that made him so dangerous (his passing ability) is not something Kawhi is great at."
"Like I say kyrie needs to play with someone that can keep the other guys fed a la LeBron James or the chemistry will be ruined. Kyrie is going to take a lot of shots from other guys just like he did in Boston. The nets have a lot guys worthy of touches, much like Boston. It’s only a good if they will ship some guys out and add another star with him. They need a clear pecking order or the same thing will happen in Brooklyn."
"Why you gotta include James Jones, he was tired after carrying Lebron all those years to the finals."
in denial about what?   All I did was point out the irony of you criticizing Kyrie when LeBron fuckin James couldn’t even carry the Lakers to the playoffs.   This has nothing to do with the Nets and everything to do with the Lakers sucking ass lmaooo
"Wow a love tap, who gives a shit. The guy has given away more than 100 million to charity and is committed to giving away half his extreme fortune, is what he did that bad? Get the fuck over it. How much money has Lebron James donated to charity?"
"The Lakers have LeBron James, so of course they can contend if he’s healthy, even with Pelinka. But, Pelinka is an issue for sure though, especially because he seems to be left standing with more influence than before while Magic has dipped."
They have Lebron James. They aren’t getting 3 picks.
"And last party we had, they shut down Prive (Ain't that where the Heat play?) Yep (N****s hate ballers these days) Ain't that like LeBron James? (Ain't that just like D-Wade) (Wait)"
" It was all me, LeBron James. It's always been me. The author of all your pain."
Lebron James   Drafted in 2003. In the 2013 Finals (so 10 years into his career) Coach Pop told his team to sag off him and let him shoot wide open jumpers.  Can you think of any other MVP caliber player where Coach Pop would say no leave him eyed open?
"Me too but then I remember that OKC is in cap hell and we still have a max slot and assets to trade for AD along with Lebron James, so good luck to PG and the OKC Thunder."
"&gt;Steph could have led last year’s Cavaliers team to the Finals just like Lebron did    LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO    &gt;   Forget about leading them to the Finals.. they wouldn't even have made the playoffs. At best, 1st round exit  &gt;  In what world is Steph Curry even remotely similar to LeBron James? LeBron and Jordan are considered the 2 GOATS. How the fuck do you even Curry to him? Curry is not even the best player on his own team, when Durant plays. I mean, come on fool   &gt;   Curry had his best playoff game of his entire career last night.. at age 31, and y'all autistic nephews on r/nba already comparing him to LeBron, and the legendary shit that LeBron did last season, with a fucking lottery team?  &gt;   &gt;Curry would’ve dominated just like Lebron did    This sentence deserves another  LMFAOOO   &gt;   Pro tip: If y'all kids want to bait people by saying the most atrocious and illiterate ass shit, then atleast be more creative. This is just embarrassing"
Imagine being so scared of LeBron James.
"LeBron James  Imagine being called the GOAT but you jumped ship three times to join stacked teams to win a weak eastern conference. First it was wade and Bosh then it was Irving and Love. Now he jumped ship to the lakers and is basically holding the team hostage/practically begging other stars to come save him in the west.   Imagine Jordan did this, dude would win 10 straight rings.  Waiting for the downvotes from bronsexuals."
"They were gonna do this without Lebron James. Everyone saw how bad that action was. If he was a normal fan, he would have been banned for life. As a part owner, he gets a big fine and lengthy suspension"
"Okay, i wasn't going to reply to this at first, but im official in rant mode.   First of all, I'm not going to personally insults you like you did me because that's uncouth, and I don't want to be banned   Second, You can make it in this world without being an asshole and screwing people over. My favorite players in the NBA is Lebron James, hes very rich and quite successful, hes also really nice, and a great person who is helping kids go to schools that are struggling to make it and falling through the cracks.  One of the greatest presidents in the histroy of america is Jimmy Carter and he by all descriptions is very successful. He also helped nearly eradicated  an entire disease.  Some people who are successful are bad, and would be said to be assholes, but there are many who are just nice guys and just got lucky or figured something out and made it work.  You're acting like every rich person is Elon Musk. Some of them are but some aren't.  Dr Stephen Hawkings, The guy who came up with hawking radiation, and one of the greatest humans in the histroy of the earth, during his life was very successful. He was also as close to a hero as someone can get to in the history of man.   You just hate all people who made it and were successful, theres a word for that, resentment. It's unfair to them, sure i understand hating the system because its broken, but it makes no sense to hate people."
Lebron James
We got Anthony Davis and Lebron James on our team today
He also know he aint beating LeBron James with AD.
Let’s say the Lakers just got AD to play with Lebron James.  Cuz that is real.
"&gt;Right now their roster is a broken down and washed up LeBron James   If you want to bait people with the most retarded as fuck shit.. then atleast don't come out and say these things. You got to be smart about it  &gt;  Broken down washed up LeBron James? Come on now. Even the biggest haters won't say such a stupid thing. He's also the Daddy of the Toronto Raptors, and that'll never change.  He just went out to get some cigarettes, but he'll come back soon. Show some respect fool"
Anthony Davis is a Laker. With LeBron James. Wow.
"The Pels did great and I am super happy they got a haul for him after all this shit with AD.   That said, my team has AD and Lebron James and a potential max slot.  It's a very good day for the Lakers."
"Lebron of House James, Old King of the East, Current Protector of Staples, Seducer of Brows, Banisher of Lavar, The ReGroined, Breaker of 73, Jammer of Sea, [Taco-er of Tuesdays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MrLPZbdkJU), Father of 3+, and First of His Name.  Long may he reign."
Lmao you can't even get a decent chunk of Lakers fans to respect LeBron Fucking James
"There’s a reason no “big name star” game to the east for the past 10 years. His names LeBron James. Now before we discredit anything, here’s a fun stat.  The average NBA player’s career length is 4.5 years.   LeBron has been to the NBA Finals 9 times.   Quite literally, LBJ has had more “finals seasons” than the amt of seasons an average player will play his entire career...."
"Once again, he won a championship without them, but with LeBron James. What is the concept that you seem to be missing? Kyrie isn't a god that transcends basketball. You keep saying that LeBron couldn't have done it without Kyrie; but you understand that the opposite is true x50, right? Kyrie having won a championship before means nothing when he isn't able to perform. And he wasn't. It is as simple as that. Don't get me wrong chief, I'm a Celtics fan and desperately want Kyrie to stay. I recognize how very good of a player he is, but that doesn't mean that he is void of blame."
They can do this for 7 years?  They should do it when Lebron James Jr is draft eligible
"This was said last year. Rememberer?   ""It's the year 2018 and we have LeBron James..."" Laker fans are just salty LeBron couldn't carry the team to playoffs. I don't blame him either, you know damn well Lakers didn't have any type of superstar talent."
Well O dont get it why lot of people are saying Lebron James on the decline and they didnt made the playoff last year atleast now its a bit more fun to watch
"Did you forget about 16-17? Our team full of scrubs dropped to 4th seed and we were still the favourites, and just like everyone expected Lebron won us the ECF. Your talking about Lebron James who is now paired with Ad."
Hello it’s the year 2019 and we have LeBron James and Anthony Davis
They did have LeBron James though
Soon we're gonna find out the trade includes a hidden option to acquire Lebron James and jeanie buss.
"Even though you told me to shut the fuck up :(  We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"The word ""prime"" does not apply to LeBron James"
Yes because we learned this year making a risky trade for a superstar to win a championship is absolutely retarded.   Lol if any fanbase should understand going all in it's you.  Lakers have Lebron James. If it doesn't work out for them that's a shame. But when you have Lebron the far bigger crime is sitting there content being mediocre.
Kobe and shaq are a way better duo. Anthony Davis hasn't really done anything yet in the league compared to shaq. And Kobe is better than lebron James too.
Uhhh... any scenario with Lebron on your team that doesn’t result in a title is a flop. Lebron was about to win a chip next year with Lonzo and Ingram. Or ever. They’re useless pieces for the Lebron timeline.   If you wanted to build around and develop those guys you don’t sign Lebron James.
"Lebron James is a great core, but he’s not young"
Yea Lebron James was definitely a big part of their young core lol
Lakers have a big positive in LeBron James and the Nuggets have a big positive in roster depth. I feel like this season will be very telling for who is better. Right now they are on the same tier.
LeBrON JaMeS tO LA iS tHe SaMe aS MJ tO WaSHiNgToN
Because they didn’t have LeBron? Their trade didn’t pair a top 10 player in the league with the best player in the league. Plus James isn’t getting any younger.
LeBron James  Anthony Davis  Kyle Kuzma  Enes Kanter  Rajon Rondo
"You heard it here first, Lebron James can't shoot the ball."
this season in which are entire team was injured at some point? Yall so mad about us getting AD yall actually questioning if Lebron James can carry a team that has AD on it lmfao
so Zion's that big of an improvement on LeBron James huh?
"Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Kyle Kuzma, and 3 other dudes nobody cares about. The Lakers better do more this offseason if they wanna win, because the Pelicans have Jrue Holiday, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, Julius Randle (if they re-sign), and the 4th pick (probably like RJ Barrett or a real nice trade piece), 2 or 3 other 1st round picks, and Josh Hart. Kind of sounds like a bad trade, but who knows?"
"Fill in these for us please. As commented earlier.

Lebron James tearing his Achilles is hilarious to you?
i mean the title favorite probably hinges completely on how much prime lebron has left in the tank.  he could come out and be nearly as dominant and healthy as he was in CLE or he could finally experience significant decline and/or vulnerability to injuries we never worried about before because he was such an iron man.  we won’t know till we’re watching it next season but if he’s still the lebron james i desperately hope he is then they’re probably legit favorites.
Leigh Ellis was the only guy who kept it real.. I used to listen to these guys all the time but the amount of hate they spewed at the lebron james led Miami heat was unbearable and cringe worthy.. I stopped listening to them after that and then again they did the same thing with the warriors..   good riddance..
"Fun Fact: If it wasn't for Ray Allen, Kyrie Irving, and Adam Silver, LeBron James would be 1-8 in the Finals."

No he’s Lebron James
If you think Lebron James will ever sacrifice his stats you're insane.
"Ok so first off I want you to explain to me with what cap space the warriors are going to sign those players if they max Klay and KD. 2ndly Boogie had a torn Quad. KD has a ruptured Achilles, the MINNIMUM return for that is 7 months (after what just happened I promise you KD is not playing next year). Klay has a torn ACL, he’ll be LUCKY if he gets back mid February. Finally you just told me the Kings or the Clippers would beat LeBron James and Anthony Davis in a 7 game series and it’s pretty easy to see you just hate LeBron James. Name 1 player either of those teams have that is better than Anthony Davis let alone LeBron James. He literally just averaged 27/8/8 and you’re talking about him like he’s a washed up scrub."
They have some dude named LeBron James to start at SF
"It’s foolish to believe Lakers are not an instant contender now. They have 30 million in cap space to give Lebron, AD help. Kuzma is a great player too  Collison  Redick  James  Kuzma  AD  That’s a championship starting 5"
The Knicks didn't have Lebron James
"He literally took the last 20 games off to rest this past season.   He's going to be 35.  He was roughly the 10th best player last year.   It's not unreasonable to think a few other players pass him as well next season. People can point to a single example of Tom brady all they want...but that's avocado ice cream tom brady, not wine enthusiast LeBron James. The TB12 system is an entire way of life. Brady is fucking insane with his commitment."
Sign Kemba and Danny green and it's a wrap   PG Kemba Walker SG Danny Green SF Lebron James PF Kyle Kuzma C Anthony Davis
"[Woj] Sources confirm, LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard have left their contracts in the NBA and will be competing in The Big 3"
Because the Knicks didn't already have Lebron James on the team.
"Ty for understanding sarcasm.   It’s funny, people never seem to learn that you shouldn’t doubt or underestimate what Lebron James can do. He’s a freak."
Lakers roster next year (so far):  PF/C - Anthony Davis  SF/PF - Lebron James  SF/FP - Kyle Kuzma  C - Wagner   PG - Isaac Bonga  That's it... They have some major holes to fill. Especially at the guard position.

The protection is the fact that they have AD and Lebron James. That pick isn’t touching the top 20 barring a catastrophe
How do you know that? What part of LeBrons game declined this year? Unless they suffer major injuries NBA players don’t fall off cliffs like NFL players. They have slow steady declines. Add that in with the fact that LeBrons passing and basketball IQ is so dominate his game will translate well into his older years. He could be 40 years old and still be a top 10 active player. LeBron James will be competing for a title next year. The year after. And the year after that.
This has LeBron “I set teams back ten years and leave” James written all over it.
Lebron James is clearly going to play every year worse than the year before so I can't see the title with him. Anthony Davis as I know is a AG/C that just shoot by 3 and nothing else. Tell me what's the good part of this trade.
Lebron James is clearly going to play every year worse than the year before so I can't see the title with him. Anthony Davis as I know is a AG/C that just shoot by 3 and nothing else
Playing with LeBron James and Anthony Davis is much more popular than playing with whoever is already on the Knicks lol
It wouldn’t be a Lebron James team if he didn’t recruit other superstars to win championships instead of letting the growth happen naturally.
That’s is essentially what they did in the first place. You don’t sign LeBron James to rebuild. They just missed the playoffs with that team. What makes you think they were going to compete for a title? They could keep their young core and maybe hope to contend for a title after LeBrons contact is up. Or they could trade away their core and compete for 3 right now. No brained.
Anthony Davis+ LeBron James= title contender
"&gt;For one year of davis? Rofl    That's the thing fool. AD wanted to be a Laker and wants to play with LeBron. So for the Lakers, this was a bargain. But yes, for any other team, this would have been a shitty deal  &gt;   Lakers also kept KYLE KUZMA.. while pairing LeBron fuckin James with Anthiny Davis LMFAO  &gt;  They still have a crazy amount of cap space, to fill in the roster with more firepower. Free agents will line up now even more than even. It's Los Angeles. It's LeBron, and now AD too. That's SHOWTIME"
Lol what if that pick is LeBron James Jr
"Kyle Kuzma yelled out, “There you go!” Mo Wagner gave a look of pleasant surprise. Isaac Bonga belted, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Magic Johnson hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"

It will most likely be:   * LeBron James * Anthony Davis * Lonzo Ball * Jimmy Butler * Javale McGee
The 2019-20 Lakers Starting 5: LeBron James Anthony Davis Kyle Kuzma
Shit changes when Anthony Davis and Lebron James link up in a historical basketball city
"Lakers 2020 rolling out PG - Kemba Walker  SG - Danny Green SF - LeBron James PF - Kyle Kuzma C - Anthony Davis   Also alternatively Nikola Vucivic instead of Kemba, just run LeBron at PG and move everyone down a spot"
"Well, minus Lebron fucking James"
And he’s on a team with Lebron James. They will fit just fine with almost no overlap in playing style.
"Just as we finally get to see some parity in the NBA, along comes Lebron James to kill it once again  Can this guy win without a superteam around him? I guarantee he doesn’t win with the Raptors this year if you replace Kawhi with him"
The Knicks don't have LeBron James
The NBA vetoed the Miami Heat signing Juwon Howard to a blockbuster contract in 1996. Howard eventually signed with the Heat in 2010 and won two titles with LeBron James.  The NBA vetoed the Los Angeles Lakers making a blockbuster trade for Chris Paul in 2011. Paul eventually was traded to the Lakers in 2019 and...

One year for who though? They do well and clearly he stays with LEBRON FRIGGIN JAMES.
"Exactly. I guess you can say it’s WIN NOW, especially when you have LeBron James on your team, but he has minimum 3 years left in him"
"can you stop. Do not compare losing DeJounte Murray to losing LEBRON JAMES.  And Lonzo Ball. And Brandon Ingram. And and and half the damn roster.  No, the point of basketball is to win championships, and we did more to move closer to one last season than you did."
1. LeBron James  2. Kawhi Leonard  3. James Harden  4. Steph Curry  5. Giannis Antetokounmpo
"You have nowhere near as many Hornets posts as even posts about Harden that don't specifically mention his name.   &gt;Yeah there’s really no debate on Harden being a better player than AI. Like zero. It’s crazy to think otherwise. AI literally did nothing better. Absolutely nothing.  &gt;AI has more scoring titles tho so he’s ahead right now  &gt;Can’t wait for y’all to discover how hard it is to be Harden for 82 games a year  &gt;Genuinely never seen a guy who’s nicer with the media as universally reviled as James Harden. He ought to go full Westbrook with the level of slander and disrespect he gets from the sameness media he treats better than anyone  &gt;Now do James Harden  &gt;Won’t be made because he’s not James Harden. Just like nobody will compile Kawhis push offs and travels  &gt;Harden would be getting spitroasted tho. Because he had better stats than that and lost and got torn apart. He was 1-6 for 4 points in the fourth  &gt;Kawhi has been so shit from the field like Jesus Christ Harden would be getting killed for this  &gt;Curry shot 3/12 in the second half, Harden shot 5/8 in the 4th of game 6  &gt;ESPN still ranks AD over Harden in 2019. Oh well  &gt;People are being their typical righteously indignant selves. These same shocked fans booed Harden when Draymond dirty ass fingernails gouged Harden’s eye. Oh and Bogut mocked him.  &gt;I’m sure Harden would love an EG for KD swap  &gt;Harden got killed for having a nearly identical game 7 performance as Lebron did in game 6  &gt;I honestly think this is closer than anyone would ever admit. People hate Harden so much yet he had a better stat line in his final series than Steph does now. Seriously, Harden got torn apart for a series where he put up 35/6/6 on 59% ts. Look at Stephs averages in this finals series. It’s Closer than anyone will ever admit and it’s a godamn shame too  &gt;He is almost the ideal Harden big imo. If they aren’t going to get a guy who is a complete pick and roll maestro like a Stoudamire then a playmaking jumpshooting big is the next best thing.  &gt;Raptors. Harden was dog ass tired last year, his legs were shot and his jumpshot was done. 2019 Harden on that 2018 team wins 70 games and the championship though  &gt;This has never been the case. Kawhi doesn’t check Harden, Green does.  &gt;I feel sorry for James Harden and only James Harden. The slander is unwarranted. The rest of them unwashed wastemen besides Tuck can kick rocks  &gt;Harden never gets this excuse  &gt;**I would take a bullet for James Harden.** I would also take a bullet just to take one tbh  &gt;Please don’t tell me Steph is gassed form doing what Harden does on a nightly basis 😤. Y’all better appreciate that man  &gt;He (Harden) owns that move. Wish he would reintegrate the eurostep so he could steal that patent from Manu and Wade.  &gt;Imagine thinking Harden doesn’t top this list  &gt;I just want consistency tbh. Harden is universally called a choker for his 4th quarter where he scored 12 on 5/8 with 4 turnovers. But due to Stephs effort in the first three quarters he’s given a pass. Crazy  &gt;Bruh Steph went 1-5 in the fourth. I know a man who went 5/8 and lost but got torn apart for it. Can’t imagine who that was"
"To any Bot sellers: if you need karma you can come to r/Lakers and just post a picture of LeBron James' face, and title it ""our leader"" and get hundreds of upvotes.   Bonus points if you participate in game threads; your contributions couldn't be any worse than some of the headass niggas in there."
You really think Curry gets more defensive attention than LeBron james does if they were both alone?
No one :  Lestan: but LeBron James
Master Chief takes his helmet off at the end of Halo 7.  The camera zooms in on his hairline and it is unmistakable. He is the descendant of Lebron James.
Yep I don’t know why Steph is held to the standards of LeBron James and KD tho. Look at the all time top 10 list. There isn’t a single point guard aside from Magic who was 6’9. Height matters in basketball. Big men used to be the way to win rings now it’s scoring wings. Point guards who are elite scorers like Stephen Curry don’t win championships by themselves very often because it’s easier to stop someone who is 6’3 and not very athletic. If Steph was 6’7 he might be in the GOAT conversation.
"All Decade 1st Team has to be, I'm pretty certain: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Lebron James."
Genetic lottery? Lanky Asian kid isn’t exactly winning the genetic lottery. Lebron James is hitting the genetic lottery. You make it sound like making it to the nba and onto a nba roster that makes it to the finals is so easy.      There are plenty of people  that “ hit the genetic lottery” and are nowhere near sniffing major league sports even after spending their whole life trying to make it.
"Seems like an unnecessary move considering what you said above. Depth is key in nba especially in the west. We saw it this year with the raps (though they benefited from injuries) the raptors have a star in Leonard and an all star in Lowry and great rotational players and were able to win a championship. If I were in charge I’m not sacrificing that much of my cap to bring in a player like Beal who is a great player but if I can get 2-3 solid rotational players out of the salary he would command I’m taking that. Especially if one of my 2 stars in lebron james, a player that can maximize the skill sets of a poor mans bradley Beal."
&gt; No he's not  yeah this just invalidates everything you said  lebron james is objectively the most criticized and scrutinized player in nba history
was this before Kawhi started winning two dtraight DPOY though? lol plus Kawhi guarded Lebron Fucking James well. Wiggins is  barely a plus defender in COLLEGE.

Yeah a team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis would actually be terrible
Any player and they're in their prime?: Dirk Nowitzki  Any active player right now?: Damian Lillard  Any active player and they're in their prime?: Lebron James
"hahaha, LeBron get so much hate and gets killed for so much. But I think only time will allow people to realize how great he is/was. 3 years after LeBron retires, someone is going to put up a crazy stat line, like a 25 point triple double, and they will show who else in history has done it, and they'll show LeBrons numbers and it'll dwarf anyone elses. That's the only way people will end up appreciating him. They will say, ""Wow, Marvin Bagley is having a hell of a finals game. Leading all players in points, rebound, blocks, here is a look at players who else have done that"" and it'll show James leading all players, from both teams leading in all categories. Unfortunately, that's the only way people will appreciate James."
"The /r/nba way.  Until Lebron James starts talking about the same issue, then they'll start slobbering him again and pretend they don't do the exact same thing."
"Yeah we are all aware the NBA investigated. I'd be very surprised if he's on paper anymore or maybe ever, but he might as well be. It doesn't change that the agency operates with and for James first of all and likely wouldn't exist at all without him. It's an advantage I don't think a GOAT needs.     &gt; If that's true (and that's just pure speculation on your part, and is likely incorrect),   Do you really think everything is speculation after the whole AD debacle? like honestly? AD, Lebron, Rich Paul and the whole team of young guys they tried to trade? So that wasn't just best for James, it was best for everyone involved? What a bad look for the league.   &gt; After all, if Rich Paul's whole goal was to just move every one of his clients to LeBron's team....  Nobody said this?? Look at how KCP's inflated contract was to be matching money. You write walls of text, but what do you really think about the AD strong-arming? The tampering was just cool legal beans? Do you support these tactics in general, think it's good for the league forward? Did it just happened to go down this way and not really involve Lebron at all?"
"&gt;”Randle wanted to come back after we got lebron”  &gt;Want to know how I know that’s a lie? He demanded his rights he renounced BEFORE WE GOT LEBRON.  I don’t want to insult your intelligence, but I really don’t understand how you can’t reconcile these two things in your mind. Randle wanted to leave, then changed his mind after we got LeBron. Just as I stated in my original comment. Randle wanted to leave because the Lakers were a 35 win team who had shown no interest in promising him a starting role. Once the Lakers got LeBron, Randle saw an opportunity to potentially be on a championship team in the near future so he decided he would try to work on an extension. After all the Lakers offered him the qualifying offer so there seemed to be some interest. The Lakers wouldn’t promise him a starting role and then renounced his restricted rights.  You can call me a liar, but’s here’s a tweet from Charania confirming Randle wanted to re-sign with the Lakers after LeBron committed. So I’m going to stick to the evidence that a reputable NBA reporter provides over an anonymous Redditor that can’t reconcile two non-contradicting points.  [Charania] Sources: Lakers restricted free agent Julius Randle hasn’t yet received an offer from L.A., but has excitement for arrival of LeBron James. Randle’s representatives and the Lakers are expected to speak Monday, hopeful of potential offer to retain him.  https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1013809832036634626"
"As time goes by people forget about greatness.    People also have a tendency of saying he played in a wash league where no one could guard him. However, that's the same with the lebron james. "
You can compare Luka doncic’s rookie year with LeBron James. Knowing that it’s a no brainer to take the guy who’s already proven himself in the nba knowing he still has a lot of potential. 
"Lol, I'd like to introduce you to LeBron James. Left his hometown to burn on two separate occasions and his ""fans"" worship him despite losing twice as many finals as he wins "
that happens when your only playoff appearances are next to lebron james.
LeBron James is the best basketball player that I have watched with my own eyes... Giannis is the only player that makes me question that.
I can't wait for the F5 frenzy on draft night when both the Knicks and Suns get lower picks than the team with LeBron James.
"It's LeBron James, tho. Arguably the best player in the history of the league."
"&gt; It's a conflict for any player to own an agency while they are playing and especially one of the greatest, I don't know how you could say it's not.  Well first of all you should know the NBA investigated whether LeBron had any part of an ownership stake in Klutch sports and found that [he did not own any of it.](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/07/31/lebron-james-klutch-sports-group-ownership-investigation)  &gt; You're acting like KCP for instance doesn't want to be used as a pawn. The pawns might well be very happy.  If that's true (and that's just pure speculation on your part, and is likely incorrect), then there's no conflict of interest as that would be those players using an agent to get what they want (in this case, to be LeBron's pawn). As I said above, if players feel like they're being used in some scheme by LeBron and that's not what they want, then they can just fire Rich Paul and find new representation.  This is really the main point I'm trying to make: no one of these other players that Rich Paul represents can be part of an unwitting scheme on LeBron's part because it's up to each player who they hire to represent them. If they feel like Rich Paul isn't doing right by them and what they want, they can fire him. So if Rich Paul wasn't fulfilling his clients' wishes, then he'd soon have no clients. It's that simple.  Like I said: every agent has potential conflicts of interest if they have more than one NBA client. Their job, however, is predicated on how happy they make their clients, so if an agent lets those conflicts control them or they end up doing a poor job for one client because they're too focused on another client, then they'll soon be without any clients. And it's not just that one guy would fire his agent and that's that, it's also that word would spread that this agent wasn't doing right by his clients. If that was the case with Rich Paul, then surely he'd have 1) been fired by someone before now, and 2) would no longer be attracting new clients. But seeing as how Draymond just signed on and nobody (not even AD) has fired Rich Paul, it seems like Rich Paul is doing a credible job of keeping his conflicts of interest at bay and is instead doing right by his clients.  After all, if Rich Paul's whole goal was to just move every one of his clients to LeBron's team, then how come Klutch clients Nerlens Noel and Markieff Morris ended up on the Thunder in the last year? Both were free agents and could have gone anywhere. If your conspiracy is true, then surely they'd be Lakers right now, right?"
"The injury is prolly a legit excuse but the pure fact of not trying on defense is embarassing. Harden's game has never been defense obviously but he is having an absolutely insane offense season that he's worthy to be in the conversation even if not being named that guy. LeBron James defensive stats are an outlier because of the way they were playing pre-AD drama, when he wasn't just blaming his team for his mistakes"
"LeBron ""The Kid"" James"
"I think the problem is there's too much talent in the NBA. We look at Anthony Davis, and think he's this generational talent, but he's really not.  Just going down the standings, the list of superstar talent in the league:  Giannis Antekoumpo, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Bradley Beal, Kevin Love, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, James Harden, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Karl Anthony Towns, Lebron James, and then Anthony Davis way down there in the standings.   When you have a superstar class that big, Anthony Davis is only going to impact winning so much, as there is too much talent in the league.  This doesn't even count all the superstars in training that will be on the come up soon like Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum, and Lauri Markannen, or guys like Kemba, Al Horford, Tobias Harris, Lou Williams, Jrue Holiday, etc. that are also as good of what we traditionally think of all stars.  The league is fucking stacked right now, and it's only getting more talented every year."
Barkley can eat more Krispy Kreme than Lebron James though
"&gt; I'm not sure that quick timing or the ability to fire agents negates conflicts of interests all around, is that what you're saying?  That is what I'm saying, and yes it does, or rather that if there's a conflict of interest on the part of LeBron or Rich Paul, it is negated by the fact that the people who hire Rich Paul can fire him at any moment. The reason that this is important is because if Rich Paul (or LeBron) tries to use these other players as pawns in their scheme or acts in a way which runs counter to what the other players want, they can just fire Rich Paul and find someone else.  Like I said with my above analogy, that if LeBron started a company that is a team of athletic trainers. If players from rival teams hired those trainers and the trainers through a conflict of interest or under LeBron's orders began implementing training methods to harm rather than help the other players, the players would just fire them and go somewhere else. So would there be a conflict of interest in LeBron owning the training company that employs trainers for players who play for teams he's trying to beat? Sure, I guess, but so what? It would be a conflict of interest that is so easily negated by the other players that it's meaningless.  Rich Paul doesn't have a conflict of interest as a sports agent that's any worse than any other agent with multiple clients does. Every agent who represents a stable of clients could have a myriad of conflicts, whether trying to use one player's upcoming contract as leverage for another of their clients (as we may have seen with Aaron Mintz in possibly trying to dangle Paul George to the Lakers to get them to extend Julius Randle, another one of his clients, last summer), or whether they are just prioritizing one client over another, there are just conflicts of interest that are inherent there. But the reason it doesn't really matter is because these agents, even Rich Paul, in the end work for their clients, not the other way around, and as such they can fire their agents if they don't like the job they're doing.  So in the end, it doesn't matter if there's a conflict there. Just like it doesn't matter if a player from Boston signs up with the agent who represents James Harden or something. Any agent who isn't doing his best to make his clients happy is soon not going to have any clients. And that's the difference between a shitty agent and a shitty team owner, because James Dolan and Robert Sarver have just as many NBA players employed as Wyc Grousbeck and Peter Holt do."

First. Summer. Off. In 8 years. No, forcing a trade for AD didnt work out. No, the Lakers didnt have the opportunity to be rofl stomped by 5 all stars or some lesser team. No, Magic didnt make all the right moves. But Lebron is living his best life. And like many have done before this same time every year, I wouldnt write Lebron James out.

"If LeBron James isn't one of the most accomplished players of all time, then who the fuck is?  This guy is the Maradonna to Jordan's Pele  When you mention the greatest basketball player of all time, it's Jordan and LeBron   When you mention the greatest football player, it's Jerry Rice or Tom Brady  If you're the 1A/1B greatest of all time in your sport. you're one of the most accomplished athletes ever "
"Make a rule that says that Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Joel Embiid must all play for the Celtics"
&gt; Then you add in the fact most if not all the players from his draft class are broken down or out of the league.  This one in particular is why all the Me7o hate annoys me.  The dude had an amazing 15 year career.  Lebron James has skewed everyone's perspective into thinking Me7o should still be at the top of his game but historically there are only a select few players all time who can maintain excellence that long.
"“5 reasons why LeBron missing the playoffs still means he’s my daddy, uh i mean goat... man this Jordan guy really had a more dominant and successful career, I wonder what kind of article I could come up with to make people think Jordan ain’t all that. Oh yeah, I saw that YouTube video about the defense in the 90s being easier with illegal defense, there we go. Those 2 threepeats are now invalid. Hahahaha we did it now boys. LeBron ‘3-6 ChokeLord’ James is the true goat now!! He got dominated by Curry and the warriors in his own era but he got that one championship! That’s worth like 8 normal chips right?”"
Lebron James and 3 unprotected 1st for Moreland.   Lakers might have to throw in Ingram too
"""Sports news guy told me James Harden is the GOAT (I don't know what animals have to do with it, maybe the beard) cuz he does the most baskethoops a game"". You look at a Rockets loss and see him shooting like 12/47 while CP3, Capela, Gordon are shooting 70% on like 8 shots.   Best one is when you see LeBron finished with a line like 25/8/15 and fail to see the nice -25. People give Russ shit for looking for his numbers but nobody can deny it's what Bron's doing now. My brother is the biggest Bron fan, said he was gonna go West and dominate them year 1 with no help. Said top 3 team at least, making finals. Played out well."
Are you serious right now?  You actually think that if LeBron freaking James punched a teammate in the Lakers lockerroom it wont be leaked?  Freaking Bobby punching Mirotic was leaked
"They have Lebron fucking James, i dont get why they make it look so hard."

"Here's the thing. He's still a top 5 player when he gives his all and cares on both sides on the floor, but age and effort really showed it's signs this year.  Like LeBron James said it himself ""2 points aren't 2 points"" and this year his 27/8/8 aren't the same 27/7/7 he averaged before. Would you really take this LeBron over 06-07 year LeBron who also averaged 27/7/6, but took his team to the finals?  Again, stats don't tell the whole story and everyone who watched the games can see that most of the time his defense was bad and was a negative asset on the defensive side, and his offense didn't carry the same impact team wise (it's easier to guard him 1 on 1, he creates less spacing, because he settles too much on his jump shot). LeBron played this season caring more about his stats than his team.  Again, LeBron is still a top 5 player, but don't act that his level didn't drop significantly this season, and most of that is age related which is fine. No one can stay forever young."
Raptors get: Lebron James    Lakers get: A cup of mildly hot Tim Hortons coffee

You’re right I went to bat for Lebron he was my boy in Cleveland. Idk when he left I just kept following Cleveland and never really followed him to the lakers...and I’ve alsays told my friends I’m a Lebron James fan. Now I say I’m a Cavs fan...wow felt good to admit that. 
Why did I read this as “Lebron James calls out minutemen”
"This is nonsense. Honestly I'm probably older than you. Yes there was some hard defense, especially the Pistons and Knicks of that era, and of course from Bill Laimbeer, but people were not getting crippled and there's no era where a tank like LeBron James would get physically dominated. A lot of NBA players in that era were much weaker and smaller than LeBron.   One of the arguments against Jordan is actually his competition was weak. Magic had to leave because of HIV and then there was really not much of a real threat to Jordan. Pistons also were pretty much gone when Jordan started winning. They didn't meet the Rockets in any of the Finals, and Jordan himself said that's a good thing since they never had an answer for Hakeem.   The best competition Jordan had was those two Utah Jazz teams. And the Bulls were the superteam of that era so not even really then.   I'd be surprised if you were older than 25, I suspect you're just some young kid trying to pretend you are older. If you actually watched Russell play, you'd have to be in your 60s now. But your writing is very immature and antagonistic, and really not befitting someone of that age. Instead it shows the usual anger of a young man and the insecurity of an inexperienced person. If you still insist on being older, it means you never matured and have low ability/intelligence, which casts any observation or thought you make into question. An imbecile in his 60s is not actually worth listening to. "
"The article goes on to say:  &gt; Of course James also has his haters in China, and their nicknames are less flattering. When James first came into the league, he was called “The Little Emperor” (小皇帝) on account of his youth. Most people don’t call him that any more, but “Little Emperor” is also a common slang term for a spoiled only child raised under China’s “One Child Policy” so haters still roll this term out from time to time.   &gt; Others have focused on LeBron’s propensity to travel without getting called for it, dubbing him “Six-Step Bron” (六步郎), using three characters that also sound like “LeBron,” as well as “King of the Crabs” (蟹皇), coined after LeBron tried to claim that his traveling was a legal “crab dribble.”"

"[It's one of his Chinese nicknames, and it's meant to throw shade at him](https://deadspin.com/sprout-god-porcelain-mamba-and-six-step-lebron-the-s-1825949113)  LeBron James probably is best known as 詹皇 (Zhan Huang), which is an attempt to directly translate his English nickname “King James.” The phonetic spelling of “James” in Chinese is 詹姆士 (Zhan Mu Shi), and 皇 (Huang) means “emperor” so this nickname means “Emperor James.”  Another common nickname for James is “Old Beijing” (老北京, Lao Bei Jing), since the initial sounds of these characters spell “LBJ.”  Of course James also has his haters in China, and their nicknames are less flattering.

"Yes, LeBron James is one of if not the best basketball player of all time. Very new info"
"Randle was averaging 16/8/3 and Lopez averaged 13 on 35% from 3. I get that Randle had some really great stretches and Lopez provided a ton of value by spacing the floor, but those are not outstanding numbers.    The overall picture is that LA kept kept their two most impactful players last year (Ingram and Ball), then added LeBron in exchange for two decent starters, and ended up with a similar number of wins. LeBron James should be worth far more than Lopez and Randle, even if you consider games missed and him not playing 100%. "

"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."

Wrong.  “LeBron averages 27/8/8” is a fact.  “James harden averaging 50 ppg makes him the best player ever” is misleading. 
"Well first of all it's not a love for Lebron James that people have that don't agree with this argument because it can be applied to any player in particular. To your argument, just because collectively the league is improving when it comes to points, rebounds, and assists doesn't mean that Lebron is doing bad, it just means that players in the league are getting better at those things compared to last year. Lebron's 27/8/8 is still amazing, but saying that by team averages he is doing worse just doesn't add up."

"Wait, wanting to trade Lebron (assuming a Ricky B article is trustworthy) is ""getting control of the situation"" ?

They didn't lose anything by Paul George saying the Lakers are his preferred destination. "

Lebron for Evan Turner+Harklass. The Lakers love cap space; Portland runs Lillard/McCollum/James/Aminu/Nurkic which actually sounds pretty good. 
"This makes sense. Now the young players didnt like the fact that he came and almost got them traded. A good GM wouldnt have traded so many pieces for AD. Now theres tension in the locker room with lebron. You cant trade James cus hes a vet and face of the league in a players nba, but that would be the best move to make unless you can smooth things over with the young guys. Ingram is un-tradeable, hes too good and young. Ball is selfless, defensively talented, different and despite his shooting woes and i wouldnt trade him either. Tradin bron to a team he wants to go to would be the perfect move. taht way we can sign two free agents that play both sides of the ball"

"""You guys don't need my help, I didn't even make the playoffs last year""   -LeBron James right before he agrees to helping the Loony Tunes, falls back in love with basketball, saves the world and comes back to the Lakers and starts playing defence again probably. "
"You forgot the oldest current superstar guilt of this, Lebron James."
"The problem with signing LeBron James is that you now have to sign ia bunch of shooters to surround him. Then, when his contract is over, you are going to have to overhaul the team again. That’s just no sustainable.  Remember the last championship Laker team (2008-2010) the lineup was PG Fisher, SG Bryant, SF Artest/Odom, PF Gasol, C Bynum. One superstar surrounded with solid players. You don’t need to sign players just because they made the All-Star team last year. I believe the next year they acquired Dwight Howard and Steve Nash but didn’t get out of the first round.    Thirdly, if the Lakers are to bring in another ‘Superstar’ along with LeBron James then there’s going to $$ to sign other players therefore no depth. I just don’t see how they’ll do it but ok.    "
"Lebron has been in the post-season *every season* since '06. Regardless of mitigating factors such as strength of teammates, difficulty of opponents, health, injury etc. he's been in the playoffs *every single season* for thirteen seasons straight.

"&gt;I understand that the Lakers acquired LeBron James in the off season  That's the answer to your question. Lebron has been in the post-season *every season* since '06.

Lebron James and James Harden.   (this should be fun)
"&gt;The idea of terminating the franchise's relationship with Paul by moving James at least crossed Buss' mind, the team source said, and Paul was made aware of that.  I can actually believe this. Not that they were actually going to trade him, but that Jeanie was so angry that she probably wanted to strangle Rich Paul and that idea was said to him to remind him of who is running the show.   You're all acting like Jeanie was putting LeBron on the trading block which makes this unbelievable - that obviously didn't happen. This is a private spat which either somehow got around to BR... or it's all bullshit. I have no idea.   "
"Of course, that's why no one has LeBron in the top 10.   So for you to include him in yours, it speaks to your ability to truly understand his game from years of watching him kill it.   You my friend are the one true fan of LeBron Raymone James. "
You forgot to mention that this was written by Ric “I’m hearing LeBron James and Chris Bosh are headed to Chicago” Bucher
Yeah but no free agent is ever gonna come to a team that missed the playoffs with LeBron James
"I also think Dwight leaving the Lakers to sign with Houston has gone underrated in terms of how much playing for the Lakers isn't all that it is cracked out to be even though Dwight didn't work out for the Rockets either. Heck, Russell Westbrook and Paul George rather stay in OKC than play in their hometown with the Lakers. I think if this LeBron James to the Lakers thing stays a total disaster, it will for ever hurt the Lakers in terms of attracting stars until they get new ownership."
"It don't matter how the hotdog was made. A hotdog is a hotdog.  When Lebron joined the Heat he formed a Super Power that was far beyond anything else in the league. Most experts thought Lebron was going to 3-peat.    Stop changing the narrative.  The reason people got so mad at Lebron for saying ""not 3, not 4, not 5......."" is because people though it was actually going to happen.  And why not?  The Heat had Lebron James the best player in the world at age 26.  Wade a former FMVP still in his prime and a top3 player and Bosh at age 26 a top 5 center.  Together they suppose to rule the league for the next 7 years. They suppose to win 5 rings at minimum.  In fact if Lebron joined the Celtics it would not be as devestating as him joining Wade and Bosh. Ray Allen was already 35. Pierce was already 33. And KG was already 34.  Plus they would have to trade half their roster to fit Lebron. That team would be great for a year or two. But after winning 2 titles Allen/KG/Pierce would be old AF.  People forget how unfair it was for Lebron to join Miami. People forget how ridiculously stacked that Miami team was compared to the rest of the league. They forget because Lebron choked in 2011. They never became a Dynasty. They never meet even half their expectations.  But make no mistake. Lebron made that move to win 5 or 6 Rings. "
"If the Lakers were willing to trade LeBron James after one disappointing season, I don't think any FA would feel safe signing there"
"I'm not salty at all man lol  All I'm saying is that the Lakers have been more exciting to watch than the Clippers this year, not that they've been a better team or that our rings somehow mean something in this context  We have Lebron James. We have *very* entertaining young players in Ball, BI, and Kuz, especially because of how unorthodox Ball and BI are. And we have meme team guys who are flashy and fun on the court. We all know Lance and his crazy park moves and guitar.  I've heard a *lot* this year from fans of other fanbases that the Lakers are super fun to watch. I've heard nothing like that about the Clippers."
"See Jeanie Buss seems like a smart person. Why did she let them make also those terrible trades since signing Lebron James, is confounding."

"Lakers acquire: Capella/Gordon/Tucker + 2 1sts (36m total)  Rockets acquire: LeBron James (35m total)  &amp;#x200B;  New lineups:   Lakers:   PG - Lonzo  SG - Gordon  SF - Ingram   PF - Kuzma  C  - Capella  Bench: Hart, Tucker, Wagner, and still maintain enough cap-space to sign a premier FA this offseason, while also acquiring more 1st round draft picks. Situation looks attractive for someone like KD/Kawhi/Kyrie/Kemba to join a team that looks deeper as well as draft picks to continue upgrading the team long-term.  Why would the Lakers do this? Well, it may one of the few trade destinations that LeBron would actually be okay with and can mutually agree upon, otherwise they won't make any deal without LeBron's consent. They also don't feel pressured anymore to maximize his remaining competitive years, and can go back to focusing on long term development by acquiring assets and draft picks and building an attractive team that a premier FA would be willing to sign with.   &amp;#x200B;  Rockets:  PG - Chris Paul  SG - Harden  SF - Green/Shumpert?  PF - LeBron  C  - Nene/Faried  Honestly, I'm sure they'll find plenty of ring chasers willing to sign cheap contracts to fill out the rest of this lineup once you have CP3/Harden/LeBron together.   Why would the Rockets do this? CP3s window is the same as LeBrons at this point, and if they can't win this year then may as well take the chance and try LeBron/Harden/CP3 together and just let them figure things out. If KD leaves the Warriors, this Rockets team would be the favorites by far. "

"If James wanted to win a title, he wouldn't have gone to the Lakers. He already has 3 rings he doesn't really have to prove anything anymore. He came to LA because he wants to live and settle down there with his family + the Lakers history. If he wanted a better chance at winning, he could have at least gone to the Clippers who are also based in LA. I never saw moving to LA as a move to compete, I viewed it as a throwaway year because the Lakers roster can't improve enough until next year at least.   Though, a part of me wanted to see Lebron make the playoffs and then see how far he could get with the Lakers, and pretty sure if he didn't get injured it was very possible.  "

"It's not just that he missed the playoffs, it's that his team is going to most likely end up with fewer than 35 wins.  If we were told prior to the season that LeBron was missing the playoffs, I think a lot of us would've figured that the Lakers won like 47 games but were 9th, while 8th in the West had 48 wins. Something like that.  The fact that a LeBron James team is going to end up with like 33 wins is so crazy to think about."

"Lol it definitely wasn’t impossible to get back in the race. Even post return Lebron and the Lakers dropped games to the Suns, Hawks and Knicks. I know Zo was injured but if you’re telling me that Lonzo Ball was the difference maker between Lebron friggin James and 3 tanking teams I’d laugh in your face.   They flat out didn’t want it enough. Multiple opportunities to take the Clippers or Jazz out of the race. "
You know I was hating on lebron which was all wrong. The bum ass Lakers have ruined Lebron James year 
"D’Lo helping to eliminate the Lakers is the epitome of poetic justice.   “Play-off mode activated ?”   More like “taking plays off” mode activated.   Lebron doesn’t care about hooping anymore. He will probably retire as the statistical GOAT, however, I’m pretty doubtful that Bron will ever win a championship in LA.  Bron seems to only really cares about building his brand and constructing a life and business endeavours after/outside of professional basketball.  I could even see a presidential campaign in the future.  If Trump can do it, I’m pretty sure Lebron can.   Bron must put his ego and controlling/domineering personality aside and make LA and the idea of playing alongside Lebron James an appealing notion, versus a terrifying and risky one for other superstars.   KD wasn’t lying or exaggerating when he called Lebron fans toxic. Not only are the fans toxic, their toxicity protects Lebron and paints anyone else on the LA roster as the villains and culprits, if the team loses.    I used to be a die-hard Lebron supporter and I feel like I’ve had an epiphany of sorts.  This is a very strange and surreal moment for me.   Feel free to disagree.  I’m a proponent of civil discourse. "
"They didn’t build beforehand around James. Even before LeBron came back to the Cavs (and even after he came) they still had genuine pieces ie Kyrie and getting KLove. I’d say that definitely has to begin with he problems.   Look at the players the Lakers signed once they got LeBron...Lance? Rondo?(I love you Rondo) McGee? Beasley? Etc etc. all signed to 1 yrs, obviously not players that the Lakers were seeing long term, but that’s the problem.  I’m sure the Lakers will see this season as a wake up call and think, “Oh shit, we actually have to improve our youth or make a trade.” We’ll see what happens."
"Hell no kid fuck off with that BULLSHIT.   Lebron James signs with our team then proceeds to give absolutely zero fucks on the court.   /r/nba called it already. Y’all said ges not in LA for basketball. You justified him coming to LA by saying he wants to improve his brand. BUT THE MOMENT WE LAKER FANS GET MAD ABOUT THAT, you say stfu? Fuck you. "
lebron james is just julius randle with court vision
Now Lebron James is free for filming Space Jam 2 and his other hollywood adventures this summer.
Lebron James has been Finalsn’t
"it's literally just because it's James Harden doing this to these people  imagine if LeBron was having this kind of season, the MVP trophy would already be engraved and shipped to his house"
And Lebron James apparently
James Jones carried LeBron James to 3 titles. The real GOAT
Also from Tommy Beer:  Highest scoring games in the NBA this season:  James Harden: 61 James Harden: 61 Kemba Walker: 60 James Harden: 58 James Harden: 58 James Harden: 57 James Harden: 57    Games with 57 or more points in their entire CAREERS:  LeBron James: 2 Allen Iverson: 2 Melo: 1 Larry Bird: 1 Shaq: 1 Jerry West: 1 Oscar Robertson: zero Kevin Durant: zero Steph Curry: zero  Games with 57+ points THIS SEASON: James Harden: 6
"James Harden isn’t going to stop Lebron from scoring, but Lebron isn’t stoping Harden either since he’ll call foul every possession. "
"That's what happens when you let a dumb ass player who thinks hes smarter than he really is run your team. Hahaha. Fuck the Lakers and lebitch James. You fucking suck at being a ""GM"" lebron. Hahaha. "
"I didn’t know that was the bar for relevancy lol. People talk about us when we win or lose. And you can love him or hate him, but LeBron James is still the best player in basketball. People pretend as if he’s washed up, even though he just averaged like 36-8-7 in last year’s playoffs, including one of the greatest performances in finals history. He’s averaging monstrous numbers this year despite suffering an injury that took him some time to heal from.   Also I think we have a championship as of 2010 - when did the Knicks last win one? What about the bulls? How about clippers? What about you guys? I can’t remember that one too well.   Also, we’re so irrelevant that you’ve spent a lot of energy telling me and other laker fans about how irrelevant this team is lol. Seems like we run through your mind quite a bit. Going through your post history without even scrolling, the last 10 comments are all about us lol. Maybe we have different meanings of relevancy. "
I never thought I'd see the day that my dumbass team would be close to 50 wins and Lebron James wouldn't be going to the playoffs.
James Jones lowkey the best James not even close @Lebron @Harden
"The Lakers just wasted a year of JaVale McGee's prime by putting scrubs like Lance Stevenson, LeBron James, and Michael Beasley around him. smh"
"I don't wanna get angry. I just wanna say that Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka are mainly to blame. Injuries are also to blame. Luke deserves SOME blame but it's minimal. But it don't matter. Luke will get fired. Mark Jackson or Jason Kidd or somebody equally as bad will take the job and they'll miss the playoffs again next year. Imagine signing LeBron James and then building a completely garbage team because you're big Magic Johnson. Nobody knows better than you. The amount of hubris this takes as an executive of the most popular NBA team in the world is **STUNNING**. You just know that whoever Luke coaches next will overachieve in the first year because everyone who leaves the Lakers winds up doing better. You just know it. I'm confident that even if Gar/Pax were in charge of building around LeBron, they would have had the common sense to do how Cleveland and Miami did it and not claim to know better than the rest of the league. Fucking amateur hour. This team is never going to be good again. "
"I mean advanced defensive stats are trash. Russell Westbrook MVP year he was not a good defender and admitted as much. PG literally worked with him on that the offseason after he got to OKC. But by advanced metrics, his MVP season he was a great defender because most advanced defensive stats factor in rebounding. Currently LBJ is having a good rebounding season as such, DBPM has him as a positive when he has not been.  I mean, would you really rather have LeBron than Draymond for defense? PJ Tucker, Pat Beverley, Marcus Smart, Ibaka, Capela and PG are all lower than him on DBPM. DWS similar.  He is considered the 63rd best defender. James Harden 26th. Advanced defensive stats are not good. Most are box score state generated."
apologies for poor english when were you when lebron james dies? i was at home when pyotr ring 'lebron is kill' 'no'
"Lebron GOAT James.   Getting Old And Tired.   And it’s only fitting that D’Lo was the one that would be responsible for the Lakers elimination.   Skip was right, Lebron went to LA to chase Michael B Jordan, instead of Michael Jeffrey Jordan. "
*BREAKING NEWS* LeBron James has been traded to the Brooklyn Nets via trade
"Yeah, I agree with you. I was just about to finish writing my comment when LeBron James came back into the game, so I added that last sentence as an update to LeBron's slip/fall lmao 😂😂😂"
and his old team got lebron james
&gt; LeBron James has officially been failed to make the playoffs  lmao
As a non-practicing Cavs fan? IT. He was never meant to wear a Cavs uniform.   On the flip side I would love to have Lebron fucking James back in my conference (Cleveland specifically) he’d work well with Sexton and Zion...
"Yeah, I did type ""LeBron James"" a little too much in that comment lol my bad"
"It's not about the thick and thin. It's about you literally spending all that money on an overpriced ticket on the fact that Lebron James is on the team but will end up not watching him.   If you actually have that much money, help me pay for some of my college tuition lol"
"&gt;Buying out Deng a year early preventing two max slots  You do know that the Los Angeles Lakers have another max slot this offseason? That would be the Lakers 2nd max slot after LeBron James took the 1st max slot. You can criticize Magic Johnson for a lot of things, but I don't know why you decided to include this part, when it's just not true lol"
HERE COMES ~~AUSTIN RIVERS~~ LEBRON JAMES 
Where were you when LeBron James and the Lakers missed the playoffs 
LeBron James
i feel so bad for you that you think westbrook is even remotely comparable to lebron james...
Smart move signing Lebron James to secure the tank
"LeBron James was kind of grimacing walking to the bench, hopefully LeBron is alright. I get scared for a second whenever an NBA player hits the floor, especially LeBron James. It also looks like LeBron James came back to the game to shoot 1 more shot, so it looks like LeBron is alright thankfully."
WE JUST ELIMINATED LEBRON FRICKIN JAMES FROM THE PLAYOFFS
The last time Lebron James didn't make the playoffs was more than half my lifetime ago.  End of an era.

Injury Report: Lebron James - Shin Splint. Out for season
I still think LeBron is amazing and a top 5 player. But I have to say if you're just focusing on offense I think Steph Curry Kevin Durant or James Harden are number one this year
The best player in the league and Lebron James are going at each other right now. 
"That’s like saying there’s a big difference between James Harden and Luka Doncic... LBJ, whether people want to acknowledge it or not, is in the twilight of his career. Harden and Lebron are in two different stages of their careers. "
"While he was mentioned earlier on his career as being a challenger to Lebrons Throne, I've never seen a season where a decent number of people considered him better than Lebron at that moment. There were definitely some who projected he would be better eventually, but it wasn't until he joined the Warriors these past 3 years that a decent number of people started to believe him better than Lebron. In fact He wasn't very much in the Convo during the 14-15 &amp; 15-16 seasons, his top of the league reputation had faded a bit by then.  Most lists don't even have him in the top 2 and I can't find any lists or big analysts that had him ahead of Lebron (as some have the last couple years). During those years it was Steph who is the only one that is occasionally mentioned as being better than Lebron.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/sports/nba-top-100-players-2016/?noredirect=on   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2573269-nbas-top-25-players-entering-2015-16-training-camp#slide26   https://www.newsday.com/sports/basketball/10-best-nba-players-for-2016-17-season-1.12489149  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarank1_2016/nbarank-1-cleveland-cavaliers-forward-lebron-james  http://www.basketballinsiders.com/the-top-10-players-in-the-nba-2015/"
"also poor shot with lebron james still under his own rim.  If it was a miss, it would have been an easy 2 going the other way"
LeBron “mesJa ronLeb” James. 
"Lebron ""Lebron James"" James."
"kevin durant does not have to try incredibly hard in the regular season because he's on the most stacked team in the history of the NBA  lebron james coasting in the regular season is so well-known, i shouldn't have to spell it out  kevin durant in his mvp season: 32.0 ppg on 63.5 ts%  in the playoffs: 29.6 ppg on 57.0 ts%  is kevin durant not a great player? no, the circumstances of james harden, gsw kd and cle lebron are just completely different and you need to understand that"
Not even close...Zion can be a good nba player in the right roll...Lebron James is absolutely the the best to ever play the game...I don’t like lebron because his loyalty is weak to say the least and he’s a cry baby...but not respecting his ability to play the game is asinine.. Zion Williamson and a stacked duke team is not comparably to James rookie year with a bottom of the barrel Cleveland team...lebron could of taken Akron high school to the final four 
"I don't really remember that, no. Maybe bad memory on my part but I really don't remember prevailing opinion being that LeBron was *not* going to the Lakers. Quite the contrary.   The likeliest candidates were the Lakers, Celtics, 76ers...and Rockets and Spurs. * Celtics seemed a no-go, given that he'd be following Kyrie. * Rockets also, given what Rockets would have had to clear and the essential certainty that CP3+Harden+LeBron all at max would mean that they'd never have anything but a G-League supporting cast and would never be a legit contender. * Spurs seemed like a *long* shot because of the unlikelihood of James playing in a small market that isn't in Northern Ohio. And not having a very attractive roster/set of building blocks for contending within 2 years. * 76ers would have been an ugly basketball fit, given the already-existing spacing issues of having Simmons and Embiid.   I always thought it was widely accepted that Lakers were the most obvious option:  * LA as a media market, and specifically *the* entertainment market. * Lakers franchise history and LeBron being able to make his Act III about bringing the franchise back to championship form. * Multiple young, talented players on rookie contracts."
Not surprising. You guys have a pretty terrible roster but you guys also had LeBron James for like 11 of the last 16 years so it’s hard to feel sympathy for ya. 
*except for Lebron James
"Good, the nba was getting too predictible. Every year the same thing, LeBron James vs Jeff Teague. It’s like, yeah, it was all-time great rivalry, but enough is enough "
"No i know Olympians typically do, but Lebron James? I don't think so, he does this all the time, he'll grab dinner with random people. Most olympians  arent famous like lebron james, they're just all insanely fit people and share the hotels the entire trip. I 100% would bet my left nut if he wanted he'd be hooking up with random models on the down-low and he wouldn't need to ask some girl to dinner first. "

"Russell was traded by Lakers GM Magic Johnson a few years ago, citing that he needed a ""leader"". Now most of this move had more to do with unloading Timofey Mozgov's massive contract in order to make space for LeBron James and eventually draft Lonzo Ball as Russell's replacement.   Another reason some believe Russell was traded was because of an incident involving Nick Young, in which Russell released a recording of Young saying that he often cheated on his girlfriend at the time, Iggy Azalea. Russell earned a reputation as a snitch for this incident.  Arguably the move was a success for the Lakers since they landed James. Arguably not since they are about to miss the playoffs and their future relies on trading for Anthony Davis or landing him (or another big name free agent) via free agency.   But the main argument against trading Russell is simple: He's transformed into an All-Star and he's only just turned 23 years old. He'd likely be a great fit with the Lakers current roster, along with a slew of other former Lakers like Lou Williams and Julius Randle. Magic Johnson has taken a lot of heat, and rightfully so, for these moves.   It would be sweet revenge for Russell, who has undoubtedly become the leader of the Nets, to eliminate his former team from the playoffs."
Yep [22.3/5.7/3.4 44% FG 51.9% TS](https://fadeawayworld.net/2018/04/30/comparing-lebron-james-and-kobe-bryants-stats-in-elimination-games/)   In fairness to him when Im talking about how the Lakers would just flat out collapse and cave by the end of series they lost it went beyond Kobe. Many of those Laker Phil Jackson seasons were rife with turmoil and tension all year and when things don't go your way and you start losing all that tension gets to the point that guys just have no interest in competing. They always were on the edge. 
Imagine tanking while you have LeBron James on your team.
"Lebron James should not make All Nba this year.  In 2016 the voters kept Harden out after putting up 29/7/5 on 60% TS.  Media said Harden played no defense, team was toxic, and only won 41 games.  This year Lebron is putting up 27/8/8 on 59% TS.  Lebron played on defense, team is toxic, and will only win 35 games.  If the Media votes Lebron All Nba they are hypocrites and playing favorites."
"The lakers traded Russell a few seasons ago to create some cap space to eventually sign LeBron James. When Russell was traded, Magic Johnson said he wasn’t the leader he needed for the lakers.   When you are traded away as the former number 2 overall pick, especially only after playing two years, people will label you as bust. But Russell worked his butt off and become an all star this year, and he can mathematically eliminate LeBron and the lakers from the playoffs.   Russell has also been killing it the past few weeks in terms of scoring. He’s definitely going to get the green light to bomb on the lakers tonight "
"Uhh lebron James, Dwight Howard, Tmac, Tyson chandler, STAT, and most importantly Thon Maker?"
The Player's Tribune  #I'm Really Coming Home This Time  by LeBron James
"That’s where you’re wrong. I’ve been a fan since 1997 when I was nine years old. I’ve seen the Lakers go up and down throughout time. The Kobe Bryant and Shaq years of course are amazing. And some bumpy roads in between within the Kobe alpha  yearsWe’re great as well and it really was easy being a fan those times. But since Kobe’s Achilles injury and sitting through the 2012 season when we got the Dwight  HowardHas been one disappointing season after another I watched every game I could they these down years since then When Xavair  Henry was Our best player. When Jordan Clarkson was our best player. And when D’AngeloRussell is the best player. I’ve been Waiting for a winning season for quite a while. I loved our young talent I didn’t want to move any of them I understand D’Angelo Russell was To get rid of the Mozgov Contract and we wouldn’t have Kuzma without it..And hell partly not even LeBron James.And that brings us to current I was happy with the front office at first and proud that I had Rob Palanca who is Kobe Bryant’s best friend and Magic Johnson the lake or legend who turns everything to gold, and I cried tears of joy when I got LeBron James because I knew I was going to go to the playoffs finally. But then we got hit with injury then the front office made terrible moves we should’ve kept Zubac. The Anthony Davis trade disheartened the youth in Los Angeles. There was distance between the veterans and the young players crushing our season. So yeah I’m a little pissed. And don’t say I’m not a huge fan"
"Right now? Yeah, I agree. I wonder how Lonzo and Fox would compare if Zo was on the Kings and vice versa. LeBron took a lot of opportunities from Zo's game this season so maybe he would play better on the Kings right now. I think it's undeniably harder to develop your playmaking ability with LeBron James on your team. Every possession it seems, the game plan is: get the ball to LeBron and let him score or facilitate. I don't think that's conducive to Lonzo's game (or Ingram's, which is why he struggled early). Especially when you consider that those two basically ran the offense last year. "
"This is 100% true.  KD didn't start this fire. He simply adjusted to the landscape of the NBA.  But I guess ONLY Lebron James gets to form Super teams.  In 2010 the elite teams only had 1 or 2 stars in their PRIME. So Lebron formed a Super team with THREE Stars in their prime.  In 2016 the elite teams had 2 or 3 stars in their PRIME. So KD formed a Super team with FOUR Stars in their prime.  KD and Lebron did the exact same thing adjusted for era and landscape of the league.  Lebron went to Miami for easy titles. He said it himself:  ""Not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6..........its going to be EASY"""
"Lmao facts. Prime Bosh isn't turned into a 3rd option who started to focus on passing spacing and defense. Prime Bosh is Raptors Bosh Number 1 option. Prime Wade my bumhole, Wade in 07 season had surgery for a dislocated shoulder and knee surgery and was diagnosed with ""jumpers knee"". 07-08 shut down at the end of the season because of his knee and had OssaTron treatment for it. Offseason knee treatment. Missed the 2012 Olympics recovering from left knee surgery. 2012-2013 playoffs was the most evident of his treads being worn the fuck off his tires with lows in fg% and ppg.   Wade was literally going to retire during the big 3 era his knees hurt so much and Bosh Bron and others talked him out of it. If ""Prime"" Wade hurts to even move I don't think they know what Prime means lol.  Wade was in such pain that it took the enjoyment out of the game. He seriously thought about retiring. “My knees were in so much pain,” Wade said. “In my right knee, I had two sets of different bone bruises. I also had chondromalacia under the kneecap, which irritates the kneecap to the extent where it’s just more pain. In my left knee, I had three surgeries so I’m dealing with arthritis. I’m dealing with swelling and all the stuff that comes with that.” The pain was nearly too much for Wade, despite the excellent position he was in career-wise. “It was a time where I didn’t want to do it anymore. I didn’t want to be in pain anymore.” Advice from best friends LeBron James and Chris Bosh, as well as a lessened workload,  helped Wade continue his career."
Title almost went without mentioning LeBron James. 
"I know, see LeBron James. I'm still curious"
"So who was the better player then? Kobe, who had Gasol, Odom, Artest, and Phil Jackson around him? But I guess LeBron couldn’t perform in the playoffs, only put up 25/8/8 in 07 playoffs, 28/8/8 in 08, 35/9/7 in 09, and 29/9/8 in 2010. Him leaving was definitely about making a superteam, because his previous FO had shown they were too incompetent to build a team around LeBron James lol. None of them took less money or were hopping on a championship squad, the Heat were shite in 2010.   I don’t know why you’re lumping me in with LeBron stans, but since 2nd stint Cleveland of course you would ask this dude who he wants on his team, he’s trying to build a championship squad and their FO incompetence was getting in the way.    "
This team does not care about stats. That is why they are SO GREAT. Winning is everything.   What a stark contrast to Lebron James who chases stats.
LeBron James. 
"I remember: That was the year that Nike did that puppet advertisement run, and that god damn LeBron James didn’t fulfill his part ...Now we’ve got to endure the “who was better”, argument until the end of time. "
You have to put the team designation like “[UTA] LeBron James”
"But you got James the best of the 2003 draft class, who carried Miami and Cleveland to rings in 2012,2013, and 2016, alongside dead weights the likes of Lebron, Chris Bosh, and Kyrie"
"Giannis, Kawhi, Simmons, Embiid, Butler, Harris, Oladipo, Kyrie, Horford, Hayward, Blake Griffin, D'Angelo Russell, Dwyane Wade, Kemba Walker, John Wall, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Stephen Curry, Demarcus Cousins, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, Paul Millsap, James Harden, Chris Paul, Clint Capela, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Lou Williams, Danillo Gallinari, Demar Derozan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Karl Anthony-Towns, Derrick Rose, Lebron James, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Marc Gasol, Dirk Nowitzki, Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, Dearon Fox.

"You can google it, but Jeanie Buss has said verbatim that she doesn't make basketball decisions and doesn't involve herself in those decisions; she doesn't consider herself a basketball expert. This has been known for awhile now.  Jeanie doesn't conduct meetings with free agents or tell Rob and Magic who to go get. She didn't even meet with LeBron once, and didn't meet him and talk with him until a few months after the Lakers acquired him. Theoretically she has the final word but she leaves it up to her basketball department(Rob and magic) to construct the roster.  ""When you talk about who’s running the basketball side of the Lakers, Magic Johnson is the head of basketball. He makes all basketball decisions. He is the one that laid down the path that led to bringing LeBron here, he is at the top of the organizational chart when it comes to basketball, and he’s done a fantastic job.”-Jeanie Buss  https://www.lakersnation.com/jeanie-buss-responds-lebron-james-magic-johnson-lakers-basketball-decisions/2018/09/12/"
"It wasn't a vague thing I'm referencing.

There's bigger threats in my neighborhood than LeBron James, so I have no fear whatsoever of LeBron.""  I remember after that specifically Amin Elhassan mocking him for that, talking about how the area he grew up was known for being pretty affluent. I'm not familiar with where he grew up and maybe Amin is full of shit, but I remember specifically what I heard."

"It’s definitely hard to come out guns blazing night in and night out when this team literally is just waiting for the post-season.   Why would he even want to be playing in these games lately? There’s no real challenge, no real drive to play real basketball until the post-season. He isn’t chasing any individual awards, and he has nothing left to prove on this team.

Who's Lebron James?
"Wow, this is the dumbest question I've ever seen on this sub -- imagine thinking the greatest player who has ever lived deserves to have his name mentioned among scrubs like LeBron James."
The only people allowed to take jump shots should be Jayson Tatum or Lebron James
"Do you know how the cap works? If they kept DLo and Randle there wouldn’t be space for another guy.   &gt; You realize that cap-space is only useful if people are coming, right?   Well they’ve already used some of that space for LeBron James ... let’s see what this summer brings. "
"Lol none of the guys you listed are in their second year.   DLo is in his 4th, Ingram is in his 3rd, Randle is in his 5th.   They gave up on those guys for fucking LeBron James and a chance to get another superstar so they can actually compete for championships instead of sitting around hoping for someone to break out so they can be a perennial 7th or 8th seed.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true          shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?    "
Dwight was clearly competing with LeBron because the first year he won DPOY guess who was in second place ... LeBron James. 
"McManamin implies that we know Luke Walton is the head coach of the Lakers, but that we don't know the Lakers have a star player named LeBron James."
Im 25. So growing up I got to see him dominate. Thats what sparked my interest. I watched a Kobe highlight real a few minutes ago. In the clip he nailed a jumpshot fadeaway 3 while being double teamed by Lebron James and some other dude from the Cavaliers. That led me to this post.
I have a feeling this has more to do with optics than it does with his injury. The laker brand is at an all time low right now and having a struggling King James getting boo'd at the Staples Center is a BAD look. Especially with the basketball media constantly talking about Lebron and the lakers after every game.   It tarnishes the laker brand for future free agents who might see the lakers as a shit storm with a media circus attached.
lebron james was the champion in the East for almost a decade. i think it would be a bigger deal if he failed to reach the finals in the east.
ESPN out here already found their new Lebron James whom they are going to be talking about every day lol
Lebron James is the best basketball player in the world 
"A older, borderline top 15 player. So someone like Lebron James"
You had lebron fucking james and youre using injuries as an excuse haha fuck you.  Fucking lakers fans.  
"Forgive me, I am a biased Bulls fan—that said:  RE: Cleveland drop off  Cleveland drop off was alarming but not truly unexpected. Has to do with a team built around the most talented single player in the league. When you take away the variable the equation is built around, we should expect significant disfunction. I did not watch specifically cleveland that year so I cant say HOW BAD we should expect them to be. But we should consider that the team was built around that massive jenga  RE: MVP &amp; narrative  On Achievement vs talent: an example Did the smartest kid in your class ever underperfom his natural ability? Is the valedictorian always the smartest student? Person can be understood by all to be the most talented while losing in pure achievement. In this example, the achievement is awarded different than talent.   Historically, there is a narrative. That narrative was built on game after game of Rose being the most valuable player to any one team.  He was vital to the Bull’s achievement. Absolutely critical, if you will.  It was a hell of a season, and Rose earned that MVP. He was not absolutely the best talent when compared to Lebron, but he was still the most important piece hands down.   Unfortunately for Lebron, his team had less success than expected because of LeBron’s impact on wade and Bosh. Note: I did not say bc his team underachieved, but WHY they underachieved—directly related to Lebrons actions. He was so efficient and yet the following year we saw a truer lebron. The one we Expected.   The team does better when Lebron is the clearcut Alpha. It was known, but often murky at that point in time. In reflection, we better understand the reality of 2011 season. At that time, it really hurt his campaign for MVP when the NBA audience did not get what we expected.   Part of that year was that Bosh was a monster in Toronto and Wade was widely regarded as capable of carrying a team himself. They were both dangerous foes.   No one on the bulls roster was capable of being #1. I mean no disrespect, as these starters (Deng, Noah, Boozer) absolutely contributed to the bulls success.  They were great starters for that team. But we all know their achievement was their max output. A synergistic max output. It was special. They were GREAT role players. Solid starters.   Its a stars game tho. Sometimes we just could not score a bucket to save our life, and Rose would repeatedly save them. Teams planned entirely around him. He did not have the luxury of deferring to a BOSS like Wade, or a trusted rock-solid talent like Bosh. Bosh was really great and very skilled.   Having a healthy wade and bosh is a different narrative to pull off. The following year Heat gelled and Lebron pulled back to back MVP narrative seasons.   Was lebron james the best player in the league in terms of pure talent—yes. I think it is safe to generally say that for every year as mentioned above...   but the award attempts to confirm: Did he outperform Rose’s accomplishments? Not that year. The Heat didnt look good right away and it had everything to do with how the 3 all stars were not understanding their roles together. This is bad for the narrative of an entertainment team sport.   Right, wrong, or whatever...this was the narrative of the Most Valuable Player award that year.   "
They did say that about the three but if we open up for the four point shot how long before that is not enough? Another fifty years or so? I hope I’m alive to see all that. I can just imagine Lebron James Jr the 3rd from way downtown!!! :p

CP3 was injured at the start of the series.   Warriors also won the championship cause Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love went down fym lol.

"&gt;This season Harden has put his team on his back and has done whatever the team had needed him to, to win. Similar to LeBron in the second half of last season. He deserves the MVP because I haven’t seen another player control the game the way Harden does since 12-13 Bron.  You know, I know, everyone in the world knows that if you had to pick one of these players to win a playoff game, its James 100/100 times.   This is like the 5th or 6th season in a row where people say LeBron ain't the best player in the league based on regular season, then playoffs come and guess what?

Oh come on Lue won with Lebron James. Brad Stevens brought Jae Crowder and Avery Bradley to a conference finals and then nearly defeated Lebron with a rookie as his top scorer. He hasn’t had he success of Pop obviously but those 2 coaching performances are far more impressive than what Spoelstra has done for example 
nah you're really not getting destroyed.   It's totally fair to look at LeBron James in his rookie year versus LeBron James just 5 years later.  And then of course LeBron James from 2012-present.    Or just compare LeBron at 22 versus Jordan at 22.  Then them at 32 and 32.  Jordan looks like he's been working out normally whereas LeBron looks like the fucking hulk.  guy is fucking jacked to all hell.

"Harden an equal defender compared to LeBron? Are you kidding me? Harden reminds of those players who only focus on scoring but no work on the defense. Scoring is easy, but stopping the other team from scoringis where the difference is made. I think plenty of James Harden shaqtin and compilation videos of his fails in the defense will easily prove that many times he doesn't even try. I'm not saying he's not playing well, he's playing quite well and am loving his performance but you can't compare LeBron's defense to whatever Harden tries to do. One more thing, he just tied in most number of 3p misses in a game against the Kings. Can the best player in the NBA have such stats?"
Hello police? LeBron James is trying to give me depression the same way he did to Kevin Love.
lebron couldnt take those lakers to the playoffs no way james taking the suns
"Actually a decent analogy.  LeBron James, one of the top 5 players in the world - couldn’t lead the lakers to the playoffs.  Hard to expect Booker to with a worse roster around him."
Lebron doesnt need to prove anything to anybody. His legacy is cemented. Harden still has a lot to prove in the playoffs. This season changes nothing for Lebron James meanwhile this playoffs is gonna mean a lot for James Harden. enough regular season talk. do it in the playoffs and he’ll be the best. simple. 
this is what seperates the best player in the league from the rest. Lebron James turns it up in the playoffs. He actually gets better the tougher the competition. Harden has either played at the same level or worse.

Dunno if u guys out there get that right but somehow this is a damn sad year. Season wasted. Over a month injured. Obvious decline. Transfer window fail. As a player I would now avoid joining the Lakers for the first time in my lifetime. Even those awfull teams and  rosters Kobe had to deal with felt different. Now LeBron is shut down.

I agree but putting him all NBA over LeBron James is kinda ridiculous 
LeBron has basketball talent few on this earth have. He’s more valuable than any of our troops. I could join the military tomorrow if I pass a drug test. It’s that easy. They take just about anyone. Don’t compare troops to a professional basketball player. You don’t risk LeBron James getting injured in 6 meaningless games. They are already out of playoff contention. 
"My question is ""Will he make the All-NBA team?"" I know this sound silly, because it's fucking LeBron James, but the facts are those: Lakers will miss the playoffs; James only played in 55 games; the narrative is going to be against him. He still averaged 27.4/8.5/8.3 on 51/34/66.5 shooting, but this year the forward spots are going to competitive.  I think most people will agree that Giannis, Durant, George, Kawhi are ahead of LeBron. Then you have 2 spots left in the forward position. You have Blake Griffin who's having a fantastic season and may lead Pistons to the playoffs; then you have LaMarcus Aldridge leading the Spurs to the playoffs while having a great season on both ends of the floor. Hell, even Anthony Davis (I don't think he will make it) could steal some votes from LeBron."

"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/obpm_yearly.html  Jordan led the league in offense for 7 seasons vs Lebron led the league for 8. Granted this accounts for passing and not just scoring. If you look at scoring titles and nothing else Lebron  is behind.   MVP’s: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/925sg9/mvps_throughout_the_years_if_they_were_determined/  Jordan was the most Valuable player for 7 years in a row but the MVP award has a narrative component and thus he didn’t win MVP in every year he was most valuable.  Though he did win an MVP despite not being the most valuable player in the year. Lebron has the been the leader for value for 9 years the most in league history: despite never beating Jordan’s Peaks. This is the nba value definition more or less so lbj really has been great just not as Peak Great as Jordan. It’s really how you want to value the goat  Scoring: while not Lebron James strong suit something you may find interesting. So despite him not being the scoring champ he set a record of being second place for “points champion” 8 years in a row.  By points champion I mean total points scored in a year and not just scoring average. Since situations such as last season exist where Lebron scores the most points in the league, but James harden played less games and had a higher average. Jordan’s era players played every game so this was something you didn’t have to look for.   There are other accolades it’s really just depends on what accolades or achievements you value that make the player the best. Jordan’s has all of the peak records but nothing for longevity. Lebron is longevity. "
Uh idk personally I think it’s fun to see LeBron James in person.
I mean every statistic indicates that the Lakers have played significantly better without Rondo on the floor this season. No matter which line-up.

[Also the only regularly used combination with LeBron that has a negative net rating.](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612747/lineups-advanced/?Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;GroupQuantity=2&amp;sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=GROUP_NAME*R*James)  And we know that LeBron's minutes are staggered with the other major ballhandler so he will always play with a backup PG.   
"This is... idk what to say. The bench unit was the best bench in the league, but their starters weren't a bad team. It's been a consistent playoff team for 5 seasons, when looking at it from any point. Yes, they got swept, but there was a matchup problem that didn't hit the Celtics or Pacers as hard last year. Siakam is much in better position to defend K Love than JV or Ibaka were. And they never had anyone to defend James, not even to slow him down, that's not his fault. I'm not saying he's a great player, I'm saying he's a very good player that has been better than all the other 5 in the list, and that he's the most disrespected player in the league probably, because he wasn't able to beat LeBron (which no player could in the east in 8 years).

"We're all caught up in the MVP, with James Harden scorching the nets all season long and raising questions regarding ""what is the ceiling for a modern NBA scorer?""       Beyond Harden, there are plenty of insanely talented and young scorers in the NBA, from Devin Booker to Karl Towns to Luka and Trae. These guys are all so young; maybe someday one of them could catch Kareem (or LeBron).       But I'm not here to talk about those guys. No, I'm here to discuss Lakers star Lonzo Ball. Can he become the NBA's all-time leading scorer?       In order to calculate the stats, I had to assume a couple of things.       \- I'm assuming he will get no better as a scorer, ever.       \- I'm assuming he will never miss another game in his entire career.       \- I'm assuming the percentage of his shots that come from 3 and from the free throw line will not change.       These are all incredibly safe assumptions to make.       So, what would it take for Lonzo to pass Kareem?       Currently, he's sitting at \*\*993 career points.\*\* He would need \*\*37,395 more points\*\* to pass Kareem as of today.       Roughly 49.85% of his points have been scored from 3. 44.91% of his points have been scored from 2. And 5.24% of his points have been scored from the free throw line.       By extrapolating these numbers, it would take:       \- \*\*6,213.8\*\* 3-point baskets (he's currently made 165)       \- \*\*8,397.05\*\* 2-point baskets (he's currently made 223)       \- \*\*1,959.5\*\* Free Throws (he's currently made 52)       How long would it take Lonzo Ball to reach those numbers if he played 82 games every season?       At his current scoring rate, it would only take Lonzo Ball \*\*45.6 seasons of NBA basketball without ever missing a game to pass Kareem.\*\*       That would make him 66 years old in his last NBA season. If things hold up, that would be second all-time to Vince Carter in age.       So is it likely? Tough to say. I think at this juncture we just need to sit back and enjoy the ride."

Tier 1: Lebron Tier 2: Durant Tier 3: Steph, James, Kawhi, Giannis, Davis Tier 4: PG, Embiid, Dame, Kyrie, Russ, maybe Jokic   And with the argument originally being that he is/isn’t top 5, seeing that he’s at worst top 7, it’s such a small difference to make. Not to mention he’s a lot closer to top 5 than he is to 8th imo."
"Ok but your also shitting all over the other guy for sourcing from ""  unreliable reporters"" but quoting woj regarding LeBron James intentions when woj is completely unreliable and doesn't have sources with LeBron. So I chose to ignore your unreliable source just as you have."

&gt;Shaq can talk down to anyone not named LeBron James  &amp;#x200B;  Lol I think you may be forgetting a few people
"Here let me make it simpler for you.  James Harden is an integral part of his team and he plays a lot of minutes. If he plays, and subsequently produces less, they're not in play for the 2 seed let alone in playoffs contention.  LeBron missed 18 games. He wasn't available but he damn sure got rest. Turns out rest don't mean shit if you're essential and unavailable."
"Pierce and McGrady were All Stars and on a few occasions All NBA. They’re never mentioned in the All Time Great discussions though. But they get paid to talk, so let them talk.   Shaq is one of the most dominant players in NBA history. Outside LeBron, no one currently playing can say they’ve had a career to match his. Shaq can talk down to anyone not named LeBron James."
"I don’t think Lebron James is one of the top 3 basketball players to ever play the game.   Wilt was clearly better than him, so the 1&amp;2 spots are locked out.   I am not convinced lebron is better than the rest of the field all competing for that 3 spot."
"Tim Duncan existed and then LeBron James existed, Kobe was never the best"
Not good enough.  That stat does not take into account the constant grind of playing a western conference schedule. Go ask Lebron James. When you have to play solid teams 3 or 4 times every week it grinds on you. While the Bucks have about 20 games a year against pathetic East teams that they can win in their sleep.
"The reports of Lebron to LA have been happening since the Warriors lost in 2016. It started out small and then was at it's apex during 17-18 all star break when the Cavs looked like shit. Most of the league thought it was LA, what r/nba thought has nothing to do with it.  Here are just a smidgen of articles from well before he signed  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/predicting-los-angeles-lakers-2018-19-starting-lineup-with-lebron-james-060917  https://www.complex.com/sports/2017/06/lebron-james-2018-free-agency-rumors-lakers  http://thesource.com/2016/06/20/espns-stephen-a-smith-believes-that-lebron-james-might-leave-cavaliers-for-la-lakers-or-miami-heat/  https://www.forbes.com/sites/mitchlawrence/2018/02/08/how-the-lakers-set-themselves-up-to-land-lebron-james-in-july/  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2017/07/18/the-noisiest-chatter-at-nba-summer-league-is-lebron-james-indeed-destined-for-the-lakers/"
LeBron James would never have the balls to take that shot
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  MVP voters hate James Harden  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Harden in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Harden game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that Giannis Antetekounmpo is better than James Harden, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Harden in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Harden is better.  You might be jealous of Harden’s 36ppg, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  These voters would make you think that Hardenisn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Harden talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Cavaliers literally brought back LeBron James just to win after he roasted them by leaving for Miami.  I mean, did the cavaliers not bring in Richard Jefferson specifically to beat the warriors with LeBron?"
"Yeah because the Bulls actually surrounded him with talent. Who did James have in his first 7 years with the Cavs that even slightly resembled Scottie Pippen? Mo Williams lol? Jordan won because he had help to win. He didn't win anything until Scottie showed up.   He also needed Phil Jackson, one of the greatest coaches in NBA history. Who did LeBron have? Mike Brown? The guy who's being paid by like three teams because two fired him early into his contract?   MJ didn't have to ring chase because the Bulls built a team around him worthy of contending. That's not a diss on MJ -  no player wins it by themselves. But the Cavs didn't really give James any of those pieces. "

"See my flair? Do you think there's a reason there's no team there?   I'm an international fan. I don't have a team. I love players and good basketball. I'm a LeBron fan, a Steph fan, a giannis fan, a Westbrook fan, etc etc etc. Basically I just Stan the whole fucking league. Except for one dude who's play is so fucking annoying that I just can't fathom enjoying it. James harden. Such a shitty, annoying, 12-year-old style of play.   Imagine playing against James harden and he shoves into you at the 3pt line, flailing his arms while launching the ball in the vague direction of the hoop. He eyes the ref and gets the call. Imagine he climbs your back. Imagine he locks on to your arm. Imagine he literally runs out of bounds like he did earlier in the season even when a whistle wasn't called because he's so confident in himself getting the call that when the ref doesn't call it, he acts all surprised as if he should have just played the fucking game of basketball instead of literally running out of bounds because he was so sure he'd get the call.   Just the thought of playing someone like this makes me angry. He plays like that asshole in the gym that nobody wants to play against. Not because he's too good, but because he just plays like a fucking douchebag.   If you're a rockets fan and you recognize that but you don't care because he gets Ws, cool. But don't fucking pretend it's not happening. "

LeBron James averaged more points rebounds and assists than Kyle Lousy and DeFrozan combined last year
"According to Steve Kerr, Lebron James is the best player in the world, and Kevin Durant -- not Steph Curry -- is the second best.   On Wednesday, Kerr was a guest on The Lowe Post Podcast and was asked the following question:  ""Do you think Steph cares about that? Steph is the two-time reigning MVP and I feel like everyone has sort of collectively forgotten how good he is. He was amazing in the Finals, he was really good in the Finals two years ago for which he gets no credit. When you say something like that publicly, are you worried that Steph is gonna be, 'Hey, what about me?' Or just doesn't matter to him?""  ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr told Lowe. ""That's the beauty of Steph -- he doesn't take that stuff personally. He understands it. Steph is one of the great players in the world. Two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of the way he impacts the game.  ""But you're talking about Kevin Durant at 6'11"" protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do.""  ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD,"" Kerr explained. ""Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill.  ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league.  ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi (Leonard) is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."""

LeBron James this year: 27.4 PPG / 8.5 RPG / 8.3 APG / 58.8 %TS / 25.6 PER Consensus No All NBA Team?
It’s very possible. People here just don’t play ball or are very short. All you have to do is get one point. It’s not like you’re trying to score on LeBron James 
Except when he’s guarded by Lebron James.. then he’s dead 
Were you happy with your Raptors being number 1 last year only to lose to Lebron James in the semis? Was that a successful year for you? 
"Great point, and like I said before, there is no way for me to prove it other than my opinion that the Nets do not have anyone that can stop playoff Lebron James. I just firmly believe that the team the Lakers are fielding right now would be able to beat the Nets in a 7 game series with Lebron in the line up. If Lebron was able to take the the 2018 Cavs team (which is certainly a better supporting cast than this Lakers team, but not by much), I am almost certain that Lebron would be able to take down an inexperienced .500 east team. Of course, there is the argument that Lebron isn't the same player he is last year, and to that I say whenever it's playoff Lebron I'm putting all of my money on him to beat an inexperienced, young east team. It's unfortunate the Lakers weren't healthy and Lebron isn't in the playoffs this year, but I firmly disagree with the notion that the Nets are a better team than the Lakers. It's an opinion I can't prove, but it's an opinion that certainly won't change. "

"I mostly agree, however I say Jordan loses none of them. He couldn't be beat on the grandest stage. I know this is going to sound redundant, but Jordan in a league as soft as this one, in his prime, no way does anyone stop him. Look at what James Harden is doing right now, now mix that with Jordan's raw talent, will to win, and competitive fire, I just don't see him losing. People say, ""Well it's a 3pt game now"". That may be true, but there have been two games that I can recall that Jordan proved that if he chose to could fire the long ball as well as most players. No, he's no Steph Curry, but percentages didn't matter to Jordan, if they needed him to do it to win, that's what he did. He shot lights out 3's in a college game, and again against the Trailblazers in the NBA 92 Finals. Just because he didn't shoot them, does not mean that he couldn't. Jordan's defensive expertise also ranks him WAY above Lebron, so again, I say he doesn't lose any of these finals appearances.   "
"&gt;What's stopping them?  The fact that LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson played basketball."
Kevon “LeBron James” Looney
There's countless of footage for LeBron James during his 1st stint with Cavs.  Even someone like Vince Carter has multiple highlights during his prime and he isn't an all-time great.  
"	                        PPG 	RPG   APG	 PER  eFG%  WS LeBron (2003-04)	20.9	5.5	5.9	18.3	.438	 5.1 Carmelo (2003-04)	21.0	6.1	2.8	17.6	.449	 6.1  I am not sure people would have been roasting that vote. It was close, yes, but as someone who WAS alive and watching a lot of ball back then, it was seen as a 1 and 1a sort of thing with a lot of praise going to Wade and Bosh as well. James was seen as the alpha by NBA heads, college gurus praised Melo."
Go back to trolling children in your other subreddits. No one gives a flying fuck what the equivalent of Lebron James’ athletic cup had to say

Defense, offense, set plays, etc  Tom Brady is 1/11  LeBron James is 1/5  If every NBA series was 1 game, do you earnestly think any of your stats would be relevant?   In 2011, do you honestly think in a 3 game series, the Jets beat the Patriots? No lmao. Bill Belicheck would destroy any coach in a multi game series, nevermind so would Brady  So now ask yourself, do you  honestly think the Patriots lose any super bowl in the last 20 years if it was a 3 game series? I don't  But because all it takes is one extremely unlucky play, the Patriots will lose and do lose  But seriously ask yourself if you could see them losing any multi game series? There is 1 or 2 years where it's more questionable"
the playoffs will be boring without lebron james and this sub will be bored as shit to not have their annual bogeyman 
curry's competition is only the pretty weak fucking LeBron James and also the pretty weak Kevin Durant
Lebron James writes with his left hand
"19 million dollars,hes actually the no 7 paid  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/02/12/the-nbas-highest-paid-players-2019-lebron-james-leads-with-89-million/amp/"
So are we just gonna forget a guy named Lebron James? LeCoast? Lol
"What's amazing is that a lot of these same people like to call LeBron humble. LeBron James is a great many things, but humble has never been one of them."
"Uh, Melo? Durant? Dwight? PG13? Pierce was a great player, but there never was a narrative for Pierce vs LeBron - in the same way, there was no rivalry between Tayshaun Prince and LeBron James.   &amp;#x200B;  It was the big-3 Celtics vs. LeBron during his first Cav stint. As a heat, the Pacers were a bigger threat than the Celtics."
Lebron James 
"first of all, if aliens are challenge us to a game of basketball for the future of Earth, how the hell are we getting players from any time in history to play in the game? if they're giving us access to a time machine to scoop these guys up, shouldn't we look in the future to see if there's a LeBron James with Steph Curry's shot in the future?"
this doesnt make any sense lmfao. by your logic bird had a higher peak than lebron james and michael jordan because they never had 3 mvps in a row. use your brain buddy
One had Lebron Fucking James and Chris Bosh the other had JJ Barea and Jason Terry lol
My top 5 from 1999 onwards:  1. Shaquille O’neal 2. Lebron James 3. Tim Duncan 4. Kobe Bryant 5. Steph Curry
"""I'm the goat"" - LeBron James "
"honestly i dont care about that, they are a chip on the shoulder type team. good for them for making the playoffs despite everyone counting them out.  but people are hyping them up just to shit on the lakers and frankly its becoming annoying. the clippers did well this year because they are underestimated and have a lot of players looking for opportunity, which Doc gives them. but to expect them to actually be a power to be reckoned with is laughable considering the lakers have magic johnson and lebron james running the show. both of them togehter own this league  jerry west is the GOAT GM but hes only an advisor, dude comes to the la clippers office maybe once a month"
It winds up that Shitfucker James' real first name is actually LeBron. Who knew.
LeBron is really David James
LeBron James?
"Because he played in a league with Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, and Steph Curry"
"Well that same argument can be made about Ainge. This is my whole point about GM’s in general. Ainge tried reading 4 picks for Stanley Johnson but people still love Ainge. You take a few Stanley Johnson’s when you can get a Blake Griffin. You’re ok paying Ryan Anderson $20+Million when you can get James Harden. You’re ok with your GM drafting Anthony Bennett if he also signs Lebron James. Every GM’s resume can be picked apart. There’s luck, there’s wins, there’s losses. (Then there’s the Warriors) "
"Paul Pierce was a better shooter than Wade.    Pierce only shot below 30% from 3 one time.    Wade  literally averages 29% for his career and once shot 15% in 2015 and 17%  in 2005... made the all star team both times...Pierce in his prime was  competing with perennial all stars at SF (Lebron, Tmac, Melo, to name a  few). The players st SF during Pierce's prime years trump the SGs during  Wade's prime ANY DAY. Hence the reason wade more all NBA teams... Wade  made multiple bullshit all star appearances during his career, because  there wasn't enough talent at SG to compete with. 23 year old Pierce  averaged 25ppg, 6reb, 3ast... shot 45% and 38% from 3, played all 82  games and still didn't make the all star team because of the NBAs  competition at SF in the early and mid 2000s. They both averaged 25 or  more 5 times. Wade never played all 82 games. Pierce did it 3 times and  even in his 30s played 81 and 80 games at one point. Carrying Boston  every fucking year. Pierce had 7 40-point games, wade had 8. Pierce has  obviously scored far more points than wade. Pierce is second in Celtics  history in points. Wade is first... competing with who? Wade literally  played with LEBRON JAMES. The greatest player since 2000. The year  Boston won their title, KG and Ray were 32 and 31. Wade, Bosh &amp;  Lebron all came together in their late 20s... Bron and Bosh were 26!!  And they lost the championship their first year. Wade and pierce both  averaged 25 at age 29. Wade did win a scoring title... Miami lost in the  first round of the playoffs that year. Pierce lost in the first round  twice in his 20s. Wade did it 3 straight years including a 4-1 L to the  Celtics. They both made their final all star games at 34... Pierce's  stats at 34 : 19.4ppg, 5.2rebs, 4.5asts 44% FG, 36% 3PT, 85% FT   Wade's stats at 34 : 19ppg, 4.1rebs, 4.6asts 45% FG, 15% 3PT, 79% FT    Oh and Boston took Miami to 7 games in the ECF that year... Where is Wade definitively better than Pierce?. "
"Joakim Noah outplayed LeBron James in a winning effort, days after LeBron swore to approach the remainder of the season like the playoffs."
Jonathan Isaac is Lebron James with a better hairline. 
"&gt; I said top 5. Op was saying playing at 6th man level (which most infer to being top 3 or 4 on a team).  You said top 5.  The guy who you were replying to said ""**if** Rose was putting up 6MOY type play in Cleveland"".  Not that he was.  You are the only person who seems to believe this utterly revisionist history that Rose was playing well in Cleveland.  For example, the very first google result for 'Derrick Rose Cavs' is [an article by their SBNation blog about how terribly he was playing for them[(https://www.fearthesword.com/2017/12/12/16764298/cavaliers-derrick-rose-no-role).  &gt; He belonged on the court  In fact, an article from the Ringer at the time he was traded says [""Rose might be neither interested in nor capable of playing basketball""](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/2/9/16993944/cleveland-cavaliers-dwyane-wade-derrick-rose-isaiah-thomas)  &gt; Stop staring at stat sheets and try watching the games sometime. Theyre pretty fun!  Yeah, it's not like the Cleveland Cavaliers, who had just been to the NBA finals and starred LeBron James, were ever on national TV or anything like that.  Clearly you were the only one watching these games."
"I prefer the Knicks to get #1 pick compared to Cavs &amp; Suns. Last year the Cavs are NBA Finalist, then they decided to Tank, when Lebron James went West. Cav's want another Kyrie, #1 draft pick to replace LBJ. Phoenix already got the #1 last year, but they didn't try to make their team better ( recordwise). Lesser of 3 evils, Knicks. Hopefully Zion lands with them"
 Best player in the series was LeBron James.

"&gt; Before anyone ever cared where I would play basketball, I was a kid from Northeast Ohio. It’s where I walked. It’s where I ran. It’s where I cried. It’s where I bled. It holds a special place in my heart. People there have seen me grow up. I sometimes feel like I’m their son. Their passion can be overwhelming. But it drives me. I want to give them hope when I can. I want to inspire them when I can. My relationship with Northeast Ohio is bigger than basketball. I didn’t realize that four years ago. I do now.  https://www.si.com/nba/2014/07/11/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers  Something tells me that the Cavs being LeBron's hometown team had a little something to do with his return in 2014. "
"Anybody remember the ""could you beat LeBron James if he wore flip-flops"" thread? Where people actually thought they could?"
I can name u plenty players that underperform in the. Playoffs and also haven’t played all time player in LeBron James. Celtics fans really are forever cancer
"You don't. I would also put Cowens at #6. 2 rings, MVP, 4 All-NBA teams, 3 All-Defensive teams, Rookie of the Year, 8x all star in 10 seasons as a Celtic.   Also he is one of only five players (Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, LeBron James, and Giannis Antetokounmpo are the others) to lead his team in all five major statistical categories for a season: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals.

"Rozier played the best basketball of his career in those playoffs. Your GM refused to trade him because of that playoff run. Horford is good? He's the motor that keeps your team running. He plays great defense, is one of the best passing big men in the game, his shooting is huge for the offense. Without him they wouldn't have made it to the ECF.   Lonzo is trash on offense. He was essentially a better passing Marcus Smart for us. Hart was playing injured most of the season and had a down year. KCP was trash most of the season, he didnt play well until after the allstar break. LeBron James did his thing as usual. The Lakers were 4th in seeding for the early part of the season and that went to shit only after we got hit with the injury bug.  LeBron only played 55 games, Ingram played 52 games, Lonzo played 47 games, hard played 67 games. How you going to put the blame on Kuzma and Ingram for not making the playoffs when our core was injured for a good amount of the season?"
"rozier is trash, horfords good but i would think zo plus hart and kcp and lebron fuckin james could do better"
"That tweet you posted was from July 1st, 2018. [Here is an article about how Woj then said on his podcast that the Lakers are not the frontrunners anymore, that the Clippers were, because Kawhi didn't want to play behind Lebron](https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nba/news/nba-trade-rumors-clippers-kawhi-leonard-lakers-lebron-james-la-less-appealing-spurs/galoxrrv9uoz1i2upulmk2d4c). It's from July 5th, 2018.  It's like you haven't seen any Big 3s operate. Guys always have to take backseats. It'll always be, at best, 1a and b, then 3. In Miami, DWade took a back seat and Lebron was 1a. Bosh was regulated to a spot up shooter and defensive centre, a position he actually didn't even like. In Cleveland, Kevin Love went from a 28/13 guy to a spot up 3 point shooter. There's only 1 ball. Someone is going to have to sacrifice.  The Clippers have Jerry West, the mastermind behind the Warriors; the greatest exec ever. Kawhi is only about to turn 28. They could easily build a contender around him. And Lebron has a 1-3 year window of GOAT play at most. He'd be jumping on something that is depreciating rather than making something himself.  How is it fan talk? It's well know Kawhi hates the media and the attention. You think he couldn't have come out and told his side of the story last year? He just sat back and watched the media spew all the Spurs friendly narratives, calling into question his character, and still harbours that if you heard his interviews after he won the championship this year.   &gt; No, it's because he and Uncle Dennis made it very clear that he wanted to go to the Lakers after Lebron came here. Not the clippers. The Lakers.  Again...source? Woj doesn't say anything about who his source was in his report. He doesn't have a quote from Uncle Dennis or Kawhi. The article I showed you has Woj saying the opposite...so now what?  I mean you're all about reports my man, especially from Woj who I don't think knows shit, tbh. But even he says it's a two horse race between the Clippers and Raptors at this point.   Like I said, Jerry West, Doc Rivers, Steve Ballmer with his deep ass pockets, it being in LA and being the underdog having never won a championship where Kawhi can build his own legacy as the main dude on the team makes it all more appealing than the Lakers right now. And like I said, look how toxic that locker room was last year with the Lebron media circus. KD pointed it out himself. Players are aware of that and it's totally not Kawhi's scene."
"It doesn't matter how you slice it, not player who joins Lebron James will think that it's his team, no matter how well he plays. It was why Kyrie left.  And the competitor aspect would mean that Kawhi wouldn't want to go to a team with two top 10 players already on it. He'd rather go to a team that is better run, better coached, and can build something himself."
“LeBron James!!”
"Yes we are.   Are you from LA by any chance? Its not a shot at you, I’m just asking.   Also, I’m sure there are plenty of players who would sign for the minimum to be a part of a team with LeBron James, Kawhi and AD"
"My man, they got LeBron James in free agency. That’s the biggest quality free agent right there."
"Versatility and athleticism have to be the key factors. You would have to pick someone who can facilitate, shoot, and finish. They would need to be able to defend all positions to some extent. Lebron James and Kevin Garnett seem to be the best candidates. Kevin Durant would be a possibility too. They have size to defend larger players but speed to keep up with smaller players."
At the end of the day this is a guy leading his team who pretty much every year came up against Lebron James in the playoffs and lost. Isn't that the fate of most.
"Because the scale is completely different. Playoff heartbreaks only happen when you make the playoffs, the Decision only happens because he's the best player in basketball, LeChoke only happens because he takes you to the finals, etc.    Lets say we have a fan of the Timberwolves. You were watching Lebron through his career, what were they doing? In that time period they had the continued greatness of Kevin Garnett, but little playoff success. You saw him get traded to Boston and win a championship. You look at your franchise. You watch the Kevin Love era lead you to no playoff appearances. You watch them draft Rubio and Flynn over Steph Curry. You watch years of terrible basketball to eventually get hope with Andrew Wiggins only to find that he's a chucker who doesn't actually like basketball. It's only now in the KAT era, around 10 years of mediocrity after KG left that basketball is somewhat fun again. Oh, except now you've got to deal with being a small market team and FA's not wanting to come. You finally made the playoffs but Jimmy Butler can't motivate your young guys to care about basketball and actually win. You're stuck again.    That doesn't happen when you root for LeBron. Again, I'm not trying to gatekeep you by saying that as a LeBron fan you're not a real fan. But you have to understand that the scale is completely different. I'm sure there's a ton of fans of shitty franchises like mine who wish they could solely follow the career of a transcendental player instead of watching their FO waste away year after year. Despite all of the hard times, you still got to witness 3 championships and one of the greatest finals' of all time in 2016. Your opinions regarding the sport are obviously valid and likely well informed, but just like you made the choice to follow a player, other people make the choice not to value what you have to say. Is that right? No. But I'm just trying to explain why they feel that way. For me personally, if I make friends with someone who likes basketball and mentions they're a LeBron fan as opposed to a fan of a team, that's totally fine. However, I'm framing every basketball conversation differently. Even taking it to another angle, part of being a sports fan is talking shit. One of my close friends is a Philly fan, so we're always talking shit about every sport. How does a Knicks fan shit talk LeBron? It's not even that you have no horse in the race, you're starting the race with a roided out horse, I can't say anything. I can bring up all of the heartbreak you've mentioned throughout LeBron's career and all you have to say is ""James Dolan"" and the conversation is over. We're talking completely different scales."
"You think, as a LeBron fan, it was all good times? I've suffered through his playoff heartbreaks in his 1st Cavs stint, the LeChoke and ""Who gives you only 3 quarters"" jokes, the aftermath of the Decision, the 2011 finals, LeDecline, LeBron only went to the Lakers for his entertainment career and so much more.  As a Knicka fan, I'm sure you cared more about Patrick Ewing and John Starks than Chris Childs or Charlie Ward. Because why wouldn't you? Fans gravitate towards stars. Just because player fans gravitated more towards stars doesn't mean they deserve to be called nuthuggers/dickriders and all those disparaging labels for player fans. Are you seriously asking me, a Filipino through and through, and millions of fans in Asia and Europe, to care more about Chicago than Michael Jordan? To care more about Cleveland, Miami and Los Angeles over LeBron James?"
By that logic the Pacers should have been in the finals this year because LeBron James was in the Western Conference.   Prior performance does not suggest future events.

"i used one example.  he stated that kawhi leonard has no desire to play in toronto, lebron james isn't signing with the lakers, celtics being the frontrunners for davis etc."
"Take this scenario:  Team 1: John Wall, (prime) Kyle Korver, Otto Porter Jr., Aaron Gordon, Serge Ibaka, Al Horford  Team 2: Michael Carter Williams, Alex Abrines, Lebron James, Ryan Anderson, Willie Cauley-Stein  John Wall stats: 23/6/8 on 51 TS% and his team wins 56 games  Lebron stats: 33/10/7 on 62 TS% and his team wins 54 games  You're gonna sit here and tell me that John Wall deserves it over Lebron just because his team of much better players won 2 more games?  This is obviously taking it to the extremes in order to get the point across but do you realize how simple-minded of a take that is now?"

LeBron was going to switch to number 6 before he signed with the Heat. Leading up to The Decision people were photoshopping him in different jerseys wearing the #6. He made the decision during his last season in his first stint in Cleveland. It wasn't that he came to Miami and asked for it and they told him no. I'm pretty certain that they would have allowed him to wear #23 had he asked for it.   Source: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/295859-the-real-reason-lebron-james-plans-on-changing-his-number
"lmao so you're telling me his stats were lower in cleveland when he was playing with Lebron James and Kyrie Irving, than when he was the #1 option on minny??? That's crazy!  Next thing you're gonna tell me is Bosh's stats went down when he went to miami!"
Harden and Lebron James are still effective
"Ok, here's a stat.  Playoff game-tying/winning shot in Q4 or overtime.  Michael Jordan = 9/18 (3/3 facing elimination) Lebron James = 9/25 (0/2 facing elimination)  Dude...they're two of the best players of all time and I'm not going to begrudge you preferring LBJ.   I just happen to be old enough to have watched both of them play and you're clearly not because if you were you'd know the difference between them. Anyway, good day to you, I'm out."
"I see you don't know either.  &gt;  if you need a shot down the stretch in a game, there’s not many guys you’d want over Melo  Sure there are. In no particular order I'll take Steph Curry, LeBron James, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Manu Ginobili, James Harden, Lou Williams, Luka Doncic, Dirk Nowitzki, Jamal Murray... *cut for space* ... Jayson Tatum, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Victor Oladipo, or Blake Griffin over Melo.  Among others."

You heard it here first gay Murray and white are comparable to Lebron fucking James.
This is what I was talking about  https://www.maxim.com/.amp/women/lebron-james-busted-sliding-into-dms-instagram-hottie-2017-11
No he can’t but anyone saying this isn’t allowed in the NBA is not a fan of the politics of the NBA. In Lebron James case he can’t now but in his 4th year of his contract (his last season with the lakers) he can restructure his contract. Would be willing to do it ? I don’t know. He should if he wants more rings. This doesn’t make sense for the NBA to make it strict on teams and players if they want to restructure their contract they should be able too.
In the Eastern Conference.  How many All-NBA 1st Team players not named LeBron James has there been in the East during his career again?
"I'll throw this in too. What advice would you give the Warriors in the 2014 offseason? Make a splash, or make tweaks and keep what you have going? Granted they got a new coach, but given the fact that they didn't miss a beat when Luke was coaching them, the coaching change wasn't THAT big of a factor in their dominance.  I'm sure i'll be bombarded with ""I KNEW THE DUBZ WERE COMING THAT YEAR!!!""  ""**Overall grade and accomplishments -- B**: The Warriors could have made the biggest non-LeBron James splash this offseason by trading away one of the Splash Brothers.

Lebron James lost the opportunity to be called the GOAT when he stood in the corner during the NBA Finals while Jason Terry was running around pretending to be a plane.

"Ultimately bad ownership, followed by a bad FO.  Look at the teams that changed ownership in the past decade and how that's changed the franchise. GSW had a similar beginning to the Clippers - irrelevant for most of the 2000's minus one playoff appearance. Late 2000's, with new ownership, and both franchises are much different - Warriors even moreso. Kings after a few early road bumps and some more experience look to be turning a corner with an awesome young core after the Malone Brothers ownership. Surprisingly, the Bucks with the HC made a huge change, but have made the playoffs the past 3 years with an ECF berth after Edens took over. Compared to a bunch of inconsistent seasons in the past.  Then look at teams, who were once great but are either considered mediocre or downright embarrassing. Lakers are a great example. Since Jerry Buss died, his 2 children took over, and have displayed nothing but incompetence and nepotism in terms of how they run the team. Lakers are currently under their longest playoff drought. They even missed the playoffs with Lebron James. Things look to be turning around with AD, but who knows if it'll end up being another Dwightmare debacle. Then look at the Suns - one of the most competitive teams in the early/mid-2000s who seriously could have a title now if it wasn't for Robert Horry. But since Sarver bought the team, the franchise seems to be in the dumps"
This ain't LeBron James
Lebron James has won how many rings?!?!?  Lolz.  How is he first?
I would argue LeBron James played professional basketball.

There will never be a greater performance than LeBron James in the 2016 NBA Finals.  That one series will be remembered for as long as basketball is played.
"&gt;Negotiations really deteriorated w/ Ty Lue when the Lakers refused to offer more than a three year deal that was designed to line up with LeBron James’ contract. Lue felt insulted the Lakers only saw him as a coach for LeBron, sources close to the process told ESPN.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; There are reports that the Lakers lowballed Lue [**with an offer of three years and $18 million**](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2019/5/8/18537538/lakers-rumors-tyronn-lue-head-coaching-candidate-jason-kidd-lol-la-times), money that would not have done much to go over the guaranteed money he has left from the [**Cleveland Cavaliers**](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/cleveland-cavaliers), guaranteed cash that would be offset by accepting another head coaching job. We also know that the team tried to get him to take on [**Jason Kidd**](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/21554/jason-kidd) as an assistant coach, something [**he was not amenable to for reasons that are fairly obvious.**](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2019/5/8/18537489/lakers-rumors-jason-kidd-tyronn-lue-lol-assistant-coach-espn-news-woj-bomb-shams-wow-athletic)   &amp;#x200B;  How does that not support my point?

"But not r/nba fans.  On r/nba, Jordan is considered a really terrible person they know personally who played with top level basically MVP (Scottie) and the greatest rebounder of all time (Dennis) his entire career, but still can’t beat the modern warriors, because even though his teammates were basically the best ever, they’re actually not in that one specific tiny case.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"It's not close honestly. If LeBron this season had put up Harden's numbers and took the Lakers to the 3 seed I promise you and would bet my life savings that NO ONE in the NBA would even consider it a competition. Of course, James Harden gets to the line a lot, so the entire world swung all the way to the opposite side. Insane. Giannis is legit one of my favourite players too, I've been hyping up the Bucks since 2015."
"Nah, that's just the dichotomy some fans make. I truly value Lebron James and think he's great, but I just don't think he's the greatest. The fact that I'm not firmly in his fan club gets downvotes in threads like this. That's a much bigger problem. The fact that I can't think someone is great and still point out something negative without getting labeld a hater."

Amy Schumer and Lebron James
"Miami James is considerably better current James. It's an insult to him as a player at his peak to say otherwise. If peak LeBron is a 10 current LeBron is an 8-8.5 (just as a point of comparison, I'm not rating current James an 8 at all).  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I'll have to wait till he gets some playoff success before putting AD &gt; Wade over there  This is exactly it to me. Wade was still ultra talented and athletic in 2011, and he brought an acumen and poise in the playoffs that we have no idea AD will come close to.  &amp;#x200B;  But Kawhi is clearly better than Bosh, yes."
I’ll be honest you’re right but I low key want it bc of the way people 💩 on Lebron. Like he became a scrub last year   But truthfully the best scenario is kawhi stays in Toronto and the lakers get a different max star and that will satisfy my desire for delusional fans to eat crow. Y’all really said James Harden was better than Lebron James. I didn’t forget.
"Slightly? Lmao. He’s a dramatically better defender than LeBron. I couldn’t care less about a rating, watch the games. But then again based off your “LeBron James” flair I’m talking to someone who is clearly a fanboy so not worth my time. Have a good day being delusional 👍🏼"
"&gt; Ok, let's look at the Lakers roster. Wait they don't even have one.  Anthony Davis Lebron James Kyle Kuzma Horton-Tucker Norvell Wagner/Jones/Bogna  And they have between 24-33 million dollars in cap space, depending on how things shake up. So they could potentially add another A-list player (Kemba or Kyrie?) or break that up and add two mid-range players."
So LeBron James was the favorite to win in every single season he won the championship while Michael Jordan was not (1990-1991).  You would never guess that from the conversations in this sub.
"Lakers traded him to make space for the possibility of signing 2 max players. The original plan was PG and boogie cousins. But instead we got lebron and AD.  The Lakers did not mess up.   Dlo is fools gold. Bad knees, high usage rate(only second to james harden) , slow first step, plays no defense.  He’s so amazing that nets didn’t even prioritize him after an “all-star” season and help lead his team into the playoffs after a long drought."
"&gt;The two way player distinction is so dumb. Why not just say best players?   The best ever discussion is the most played out topic ever. I just wanted to switch it up a bit, make a topic that includes players that arent usually in the goat conversation.  &gt;Is there a cut off on how good you have to be on defense or offense? Or is it just who is the best at offense and defense combined?   The best at offense and defense combined, as that is the definition of a two way player.   &gt;Because that just sounds like who is the best player?  A player can be considered the best on their team or the league and not be a two way player (James Harden, Lebron as of late, KD, Steph Curry isnt particularly known for his defense)  &gt;Is Kobe better than Kareem at offense? Or defense? Why is Kobe #3 when Kareem is 9?  Kobe is a 12 time all nba defender (9 1st team appearances, 3 2nd team appearances). Kareen is an 11 time all nba defender (5 1st team appearances, 6 2nd team appearances)."
"Ben Simmons, Lebron James?"
"&gt;  There Will never be another player like MJ, ever..  Lebron James"
"Who has the ability to walk away from a deal? The Pelicans. They say fuck it, let's run AD with Zion and hope he likes the dynamic of playing with the best prospect since Lebron James. And maybe he stays. Lebron's camp already showed they wanted to get AD to the Lakers with that whole mid-season fuck up of leaking a trade demand. Lakers FO don't want to lose another year of Lebron especially now since the West seems wide open. If you were a negotiator, which side would you want to be on? I think I'd rather be on the Pelicans side. If you're the Lakers, you're gonna walk away and tell Lebron you couldn't get a deal done? Sorry Lebron, they wanted a pick swap in four years, and that's just too high. FOH.  I'm not trying to start shit with you ColeYote. I'm just pointing out to whoever I can that the Pelicans had far better leverage in this situation. Hence, the deal that happened.  The Pelicans miraculously getting the #1 pick this year is an all-time sliding-doors, what-if moment in the NBA. Suddenly they go from 'We desperately need to get something back for AD right now"" to ""You know what, it's not a bad idea to just play him with Zion."" And that difference in mentality is huge at the negotiating table."
"Yeah if he had to guard somebody better than Lebron James, maybe he would have looked worse..."
"“When he enrolled at Chapel Hill, Jordan ran the 40-yard dash in 4.6 seconds. This fall he ran a 4.3.    –  Coach Dean Smith   “I ran the 40 in 4.6 seconds.”  – LeBron James  There are rumours of a 4.40 from LeBron, but I don’t know if that’s true.....if true, still slower."
&gt; How Paul George hasn’t won a ring?  Danny Granger injury. Lebron James. Roy Hibbert.
The  disrespect to LeBron James and irony Kawhi L. beyonnnnnnnnd me  Just because Lebron doesn’t play defense anymore because he has played 17 years of pro basketball with a huge playoffs plus finals streak ( 100+ games a season ) doesn’t mean he ain’t on the top 10  Kawhi is definitely better than John Stockton was offensively and defensively c’mon now.   Way to bring in old cats but make it fair
"I saw the first one and thought it was a normal list at first with MJ and Kareem sitting comfortably at the top, then I realized a familiar name was missing and he was 36th back then (Lebron James). Mad stats.  Curry should be further top imo."
"Sure, I just disagree with you that his plan was ever a good one. The Lakers had a plan to put playmakers around LeBron, instead of the proven model of surrounding him with shooters. That was a plan, but it sucked. The Suns and Wizards have plans, too. They suck, but they are plans. Ainge had a plan, it just always sucked, and he didn't pivot when his plan was blowing up on his face.  You say his plan was AD, but when did that become his plan? It wasn't his plan two years ago when he traded for Kyrie, because he couldn't have both on his team. You say he didn't want to trade for Kawhi because he didn't want to risk him being a one year rental. Ok, but he knew AD would be the exact same circumstance, because he couldn't trade for him until this summer because of Kyrie. But, that also means that, he knew that by the time he got AD, Kyrie might be gone.  I mean, I thought from day 1 that the idea of hitching his wagon to Kyrie was a terrible idea. He thought he could build a title contender around a pass-first hero-ball non-defense point guard, who he only got because the dude forced his way off a team that had been to 3 straight finals, so he could ""have his own team""? The Celts had an overperforming team of promising young assets, with a great coach, and a good free agent addition, in Gordon Hayward. They traded for a me-first player who couldn't even bring himself to defer to LeBron freaking James. What made them think he was going to buy into this team-first thing they had going on in Boston? What made them think that a guy like that would re-sign when his contract was up? What made them think a guy like that wouldn't stunt the development of their youngsters?  When you get to Kawhi's availability,  you have two choices: commit to win now or commit to the young guys and win later. Ainge thought he could do both, and, predictably, did neither. Having too many assets results in a diminishing return. There are only so many minutes to go around, and only one ball. If you are as asset rich as Ainge was, the course is simple: trade multiple assets for one better asset. You saw Terry Rozier was good. Did he think he would improve playing behind Kyrie and Marcus Smart? No, he had his value diminished because he couldn't get the minutes and the touches. That's why you trade valuable assets you can't use to upgrade to ones you can.  But, ok, let's say he was dead set on AD, and that was his plan. This past deadline, he had a team that was underperforming to the max, and clearly did not get along with Kyrie. The team would win when he was out of the lineup and lose when he was there. It was pretty clear that Kyrie wasn't happy, and no one else was either. There was a very strong risk that Kyrie would leave in the offseason, and Horford had the ability to, as well. Ainge could have traded for AD, but would have had to sacrifice Kyrie to do it. But who cares, Kyrie was a locker room cancer and the core of your team's locker room issues. Why didn't Ainge set up a three team deal that sent out Kyrie and some additional assets (maybe a couple of picks) and net Davis? When the Pelican's owner said ""to the Lakers over my dead body"" why didn't Ainge offer Kyrie to LA, for some of those assets and send those to the Pelicans, with a couple of picks, for Davis? Solve your locker room issues, use an asset that is about to leave in free agency, and get the guy you apparently wanted so bad you refused to give up Jaylen Brown for Kawhi.  Or, alternatively, do freaking anything at the trade deadline. No competent executive sits pat at the trade deadline when you have a drastically underperforming team who hate playing together, and when you have your best two players about to hit free agency. In February, if Ainge didn't see the present situation coming, he wasn't paying attention.  Now, personally, I applaud all of Ainge's moves...because I am a Raptor fan. I kept fearing that he would do something like getting Kawhi, or trading away Kyrie, or any number of great moves he could have made. I was relieved when he decided to stick to his shitty plan instead. But, when your chief rivals are cheering your non-moves, you might want to ask how good a job you are actually doing.  In the end, you are judged as a GM in basketball by results. Ainge had an abundance of riches that  few teams can ever claim to have matched. He turned that into one conference finals appearance, a second round exit and, now, a rebuild. Whether you attribute his failure to failing to pull the trigger, or to getting assets that didn't fit together, or whatever else, the fact is, he took a ton of assets and turned it into very little. There are very few executives who have turned so much into so little. You can't write off a failure that epic to bad luck."

What was he saying? I've heard about it but the LeBron James police got there before I could
"""It was at that moment that I thought: I must be the greatest of all times"" - also LeBron James"
"So I was at a restaurant with my family. This restaurant was like any other, it had a few TVs. It was a particularly cold night which was odd for our small town. We were all having a good time, laughing, smiling, and eating good food. When we were eating I was fixated on the the college basketball game on. I’m not a huge fan of college basketball but it was a close game and wanted to see the outcome. It cut to commercial. The infamous Sprite Cranberry commercial. The commercial that haunts me everyday of my life now, forever. It seemed like the normal claymation commercial but when it came to Lebron James’s part of it, he started farther back than usual. Then he whipped out that wretched drink and started running towards the screen. He got so close to the “camera” that it seemed like he would jump out. And he did. The famous 6’8” basketball player rushed out of the screen turning from claymation to a real person. The entire restaurant went quiet. He looked around then he locked eyes with me. Then this giant started sprinting as fast as he could holding a frosty Sprite Cranberry. Lebron decked me to the ground and pinned me down. I couldn’t move because i was in shock and awe. He then tried to forcibly shove a cold soda can full of sprite cranberry inside my mouth. Patrons of the restaurant tried to stop him but no one could stop Lebron. He started tearing the corners of my mouth with the can to fit the entire fan inside my mouth. I tried pushing him off to no avail. Blood was coming out of my mouth and my vision was fading. All i could hear were screams from people and Lebron just repeatedly saying “Want a Sprite Cranberry?” I passed out. I woke up for what I thought a few hours later in the hospital with stitches on the corner of my mouth. My family wasn’t there, and i called in the nurse. They said that they all went home days ago. I was in a coma induced by Lebron James for almost a week now. I text my mom telling that I woke up but it was late so she was asleep. I asked the nurse to turn off the lights and when she did and left, all that was there was just the dim light from the hallway. I try to fall asleep but i can’t the trauma made by Lebron wouldn’t wipe away from my memory. Finally a few hours later I was drifting off when then I saw a figure. I thought it was my dad but I realize the figure was too tall, and he was holding two objects. The figure got closer and i realize this person was holding a soda can and a basketball. He’s back for me."

You're not gonna excel if you're a big man playing in a superteam that features Lebron James and Kyrie Irving in the backcourt.  Unless you're Shaquille O' Neal

"""And when I say that, I really believe that. I'm not here trying to blow smoke in these fans' face"" - LeBron James  during that same speech"
2000-2003: Shaq  2006-2010: Kobe  2011-2013: LeBron  2014: KD  2015-2016: Steph Curry  2017-2018: LeBron James  2019: Kawhi Leonard
The bulls went 72-10 but you're going to argue that cause the cavs scored more points they were a better team? Compare Pippen and Rodman's defense to Love and Irvings. This is one of the most far fetched attempts at discrediting lebron ive ever seen. If the cavs were a better team than the bulls that says a hell of a lot about James lmaoo
"""I've never had a LeBron James as a team mate""  - LeBron probably"
"And why do you think it works that way now? Because LeBron James set the precedent of players colluding to form superteams. He did it twice and was rewarded with 8 Finals appearances in succession and 3 rings. When people in general see something that is successful they tend to copy it. LeBron's legacy will end up being the guy that changed the NBA for the worse and the value of his accomplishments will diminish as more people come to realise how manipulative he is and how manufactured his career has been. If Jordan's career was written by a Hollywood screenwriter, LeBron's was written by corporate shills in a boardroom with a big whiteboard that has 'how to buy championships' written on it."
"The problem with that way of looking at it is that two of those three are Lebron James and Anthony Davis and most of the roster that missed the playoffs last year are gone. The NBA is also very superstar oriented so just having a big three of Kawhi AD and LBJ would be enough to beat any team, with the only way to stop them being one getting injured which is an outcome no one would be happy with."
I think it's a pretty out there opinion to say that Udonis Haslem means more to the history of the Miami Heat than LeBron James.
"Nice strawman, stupid. This is about Michael Jordan and LeBron James. No one thinks Wilt is tbe GOAT. Try to keep up."
Imagine in 2019 still considering the Miami heat a super team. Wade already was on the way down with his terrible knees where he even came out said it hurt to play everyday and bosh had blood clots. Who else did they have? this team was lowkey a joke but Lebron was just that good that team looked great.   50     Joel Anthony 8	Carlos Arroyo 0	Mike Bibby 1	Chris Bosh 15	Mario Chalmers 25	Erick Dampier 40	Udonis Haslem 55	Eddie House 5	Juwan Howard 11	Zydrunas Ilgauskas 6	LeBron James 22	James Jones 21	Jamaal Magloire 13	Mike Miller 45	Dexter Pittman 42	Jerry Stackhouse 3	Dwyane Wade
Lmao imagine NOT wanting to play with Lebron James
For real imagine thinking Harkless makes any fucking difference when LeBron fucking James is on the other side.  Not saying Kawhi is for sure taking Lakers over Clips but this is hilarious.
"He probably planned it with Lebron. Kawhi wanted to go the Lakers during the 2018 season, and Lebron was planning it years in advance given the KCP-Klutch thing. Plus there's this from 2018 also:  Actually Lebron was already on the way to LA before Kawhi (see KCP), and Kawhi also did reportedly talk to Lebron about teaming up a year ago.  &gt;San Antonio Spurs star Kawhi Leonard has reached out to LeBron &gt;James, informing the 33-year-old superstar that he wants to play alongside him, a source told Yahoo Sports.  &gt;Leonard pitched James on his incredible defensive ability and how it would alleviate the pressure on James, the source said.  &gt;On June 15, Yahoo Sports reported that Leonard, 26, wanted to be traded from the Spurs organization, and trade talks with San Antonio regarding Leonard reportedly picked up steam Thursday, with the Lakers expressing interest in a deal.  https://sports.yahoo.com/source-kawhi-leonard-reaches-lebron-james-hopes-play-210550904.html"

"Ehhhhhhh I would say no? Lebron has already passed MJ in games played, I think it was sometime in the 2017-18 season that the two of them were level, so the argument for MJ vs. Lebron is always gonna be peak vs. longevity. And Michael's peak was so amazing, and lasted so long, that it's hard to argue against him. He also retired at said peak, which leaves a lot of people with the ability to say ""yeah but what if what if what if, shoulda coulda woulda"" until the cows come home.  So, I say no. I ALSO would add I don't think there's any way the Lakers are gonna three-peat, and if they DO, I don't think it's gonna be on the back of a 37-year-old Lebron James, so it won't really be the same feather in his cap that his other rings are."
"Read any of Woj's ""articles"" regarding lebron. They aren't quite smear-pieces, but there is definitely a pattern.  [https://waitingfornextyear.com/2014/12/adrian-wojnarowski-doesnt-like-lebron-james/](https://waitingfornextyear.com/2014/12/adrian-wojnarowski-doesnt-like-lebron-james/) was written a long time ago, but is still very relevant."
"Dwight Howard, Lebron James and Dwayne Wade"
"Can confirm the guy is a super douche. I worked in Marina Del Rey a couple of summers ago and Lebron rented out a boat to fish with a couple of his boys during the off season and I was crew. We all got a strict no photo, no speaking to them unless spoken to lecture by our bosses, which was fine. But he treated us like fucking peasants the whole time. He requested bait and I brought him a bucket of live bait and he looked at the bucket and said what the fuck is this shit bait! Can’t catch nuttin with that shit. And he took the bucket and tossed the bucket with the bait over board and demanded that i bring better.  He was drunk off his ass but that’s not an excuse for how he behaved. When he wanted his barracuda gutted, he didn’t even hand his bag to me or place it on the chopping board like usual. The scumbag threw the bag on the floor for me to pick up (keeping in mind I was literally at the cut table) and walked off. Fuck that guy so much. I’ve met multiple b-ball players because so many come out to the marina for the summer, Pau and Kareem for instance. None has never been as close to a jackass as Lebron James."
Minimal competition   Lebron James   Pick one.
"His top five comparison players in order of similarity are: Michael Jordan, Dwayne Wade, Magic Johnson, Clyde Drexler (Surprise for me, didn't realize advanced stats liked him so well), and Lebron James.  That's pretty wild company to be in and it's also insane that his highest similarity is MJ year 1993."
The Lakers have Lebron James and signed Anthony Davis I don't think they will have a problem filling out a roster (though not as strong as they could have yesterday).  Clips have Patrick Beverly as their major FA signing?
"As mavs fan, definitely. From an NBA fan standpoint, I think so, but not significantly. Granted, I think lebron had to lose the 2011 finals  in order to build up the good will he ultimately got by winning the 2016 finals. In wrestling, you have faces (good guys) and heels (bad guys). When someone turns heel, they go from being a good guy to a bad guy. Lebron James' decision was the biggest heel turn in the NBA at that point. And with a heel, the point is that they get some sort of come-uppance so that they ultimately not only can put over a face but also build towards a redemption story arc (otherwise what impetus does the heel have of turning face again when they are winning as a heel). Lebron's redemption arc climaxed with the 2016 finals."
"[I will always post this article when I get the opportunity.](https://deadspin.com/just-undo-it-the-lebron-james-profile-that-nike-killed-1602381429) Fuck LeBron's corny, entitled, child-star-mindset having ass."
"Sorry but Love was never better than Toronto Bosh.  Also, what does being “homegrown” have to do with being a super team? Some of those late 90s lakers teams had like 4 all stars. How is shaq/Kobe + 2 other all stars not a super team, but James and 2 all stars is? Kobe may not have been in his prime yet, but neither was Kyrie.  Idk I think that team is as much of a super team as the current Rockets roster. Really really good championship caliber teams, but not on the same level as the Lebron Heat, KD Warriors, big 3 Celtics"
"I'm going to call this dude Buckets Man, and he's a center:  &amp;#x200B;  C: Buckets Man  PG: Derrick Rose  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Lebron James  &amp;#x200B;  Have fun with that."
The only attraction is Lebron James was what I was told  But he’s in LA now
Yeah we don't need the best player in the world while the Lakers have LeBron James and Anthony Davis + 32M in cap space
4 lebron james
OP hates Lebron James with a passion
Don't let this distract you from the fact that LeBron James.
"So that was another LeBron James that played for the superteam, Miami Heat?"
I spent all this time rooting for Lebron James because KD fucked the league but now it seems the tables may turn..
He's a champion and it would be good if he keeps on winning. But affected? Naah. He's LeBron James. We know his name. We know his legacy.
"Lol, he actually hurt his hand. Don't know why this ""he was faking it"" rumor is still going around when it's pretty well documented his hand was injured at the time. There's literally pictures and entire articles analyzing why his hand was hurt and yall still post this garbage. Plain ignorance at this point  https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/06/11/lebron-james-hand-injury-photographic-investigation/"
"Like Charles Barkley says, only bc he’s Lebron James the basketball player. If he was Lebron James the plumber, he wouldn’t get shit"
Why do you think they only lost by 3 and 1? Because of lebron james you imbecile use your brain

I doubt LeBron James drives a Subaru Legacy and even if he did his basketball career won’t affect it much
"Sure.  Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard, and James Harden."
"He's clearly very polarizing among his teammates. James Jones, Mike Miller, to name a couple, seemed to go out of their way to play *with* him. Then a few guys have gone out of their way to not play with him. Kyrie being the biggest example.  One thing is definitely true, he does go through coaches. Spolstra is the only one who has coached LeBron and still had a job at the end."
"I just did what I do best. I took your little Lebron circle jerk and I turned it on itself. Look what I did to this sub with a few Fuck Lebrons and saying Lebron tampers with other players. Hmmm? You know... You know what I've noticed? Nobody panics when things go ""according to plan."" Even if the plan is horrifying! If, tomorrow, I tell reddit that, like, fuck James Harden, KD pulled a bitch move and joined the Warriors, nobody panics, because it's all ""part of the plan"". But when I say Fuck that crybaby Lebron, well then everyone loses their minds!!! Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the Lebron fans order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about being able to say Fuck Lebron!? It's fair!"

Have you met LeBron James?
Probably because they have Lebron James and Anthony Davis with rumors of other big guys signing
"LeBron James literally played more competitive, high level basketball than anyone on planet Earth during that time period and he still found ways to win.   You can hate all you want, but I don't know why you want to."
Oh come on you would still have LeBron fucking James and Anthony Fucking Davis. Far from a slouch.
Lebron James' a wasteman ahlie?

"I think he needs more help though, might need to get someone like James Harden if we want to say its a superteam. Kawhi aint enough, Help lebron"
Iggy a Lebron killer? Hahahaha nah:  “Blocked by James!”
LOL y’all seeing this right????? i’m pretty sure Kawhi is the free agent NOT Lebron James.
"Miami just did a hell of a job growing their young talents like Lebron James, Dwyane wade, Ray Allen and Chris Bosh."
"LeBron James: ""I don't think I've ever lost an NBA final"""
&gt;The Warriors are going to be mediocre in the future and are going to heavily regret giving Iguodala and Bogut such big contracts. Curry is going to be rumored to leave the entire duration of his contract year.    Welp  &gt;I don't understand why anyone thinks LeBron James would go back to Cleveland. I don't think there is a stupider idea on the sub.  .  &gt;Doug McDermott has everything necessary to be a number one option in the NBA.  uhh  &gt;Derrick Rose will come back 100%  :(
LEBRON JAMES WITH THE GOALTEND
Lebron James happened.
“LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE!”
"Kawhi, AD, and fucking LEBRON JAMES. It's very interesting how this team is not getting nearly the amount of hate the Warriors got for signing only one free agent in KD and drafting their other stars."
... One via trade - Anthony Davis  ... One via free agency - Lebron James  Kawhi hasn't made a decision yet. Are you fucking daft?
"Oh yeah, cause Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons = Kawhi Leanord and Lebron james. Gtfo, we were never a super team"
"Lol it doesn't matter, it's Lebron James and 3 to 4 other all-stars."
2015 was gsw against lebron james by himself
Lol.  “Lakers announce that they’ve traded Lebron James to the Toronto Raptors for Kawhi Leonard”
"The Knicks are making similar moves to the Nets when they missed out on Lebron James. Nets signed guys like Travis Outlaw to fill out the roster. It ended up being a big mistake for them. Luckily, the Knicks are only signing them for 2 years."
"One postseason run from Kawhi and everyone is acting like Lebron isn't Lebron James. As if he didn't leave everyone foaming at the mouth during the 2018-19 playoffs himself.  It'll be a fun debate throughout next season, which of the Laker stars is the best player in the world."
We did aaaall that shit and the last time our teams met Mario Hezonja managed to get the fucking game winning block on LeBron James.   Lmfao.
"The point is LeBron James wasnt the only piece in the Heats run to rings. Riley knew that and surrounded Wade with that talent.   You think Butler sat down with Riley yesterday and Riley said ""Alright Jimmy, you're all we want, we are done"". The shook hands and parted ways? This is only the beginning. If Riley is able to maneuver this we'll be contending in the next year or two."

LeBron James IV is going to have something to say about that in the 2050 finals
Imagine LeBron and Iggy come together and best the Warriors game 7 LeBron James blocks Steph Curry alley oop to Iggy who jumps from the free throw line for a signature dunk and posterizer on Draymond.  The 30 for 30 for LeBron and the Warriors is going to be so good
"Not dramatic and spurned enough.   It'll be more like:  *""Cowardly. That is how executives around the league feel about Kawhi Leonard, sources say. Kawhi was offered a private jet, lifetime access to Microsoft Office products, and a Windows Phone but turned down the offer in a conference call, sources say.*  *Yes, Kawhi Leonard left the country that adored him to join the LA Lakers, but did it in the most cowardly way possible. Now he and fellow coward, Lebron James, will be teaming up to try to topple what will be the next dynasty - the Los Angeles Clippers, a team that I am in no way paid by.""*"
“LeBron James?!?”
next polar opposite lebron james
Next LeBron James!
"Miami under the Pat Riley has refused to ever give up and tank.  They seem totally fine with being a .500 team, because every few years, they get rewarded with a Superstar that wants to play there, and takes them to the next level.  1996: Finished 42-40 prior season, losing in the first round.  Alonzo Mourning, who they acquired by trade in the middle of the previous season, agrees to stay with the Heat by signing a long term contract.  2004: Finished 42-40 prior season and missed playoffs.  They acquire Shaq in a trade .  Although Shaq didn't have a no trade clause, the Lakers let him choose his destination, and he chose Miami as his second choice (his first choice, Dallas, couldn't work out a deal with the Lakers).  2010: Finished 47-35 the prior season, lost in the first round of playoffs.  Lebron James and Chris Bosh sign as free agents.  2019: Finished 39-43 the prior season, missing the playoffs.   Jimmy Butler signs as free agent."
"it will surely be talked about for generations.   a controversial move that created possibly the greatest team of all time, during what was already a crazy rivalry between lebron james and the warriors.   future generations will be amazed at this team, and we can say we were there. fuck you kevin durant, but thanks for the basketball"
"4 &gt; 3, you got me there!   But the third or fourth dude on the Warriors is one of Klay or Dray...great players who have offensive limitations. The third dude on this made-up LA team is still an MVP candidate or *literal LeBron James!* Who is beating a team with three MVP-caliber players?"
"you guys are delusional as fuck man. Kevin Durant is gonna come back and this nets team is gonna run the east. this is the 2nd best player of this generation, behind only Lebron fucking James man. this team is stacked from top to bottom. Kyrie, KD, DJ, Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, LaVert, Jarrett Allen? that's honestly the most well rounded team in the league with another couple signings."
"I don’t think Zion averages crazy numbers, but I think the young players can take a step up,and LeBron only played 55 games last year. I think the Pelicans this year are a more complete team than the Lakers were last year, they just obviously don’t have a LeBron James. Again, I think they fall short, but I don’t believe that the Pels making the playoffs is unthinkable"
"were they top 3 players all time, in their primes when they joined the lakers?  lebron james and steve nash dont belong in the same paragraph little man."

Rename Staples Center to Lebron James’ practice arena (and home of the Clippers)
"lebron james isn't just anyone, yes they would.  its a team that cares as much about having big stars as it does anything else.  do you not know your own team?"
"It’s crazy too me that’s after THIS season that just took place, we are calling next year off for the lakers winning the championship if kawhi signs. Anthony Davis, who misses about as much basketball as anyone in the top five players in the league discussion and a Lebron James who was legitimately injured for the first time in his career. The games still have to be played and a ton of teams got better this year. IMHO kawhi going to the lakers is good for the nba and I hope he signs."
But still the only Raptor who got through a East without LeBron James on it.    #JUST SAYIN
"So weird when people call lebron james by his last name. “James”.   Low key irritates me when people call players by only their last name when it’s a very common name, especially when they have a distinct first name"
*LeBron James(Part Owner/Spokesperson)*
"&gt;but it is rarely one person like LeBron James doing the funding.  I definitely did not assume that LeBron paid for all of the funding, but I did assume that he was contributing funds so that he could get more money out of the back end.  Aside from that, thanks so much for the detailed write-up!  It's pretty cool to get an insider's view on movie production like this."
Lebron James III should be eligible to be drafted into the NBA Academy since he should be turning 13 that year.
"Looking through the projected for a lot of these players really puts this list in question.  For most young promising players the model expects them to improve next season or two and then more or less plateau at 8-9 WAR at best (basically all star niveau) for the next few years.  [Luka Doncic](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/luka-doncic/)  [Ben Simmons](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/ben-simmons/)  [KAT](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/karl-anthony-towns/)  [Embiid](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/joel-embiid/)  [Tatum](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/jayson-tatum/)  It's similar for most young good players. For some reason the model really likes Lonzo and expects him to really keep improving.  It also doesn't expect improvements on good players to last and expects them to be outliers which might be true in some cases but less so in others  [Giannis](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/giannis-antetokounmpo/)  [Jokic](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/nikola-jokic/)  [PG](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/paul-george/)  Lastly the model predicts most stars around 30 to really regress the next few years.  [Harden](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/james-harden/)  [Curry](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/stephen-curry/)  [LeBron](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/lebron-james/)  This one might actually be because of his injury so the model thinks he got significantly worse this year.  [Westbrook](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/russell-westbrook/)  He is predicted to be better next year but then declines.  [PG again](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/paul-george/)  [Kawhi](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/kawhi-leonard/)  Overall it seems like the model is very cookie cutter for young players and older player, because young player will improve some more and then stay the same for a few years and older players simply get worse the older they get. It doesn't really recongnize if a player can be expected to be great or if a player has a game that ages well.  It also fails to interpret rapid improvement properly. Jokic, Giannis and PG are expected to be at their older levels next year despite their improvements this season.  All in all it seems very generalized and something everyone could tell you. Young players improve and older players get worse but it lacks individualism."
If Lebron fucking James struggled in the summer league. What does that tell you?
"Tbqh...no. The ""poorest"" majority owner is Michael Jordan, with a worth around $2.0b. The richest active athlete is Lebron James, who isn't worth anything close to that.   Collectively the players aren't worth anything but a smidge compared to the owners, who funds almost everything.   That being said, maybe I can see a league being created akin to Ice Cube's BIG3"
"What the fuck did you just fucking say about Caruso, you little bitch? I'll have you know Caruso graduated top of Mamba class in the Los Angeles Lakers, and He’s been involved in numerous trade rumors in this league, and he has over 300 confirmed buckets. Caruso has been trained in Mamba Mentality and He’s the top shooter in the entire NBA. Kawhi is nothing to Caruso but just another target. Caruso will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to Caruso over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting Lebron James on Instagram and your post is being screen shotted right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. Caruso can be anywhere, anytime, and Caruso can dunk on you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with him starting from the free throw line. Not only is Caruso extensively trained in the ways of the Mamba, but he has access to the entire arsenal of the Lakers Organization and will use it to its full extent to wipe Kawhi’s miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" post was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. Caruso will shit fury all over this league and Kawhi will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo."
Probably Lebron James. Houston recently.
"This list will based on how I think the players will perform in both the regular season and the playoffs. This is why Kawhi will be at the top despite likely missing upwards of 20 games in the regular season  Injured will players will be excluded  **1. The Self Proclaimed ""Fun Guy"", #2 you know who? Mr. Kawhi Leonard**  Why:  * Entering prime * Does it all * 2 way superstar * Second year with team. Will know system more (assuming he stays)  Counter point:  * Will Miss upwards of 20 games due to L O A D M A N A G E M E N T  * Might have to share ball with AD/LeBron   **2. The reigning MVP, The Greek Freak, Giannis Antetokounmpo**  Why:  * Still VERY young * Had necessary experience and playoff heartbreak * Superstar on both ends  Counter point:  * Poor shooter   **3. The Greatest shooter of all time, 2x MVP, 3x NBA Champion, None other than Steph Curry from Golden State**  Why:  * Will have free reign with KD in Brooklyn and Klay in hospital * Will need to carry team until Klay comes back * Experienced   Counter point:  * Weak defensively  * Weak ankles  **4. Multiple time MVP finalist, 2018 MVP, Best Scorer in the league, the beard, James Harden**  Why:  * Best scorer in the league * Still in his prime * One of the greatest offensive players in history * Rarely injured  Counter point:  * Improving but still Weak defensively  * Team hasn't made it far in the playoffs  **5. The Self proclaimed King, the chosen 1, the 3x NBA Champion, 3x NBA Finals MVP, LeBron James**  Why:  * Consistently great * No glaring weakness  * Rarely injured * Will be paired with star  Counter point:  * Getting up there in age * Will be paired with star  **6. They call him the brow, the new Los Angeles Laker Anthony Davis**  Why:  * Will be paired with star * Superstar on both ends * Just entering prime  Counter point:  * Lacking experience * Doesn't elevate teammates * Will be paired with star  **7. The big man from Cameroon, The process Mr. Joel Embiid**  Why:  *Still young * Superstar on both ends * Got necessary experience and playoff heartbreak  Counter point:   * Durability issues   **8. Dolla Dolla Dame, Mr. Damian Lillard from Portland**  Why:   * No glaring weakness * Had a great season * Still in his prime  Counter point:  * Won't have Nurkic to help him create open shots * Not the greatest defensively  **9. They call him the Joker while others insist on calling him Big honey, Nikola Jokic from Serbia**  Why:  * Best passing big man possibly ever * V E R Y young * Got necessary experience and playoff heartbreak   Counter point:   * Not great defensively   **10. The Los Angeles Lak-- No wait the Oklahoma City Thunder star Pauulllll George**  Why:  * No glaring weakness * MVP and DPOY finalist * Still in his prime  Counter point:  * Durability questions * Playoff failure     Let me address the most common question:  **Steph above LeBron?**  Steph will have to carry his team to the playoffs with Klay out till February. Curry was arguably better than LeBron last year and that was with KD and Klay. We're going to see MVP Curry again. Plus LeBron will defer to AD and will likely miss games to load management.  **Kawhi at one?**  This list is based on how I think they'll perform in playoffs+regular season. Kawhi proved he was the best playoff performer behind LeBron and possibly KD.   **Joel after AD?*  I love Joel, but AD is better. He's a better passer, better shot creator and he'll be fed by LeBron.  **No Kyrie?**   I'll just say it, I think Kyrie is extremely overrated. He's a great scorer, but doesn't excel in much else. His passing is decent, his defense is mediocre at best, and he has chemistry issues. Plus he had an underwhelming season and that was with a talented celtics team."
"Lol so now it’s conspiracy nonsense? What are you, Alex Jones with a little money to spend on VC?

Fucking hilarious pal. I can’t stop fucking laughing."
"Lebron had everything to do with why the Warriors were willing to give up the team that won them 70 games for Kd, and the criticism levelled at Kd by Stephen A. had everything to do with why he left OKC.

"Bradley Beal is one year older than all three of those   Ben Simmons turns 23 in two weeks, while Giannis is 24 until December   Lebron James is 4 years away from being in the league for 20 years."
"Those are two separate things. Stars teaming up is one, and big market teams getting superstars is another. Oddly enough, neither of the examples you gave (Heatles and KD joining Warriors) happened with a big market team.  The Lakers have signed two superstars in the past 25 years: Shaquille O'Neal in 1996 and LeBron James in 2018. The Knicks have sucked for decades. The Clippers have signed nobody until Kawhi Leonard this summer.  Wanting parity is a way of asking the league to enforce rules to bail out shitty team management."

"How about winning chips with the team that drafted them?  It happens like once a decade.  Kyrie(Cavs) in the 2010s.  LeBron, if you count him(Cavs) in the 00's  Duncan(Spurs) in the 90's  Hakeem(Rockets) and James Worthy(Lakers) in the 80's.   It's worth noting that the Lakers were already the defending champions when they drafted Worthy, as the Cavs had traded them their first round pick for Don ""Literally Who?"" Ford.  Magic(Lakers) and Bill Walton(Blazers) in the 70's  Kareem(Bucks) and Cazzie Russell(Knicks) in the 60's  It didn't happen with any player drafted in the 50's or 40's."
We have one LeBron James
"West:  1. Clippers (Probably best defensive team in the league, has 2 MVP level players and a beastly bench unit and we all know that helps a lot in the regular season.) 2. Jazz (Also a great defensive team, addition of Mike Conley/Bogdonovic and development of Donovan Mitchell as well as Rudy Gobert could boost them here. Has a solid bench too.) 3. Lakers (I doubt that Lebron James is still in his prime at this point, considering that their team had the most roster changes in the league, they could have chemistry issues. Would figure it out in playoffs though.) 4. Nuggets (Pretty much stayed the same, solid team.) 5. Rockets (Minor roster changes, still formidable) 6. Warriors (Their OG core is still intact, assuming that Klay comes back healthy, should be still in playoffs. They are lower bc of Klay being out) 7. Blazers (Addition of Whiteside should help out a bit, but the west is too strong.) 8. Spurs (Basically same team, but Pop is Pop.)  East:  1. Bucks (Giannis will again have a phenomenal season,) 2. Celtics (I believe this is the breakout year for Tatum as well as a chance for Kemba to prove that he can win games.) 3. 76ers (Lost Butler but still has a solid team. Maybe a good year for Simmons?) 4. Nets (Only IF (BIG IF) Kyrie can prove that he is still a top 3 PG.) 5. Pacers (IF Victor Oladipo can still be a top 3 SG) 6. Raptors (Maybe a good year for Siakim? Still out of contention without Kawhi.) 7. Heat (As of now without Russ) 8. Orlando (Okay team, not much to say.)  Bulls could be swapped with Orlando."

It's not our real fan base. The real Lakers lifelong fans love Magic. It's the new guys who just became Lakers fans after the LeBron James' signing who are disrespecting Magic.  I'm literally wearing a Magic Johnson jersey right now as I type this. I love this guy.
If Simmons does not develop a 3 ball or even a consistent mid range 2 it won’t matter.  His size/athleticism/passing make him Lebron James minus a jumpshot and that’s still pretty good.

The Lebron James family foundation continues to do some amazing things, including the school, and has for a while, and whether you want to attribute those things to him or not, they wouldn’t have happened without his initiative. There’s no doubt that many nba players are philanthropic in varying ways, and to what extent, who knows. But the fact is lebron is undeniably the most famous one (currently), and he doesn’t exactly shy away from using his image and influence to do some phenomenal things, and although it’s hard to say given the limited amount of public information regarding these things, it seems like lebron is one of, if not the, most philanthropically-minded players in the league."

"I actually think Davis will improve Lebron numbers and vice versa. He can cover for him defensively in Lebron at the 4 Davis at the 5 lineups, allowing Lebron to save more energy on defenders. Then I’m offense he gives him a pick and roll, and pick and pop target on offensive, giving James 9-10.5 assist per game. Meanwhile Davis gets Lebron giving home open looks for high percentage shots, symbiotic. Meanwhile, AD can space the floor on Lebron drivers and require significant defensive attention, preventing more doubles teams on Lebron and opening up easier drives."
"Whose forcing you to listen? Is Lebron James personally calling you up and making sure you're aware of his political stance? That's the great thing about having personal autonomy, you can choose what you consume."
Father time is coming. But LeBron is known for his elite passing and playmaking. So yea...he does need a good supporting cast now more than ever.

"There was a fun fangraphs article that explored what a baseball equivalent of [LeBron would be](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/lets-imagine-a-baseball-playing-lebron-james/).   &gt;This approach assumes it’s fair to say a LeBron James baseball equivalent would be worth 42 WAR in a year. What would it take for a baseball player to be worth 42 WAR in a year? Based on our construction, we have a hybrid shortstop/starting pitcher. When playing the field, the guy hits better than Barry Bonds and fields better than Ozzie Smith. When pitching, the guy still hits better than Barry Bonds, and he doesn’t really ever get removed, and he allows an average of basically one run per nine innings. Craig Kimbrel has allowed an average of 1.64 runs per nine innings. This guy would be a lot better than Kimbrel, and he’d throw nine innings a game instead of one."
im sure you can google lebron james' philanthropy
Lebron James? Nothing. He's already top 10
"So look at the last 5 years.  It's a had one team win three titles, and and two teams led by former champs win the other two.  Everyone except Kawhi, Green, and McCaw on the 2019 Raptors (9 guys) was a first time champion.  The 2018 Warriors are the worst.  Repeat Champs.  Not a lot of turnover.  Only had 4 guys win their first title (Bell, Looney, Young, and Cook).  The 2017 Warriors were also a repeat.  Still had 7 first timers (Durant, West, Clark, Zaza, McCaw, McGee, and Barnes).  2016 Cavs had LeBron and James Jones repeating, but the remaining 12 guys were all first timers.  2015 Warriors were all first timers.  13 guys.  All total it's 45 guys in 5 years, or 9 per year.  Not too far off the average."
"I can sympathize with the owners. Players like Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, and Marcus Morris are becoming way too powerful.   &amp;#x200B;  Oh wait, the owners are even more shady and unprofessional."
"Dirk actually addressed it in an interview as well. Very classy guy.  On LeBron James and Dwyane Wade mocking his illness after Game 5 of the finals in 2011:  Nowitzki: “I wasn’t happy about it. I didn’t think it was funny or anything. I didn’t feel like majorly disrespected or anything. I just didn’t think it was funny. Like I said then in the press conference, I’ve never faked an injury; I’ve never faked being sick before, so I wasn’t going to start in the NBA Finals. People made it a bigger deal. I don’t think it motivated me a lot more, you know this is the NBA Finals we were one win away from our dream. It actually motivated me to shoot 1 for 12 in the first half, so it worked. No, it just happened and we as a team moved on and we were, like I said, one win away and took care of business.”   https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-mavericks/mavericksheadlines/2014/06/12/nowitzki-recalls-being-mocked-by-lebron-dwyane-wade-in-2011-i-just-didnt-think-it-was-funny"

"Youre telling me only D wade, Chris Bosh, Kevin Love and Anthony Davis have chosen to play with Lebron James? Pathetic!"
"LeBron - Durant - Bird - Dirk - Shaq  ---Tough to say but I think that's one of the few combos that could give that MJ team real trouble. You've got three all-time great shooters in Durant/Bird/Dirk. All three of whom are great off the ball on offense as well as at creating their own offense with the ball. LeBron is a capable distance shooter himself. Smallest guy out there is James at 6'8. Only exploitable guy on defense is Dirk... And I think he'd do fine on James Worthy...   That much shooting (plus having three strong passers in James/Bird/Durant) is the only thing I think possible of getting points against a lineup like MJ's... spread things out as much as possible for prime Shaq to try and get some against Hakeem, though at best it'd be a draw down low between those two.  God what a series that would be. GODS NED"

I think hair plugs and lebron james is the greatest pairing
It was an honest question. Just like I wonder if Lebron James spotted that one guy that also came out of high school in the same 2003 draft but never got picked or played in the nba a few million.  Now he has a few kids and broke
He was brought into existence the day LeBron James first held a basketball on this rock we call earth by the old gods and the new.
"&gt;Outside LeBron James,  There *is* no outside Lebron James.  Perhaps he would get less hate cause he wasn't joining the team who beat him but it was be moderately less *at best.*"
"James worthy is one person, it’s not lebron and Worthy."
"I think he will.  Lebron James has a no non-sense attitude, top it off with him being aware that his window for playing at an elite level is slowly closing, I think he'll should a large portion of the responsibility of keeping Boogie in check.    On top of that Demarcus has everything to play for, he's only 28 years old with an opportunity to play himself into what could potentially be his final high dollar contract. (Should he prove that he is over the Achilles injury)"
how hold do you forese Lebron James IV being in 2050?
"This is very flawed logic. Lebron is very clearly a better shooter, how can you even argue that? And with 6 first AD teams to Magic's 0 selections to any AD teams, he's a much better defender. As for ""winning"" Magic was drafted to a super team. Kareem was the best player in the  world and they made each other better. You could absolutely argue that Magic overtook him as Kareem aged. James Worthy and Pat Riley are instrumental, crucial to Magic's success. Despite never having a top 5 all time coach (like Jordan, Kobe, Duncan, Magic, and Russell all had) or a consistent all time supporting cast, Lebron has won more playoff series than Magic (35 to 32) and has a very similar playoff percentage (Bron 0.65 to Magic 0.67) and of course, they both have the same finals appearences, with Magic winning twice more because he had both a top 5 coach and a better squad than Lebron ever had."

Lebron James used to guard people tho
"Say what you want about KD but he’s 5x the leader kyrie is. I should probably say infinitely times the leader bc kyrie isn’t one at all. KD has never caused problems anywhere. He’s always had his teammates back and goes out there and plays with his head up win lose or draw. He handled that draymond situation with class. He rooted for the warriors without him and continued to do so after tearing his Achilles for them.   Could you imagine someone like draymond called out kyrie like that? The guy who has shrugged off his coaches and *lebron fucking James*. The guy who didn’t get along with one of the 3 best coaches in all of basketball that was praised as being more than just a coach by other players?   They shouldn’t be compared beyond both being emotional, which there’s nothing wrong with in itself."
I love how people forget Lebron James is on our team. Lebron James. Lebrawwwwwn james
"East first because the West is impossible:     **East:** 1. 76ers - Love the team they put together. I feel like a lot of regular season success with this group.  Simmons/Embiid a year older, Harris with a bigger role, Al/J-Rich should integrate easily. (Range 1-2).      2. Bucks - Losing Brogdon will more then people expect.  Not confident about this pick as they are the favorites to be the first seed with good reason. I expect some regression and less injury luck.  (Range 1-2).      3. Celtics - Hayward is another year past a freak injury.  Wing depth, rejuvenated Kemba will help. Losing Hortford will hurt the most, but the East is still open after #2. (Range 3-6).      4. Raptors - Assuming they don’t fire sale, the Raptors still have a strong nucleus without Kawhi, especially in the regular season. They’ll miss Danny Green’s spacing a lot.  Interested to see what types of lineups Nick Nurse has in store. (Range 3-7/Unknown if they blow it up).   5. Pacers - Sneaky good offseason for the Pacers. They get younger, and have some different end game line ups. Giving Oladipo a perfect backcourt compliment will be fun to watch when he gets back to full strength. (Range 3-6).      6. Nets - One season away from getting into the title contention mix. They’ll be fun to watch, they national attention and some injury luck might help Caris LeVert make an all-star team, or maybe that’s wishful thinking. They’re deep enough to be a playoff lock. (Range 4-7).       7. Heat - Do they get Russ?  If so I can see them being a much better regular season team than this. As constructed Dragic and Butler will be an interesting pairing. Excited to see Bam not have to backup Whiteside. (Range 6-8 without WB, 4-7 with).      8. Pistons - Another rumored WB destination, even though I don’t see it happening. They fine tuned their bench with limited flexibility, if they stay relatively healthy they could be an interesting regular season team (Range 7-10).      9. Magic - Locking themselves into a 8 seed contender by bringing back Vuc. I don’t see them topping what they did last season. They’ve built a long team that can’t really shoot....speaking of which do they decline Markelle Fultz option?! (Range 8-10).        **West:**  1. Rockets - I feel like a fool doing this. Leaning on an old Chris Paul, a team with no real backups at the 4/5....but I believe in James Harden, D’Antoni, and more importantly Darryl Morey. I can go on to talk myself out of it, but it’s July and I’m rolling with it (Range 1-6).       2. Clippers - Paul George and Kawhi will be load managed, but they have the depth to do it. (Range 2-6).       3. Nuggets - Probably the favorites to be the #1 seed just by retaining their team. They are so damn deep even though I don’t love their options at the 3. Also what an sneaky awesome trade for Grant.  I fear a little regular season regression / injury luck, but another year of development in Jokic/Murray is scary. (Range 1-4).        4. Jazz - Upgrading Rubio to Conley will ease the load on Mitchell for sure. Losing Favors/Crowder will be a sacrifice to their wing defense, but Bojan will make their offense super scary (plus he isn’t bad defensively).  Gobert will be the key here. (Range 1-4).       5. Lakers - LeBron and AD is almost as scary as relying on Rondo/Cousins for meaningful minutes. They are a playoff team, but the regular season will be a grind. (Range 3-7).       6. Trailblazers - Betting on Whiteside/Hood is an interesting take, but Aminu and Harkless played themselves off the floor in multiple playoffs now. Whiteside looks like a good Nurkic stopgap. I seriously hope they go get Kevin Love, even without him they can have another great regular season. Range (3-6).       7. Warriors - Truly a shell of what they were during their dynasty. But if healthy they still are a playoff team with Steph, DLo, Draymond, Looney. They will need some injury luck and good minutes out of their deep bench guys. (Range 6-8).        8. Spurs - “Don’t count out the Spurs”. Serious nephews don’t. Plus they added so much wing depth that they lacked in recent years. (Range 7-9).        9. Kings - Love the Dedmon signing, this team is gonna be fun again.  Might regress or improve depending on if one of their young guys pop.  Feels bad that they are in the West. (Range 8-11).       Outside shots: Timberwolves / Mavs - both teams with star players, but lack depth or have serious question marks. Again the tough part about being in the West. Oh and the Pelicans will be sneaky good. The West is gonna be wild."
"*""I'm feelin like the world is Skip Bayless, and I'm LeBron James""* 🔥"
Lol how is 1 year of iffy deals and signing Lebron James much worse than ruining a possible dynasty? It's not even close he barely did any lasting damage we got AD still and built a pretty good team just the summer after he quit

"because I know the strengths and weaknesses of the players in each roster and can make an educated guess on how a potential series would play out? with your logic we can't make *any* prediction.  who's guarding LeBron in Utah? who's guarding Kawhi and PG13? Royce O'Neale and Ingles are your best wing defenders, that's not enough. and if you're putting O'Neale on the floor for 30 minutes just to have a chance of slowing down these guys you're giving up from your own firepower on the other end.  don't trust me? this is from Zach Lowe's latest piece:  &gt;Which projected starter is defending huge alpha wing scorers like LeBron, George and Leonard? What about James Harden? That job fell mostly to Ricky Rubio in last season's playoffs.  Dante Exum and Royce O'Neale figure into those questions. They bring some of that missing oomph. But will Utah be able to score enough against elite defenses with one or both on the floor?"
"If you're relying on 34 year old LeBron James (or 34 y/o anyone really) to bang down low for the entire season to win regular season games, you are in trouble. Fatigue is a thing.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"Zion is handling it well, but wasn't the same level of hype out of high school. Not even remotely close, honestly. The entire basketball world knew who Lebron James was when he was a Sophomore.     Also, Zion is about a month into his NBA career vs 16 years.    Not to shit on you, but we'll see."
"When it comes to winning championships, coaches are extremely important, and saying that Doc and Carlisle *only* made it there on the backs of all-time great players is simply not true.   I'm not saying that you don't need amazing players, and I'm not even sure why you're bringing up GMs when no one mentioned them - I'm just saying that bar a few exceptions like Lebron James, you need a smart coach to make it there and get the chip."
LeBron James is gay.

Lebron James Implicated In Performance Enhancing Drugs Sting
Our best player (IT) was out and we went against Lebron James who owned the Eastern Conference for a decade. Now that Lebron (and Kawhi) are gone its more likely Brad Stevens will lead us there as the competition is weaker
&gt;Is he something like LeBron James of the 90s?  No. Better. LeBron has what? 1 scoring title? 1 DPOY?
"Tbh, and I say this as a truly devout Witness to our one true King himself, Lebron James... I dont think LeBron can scrap. This is completely a guess, but LeBron ain't trill, he's never squared up even once on camera, he's never shown himself to be involved in any real combat training (I think he and the Heatles did some aerobics with boxing gloves on), and if I had to guess, I would say that IF LeBron has ever been in a fight, it was likely well before he grew into any semblance of his body we know today."
[He actually is!](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-lebron-james-gives-away-no-23-jersey-to-anthony-davis-tweets-possible-hint-about-new-number/amp/) He’s giving the number to AD
"I’m a Cleveland fan so I want to see Lebron succeed, but ever since this trade I’ve been such a Houston bandwagon it’s not funny. If I have to hear “James harden isn’t better than Allen iverson because he’s never made the finals”, I’m gonna kick someone in the teeth"
"Wade gave an interview last season during his farewell tour where he talked briefly about how the trade went down and how he preferred to stay with the Cavs that season.   https://theathletic.com/738829/2018/12/29/dwyane-wade-signed-with-the-cavaliers-knowing-lebron-james-would-leave-for-lakers-heres-why-he-wanted-to-stay-in-cleveland-anyway/?redirected=1#_=_  Sounds like we was blind slighted by the trade. He never asked to leave. 'Bron didn't do him a solid. He moved his ""Boy"" to Miami in order to free up cap space for other trades."
Imma say LeBron James and his million dollar training staff know more about exercising and taking care of his body then some rando on reddit.
"He's not here JUST to direct LeBron James, he's here to direct EVERYONE"
"To a lot of Clevelanders he's the one member of the big three that actually wanted to be here. Kyrie and LeBron both bailed when they felt it wasn't the right situation for them anymore, but Love stuck it out, even when he wasn't playing well and having to change role to fit with LeBron and Kyrie. And then after both left, he still wanted to re-sign and commit to the team and city long term. Clevelanders have a soft spot for loyalty. LeBron James (twice), Kyrie, Jim Thome, CC Sabbathia, theres a long list of good players that left Cleveland for a ""better opportunity""."

It would take a lot of self control to stay with your high school sweetheart and be a superstar at the age of 18. I dont think I can do it. Legit 10/10 THOTs in waves will throw themselves at you day in and day out if you are a guy of LeBron James' caliber
"Sorry, I just don't buy it. Danny Green shot a career high 45% from 3 this season, the spacing allowed him to shoot at a better volume.  That's just one example.  He's not going to get people paid like Lebron james has done for other players, but he still elevates them enough to where they can compete.  No one ever says this about tim duncan. I don't think anyone would say tim duncan isn't a leader because he's mostly quiet. that's what the GM says, the gm says he doesn't rally his team, he doesn't elevate anyone. I don't get it.   Just his presence on the floor elevates people. I think if you put melo in kawhi's place, siakam is not going to go off like he did or fred. Not because they're not capable, but because melo's playstyle won't allow them to be put in places to succeed."

"If we're talking MVP by definition, LeBron James should've won it every year, barring last years Lakers squad. If we're talking MVP by definition, Harden should've won it last year, that man was single handedly changing how players guard him just by existing over the half court line.   But the media hates multiple MVP's. They hate it when a player singlehandedly dominates as hard as they do, so they find another player who's doing it for their first time and give them the MVP.  Don't get me wrong, Giannis played out of his mind, and dunked on the entire league. In another year, 100% he deserves that MVP.   It's just a crime to see Harden outscore the entire league and not earn that MVP."

"I wrote you a haiku  ""Lebron James blocks per Game:  Point 5 chase down blocks per Game. Point 5 blocks per game."""
"Bro how do you justify calling LeBron better after you dig into the advanced metrics and stop with these crazy hot takes. Like for instance we can compare a series of four of the most used advanced performance metrics BPM, VORP, PER, and WS/48 from this regular season.   Caruso: BPM:9.5/VORP:7.3/PER:26.3/WS/48:.226  James: BPM:4.1/VORP:3.3/PER:26.1/WS/48:.194  Here we can clearly see how Caruso surpassed LeBron's performance in every category. You can argue a variety of points for both players in terms of individual skill level, but I hold that Caruso has taken a worse team in a harder conference to a better position than LeBron has on the second most star studded starting roster in the league. Caruso's  performance has been phenomenal and should have earned him more respect than the people in this comment chain seem to give him. I'll wait for a response with actual reasoning instead of you just quoting ""LeBron is better"" over and over again."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that.

Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"Of course he needs help to create a good offense. Even Lebron James needs reliable shooters to kick out to. A teams offensive rating is built by the team not one guy. There is no top offense in the NBA that only has one elite player, I don’t care who it is every offensive star needs other good offensive players around him to have a good team offense. The Pistons literally only have one elite player. The guy you’re replying to simply listed out what Blake has over other players, I don’t see how he made it seem like Blake is some god."

"He's there as a two-way superstar who can create his own shot. He's not a playmaking savant who can also score. This criticism is unnecessary.      Kawhi's impact isn't raising the levels of other players. It's giving his team the best opportunity by playing elite level defense, have elite hustle on the small things, providing gravity on offense, and the ability to score at will.       Also, elevating other teammate's game does not mean he doesn't rally his team. I don't think he would have won the 2019 championship if his team wasn't rallied. He was integral to their success as a leader.      LeBron James, Magic Johnson, and other superstar players known for ""elevating others' play"" are MOST often running a Point Guard or Point Forward position. They are MOST often making the best decisions because their BBIQ is elite."

In the 2018 Finals (pts scored by Steph against various players):   Player | Possessions Guarding Steph | Steph Pts ------|--------------------------|--------- Kevin Love | 9.0 | 5.8 LeBron James | 8.0 | 2.8 Tristan Thompson | 7.0 | 1.3 Jeff Green | 7.0 | 1.5 JR Smith | 21.3 | 5.3 Jordan Clarkson | 8.0 | 1.0
"&gt;	While out in LA, (Jordan) basically let it be known that any of the NBA guys who were in town should come and play with him.  &gt;	They had unbelievable games all summer long.  &gt;	That meant that when Michael came to training camp he was in incredible shape and incredibly motivated.  -	Kerr on Jordan playing ball to get in shape.    &gt;	 James missed a career-high 13 games during the 2014-15 season, his first in his return to Cleveland, most due to lingering disc issues in his back.

LeBron James is left handed
"That’s awesome.  The question is, can a small market team win rings in the NBA.  Seems like you need more than one superstar which means big city luxury tax spending.  LeBron James did show you can do it in Cleveland, but can you only do it if your superstar is one of the best ever?   When was the last time a non LeBron James small market team won a ring?"
"Here is a list of potential free agents (some have player options but most of them are likely to decline the option in favor of a longer term deal barring injury, and as Durant just showed, may not even then)  * Lebron James  * Kawhi Leonard  * Giannis Antetokounmpo  * Blake Griffin  * Paul George  * Rudy Gobert (may get extended)  * Bradley Beal (may get extended though it looks less likely right now)  * Victor Oladipo  The above are kind of cornerstone players, potential All-NBA players. Lebron and Blake will be older, but both will still probably command multi-year maxes at that stage (though some team may end up regretting it ala Chris Paul).   There are ""second tier"" players though that in any other year would probably be headliners (like when Gordon Hayward got a max contract)  * Jrue Holiday  * DeMar Derozan  * CJ McCollum  Andre Drummond will be a free agent. Otto Porter Jr. will be a free agent. Other interesting players like Justise Winslow, Josh Richardson, Jerami Grant (though I think he can opt out in 2020 and should, he'll get a massive deal then), these guys would be in line for $60 to $80 million dollar deals this year but aren't even in the top 12 for 2021?  And we haven't even touched on the older player market (Mike Conley, LaMarcus Aldridge),  as well as what would normally be the mid-tier but will be scrounging for MLE's (Joe Ingles, Lou Williams, Derrick Rose who will only be 32 years old remarkably by then, Will Barton, Kelly Oubre Jr, etc).  Lonzo Ball will be a RFA. So will Jayson Tatum, De'Aaron Fox, Jonathon Isaac, Lauri Markkanen, Donovan Mitchell, Jarrett Allen, etc (what a good draft year btw). And while the RFA market is normally dead (like Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum won't really be available), there will be a lot of teams with cap space to be disruptive.  Speaking of that cap space, did you notice how many two year contracts were tossed around this year? This is why. It's also why Chris Paul's contract is untradeable. He has a $40 million dollar player option for 2021 that at age 36 he's surely going to exercise. Right as the largest Free Agent bonanza ever hits.   What we saw this year wasn't just free agency movement. Going in you had Durant, Irving, Thompson, Butler, Walker, Russell, and Leonard as your franchise altering players. Than you had the second tier (Middleton, Harris, Horford, etc). The reason this year got wild was the gyrations teams went through to accommodate two of those franchise altering players (Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler). That created a ripple effect that impacted OKC which is still rippling.   With more top tier players moving in 2021, you should probably expect more big trades as teams try to assemble rosters around them to entice those players. So players we aren't even expecting to be impacted, like Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul were this year, will end up in play in 2021 in addition to that ridiculous roster posted above.   We also don't yet know who the inevitable ""disgruntled stars"" will be like Anthony Davis. Again, Davis forced his way out to play with Lebron. It'll be no different in 2021. Does Devin Booker force his way out? Karl Anthony Towns? (not making predictions Suns/Wolves fans, strictly using those guys as examples, no offense intended).    When you look at the cap space, it's obvious other NBA teams see the same thing. Only the 76ers and GSW are guaranteed to be completely capped out in 2021, and GS in particular has shown that that won't necessarily stop them from being able to make moves (the same is likely true for the 76ers). The Nuggets, Rockets, and Nets are already pretty close, but the entire rest of the NBA (25 teams) can plausibly enter 2021 with max free agent space (or more) with minimal effort.  NBA teams are being hyper protective of their 2021 cap sheet for a reason."

"Yeah, I think i just watched afew summer league games where you could easily argue some of these players had more pressure to perform than Lebron James in the 2011 NBA Finals.    If some of these guys do well, they could end up with a minimum salary contract ($600,000) or more next year.   If they don't, let's say they end up getting a median salary job ($30,000) for 25 year olds next year. With the possibility of less, given that many of them have no experience doing anything else besides playing basketball.   I think that's a whole new level of pressure."
I agree with most of your take but Melo was not the most unguardable player at any point   There’s this LeBron James guy you might’ve missed
"&gt; his stat line this (and previous two) seasons come from his insane usage, and total shot attempts.  Again, TS% already takes care of that, and he’s damn good at it.  &gt; If James Harden was taking as many shots as Curry, Harden or Kawhi it obviously wouldn’t look as nice.  What?  &gt; He has a 40% usage rate, and the next closest player arguably in the top 5 is Giannis at 32%  Okay, and? I feel like you dont really understand what usage rate is.  &gt; What I’m saying is obvious, but people should see first why he was able to average 35+ this season. He was in a favourable situation, where he had the ball the most and was shooting the most.  TS% takes care of that, and he’s damn good at it.  &gt; Again, I said he was efficient but compared to the other 5 I mentioned above he isn’t known for his efficiency.  Except that he’s literally more efficient than half of them on way more attempts than everybody...  &gt; He’s a 44% and 36% from the field shooter. That’s extremely good, but it’s not elite.  TS% already takes care of that, and he’s damn good at it.  &gt; Again, LeBron and Kawhi are both better shooters than him. Not just Durant and Curry  TS% already takes care of that, and he’s better than both at it.  &gt; Any statistics you have to defend Harden being better than them is solely during the regular season. When the post-season comes around, he decreases in efficiency and production while the other two flourish.  If we ignore all context, sure.  &gt; Prime example; Kawhi has shot better from the field and beyond the arc since 2016 and is clearly the superior and more efficient player during the playoffs  Kawhi also has a significantly lower load to carry, and has always had better teammates all around. He’s also not in charge of playmaking and carrying an entire offense."
Of course we do. The biggest thing LeBron James ever did was give Kevin Love depression
The biggest part of his legacy is the depression he received from LeBron James so
"I think we’re just not understanding each other.  I’ll try again:  Some (not everyone) have James Harden as their top guy currently in the league because of his outstanding performance this season.  What I was trying to say was, his stat line this (and previous two) seasons come from his insane usage, and total shot attempts.   If James Harden was taking as many shots as Curry, Harden or Kawhi it obviously wouldn’t look as nice.

"&gt; usage, possessions,  Usage doesnt equal points...  Also, he’s literally the all time leader in points per 100 possessions. So youre wrong.  &gt; Also, James Harden is efficient, but largely due to his abnormal amount of FTA  So he’s efficient only because he takes efficient shots. Alright...  &gt; Harden more best known for his scoring and playmaking, not efficiency.  He’s the posterchild of analytics.  &gt; Curry, Durant, LeBron, Kawhi, AD All definitely more efficient, and don’t need nearly as many shots or free throws to produce at the same level as Harden.  Curry and Durant sure, the others are factually incorrect."
"No, I mean people look at his stat line and think he’s the best player in the league.  But don’t realize why he scored so many points compared to other superstars (usage, possessions, etc)  Also, James Harden is efficient, but largely due to his abnormal amount of FTA. Harden more best known for his scoring, not efficiency.   Curry, Durant, LeBron, Kawhi, AD  All definitely more efficient, and don’t need nearly as many shots or free throws to produce at the same level as Harden."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true          shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"&gt; I’d put both of them over him right now too. Not by a massive amount sure but still enough  I can see an argument for Kawhi, but what are your arguments for LeBron James over Giannis right now?"
" Steve Nash and LeBron James won MVP with the 4th best team record in the league, the Suns as a 3rd seed. The Rockets had the 3rd best overall record in the league.  Harden had precedent.  He also set an all-time NBA record... Creating more points than any player in the history of the NBA.  Did you know that?  Probably not... Because there was no ***narrative*** for it."

Lakers officials, I'm told, have expressed to Kawhi and his camp that they will treat him as a franchise cornerstone and will do everything in their power to ensure he has a long, healthy career as a Los Angeles Laker. They emphasized that given the star power on the roster, Kawhi will have no issues taking nights off as needed, under the supervision of Judy Seto.  &gt;LeBron independently expressed that as his career winds down, he is comfortable conceding the spotlight to both Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis. He mentioned that after his championship in Cleveland, he's satisfied with his time as the undisputed primary option, and now would like to focus on extending his career to hopefully cross paths with his oldest son.  &gt;Best Regards, Mr. Rambis"
"We have 5 HC's. Vogel, Kidd, Hollins, Rondo, and LeBron James."
"Direct quote from Lebron James circa Bejiing Olympics in '08: ""I thought I was famous until I got here with Kobe.""    Carmelo is also on record stating that the fans were absolutely crazy about them all, but that Kobe was treated as if he were a rockstar. People loved the Jackson 5, but they went insane over Michael.  As a Lebron fan, you don't have to fight every battle at any slight inclination of someone implying Kobe had the upper hand in any subject. He was undoubtedly a top 5 name in basketball from '00 - '03, behind only Iverson &amp; Shaq, and the most notorious name in basketball from '05 - '09. Kobes case was special. For every TMac, VC, A. I. &amp; Shaq, Kobe simply endured longer in popularity due to a multitude if reasons. He maintained that level of popularity through TWO generations -- yes,  TWO -- whereas by the time Lebron, Wade, &amp; Carmelo were peaking as HoF level players, the VC's, Iversons, &amp; McGradys were leveling off while Kobe was still being measured beside the up &amp; comers.     Kobe, more so than any other player from his era, was the measuring stick.  From his generation all the way to that stellar '03 draft class. That reality is an objective testament to how much weight his name held. Nationally &amp; internationally. He was huge. His own teammates in the Olympics deferred to him to close it to Spain &amp; in the case of guys like Wade, will tell you he was their favorite player.  It was a combination of his diet-MJ playing style, his polorizing personality, and the fact he played for arguably the most decorated &amp; distinguished franchise in sports. He was Hollywood and as much of a showman as he was a mere basketball player. His oncourt flare, tendency to make headlines (good and bad) and the fact he played in Los Angeles for the LAKERS were all pivotal in his enduring popularity.    We take a lot from Kobe, but pretending he wasn't at the center of basketball for a decade is ludicrous &amp; juvenile."
Braves are 7.5 games and first and our economy isn't based around LeBron James and a Big 10 football team
If all of them were named Lebron James it could work.
"LeBron James averaged 31 PPG in his third season in the NBA. Kawhi is in his prime and yet to reach those numbers.  Not saying he has to, just putting into context the vast gap between their bodies of work. LeBron has been at the top for over a decade."
Dude that's the LeBron James Mickey Mantle Gene
"Everything I just said is stuff out of his own mouth lol. How is that speculation? He’s not obligated to do or say anything. It’s his prerogative to do as he wants. Did he have to come out and support Pelinka in that way? I don’t think so. He didn’t have to comment on our whole team that way - simply saying him and LeBron alone can take us to the finals. Would anyone bat an eye if AD said “I like any team with LeBron and AD”? He went out of his way to say he believes in all 14 guys - he didn’t have to do that.   Also, I don’t think Jeanie has had as rough a start as controlling owner as some people say. What exactly has gone wrong that’s so bad? Since taking over, we traded Lou to Houston for a pick that ended up netting us Kyle Kuzma. We drafted well. We didn’t sign any long-term contracts. The Mozgov and Deng contracts aren’t hampering us like they were. We signed LeBron James, a player who is still top 3 at worst. We traded our assets for Anthony Davis, a player who is top 7 at worst. We held on to one of our young players in Kuzma. We didn’t have to absorb a shit contract in trading for Davis. We didn’t give up as many picks for Davis than the clippers did for George.   What are our bad moves? We traded Zubac for nothing. That sucked, but he probably would’ve been let go in order to sign AD this past summer. I’m fine with it. We didn’t re-sign Brook. That sucked too, but how much of a discount would he have taken to come back to us this upcoming year? Not enough to hold onto him probably. Julius Randle walked for nothing. We were offered a second round pick for him. I don’t think it’s that bad of a loss considering you can just buy second rounders for straight up cash nowadays.   We looked bad in the media, but how much of that was actually Jeannie’s fault. Magic left without telling anyone. That’s not her fault that he left like such an ass. And in fact, I’m so happy he left. We’re better off without him in that role. People shit on her for Linda Rambis, yet as she rightly said, Linda’s been around since the damn 80’s. People only care now because we were looking for more ways to shit on her.   If getting two top-seven players on your team, a bunch of 2-year contracts on the books, and having the future flexibility to still be a presence in the draft is considered “bad ownership”, then I think most of the league has bad owners."

"I'm not saying it's not relevant to anything. I was just saying it wasn't relevant to zubac and Harrells defense. I was just talking about their defensive value in the abstract. That's all I meant man.   I actually think they'll be fine in the regular season. Boogie can give them enough against bad teams in the regular season, they've got enough scoring and depth behind AD and LeBron to rest them a bit.   It's the playoffs that I think they will probably be killed whenever AD is off the floor because they don't have enough defense to offset when he sits.   During the regular season when teams aren't flat out and when you can't game plan specifically for each opponent like you can in the playoffs they'll get by fine just on the sheer talent of James and Davis.   I think the worry is when the playoffs roll around they'll struggle to get enough good players in their rotation. However they will have playoff LeBron and Anthony Davis which will probably be the best duo in the league, or at the very least as good as anyone elses."

That’s a pretty sexy stat you pulled up there. But you can’t compare Paul George and Lebron James. I don’t even need to pull up basketball reference to argue that.
Because believe it or not Lebron James is not the GM nor in the front office of the Lakers
"""I didn't mean LeBron specifically. When i said LeBron i meant the idea of him, people like him. People like LeBron James, specifically LeBron James. But i wasn't actually talking about him."""
LeBron James
"From the SI piece;  &gt;”He was elevated to GM in February 2014, although everything pivoted once LeBron James decided to rejoin the Cavs that July. Griffin celebrated at first, then collapsed on his office floor in tears after James’ letter ran on SI.com, overwhelmed by the sudden pressure to deliver The King’s coveted ring.”  Props to Griff for admitting the pressure was getting to him before Lebron even entered the building.  It would have been nice for him to specify what he meant when he said Lebron didn’t have the same desire to win after 2016, he vacillated between saying its human nature to ease up a bit after delivering Cleveland’s first championship in 52 years and saying he wished he would have done things differently to keep the team as driven as the year before to saying Lebron disproved his concerns he had at the time by going to 2 consecutive Finals after 2016–**could have been a little more clear, Griff**."
James Harden isn't LeBron bro. Nothing can save the sun's right now. Not when you have dragon bender and chriss starting in your frontcourt
Hmm it was a great game that’s true  LeBron james dropped 25/9/6 as an 18 year old rookie in his debut  Mcw had a better debut  Bjennings had 17/9/9
"Had the letter came before the decision if entirely agree. I don't think Sam presti taking veiled shots at Paul George for forcing a trade with years left and going on to say well hey we weren't really happy about this but what choice did he give us- that's also not treating someone negatively. When a player puts himself above the organization why is there any expectation of decorum from that org to the player on the way out? Blast our free agency plans on national television and not even have the decency to tell me privately about your plans to bail and all of a sudden the narrative is the Cavs did LeBron wrong by having a RIGHTFULLY upset owner (albeit I think Dan Gilbert is a dolt but actually suggesting this letter is in anyway a negative toward the org and not entirely brought upon by LeBron's way he chose to leave) write a mean letter. Fuckin woah lad.   The letter maybe wouldn't have happened had LeBron actually treated the Cavs properly. The effect wouldn't have surely happened without the cause. Surely logically, the cause and effect of LeBron James decision here outweighs the emotionally driven idea that the Cavs owner writing a mean letter and fans booing him and burning jerseys makes Cleveland the bad guy in this.   Shit lebron could have had his lime light with the corny decision and still privately let Gilbert know so they could make plans to avoid having the first pick 3 of the next 4 years. Blows my mind LeBron is absolved for the banana boat shit just because he came back and won. Which is why I commented originally the poster a remember some fans never forgave LeBron regardless of the ring. And I'm thinking NO SHIT the way he left was horrible. Hence being puzzled at the narrative the blame and guilt fall on Cleveland and not LeBron. Crazy what a few years away from the situation will do for some fans.   Cleveland may have failed to give him a more competitive squad (which is an entirely different topic considering the state of the east from 2003-2013). But they never ever did LeBron wrong for responding in the exact manner you'd expect upset fans and owners to react when your star player hinders your entire off-season and subsequently rebuild because of his antics televising his leaving. Not even remotely did him wrong. The letter was mean but damn if it wasn't the most warranted hate mail I've ever seen written in sports."
"&gt; The Cavaliers were able to answer that question last June, ruining an otherwise dream, 73-win season for a Golden State Warriors team that James respects but refuses to acknowledge as a rival. Griffin felt some relief for not ruining the last few years of James’ prime. The moves Griffin has made since James arrived – trading for Kevin Love, J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert and Channing Frye, signing Richard Jefferson, replacing David Blatt with coach Tyronn Lue – helped yield the desired outcome, even if they had all been initially second-guessed. But **rest didn’t come with that liberation for Griffin because, when it came to James, “I just think he felt a hunger for more.”**  Clearly saying that after the liberation of delivering a championship LeBron felt a hunger for more."

Or how about when he completely and publicly handed his team over to LeBron James????? Why would he have accepted a lesser role when he was by far the best player prior to that?

"3. James harden- Harden’s success is on the back of Curry’s, but his game is more effective than Curry’s because of the system he’s in. I think Harden could potentially move past curry because he is the epitome of Morey Ball, which seems to be the path that basketball is taking 2. Curry- I agree with this one because he really showed that undersized guards can excel and that the 3 pointer is one of the most efficient shots in the game. 1. Lebron- Lebron for so many reasons, but mainly because he ushered in the player empowerment era. Such as orchestrating moves to make a super team, doing shorter deals, and investing more in personal brands and business than actual basketball"
"That last 45 seconds was a stretch, but other than that- Respect for Skip to say something like that.   But also- this whole thing is blown so out of proportion.  If I was a parent on the other team or a player on the other team- I think watching LeBron James go out there basically for a private showing of a dunk contest would potentially be one of the coolest things to happen to me as a parent.   My take is that people just need to find an excuse to tear down greatness. Dudes arguably the GOAT basketball player, never done anything scandalous, been loyal to his wife since high school, raised 3 kids and has done a great job despite not even having a father. People are just jealous"
"Yes, in the extended article (https://www.si.com/nba/2019/08/01/david-griffin-pelicans-rebuild-zion-williamson-anthony-davis-trade-lebron-james-cavaliers) he says that after the 2016 title Lebron is not as focused on winning: “I don’t think he’s the same animal anymore about winning.”  That really looked like a cheap shot to me."
"rofl... again, did you read the article?  Let me quote some:  ""“Everything we did was so inorganic and unsustainable and, frankly, not fun. I was miserable,” Griffin says. “Literally the moment we won the championship I knew I was gonna leave. There was no way I was gonna stay for any amount of money.”""  ""He was elevated to GM in February 2014, although everything pivoted once LeBron James decided to rejoin the Cavs that July. Griffin celebrated at first, then collapsed on his office floor in tears after James’ letter ran on SI.com, overwhelmed by the sudden pressure to deliver The King’s coveted ring. Noise around a superteam is deafening. It can cause combustible conditions. “The reason is LeBron is getting all the credit and none of the blame. And that’s not fun for people,” Griffin says. “They don’t like being part of that world.”""  ""“There were so many things during that period of time that I wanted to do differently. If you make everything about, ‘It’s a destination. Damn the torpedoes, I gotta get there,’ that might be the only time you get there.” Even still, James accepted the GM’s feedback along the way. “He knew I could help him win,” Griffin says. And so James approved of Griffin as a basketball decision–maker, allowing a steady dialogue. “You’ve got to be willing to have very difficult conversations with LeBron,” Griffin says. “I always was, which is why we had a great relationship, because I would tell him what he needed to hear and he respected that I was telling him that for the right reasons.” ""  ""James’ contagious hunger to deliver a championship for Northeast Ohio dissipated. “There wasn’t a lot else for him,” Griffin says. “I don’t think he’s the same animal anymore about winning.” Many in the NBA now suggest James harbors two priorities: enduring to team with his eldest son, Bronny, and one day owning a franchise.""  He HATED that he had to do everything to appease lebron because of his 1 yr deals and constant chirping to the GM. Also, the environemnt lebron and his entourage created was not a friendly one and players didn't (still don't) really wanna play with him. He wasn't bothered by the win-now situation by any means man..."
"It’s because anything with Lebron is extremes - shit like “lmao what a scrub, no where near top 20” or “no entity in the universe will ever surpass King James in the history of history”  So once a player goes in those extremes everyone is primed for potential clickbaity shit (and the non clickbaity stuff gets stuck in there too)"
"Yeah what happened after Griffin was gone and they brought in the guys LeBron wanted? Time to pack up and go f-up the Lakers franchise, which granted was already in the toilet, can't wait till Mr.Durabily and Old Queen James are on the shelf half the year, then what's gonna happen, Boogie to the rescue? I'll admit it if I'm wrong, but the Queen's reign is over, gonna have to settle for that 3-6 Finals legacy"

Maybe Griff will build a great team in Nola but if their ever favorites idk how he will handle the pressure that comes with high expectations."
"&gt;He was elevated to GM in February 2014, although everything pivoted once LeBron James decided to rejoin the Cavs that July. Griffin celebrated at first, then collapsed on his office floor in tears after James’ letter ran on SI.com, overwhelmed by the sudden pressure to deliver The King’s coveted ring.   That’s a direct quote from the SI story.    Griff immediately felt the pressure and his immediate reaction was being overwhelmed, it’s not surprising that he would continue to feel that way if he felt that way before the actual scrutiny began."
&gt; This time there is no Lebron James and immense pressure.
Kyle Lowry only made it onto the All NBA team higher than James Harden once and his team had way more success that year in 2016. Lillard was considered to be better than Steph by many in the regular season last year since he had more of a load to carry. Lebron shouldnt have made any All NBA teams this year because he had a career threatening injury and was carrying a team full of draft busts. Thank god LeGM went into full force and turned that shitshow of an operation around. Lakers and Knicks were just as bad as each other until this summer (assuming Lebron is healthy and AD stays which he should). You cant compare driving out a legend like Shaq and failing miserably at being a first option to all the scenarios listed above lmaoooo
"Sure, in a WC that didn’t have LeBron James/AD Russ/Harden PG/Kawhi Dame/CJ and Jokic but okay go off"
I'm glad you also think Kyle Lowry has been better than James Harden since 2016 oh and Dame was better than Steph since last season and you hate to see it I guess Lebron is no longer one of the 10 best players in the world right n ow.
"Maybe you and OP should read the entire profile instead of reacting to soundbites.      &gt;Griffin warns New Orleans will play buyer at the trade deadline if the playoffs are within his grasp. “People are gonna be like, ‘What the f--- are they doing?’” he says. “We’re trying to win basketball games!”      https://www.si.com/nba/2019/08/01/david-griffin-pelicans-rebuild-zion-williamson-anthony-davis-trade-lebron-james-cavaliers"
"Heard... I see both sides.  How dealing with the pressure of James influence on an organization from Griffins  point of view.  But also Lebron getting fired up about him saying he was miserable or whatever else; especially if lebron felt they had a good relationship.  Like no need to really say it to the media, even if it might be obvious."
"The only comment that could be considered a slight to Lebron is him saying, quoted directly from the SI article: &gt;	James’ contagious hunger to deliver a championship for Northeast Ohio dissipated. “There wasn’t a lot else for him,” Griffin says. “I don’t think he’s the same animal anymore about winning.”  That can be interpreted in many different ways, most of them not being an insult to LeBron. When he first made the move to LA people were saying it was likely for reasons outside of basketball, and that’s not a bad thing. Neither is it negative for someone not to be an “animal” about winning, when they’ve already solidified themselves as the second best player of all time.   His comments are no different than KD’s earlier in the year about the toxic media environment that follows LeBron (through no fault of his own.) People are acting like Griffin is stabbing LeBron in the back when his statements can be chalked up as overly candid more than anything."
"It's a tweet, he didn't write Why David Griffin Is a Motherfucker : a Three Part Essay by Lebron James. He could be talking about Space Jam 2, he could be talking about next season, fuck he could have just finished Season 5 of Game of Thrones and is talking about that. Nobody knows what Lebron means except Lebron, to assume that he's throwing shade at David Griffin, the ""LeGM"" takes  and ""it probably annoyed Lebron"" is jumping to conclusions lol. Calm yourself down, it's a 20 word tweet."
"I can give benefit of the doubt that it was more an inward expression of frustration at the stress of building a team around James, but LeBron James to my knowledge didn't publicly criticize his owner, GM, or head coach's overall ability or culture setting  during his career. People are always looking for a reason to criticize James' character, but when other people talk down on James, people applaud the honesty.  This was not an appropriate thing to let out of the bag, especially speculating on his motivation and effort level."
https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/2/10/10960388/kobe-bryant-lebron-james-trade-lakers-cavaliers  according to that article they weren't calling his bluff. kobe had a no trade clause and shot down both trades to chicago and detroit.
Lol the blatant disrespect to any actual gangster comparing them to soft-ass LeBron James smh
No I didn't care about the volume because the man is older and post-injury now. Derrick Rose is the guy who could finish over centers with dunks and finish layups around prime Lebron James and near prime Dwyane Wade chasing him down while he was 22 years old. What has Kyrie done that makes him the better finisher?
David Griffin is the guy who drafted Anthony Bennet with the first overall pick. He does owe his success in the nba to Lebron James and he has said so many times he said he knows people only know his name because of Lebron. That said I don't think he is hating on Lebron I think he is saying the truth.
1. LeBron James  2. Kawhi Leonard  3. ???
"&gt;Love never had a season above 19 PPG after going to the Cavs.   Yeah that dropoff couldn't have been because he joined a team with LeBron James and Kyrie Irving as the 1st/2nd options, its because he wasn't playing with Rubio anymore"
Lebron has a layup line against Draymond and just swishes jumpshots over Kawhi and also gets layups vs Kawhi. Iguodala is the one who keeps poking the ball away from James and annoys him.
Griff really wasn’t dissing Bron. Just said it’s not fun to be championship or bust every year and be unable to build organically.   But FUCK YOU mode LeBron James is gonna be hella fun to watch.
"&gt;He’s still a competitor, but it’s not his top priority anymore. If it was he would have done a sign and trade to Houston, not signed with LA and missed the playoffs  Didn't James Harden say we didn't need anyone else here to win a championship. He clearly didn't want to play with LeBron."
It's literally [linked in the article](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/11/27/lebron-james-says-he-would-love-to-see-an-nba-floor-with-my-son/)  Here's Bron's [quote from the podcast](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DtDhYk5UcAAv78u.jpg)
"Where TF is LeBron freaking James?, he's easily amongst the three most accomplished players."
"It was widely documented that LeBron was largely frozen out by the new regime after Griffin left. The LeGM stuff stems from Griffin's tenure, not Altman's. Like, why the fuck would a 33 year old LeBron James in win now mode trade Kyrie Irving for a future lottery pick?"
"That’s true for all superstars though? I know LeBron is above them all when it comes to pressure and all that, but if you have KD, Steph Curry, James Harden, Giannis, etc. it’s the same situation"
"Wow, you sure got me! I guess I’ll just have to do with LeBron James and Anthony Davis."
"I kinda understand it. Whatever headline the OP chooses frames what most of the comments are about. For example, nobody in either Reddit post is talking about Griffin saying ""LeBron is getting all the credit and none of the blame. And that's not fun for people,"" Griffin said of the challenge of working with and playing with James. ""They don't like being part of that world."""
How is that being an assholeM Griffin was in the same building with Lebron for 4 years... who else would know better?   Or is he not allowed to speak about King James?
"yeah no, you tell me that after 2016 lebron james doesnt care about winning anymore, that same lebron who had his playoff points high after 2016 with 51 in the infamous game 1 in the 2018 finals. like he clearly still cares, this first season with the lakers they didnt even plan on winning. this season they will be contenders, i dont know if they can make it out of this ultra-competitive west but they are near the top of the list of teams that could win the championship this year."
"Gotta be honest. I'm not sure how much an Irving for George trade really moves the needle with regards to competing against the Warriors. They're still massively outgunned. The outcome that really moves the needle was if they managed to get Irving, James and George on the same team which was what they were gambling on but here's a problem that really doesn't get brought up enough.  &gt; The Cavs’ Big 3 moving forward could’ve potentially been LeBron-Paul George-Kyrie Irving. The new report reveals that Cleveland could’ve traded for George without giving up Love.  &gt;However, the Cavs decided not to do it because of the fear of losing LeBron, who told the franchise he couldn’t guarantee future years. The Cavs didn’t want to give up an asset for Paul George and then lose both him and James this summer.  &gt;If James had committed to the Cavs in the long-term, both him and George could’ve stayed in Cleveland for multiple years.  &gt;From ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski:  &gt;""Last summer, they could have acquired Paul George,” Woj said, as transcribed by NBA Reddit. “I think Paul George wanted to know, ‘if LeBron commits to some years going forward, then I might be willing to commit.’  &gt;“When LeBron wasn’t willing to commit to an extension, that told me, they could have had Paul George without losing Kyrie. That’s a very different team: Kyrie Irving, Paul George and LeBron James.  &gt;“When he wasn’t ready to do that then, Cleveland was worried and rightly so.”"
"A pissed off and hungry lebron james with a full offseason of rest? Yea, some people seem to forget this is fuckin lebron james and he will dad dick your team if you like it or not"
"I think last year LeBron knew the Lakers weren't going to be able to make it far, especially after he got injured. I feel like he knew this and is the reason why we saw him regress a bit and slack off on defense more than usual. I'm thinking he's gonna turn it up now that he has a legit squad...  OR I could be completely wrong and he'll be almost 35 years old when the season starts which means even the great LeBron James regresses like any other human."
Bruno Mars and Lebron James?  Justin Bieber and Giannis?  Arianna Grande and Kawhi Leonard    Nah the Goats would actually be   Kevin Durant and Taylor Swift ft. Rhianna 😍
"There always has been and always will be an imbalance. LeBron James = Increased ticket sales, more fans, more TV games, more merch sales, a very high chance of making it deep in the playoffs, all star appearance, top contender for all nba awards. Role Player A = someone that can play their position very well. In my opinion, I think it’s great that the people actually bringing in the money and doing the work on the court are the ones that are beginning to call the shots."
"I think he’s saying LBJ is more interested in LeBron James, the brand name instead of LeBron James, the player and not going balls to the wall about winning after he got the chip in The Land... I agree with you though why the fuck else would he try to get Kawhi?"
And it will be the fault of literally anyone other than lebron james
"Whether he should stay in Cleveland or go to LA. It’s actually genius. He can brainwash kids who don’t like the move into thinking he did it for the looney tunes.   The original monstars are reformed. They’re working in the movie business in LA with the looney tunes. Their former boss has moved on from the amusement park business and wants to get into the movie business. So he decides to recruit more competent minions to go to LA and extract his old minions and the looney tunes.   Already familiar with basketball because of the stories from the amusement park boss, the new guy’s first extract the powers of some NBA players and then confront the looney tunes. They beat them by using the powers because Bugs proposes the challenge thinking they suck without him knowing. The looney tunes are taken prisoner. One escapes (probably Bugs) and finds Lebron James.   He HAS to come to LA. The looney tunes are being chained up, forced to do movies. They want him because he’s the main attraction. But he wants to go with Lebron and go double or nothing. And if they win, they get Lebron. Lebron and bugs and probably Kevin Hart and others win.   Bugs says the only way they’ll ever be safe is if Lebron is accessible. And they can’t film cartoons for kids in Cleveland. Lebron agrees to stay in LA. For the kids."
I love how many people here apparently find it unbelievable that a team with LeBron James on it felt inorganic and unsustainable.
"KD and Kyrie are both trying to overcome the LeBron eclipse.   Winning is actually secondary to perception of legacy, and in that regard, KD couldn’t stay in GS because in his own mind he’s got and asterisk next to his two titles for leaving a great franchise that had that 3-1 lead in the WCF to join the team that was coming off a title and had only 9 losses all season.     So I think the titles didn’t satiate KD.   These bullshit critics that make stories comparing players in the imaginary GOAT lists and social media has put a different pressure on guys these days that wasn’t there before.   So it’s contributed to players decisions not always being about winning titles and being on great teams, but added that “my legacy” factor.   So when players look at the landscape, they want to be “the guy” AND win titles and will try to put themselves in a situation to make that happen even if it means lower chances.   I think guys avoid LeBron simply because of the fact they are competing for that false legacy narrative they get beat up by daily, when they would actually have better odds with James.  Like Paul George choosing OKC, Kawhi going to Clippers, and KDs hate commentary about LeBron.   Kyrie leaving the Cavs.   Kyrie leaving wasn’t a smart basketball choice.   His career season was with James, and he goes down in history with his clutch game winner.   He just wanted that credit, to be the LeBron on his own team.   He tried to put that same pressure on himself and couldn’t handle it.   He called LeBron after getting a new appreciation for what the dude actually brings to the game, and even contributed to his career.   He got to feel that ego competition and the draining pressure that can be for the leader.   Kyrie cracked and showed that weakness in the media calling out younger teammates in a disempowered way and didn’t put the situation on his own shoulders, and lost the respect of his squad.   Then that same legacy pressure killed his game in the playoffs and he ball hogged and shot Boston out of the series.     So the two LeBron haters join forces in what will be the same situation New Jersey had when they had that massive salary load with all the ex Boston players, and I don’t see any titles coming for Brooklyn.   I see them struggle without KD year one which will mess up Kyrie, and it’s question what KD will be when he’s back.   Both are injury prone now, and neither are true team leaders while both strongly desire that role.   They are both extraordinary talents, amazingly gifted players.   I just think the modern atmosphere has worked to warp the priorities of players and it has hurt many of them as they make bad basketball choices, force trades, get coaches ousted, and pressure the construction of teams where they can try to be the guy but end up in a negative situation unnecessarily."
Lebron James dies on court
"&gt;Name one GM in the league who would say no to adding LeBron to their team.  James Jones, he couldn't boss his boss around like that."
"Well David Griffin is an example of someone trying to create buzz. He is literally a fart in the wind without LeBron James, which is why you’d think he would keep his mouth shut. Danny Ainge for example says shit, but he doesn’t say internal shit. Yup there is lots of drama and BS to win a championship. That’s part of the process"
sup it's me lebron james tacooo tuesday guys! haha
"What is your opinion on Lebron James / Rich Paul's agency. From an outsider's perspective it seems that they are doing a fantastic job with Financial intelligence. If you were an up and coming NBA star (rookie) with little to no financial knowledge, no professional connections and want to play it smart... how do you determine who to sign with? Zion's 30 million Rookie deal could be worth 3-5x as much in a few decades in the right hands."
"Everyone in the comments sounds stupid. ""it was the pressure.""   No, it was lebron james toxic ass...."
"The ESPN article takes portions of the original SI article and arranged them out of order to make it sound worse than it was.  For example, the thing about LeBron getting credit wasn't after the talk about winning the championship like ESPN frames it.  Here is the actually paragraph it comes from:  &gt; He was elevated to GM in February 2014, although everything pivoted once LeBron James decided to rejoin the Cavs that July. Griffin celebrated at first, then collapsed on his office floor in tears after James’ letter ran on SI.com, overwhelmed by the sudden pressure to deliver The King’s coveted ring. Noise around a superteam is deafening. It can cause combustible conditions. “The reason is LeBron is getting all the credit and none of the blame. And that’s not fun for people,” Griffin says. “They don’t like being part of that world.”  He is just generally talking about the pressure of having LeBron on the team.  Later in the article he says:  &gt; Maneuvering the league’s most expensive cap sheet was nothing short of daunting. Gilbert loomed. Griffin’s misery creeped on top of the stress. “We won despite our culture to a huge degree. And I knew it. I knew what we weren’t doing,” he says. “There were so many things during that period of time that I wanted to do differently. If you make everything about, ‘It’s a destination. Damn the torpedoes, I gotta get there,’ that might be the only time you get there.” **Even still, James accepted the GM’s feedback along the way. “He knew I could help him win,” Griffin says. And so James approved of Griffin as a basketball decision–maker, allowing a steady dialogue. “You’ve got to be willing to have very difficult conversations with LeBron,” Griffin says. “I always was, which is why we had a great relationship, because I would tell him what he needed to hear and he respected that I was telling him that for the right reasons.”**  So while Griffin is very open about the stress he was under he isn't really criticizing LeBron and says their relationship was always good."
"... are you saying we should be upset about 2-3 good years of Lebron James? I think you're the one who's ""deliciounal"" here lol"
"Who would win in a fight, a potato shaped like LeBron James or a mango shaped like James Johnson?"
"&gt; Leonard lending George leverage is a new extension of player empowerment. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar demanded a trade in 1974. LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh synchronized their free agencies to build their own team in a city of their choosing.  Zach Lowe seems to think player empowerment extends to free agency, do you disagree?"
They matched up worse to the Cavs compared to how they match up with the warriors ? In what world?  &amp;#x200B;  LeBron is gonna eat anyways. And if Iggy and Co can't stop James Harden when all they have to do is play defense since KD is on the court who the hell on the Cavs is gonna do that?
"Lol ""comfy"" gig? You know how fucking stressful it is to manage ego's? Now take that into consideration and have it be professional athletes. Being a general manager of a professional franchise has to be mentally exhausting. Ultimately you are responsible for keeping Lebron James of all people happy at all costs and you think thats comfy?"
One of the hyperlinks on the ESPN article posted here leads to the SI article where the quote referenced on this thread is taken from.  https://www.si.com/nba/2019/08/01/david-griffin-pelicans-rebuild-zion-williamson-anthony-davis-trade-lebron-james-cavaliers
"He is referring to the other players on the team. When Lebron James-led teams win, they talk about what Lebron is doing and not the supporting cast. When those teams are losing, its on the cast and not Lebron. And Lebron does at least partially contribute with the looks he makes on the court and the comments he makes to the press. Then those players have to answer/respond to the media's questions. It's probably crazy stressful having to walk on eggshells so you don't piss Lebron off."
"If you want some numbers, his absolute career high VORP is 2.6. A few players with 2.6 vorp this past season: Larry Nance, Danny Green, Mason Plumlee. Derozan’s absolute career high BPM is 1.8 (it has only been positive 5 total times in his career). A few players with 1.8 bpm this past season: Joe Ingles, Marcus Smart, Javale McGee. Credit where it’s due, he had a few decent WS seasons on those talented yet consistently underperforming Raptors teams. His WS/48 last season was .112, the 5th best season of his career, which was good for 85th in the league right between noted superstars Jeremy Lamb and Maxi Kleber (triple dirks!). Derozan’s absolute career high WS/48 is .170. A few players with .170 ws/48 this past season: Malcom Brodgon, Javale McGee, Bam Adebayo.   These are his absolute best numbers from his entire career that I am looking at. They all come, no surprise, from his 2018 season with the raptors. The one where he supposedly turned his game around, worked on his shooting, decided he would play defense, and led his very talented team to 1st in the east only to get absolutely baptized by Lebron James in what would normally be viewed as a massive postseason embarrassment (after most pundits picked them to win) except instead was just par for the course. Because every one of these same stats for Derozan plummets to near zero or even negatives during the playoffs*, when teams hone in on his extremely exploitable flaws. Demar Derozan is by all accounts a good guy, who should and will be forever loved in Toronto for their franchise, and yet who is also vastly overrated as a player, good riddance from their team, and extremely unwelcome on mine. People will doubtless say I am wrong. But I dare a single person to tell me they want their team to sign him in 2020 or 2021.   *2018 playoff stats  VORP: -0.2 BPM: -4.1 WS/48: .023  2019 playoff stats  VORP: 0.3 BPM: 3.2 WS/48: .149  2017 playoff stats  VORP: 0.1 BPM: -1.1 WS/48: .062  2016 playoff stats  VORP: -0.3 BPM: -3.4 WS/48: .009"
"Why? The facts don't fit your weird narrative? You realize even last year Lebron defended centers like Jokic when he was playing center for the Lakers in the 4th quarters when the Lakers were experimenting with small ball? Jokic never scored on Lebron. The NBA has the matchup data:  https://stats.nba.com/game/0021800066/matchups/?OFF_PLAYER_ID=203999&amp;DEF_PLAYER_ID=2544  In 9 possessions with James defending Jokic, a center, Jokic had 0 points never even got a shot off and had 3 turnovers.  The same has happened in the two Spurs games with Lebron guarding Aldridge late in the 4th. Aldridge could not get the ball with James guarding him in the first Lakers vs Spurs game, and in the second game Aldridge only got one shot off on James in 7 possessions with James guarding him, and he missed the only turnaround shot he did get off after comically failing to post James up and move him.

"Found some articles for folks who were called generational talents and got top picks:  * [Okafor (2015)](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/philadelphia-sixers/sam-hinkie-takes-generational-talent-jahlil-okafor-over-need) * [Melo (2013)](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1750914-comparing-the-stars-of-the-lebron-age-to-the-jordan-eras-legends#slide1) * [Simmons (2016)](https://www.givemesport.com/842270-ben-simmons-is-lebron-james-successor-as-next-generational-talent)  It's a fairly new word in usage. However, I did find this great quote  &gt;The headline on Bernie Lincicome's column in the Tribune of June 20, 1984, read, ""Apologetic Bulls \`stuck' with Jordan."" ""We wish he were 7 feet, but he isn't,"" Bulls General Manager Rod Thorn said, acknowledging the team's need for a center. ""There just wasn't a center available. What can you do?"""
?   It's LeBron James the best player in the world he should be able to blow by anyone without doing anything fancy.   Or maybe he isn't the best anymore?  Checkmate.
"&gt; “I think the friendship part of the league has really grown, especially since LeBron James and Dwyane Wade became such great friends and ended up playing together,” Beasley told Yahoo Sports. “People see friendship as the way guys are teaming up. There’s nothing wrong with people speculating. That’s just what it is, but we’re just good friends no matter what. We didn’t have to play together. It wasn’t necessary. But, we were friends before anything, and we just happened to want to hoop together. But it wasn’t a thing we planned. It just came together.”"
This really shouldnt need to be asked. I feel like anyone with some critical thinking skills could see why Lamarcus Aldridge is not held to the same standard as LeBron James.

LeBron objectively has more game winners than Kobe on a better percentage: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2015/5/11/8584749/lebron-james-michael-jordan-game-winning-shots

"\*however, we could be able to show how much better Michael Jordan was compared to the average player of his day and then compare to that to how much better LeBron James is to the average player today\*  And you were able to put this in a single number, which is fucking great.  Keep working, will check out the progress :)"
&gt; And with the 19th pick the Oklahamo City Thunder draft Lebron James Jr.!
"you're exactly right, and honestly Messi/Ronaldo were pretty much the main drivers behind the logic of this stat (including MJ/LeBron). Because Messi/Ronaldo 50+goal seasons are ""average"" for them but beyond superstar level for an ""average"" person.  In further development of this stat i want to be able to extrapolate it to different eras too as that was the ""second-half"" of the driver behind this logic. For example, pace and scoring is much higher in the NBA due to rule changes, however, we could be able to show how much better Michael Jordan was compared to the average player of his day and then compare to that to how much better LeBron James is to the average player today.  There's a lot of data and statistics to peruse and analyze but i wanted to see how people reacted to this, because i think this is a step ""closer"" to the ideal stat because i have the same view as you that it just never will be enough."
"In today's game, that's 6 flagrant 2's on LeBron James"
"&gt;Boston didn't even have another all star  That's THE POINT! Boston was amazing but hit a ceiling without any star power. Durant goes there, not only are they instantly one of (if not the) best teams in the league, he gets respect too because he'd be ""the guy."" How long have you been watching basketball exactly? It's honestly pathetic how you think this ""teaming up with other stars"" thing is the norm.  &gt;OKC had him for 9 years and couldn't get the job done  Now this is just low. They weren't real contenders until KD was 23, so that drops from 9 years to about 6, 3 of those years were completely derailed by major injuries, that's not OKC's fault any more than it was Golden State's fault this year, so we're down to 3, and of those 3, 1 he lost to prime Lebron freaking James, and he has no right to complain about the other 2 just because both those losses were 2 of his weakest playoff performances ever and had people saying he might not even be the best player on his team.  The move to Golden State in 2016 is not just bad because it hurt the league's parity. It's not just bad because he went to the team he himself choked against. It's not even just that he left an OKC team that he failed. It's all those things, but at the core of it, it shows KD is a weak competitor, he took the easy path because he knew he couldn't cut it the hard way everyone else ever has used."
PG- Stephen Curry  SG- Kawhi Leonard  SF- Lebron James  PF- Giannis Antetokounmpo  C- Anthony Davis
That's 🐐stuff right there.  LeBron has been super smart and invested in his body.  A great article on that is:  https://www.businessinsider.com/how-lebron-james-spends-money-body-care-2018-7  It's the reason why LeBron has now probably survived KD's bid to overthrow LeBron reign as #1 player in🏀  Let's see if LeBron can survive Kawhi's bid to do the same thing next season👀👀👀 😀😀😀😀😀  💪💪💪💪💪💪💪 🔥🔥🔥
"&gt; You’re saying LeBron James is guarding a PF playing center  No, I'm not. Pau plays both positions."
TIL Steph curry was born at the same hospital as LeBron James
"I’m defining centers as centers. You’re saying LeBron James is guarding a PF playing center, therefore he’s guarding center. Plenty of guards can guard Kawhi (relatively well, at least). Kawhi has at times played out of position at the 4. Does that mean that these guards can guard the 4 spot because they can guard Kawhi when he plays 4?"
Lebron James once dunked from the free throw line in a game.   But no one remembers it because they cut to the baseline view and you couldn't really see where he took off from or how far it was.   Sad
"he's not giving Curry credit for existing on the floor. It's for his purposeful actions off ball that create opportunities for his teammates.   Taylor never mentioned LeBron James in the 2011 finals in that video...so I don't really know where you are going with that angle in regards to his position. If you mean how people view LeBron's performance, to them it becomes negligible compared to his own failings as a scorer. Most people don't give a fuck about Curry's gravity. They usually just focus on what he scores.   You didn't address my points about Curry being great in the 4th Q's of the 2016 and 2015 Finals. One of which he is considered outright terrible and the other just okay. I kinda need you to in order to highlight the flaws of using 4th Q scoring to judge the individual performance in a series.  I'm pretty sure game 7 against OKC in 2016 was a high leverage game where he was reliable. It is hard to take you seriously after saying that Curry is unreliable in high leverage games and after saying he was completely absent in a game where he scored 27 points irrespective of his creation for teammates. I'm not even sure how one stat pads free throws.  why do you think games are close, though. You can judge players by their performance in the 4th if you want. Not here to change your evaluation of basketball. But I will not because I recognize the flaws of prioritizing a quarter of basketball relative to the collective whole. I want the full picture. Not snippets."
"Shooting doesn't matter here.  You have Lebron James and Anthony Davis posting up Leonard and... Harden?  And in case that doesn't work you have Cousins posting up Westbrook.  I'm all for the 3 ball, but when the 3 biggest guys are James/Davis/Cousins (all who can shoot btw) it's gonna be a slaughter."
Let Westbrook take 3s all day or let Anthony Davis and Lebron James dunk all day.  I think I know which one i want.
6’8” according to bbref    PG-LeBron James   SG-Tracy McGrady   SF-Trevor Ariza   PF-Carmelo Anthony   C-Paul Millsap
LeBron James
"Had to upvote such a great rebuttal man. Grizzlies weren't on his list of teams though, did they have the cap space? He gave OKC 9 years, they didn't win.  I don't see any other team that would've put him on equal or better footing than the Cavs with LeBron James and 3 all stars total and complimentary pieces they paid for that led to a luxury cap bill more than all 4 other luxury cap teams combined."
http://www.backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/  Good break down of Lebron's career and his strengths plus what little weaknesses he had.
"Please break it down for me how you think they were better than the Cavs.  He only had one other all star vs Cavs with 3 all stars, one of them Lebron James, an all time great, and a complimentary team that led to paying a luxury cap bill more than the other 4 luxury cap teams combined.  He gave OKC 9 years to win.  Isn't that enough chances?"
"Yeah Lebron for sure put maybe the largest possible target on his back with ""not 1, not 2, not 3..."" but at the same time, people massively underrate that Mavs team and act like DWade and Bosh were still amazing in 2014. He definitely needed to be humbled and felt the potential more than the actual chemistry, but at the time, I think he was just saying out loud what a lot of people were saying privately. Honestly, I really don't blame Steph and co. recruiting KD going from on top of the world and being the greatest team of all time to a joke in three games. The idea of having to battle through the West for several more years AND having to go up against Lebron James again and again... it was the smart choice."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"&gt;	Lmfao dynasty? The Spurs only won once in the 2010s, the other Spurs teams were different in terms of roster.  Lmaooo now the spurs weren’t a dynasty, the menta gymnastics lebron detractors do is hilarious.   &gt;	The 97 Jazz and 91 Lakers with a healthy James Worthy would have a shot tbh.  LULZ"

LeBron James said he doesn't have friends in the league outside of the banana boat. He said he has colleagues but people he calls friend? Very few.
Did you just compare John Starks to Lebron James?
"After a very strong playoffs run when it seemed to really danger Lebron's ability to get to the finals, the league issued new interpretations to the rulebook and guided the officials to rule differently around it.  [More on how it was at the time](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-nba-abandoned-roy-hibbert/) (and why Hibbert disappeared from the league in general): &gt; Hibbert was so good at doing this that LeBron James, seemingly frustrated with Hibbert and what he perceived to be uncalled fouls against the big man, once referred to it as “[his verticality rule](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1884443-miami-heat-let-indiana-pacers-set-terms-on-the-court-for-now-but-never-off-it),” saying that officials allowed him to make use of it more than other players.  In 2014 the legaue sent a memo about verticality so it will apply in much more narrow way - [NBA.com](http://www.nba.com/media/Verticality_Plays_Mar_31_2014.pdf)  This was dubbed at the time ""The Hibbert Rule"".   Like I've mentioned, read up that 538 article to see that he had a lot of flaws in his game to begin with that got exposed in the new ""spacing"" era in the NBA, but losing the original verticality deprived him of his one truly elite skill."
"Reminds me of a great point that Isiah Thomas made regarding LeBron James'.  A lot of the all-time great players came up under Legendary coaches: MJ/Shaq/Kobe had Phil, Duncan had Pop, Magic/Kareem had Pat Riley. The best coach LeBron ever had was Erik Spoelstra, and that was after already being in the League for 7 years."
"Lebron James is the GORN. It's not about all time. He's the GORN, right now."
"Weird, Jordan definitely had more steals and blocks than LeBron in less games.

"I’m a Jordan stan and old enough to have watched all 3.  Make no mistake about it, Michael Jordan doesn’t fuk with Lebron.  I made a thread when Lebron passed Mike in points bc the difference in what he said when Kobe passed him vs what he said when Bron passed him is hilarious   Someone said it was a ‘reach’ i said this:  Nah. There's years of ""shade"" from Jordan. Hes more threatened by Lebron than Kobe. ESPN even compiled it 'What the Goats have said about each other over the years'. Read that  It was throughly downvoted and buried. Reason being bc most r/nba posters aren’t old enough to ‘read’ Mike. Humbly speaking, I think I am. Anyone old enough can. He’s ridiculously competitive. And it’s quite clear Jordan has taken a ‘I’m not giving him any fuel for people to think he’s better’ stance.  I peeped that years ago, way before it became a legit debate, and look now it should be much more obvious now that it is a legit debate  (to some)  Someone at espn must get it too bc here’s that article detailing almost everything mike has ever said about Bron. Yea it’s so infrequent you can make a list:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/allstarweekend25788027/the-comparison-lebron-james-michael-jordan-their-own-words%3fplatform=amp"

"LeBron averaged 30 once, and Jordan did it 7 straight times before he left to play baseball.   Jordan could score on anyone, but Jordan averaged almost 23 fga per game for his career. LeBron averages less than 20. Jordan has 8 seasons with more attempts than James' highest season total. But Chamberlin has 5 seasons with more attempts than Jordan's highest season total (which was 7th all time)."

Michael Jordan was an objectively better player than Lebron James.   Full stop.
"What is there to respond to? The person misread the comment; Michael does have better steals figures:  &gt;Jordan played 80 such games in his career and averaged 32.2/6.2/5.8/**2.0**/0.8  &gt;LeBron James played nearly a full season (81 games) of Conference Finals and NBA Finals games from 2012-2018, averaging 29.9/9.6/7.1/**1.7**/1  Last I checked, 2.0 &gt; 1.7. For his career, Michael averaged 2.3 steals per game. Lebron is at 1.6. And I bring up the defensive awards because Jordan is universally considered a better defender than Lebron.  As for assists, there could be a multitude of factors as to why Lebron's numbers are higher. Perhaps Lebron's teammates had a better overall shooting percentage for his career than Michael's, meaning more passes led to made baskets than missed shots, turnovers, etc. But overall I don't think it's a controversial argument to say Lebron is the better passer."
"If you read the full excerpt he says James Harden goes from all time great regular season player to a level below that in the playoffs i.e. Harden goes from LeBron or Jordan Level to Kobe, level in the playoffs on offense. He's not calling Harden a choker or anything close to that.  And being able to be schemed against when you see him 6 games in a row is precisely what he's talking about here."

"Lebron has a decent amount.  Fizdale, the white guy in Cleveland, and James Jones."
"After 2004, the Northwest Division became extremely weak. Portland, Seattle, Utah were all in tear down mode. Minnesota started their descent into their huge playoff drought.  The Nuggets were not good at all, as evidenced by the 2005 series against the Clippers. Despite Karl trying all the gamesmanship tricks he could to give Denver advantages over opponents   By the time Carmelo left, both Utah and Oklahoma had passed them up in the power hierarchy and if not for Roy's knees, Portland would have been well ahead of them too.  Then again, Denver had no problem selling tickets to fans who got suckered into ""watching a single game"" instead of watching a team progress into a contender. Neither did Melo. He forced his way to New York and depleted the roster. He signed a 5 year deal after Lebron told everyone he wanted to play with to sign 3 year deals. He turned down Chicago after Rose won MVP. All these moves players make now are to prevent themselves from pulling Carmelo-style hijinks.  They support him in public and whatnot, but I bet behind closed doors, they probably notice everything he did and tell their agents and friends around the league to avoid any decisions like that if they wanna maximize winning and legacy.  Think about how many playoff moments from Melo get revered and re-lived in real life discussion? Probably the same amount as Smush Parker and Jerome James. Oh, there was that Roy Hibbert play"
I’m just making the point that regardless of his stat line Curry can play a bad game 😂 I’m getting downvoted cause all I said was in game 4 he played like shit. He shot 9-22 and still had 27 which is insane but if that was Russ or James Harden or LeBron they’re getting hell for months
Lebron James
I swear there’s a every year best prospect since LeBron James and they all suck or don’t even come remotely close to the hype.
"there are rarely any people that you can even call ""jordan stans"" in the era when Lebron James is actively playing lol."
"Idk bud. Curry definitely *tries* harder but Harden this past season was actually pretty decent on D.   Also, how is your argument that Curry has mvps and Chris didnt valid? Curry got his mvps while still in a league with Lebron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, etc. Its not as though he didnt have to work just as hard to win one than Wade would've had to. Simple fact of the matter is, one of the main reasons why Wade doesn't have an MVP is because Wade was never able to (aside from a two year span) lead his team to have great regular seasons. The heat were pretty consistent in finishing as a 44 or so win team until Lebron and Bosh came around."

"Yeah they do. Certain players also do one better than the other. Please don't write that off as ""bullshit"". It makes no sense to call it that.  LeBron James is far more likely than Stephen Curry to get a team 50 wins and Curry is better at getting 50 win teams to 65 wins.  Ball dominance typically doesn't scale well, especially considering how quickly it produces diminishing returns, while off ball play fits in literally every single team.   Certain attributes are more scalable than others and more portable than others, which Curry excels at."

"Let’s have a look at that depth.  For years we’ve heard that LeBron James needs shooters. Well, the Lakers have surrounded LeBron James and Anthony Davis with depth that **adequately** spaces the floor. In other words, this year’s depth fits around the two generational superstars.  Wide Open 3PT%, 2018-19 (nearest defender 6+ feet away):  Caruso = 53.1%  Green = 51.3%  Cook = 49.6%  Daniels = 47.9%  Bradley = 40.4%  Caldwell-Pope = 38.8%  Dudley = 37.8%  Davis = 36.8%  Kuzma = 31.9%  **The league average on these exact shots is around 38%**  ———————————————  Lets have a look at the depth that departed:  Ingram = 38.1%  Ball = 33.9%  Hart = 31.1%"
"Lmao the only reason the Cavs have been anything close to relevant over the last 20 years is because LeBron James _happened_ to be born in the state of Ohio.  The Raptors have been getting better year after year and made a series of wise trades and draft picks to get our championship.  But hey, none of that matters now since it’s in the past. Enjoy another 20-25 win season though."
"Wide Open 3PT%, 2018-19 (nearest defender 6+ feet away):  Caruso = 53.1% Green = 51.3% Cook = 49.6% Daniels = 47.9% Bradley = 40.4% Caldwell-Pope = 38.8% Dudley = 37.8% Davis = 36.8% Kuzma = 31.9%  **League average is around 38% on these shots.**  Considering LeBron James and Anthony Davis will require triple teams, it’s pretty safe to assume these “shooters” will be pretty open.  Another note is that Kyle Kuzma has revamped his shot. So, look out for that."
He's not prime MJ. He's also not prime LBJ anymore. And worst of all - he's not in the east.  Guess what - the Lakers had Lebron James last year and won 37.
"The 2018–19 Los Angeles Lakers season was the franchise's 71st season, its 70th season in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and its 59th in Los Angeles.  Following the signing of superstar LeBron James on July 1, 2018, the Lakers hoped to finish with a winning record and playoff appearance for the first time since the 2012–13 season. However, after an improved 20–14 start to the season, several injuries accumulated throughout the season including James, Rajon Rondo, Lonzo Ball, and Brandon Ingram, and the Lakers fell below .500 by the All-Star break. By March, the Lakers were eliminated from playoff contention, extending the team's postseason drought to a franchise record six seasons, and a sixth straight losing season, even after improving from their 2017-18 campaign by two games. It is the first time James missed the playoffs since 2005 and first time he didn't appear in the NBA finals since 2010."

"Their depth is shit but guess what, Lebron James"
LeBron James and Anthony Davis surrounded by shooters is a serious contender anyway you want to slice it.
Nah a team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis isn't  a serious contender
To make it interesting. Assuming rookie LeBron James Harden and prime Chris Paul George.   I think Chris Paul George takes it but it will be a tough battle.
LeBron James Harden and it's not even close
"No he isnt.   Kevin Durant is on the wrong side of  30 years old and coming off a major injury. He will not play next season. That puts him at 31 before he even gets back on the court. He will be 32 before rounds back into form.  He is currently at 22910 points scored. That means he needs 16,000 points to get #1 at least. 15300 for #2 (I'm assuming Lebron will be #1, with over 3900). So at 32 coming off his 2nd major injury, he needs to average 2000 points a season for 8 years. No player has ever done that.   He will almost certainly get top 10.  #1 or 2? Probably not.

"Not excusing his weight at all, and I do agree, they should all look like Karl Malone and LeBron James. That's the one major beef I've had with Carmelo through the years.  Having said that, all of these oversized men should be doing a lot of their work in a pool. It would be so much easier on their joints and harder for their cardio. If not a pool, then they need to at least be on a surface full of sand or a trampoline that can withstand the weight. Those two examples would also be a lot easier on their joints, but a tougher workout to get them in shape.  And, if they have a trainer that hasn't even brought that up to them, they should fire that trainer."
"&gt;  2 years ago  Men age.

I’m honestly can’t tell if you’re trolling or not. If you don’t think a team with Lebron James Anthony Davis and some serviceable role players can’t contend this year then I don’t really know what to say to you.

"Lebron James in his prime, and still missed the playoffs."
"They have the best duo in the league Lebron James and Anthony Davis.. Competent role players like Danny Green, KCP, McGee. Players that could potentially have good upside like Kuzma, Bradley, Caruso.   Kind of weird that you think it’s out of the realm of possibility"

"Is efficiency purely an offensive metric? Sure as shooting goes, he’s elite, but just being a good shooter doesn’t make you an efficient offensive player because it doesn’t consider usage. I’ll point out two things: for having a usage rate comparable to Lebron James and Russell Westbrook, it’s detrimental to your team if you’re not making other players around you better: kyrie has never averaged more than 7 assists a game in his career.  Second, if you’re not elevating the play of others but are hogging the ball, then you better be scoring points at an elite level — he’s not. He averaged 25 points a game once in his career, which means he’s dominating the ball like a carmelo Anthony but not resulting in the offensive output for his usage rate.  If we’re considering efficiency as a measurement of how much value do you contribute to your teams performance for the amount of time you occupy the floor, then you need to consider his defense. I don’t need to say anymore to that point, but I will: kyrie is a fucking god awful defender for numerous reasons, namely effort and the fact that even if he gave two shits he’s an undersized and underskilled defender which means he’s a liability on defense."

"I was high the other night watching NBA TV Hardwood Classics with a baby. It was Pacers team day and they were playing the 2018 Cavs. IND storms back to gain a one point lead, Collison gets to the foul line with 5.0 left in the game, IND could go up 2-1 if they hold on. While at the free-throw, the game caller sees Love and James communicating a long pass to get one shot off and comments on it. Its a solid play that they execute well. JR SMITH'S DUMBASS steals the rebound, casually jogs down the court then heaves a 35+ footer to seal the loss. I don't ever wanna see him play in this country  ever again. I know that's harsh ya'll I know, but Ill never forgive him for that Finals goof. If they steal GM1 on the road KD and Steph would have crumbled, Draymond wouldn't give a fuck but that would have fucked with the others. ""You mean to tell me we have this stacked of a team and we still lost to one man?"" This is just how I feel the postgame locker room would have been. As a person I'm sure he's chill but as a player I wish LeBron would have beat his ass on live television for those loses. Extreme I know but I'm getting mad just writing this.

How many Memphis Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings and Atlanta Hawks fans decided to go to a game to watch Vince Carter?"
"Could not make it past 20 seconds.  No, I would not draft LeBron James Jr. in this year's draft and anyone who says otherwise is an idiot"

"&gt;But there was other losing to account for; Kosloff said he had no knowledge of Richman’s promise for 25 percent ownership and wasn’t going to honor it.  &gt;“Kosloff and I argued about that through the whole summer after we won the championship,” Chamberlain wrote, “and I finally decided that I couldn’t play for the man any more if that’s the way he was going to treat me.” They finally came to an alternative agreement, equally unique: Kosloff would settle the dispute by paying a lump sum and tearing up Wilt’s three-year contract to sign him to a new one-year deal—with the understanding that after it expired, Wilt was free to go. No reserve clause. For the first time in his NBA career, the only person who owned the rights to Wilt was Wilt.

"Best Record: Bucks, because they just blow people out and don't rely on winning close games, so their margin for error is just greater than the rest of the league.  They also have better depth than last season, so they might do better in the doldrums of the season when they rest players.  Best Record in the West: Houston, because Houston, like the Bucks, is very good at the big picture things on offense, but their defense is more inconsistent.  Very close to saying the Clippers, though.  Worst regular season record: The Knicks, cause they have the worst veteran talent and a very disorganized offense.  Number 1 pick in 2020: Cole Anthony, cause the people I trust like him.  Regular season MVP: James Harden, just because of the perception he is owed another MVP and because he won't rest as much as Giannis or LeBron will.  ROY: Zion, because he is the most talented and his team actually could be decent enough he will get credit for playing solid defense.  DPOY: Giannis.  Gobert is gonna get hurt by the fact the Jazz's defense likely gets worse with Favors gone and so won't win it.  Draymond is getting too old to win it and Bucks probably are best bet to lead league in defensive rating, giving Giannis the tiebreaker over other candidates.  MIP: Luke Kennard.  Think he will get much more of an opportunity this season and will put up significantly better stats, while playing more MPG.  6MOY: Lou Williams, because his team will be great and will count on him.  COY: Alvin Gentry, cause I think Pels sneak in as the 8th seed and he will get a ton of credit for them doing better without AD than they did in last season with AD.  Dark horse is Steve Clifford.  NBA Champions and FMVP: Bucks and Giannis, don't think they blow it this time.  Biggest competition will come in the Finals.  NBA Runner-Ups: LAC, because Kawhi is a big time playoff performer and they have fewer weaknesses than other top Western Conference teams.  Biggest Event: I mean, it is tough to predict this, since biggest event has to be the most surprising thing, but CP3 rejuvenating his career or KAT jumping up a tier in perception of him as a player could happen.  Like the Pels, Thunder and Wolves both have some chance to shock people and make the playoffs."
Idk how people see a couple minutes from one movie then say he’s gonna be as good as the highest paid actor in Hollywood lol. If he wasn’t LeBron James you’d pay his performance no mind.
And despite all of those terrible players they finished with a better record than LeBron James' Lakers last year.
"When most players not named Michael Jordan or LeBron James have a bad half or a bad game, somebody else covers for them. Like Durant saving Curry from the worst game of his life in 2018. Harden even had that luxury in 2018 when he struggled at times against the Jazz in the second round at certain points. For most of his career, he hasn’t really had that cushion. Everything was on him and he just isn’t the player to handle that alone."
Doubt it. He’s just LeBron James playing LeBron James.
"&gt; as just a rock level movie star  In Trainwreck, he played LeBron James, it's funny because he is literally LeBron James so it's an NBA superstar interacting with Bill Hader. I'm not saying that to diss his performance but there's some context there. Could LeBron James play a Marine in an action movie and have it be believable and a box office draw without the novelty of ""that's literally LeBron James""? I don't know, but I wouldn't be too flippant about how talented and skilled big time Hollywood actors are."

"So out of all the actual women that Lebron could choose from (and throw themselves at them) he chooses this chick and uses that corny ass pickup line?   And ya'll mofo's are just going to  believe it?   Lebron James saying ""Wow, no freaking way"" in a DM conversation seems authentic to y'all?  Future, Fetty Wap, Sway Lee, 2 chainz &amp; other entertainers outed a few IG bitches who tried to chase clout off of their name. Photoshop is real. But wait, this is reddit. What an attractive woman says is the truth."
"On LeBron:  ""there was a player who did every single thing LeBron James did but better. His name was Magic Johnson.""  I'm pretty sure Magic was quantifiably an inferior rebounder, scorer, and defender, and of course he was a better playmaker, but he was a point guard.   Also on LeBron: "" hasn't proven himself as a championship-caliber player.""  Three titles, 9 finals. I think he's ""championship-caliber player"".  Was this published in LeBron's second year? It says 2012, but LBJ had been in two finals by then and was clearly a  ""championship-caliber player"" even if not a champion yet.   The rest of this article is about 'busts' like Kawme Brown and Darious Miles."

"I have never been that high on him. So this is more about me never being won over I guess. Kuz is nowhere near good enough to be part of a big three. But scoring-wise I do think he needs to be their rd scorer at around 12-15 a game. Given what this team looks slike I will be really interested to see where the offense comes from with  LBJ on the bench. Rondo AD P&amp;R? IDK... There are a lot of unknowns and what appears to be a little actual room for them to maneuver to address any issues that pop up.   I was one of the voices saying the lakers needed to stop pursuing KL and focus on building out the rest of the team (not that my voice mattered). A core of AD and LBJ is leathal with a decent supporting cast. I dont think they ahve enough now for that to be leathal. I think counting on Cruz to be enough to push that over is going to be a mistake.   If this is the lakers starters, as is being reported / speculated:   SF	LeBron James  PF	Anthony Davis  C	JaVale McGee  SG	Danny Green  PG	Rajon Rondo  Then adding in Kuz for McGee and sliding Davis over does very little, unless Kuz's 3 pointers suddenly reappears. I hope it does, but until then i dont want to build on that assumption. looks like a nonshooter line up that LBJ thrives with... and that is still a problem if you sub in Kuz.    IDK, I think people are falling in love with Kuz's potentially more than his reality (and i get that, who doesnt love to do this really?). I think this is a very telling season for him, which is pretty easy to say given it will be his 3rd (boy what a brave take by me). Also, I don't trust the LAL to put together a competent player development program since they haven't in a while. IIRC they hired a new crop of talent to try and right this part of their org (e.g., Jason Kidd?) but I dont think they get it turned around for Kuz. Also, name a more iconic duo than LBJ and successful young talent development on his team (Mario Chalmers?). There seems to be something about LBJ that hampers the youth (i admit this is a poorly researched take). I hope im wrong, Kuz has done nothing to earn my ire or to root against him. I am just not bullish on his future. Maybe its because the league is full of kuz's who don't hit their ceiling and flame out. Hope he proves me wrong.   And honestly, Kuz is the only thing they have to trade at the deadline with any value. IDk what that means, but im saying it."
Stop crying. You have Anthony Davis and Lebron James
"""If he dies, he dies""- LeBron James on Javale McGee"
"Not that much. He was a huge question mark, and they still have Anthony Davis and LeBron James.  He could've been the piece that put them over the top of this loaded West, if he did indeed make a full recovery and reach his previous All-NBA form. Make it a true Big Three instead of one of several duos.  But that was highly uncertain, cuz he was a net negative last year for the Warriors. Sub-50% TS, 1:1 AST:TO ratio, 6.5 fouls per 36 in the playoffs, and a bad defender."
"I think any all star would make a great 6th man. LeBron James would be great coming off the bench.  He'd be the 6th man of the year for sure. But he should probably just start.   Russell averaged 21/7/4 last season. That's really solid. He's a starter, and at 29 mil a season he's getting paid like one.   I think he knows he can be really good in the league. So would he accept a perceived lesser role?  Considering that lesser role probably leads to less money on his next contract? Most players of his caliber won't.   It has happened. Manu Ginobli was a starting caliber guard who came off the bench and flourished in that role. But that's rare."

"READ IF INTERESTED IN OUTPUT: Graph 4 in the Visualizations tab shows the clusters plotted in 2 out of the 3 components used. The Cluster Means tab shows the mean shooting stats for each player type I found. Now looks at the groups specifically:  Group 4 jumps out right away as big men with no outside prowess whatsoever, like don't even dabble in the mid-range, however they have the highest % of PTS from FT's surprisingly, unsurprisingly have the highest % of PTS in the paint, mostly assisted (probably on lobs or post-ups), notables include Clint Capela, DeAndre Jordan, and interestingly Ben Simmons.  Group 6 jumps out next as the group with the highest % of 3PT attempts and % of PTS from 3PTA, they have the least amount of PTS from FT's and in the paint on average and the highest % of assisted FGM, which tells me these are shooting guards who sit around the perimeter for 3's or cuts, notables include Danny Green, JJ Redick, Kyle Korver, and interestingly Dirk.  After these, the clusters start to look a bit more alike, but we'll take Group 2, who take as many 2PT FGA as 3PT FGA and have a very balanced source of scoring, basically sitting in the middle of the pack for everything, the differentiating characteristic I think is that 84% of their 3PT shots are assisted, but 58% of their 2PT FGA's are unassisted, so I'm thinking driving wings that can shoot, probably high volume scorers too, notables include Steph Curry, Paul George, Jamal Murray, and Buddy Hield.  Group 3 strikes me off the bat as stretch 4's or centers trained to start shooting 3's (bigs like Derrick Favors or Kevon Looney), 88.5% of their shots are 2PT FGA and 66.5% of their PTS come in the paint, but 8% of their PTS come from 3's and 97.8% of those PTS are assisted, notables include Anthony Davis, Derrick Favors, Kevon Looney, Pascal Siakam, and interestingly 1 season of Andre Drummond.  Group 1 has the highest % of points from MR and the highest % of unassisted FGM (and the highest % of both unassisted 2's and 3's), so they've got to be ballhandling PG's who are pass-first and create their own shot only when the possession doesn't work out, maybe like Chris Paul or Mike Conley, notables include James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Aaron Brooks, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, and Lebron James.  Group 7 is difficult to place by the numbers, 73% of their shots are 2PT attempts, a healthy amount of PTS come from MR as well as fast breaks/TO's and FT's, 59% of their 2PT FGM are unassisted and they run in transition so they've got to be wings, I'm thinking someone like DeMar DeRozan or Evan Turner, notables include Andrew Wiggins, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Brandon Ingram (only 1 season of DeMar).  Finally, Group 5 has the highest % of fast break PTS/PTS off TO's out of any cluster and is assisted on the 2nd highest % of FGM. They have a healthy balance of 3PT shots and 2PT shots but not strong FT or MR numbers. These are players I'm assuming have little desire to play offense and take shots as needed, notables include Al Horford, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, and Otto Porter Jr.  Looking at the cluster means tab and then trying to guess which players are in each group is a fun game for those who want to try! Would love to see people you were surprised to see in each. Remember, this is based only off shot selection, not necessarily play style. Hope you all enjoy."

“lebron james is not one of a kind”
What? Lebron has won so much without help. He is probably the best superstar with bad teammates along with Shaq and Duncan. Winning 60 year after year isn't great? Going to the finals isn't great? GTFO  Michael Jordan literally averaged more free throws than James Harden in the 80s and you're bitching about Lebron.
Fun fact: Michael Jordan is #1 in PER even with the Wizards years included. LeBron James is 2nd despite being in his prime. Subscribe for more GOAT facts?
"I'm sorry, have you not heard of Lebron James?"
To be fair he has a least a [few](https://www.google.com/amp/s/brobible.com/sports/article/instagram-model-exposes-lebron-james/amp/) examples of hitting on Insta models (there’s at least 2 in the link) but unfortunately they’ve turned him down and posted the DM’s lol.
"LeBron somehow forgot to put ""James"" on Kyle and DeMar's birth certificates."
"also 6th highest win shares in an individual playoff run, and only tim duncan and lebron james had more win shares in a championship postseason"
LeBron James because my dad told me he was going to be very good in the nba when he was drafted. I was 5 at the time and was a big Wolves fan. Since the Wolves have been horrible my whole life I would cheer for LBJ.
1. LeBron James   2. Michael Jordan  3. Charles Barkley   4. David Robinson   5. Chris Paul
Very true. NBA players are lucky they are in an era where Lebron James is their main representative in the world. A real committed family man.
yikes. Lebron was off the ball most of the series because Wade was the primary decision maker not because he couldn't score on Marion/Stevenson. He scored on them plenty. The following year Wade and James switched places and it was Wade playing off-ball to James as the primary decision maker.
"""Contraction is good for the league."" - LeBron James."
"This is the problem with these bandwagon 70 IQ Laker fans. The only move that is acceptable is poaching your very best stars and forming the biggest big market superteam they can follow from their home in Sacramento or Minnesota or wherever.  ""Kawhi/KD and AD only to pair with LeBron James. Beal and Jimmy Butler? Not good enough.""  It's Lakers first, the sport of basketball/league fairness second. Tamper them all"
"LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin love"
"Seventeen years ago, LeBron James gave Rich Paul a choice..."
"So its all comes down to you not believing draymond that he is totally fine that KD didnt tell him. Welp. Go ahead. Cant do anything about that.   ""Did he say he was never mad? Seems like begging the question there.""  Yes. The article that has that quote says that   ""But even still to this day, Wade harbors no ill-will towards James for making his return home to Ohio.""  On your last pont. Wade is talking about their trip from Las Vegas to Miami where both were sharing a plane and Lebron has the opportunity to tell Wade he was leaving but didnt. That was the uncomfortabale conversation. That was before lebrons decision to leave was known. So where did wade say that there was tension between him and lebron?  Edit: you went from calling me a psychologist because i tried to interpret what they said to telling me to interpret what they said. That was funny."
&gt; womanizing  [we talking about Lebron here?] (https://www.maxim.com/women/lebron-james-busted-sliding-into-dms-instagram-hottie-2017-11)
Most people know this. LeBron has been playing point forward since he came out of Gloria James.
"Kap didn’t stand up for his beliefs? Lebron James didn’t call the president of the United States (most powerful man on the planet) a bum? Is that not standing up for what they believe in? Lmfao go tf away, you children don’t even know how to have a conversation"
"2010 actually was really similar. The 2008 Olympic team won gold and [basically everyone from that team dropped out from the 2010 World Cup](https://www.espn.com/olympics/olybb/news/story?id=5372600):  &gt; As recently as four months ago, Colangelo was expecting at least seven of his eight core players from Beijing to return, and for Kevin Durant to slip into whichever spot was vacant.  &gt; But Deron Williams declined his invitation Saturday night, joining LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard, Chris Bosh, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony in withdrawing. Also, Tayshaun Prince and Carlos Boozer, the 11th and 12th players on the depth chart in Beijing, have withdrawn, too. All of those players either cited injuries, family commitments or the effects of their hectic free-agency recruiting period.  That 2010 team ended up going 9-0 and the roster was pretty much entirely comprised of super young guys -- Russ, Rose, Steph, Durant, Love and Eric Gordon were all on the team and had played 3 or fewer years in the NBA by that point.  So it's absolutely not unprecedented. It's just not ideal to have 10-15 really, really good players simply choose not to play."
"Because Nike would kill any negative piece about him.  That dunk video, these articles:  https://deadspin.com/just-undo-it-the-lebron-james-profile-that-nike-killed-1602381429  https://deadspin.com/read-espns-spiked-story-about-lebron-among-the-naked-la-5598719"
Does the fact that Tatum airballed one shot in a scrimmage ease the pain of the fact that you airballed the pick in front of him? Or the fact that not even LeBron James could drag your sorry asses to the playoffs next year?
Kendrick Perkins list of top 10 players  1. LeBron James  2. Not Steph Curry  3. Not Steph Curry  4. Not Steph Curry  5. Russell Westbrook  6. Not Steph Curry  7. Not Steph Curry  8. Not Steph Curry  9. Not Steph Curry  10. Not Steph Curry
Watch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsdQazLi0c  Lebron got fucked by refs plenty of times in his career just like everybody else. 538's analysis of the NBA's last 2 minute reports showed calls most often went against James than for him.
"Are you seriously suggesting that I just created that article or that I just typed a whole bunch of nonsense out of thin air? Look up her [Bailon's] name on Google and the letter ""L"", you'll see autosuggestions with LeBron's name, I couldn't have singlehandedly caused that. You'll see similar results for ""LeBron James Mea"" with Meagan Good. Again I couldn't have put up all those sites saying all that shit."

Lmao lebron James is not left handed but Ben Simmons is
I’m Lebron James?
"Rondo's BBIQ is on par with anyone in the league, he just doesn't necessarily have the requisite skill/athletic ability to execute the play develops as he envisioned it  Not everyone is LeBron James and combines insane BBIQ with the skill/athletic ability to execute the play exactly how he wants it"
LBJ = Lebron Brad James?
James Harden is a freak of nature though. He's built like a brickhouse. The idea he's not that athletic makes little sense to me. Strength is a part of athleticism and defenders bounch off of him the way they bounce off of LeBron and Kawhi. He's also got decent hops too. He's put a bunch of defenders on posters in his career
"lebron didnt tell wade he was leaving miami     http://heatzone.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2017/04/06/why-didnt-lebron-james-tell-dwyane-wade-he-was-leaving-to-cavaliers-they-couldnt-ask-dwyane-to-carry-that-secret/      kawhi didnt tell his raptors teammates he was leaving       what KD did seems like standard protocol in the NBA, that was draymond's entire point."

"&gt;So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh  So a guy who averages more points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, shoots a higher FG%, higher 3P%, has more MVPs and Finals MVPs and by the time he retires will have more all NBA selections and all star selections AND will be top 2 or 3 in scoring and top 5 in assists (which is unheard of and will probably never be done again) makes you laugh? Kobestans are truly the most braindead people in the world, it's sad that you think ""MAMBA MENTALITY""  and 5 rings (not even the best player on 3/5 of his title teams lmao) makes up for everything I just stated. Keep being delusional"
The one with Michael Jordan and lebron James
"&gt; We’ve never seen LeBron James have the chance to work with a big like Anthony Davis in an actual NBA setting, much less another like DeMarcus Cousins.   Oof..."
"LeBron James Harden would be a monster in the league lol. Imagine a freight train barreling down the lane for an and-1 in one possession, and then stepping back for 3 on the next. Would be the most unpredictable player of all time."
Lebron James Jr.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Yeah sure Enes is biased but people are acting like that isn’t a pretty reasonable take. There output is actually quite similar and Kemba is a much better leader and team player. Not to mention it remains to be seen whether perhaps Kemba could perform better than Kyrie now that he finally has a solid coach and respectable teammates. Kyrie has had Lebron James, Kemba had Nic Batum..."
"That's the thing, my argument (crafted mainly for the sake of arguing the point as OP is asking) is not about on-court achievements within the NBA structure. I think LeBron James is capable of doing more with a basketball, has illustrated that he is capable of doing all of those things, and for his raw ability and talent is the better basketball player overall."
"In terms of pound-for-pound ability, in what one can accomplish with a basketball in their hands, the best all-around basketball player of all-time is LeBron James  MJ still accomplished a lot more cumulative with the basketball in his hands so he’s most likely still the GOAT in this regard"
"Or how about just objectively looking at the player’s performance?  I agree with you though, a lot of difference between James Jones and Lebron James even though the both have the same number of rings (if I remember correctly)."
"Because without Jordan in '93, Pippen was an All-NBA 1st-Teamer, the Bulls went 55-27 (3rd in the NBA), were a second-round playoff team who lost in a game 7 to the eventual runners-up (the Knicks, who also lost in 7 to Houston).  LeBron can play more positions, and guard more positions (although Jordan was an undisputed great defender). LeBron is the better facilitator with the ball in his hand, and the more versatile player overall.   Jordan is the game's greatest champion, perhaps its greatest winner. A killer, a psychopath. In terms of pound-for-pound ability, in what one can accomplish with a basketball in their hands, the best all-around basketball player of all-time is LeBron James."
Joe Rogan said Lebron James would make a good mma fighter.  Obv not top 10 but it's a hell of an endorsement.  [Heres da clip](https://youtu.be/9viiFzuchoo)
"Its due to the level of competition. Sports games typically don't care because they usually have exclusive rights. Nobody can make a game with LeBron James on the cover.  &amp;#x200B;  Comparatively if Mario becomes shit we can see some new platformer guy come out and take over. I think publishers having exclusive rights to entire sports leagues should be reevaluated by law as it approaches monopoly territory, but that's also me being selfish as nobody is stopping anyone else from making a sports game. Its just nobody wants to play a game without any of those premier faces."
"I wouldn't call Kobe poor man's Jordan. Because, to me at least, he brings a feeling that he wasn't great. Or one of the greatest. He absolutely was. Just not as great as Jordan. Same goes for James, btw. Both are in a class of their own. It also makes me laugh when people compare Kawhi or Harden to LeBron or Kobe."
If someone thinks this is funny .. you’re not a Lakers fan pre-2008 [inb4 but it’s funny NOW!]  This was right after the Lakers lost to the Celtics in 2008. With the emergence of LeBron James AND that super team in Boston ... there was a real chance that Kobe ends his career with 0 championships post-Shaq

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true          shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?  I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns."
"You're right, it wasn't legendary first ballot hall of famer Lebron James putting on a dominating performance, but the absence of Antonio McDyess that ultimately cost the Pistons this game."
Nah [this](https://upl.stack.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/14110201/LeBron-James-Sleeves-STACK.png) gotta be the best
"Lol same. Antonio Brown  and AJ Green at Wide Receiver, LeBron James at TE.  I don't know how good of a TE Lebron would be, but I'd bet that this group would be pretty much unstoppable with the right quarterback"
"Also, in today's unnecessary LeBron James insertion:  LeBron James is one of the greatest SFs in NBA history. And LeBron has yet to win the DPOY award this season (and in the upcoming seasons should he decide to play)."
Rich Paul will remember this  LeBron James will remember this
In today's unnecessary Lebron James insertion:     Gary Payton is one of the greatest PG's in NBA history. And Lebron is going to pass him in career assists this season.
"Literally complete bums he could get 35 wins if healthy. A starting line of Ron Baker, Isaac Bonga, Lebron James, Brad Miller, and Mo Bamba would get 35 wins lol"
"Does anyone else remember this Zach Lowe article?  [http://grantland.com/features/the-toronto-raptors-sportvu-cameras-nba-analytical-revolution/](http://grantland.com/features/the-toronto-raptors-sportvu-cameras-nba-analytical-revolution/)  ""The Heat have three of the best wing defenders in the league in Shane Battier, LeBron James, and Dwyane Wade, and the latter two are among the NBA’s most gifted pure athletes. James can mimic DeRozan’s hyperactive ghost in a way no other player can, Rucker says. “LeBron basically messes up the system and the ghosts,” Rucker says. “He does things that are just unsustainable for most players.”"""
&gt;	Kobe's work ethic is another level to pretty much anyone  I would say it’s on par with guys like Michael Jordan and LeBron James
"I'm not sure if people understand how hard it is to get into the top 30 convo nevermind the GOAT convo. Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Shaq, Tim Duncan, Kobe, and Hakeem Olajuwon aren't even in the GOAT convo and all those guys were better than Giannis at a younger age. Lebron James is *barely* in the convo and has like a 5% chance at this point, given his age, of making it. That's just not a ceiling Giannis is likely to reach given the holes in his game."
"Because he's rotating over to help on another play's man like when he blocked Duncan and Splitter. Or because he is chasing someone in transition. By definition those are open layups you are arguing Lebron is playing bad defense for allowing transition opportunities to take place at all. By that logic there are no good defenders and there never will be.  Miami's defense was elite all 4 years. Only difference was that in the last 3 years they switched pick and rolls. The first year they were rotating from the baseline with Wade or James.  &gt;Why did they never once end up with the most wins in the nba? Hell, they almost never had the most in their own conference?  The Heat won 66 games in 2013 and had the most wins in the NBA that year.  Their defense was high risk high reward. They never had a great rim protector so it was always on Wade and James to do it and they came up big all the time especially in big moments. But that's why were never the best defense not when the Pacers had Hibbert, the Grizzlies had Gasol, the Bulls had Noah, the Spurs had Duncan, and the Thunder had Ibaka.  It's very obvious to me you're just making up a narrative to argue about probably because you're bored of the summer and desire NBA basketball. I have a bunch of Miami playoff games on my laptop. If you want one let me know and I will upload a link for you since you clearly either did not watch Lebron James and the Heat play defense, you don't remember, or you are suffering from recency bias imposing Lebron's current defense onto his past."
Nonsense. Lebron's most celebrated defensive plays are help defender blocks.   Basketbal fanatic actually watched Lebron James in his prime. You clearly are judging Lebron's defense of the last several seasons of old Lebron. Go watch a Miami game of his.
LeBron James.  His highlight reels have every kind of play imaginable.
"&gt; as long as he gets good muscle confusion and doesn’t use this motion while he explodes  Haha. If you just build the right relationships, you could one day train a guy like Lebron James."
"youre kinda wrong I can squat about 385x4 on a working set. And on plyo days I do 225x5 jump squats exploding up weights feels like nothing and its controlled. If you train for it and know what youre doing you adapt, im pretty sure fucking lebron james can handle it lol"
Let me summarize u/sausagelink in this thread  &gt;lol haha lol haha... but it’s Lebron James!
I would actually disagree completely and say that Lebron James is arguably THE pinnacle of human athleticism in the history of mankind.
"I mean I feel you, but Lebron James is absolutely not the pinnacle of human athleticism lol."
No wonder he wears that [lumbar support](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/7/27/17621974/lebron-james-lakers-lumbar-back-fashion-summer-2018)
"Mate, your knowledge doesn't apply to LeBron fucking James. He has full time staff to make sure everything he does is safe and useful."
"Lol no it is not. For your average person, sure. Have you seen pro high jumpers or long jumpers train? The things they put their lower backs through would collapse the average person.   This is LeBron fucking James. He has been taking care of his body for nearly 20 years now. But yes tell me more about how you know better than him."
"We can do this all day bby.   &gt;So my vote had more to do with Anthony and less to do with the dominance of LeBron. If you were to take Anthony off the Knicks, they are a lottery team. James plays with two other All-Stars, the league's all-time 3-point leader, a defensive stalwart, and a fearless point guard. The Heat are loaded. If LeBron was taken away from the Heat, they still would be a fifth or sixth seed. He is the best player of this generation, a multifaceted superstar with the physical prowess of Adonis, but I chose to reward a player who has lifted his team to new heights. The Knicks were slapped around last season by the Heat in the first round, swept by the Celtics the year before, and the constant has been Anthony. Stoudemire, an All-Star-caliber player when healthy, has been dealing with knee problems the past few years. Chandler is a defensive center, and Jason Kidd, Marcus Camby, and Rasheed Wallace are beyond aging. That leaves the scoring load to Anthony and the mercurial Smith."
Ain’t that just like Lebron James
I know a bunch of internet average joes are chiming in on the greatest athlete of our time but I think RJ has gone on the record saying that LeBron James isn't actually that strong for the elite athlete that he is.
"There's no way the franchise or his athletic trainers are going to allow him to get injured doing some silly Insta workout, especially Lebron James. Plus he's damn smart and knows what he's doing as an athlete."
LeBron James
To be fair LeBron James with Curry’s shooting might be able to win by themselves. That’s the best player in history by a wide margin.
"The NCAA doesn’t have a Rich Paul problem. The problem is that its structure is designed to regulate the freedom of athletes to turn pro in primarily black sports but not in white ones.  And an entity that now preaches the importance of college graduation for agents doesn’t have the same righteous energy for black athletes at its most lucrative institutions.  Earlier this week, the NCAA implemented what was immediately labeled the “Rich Paul Rule,” after the man who represents NBA players LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Draymond Green, John Wall, Ben Simmons and 2019 first-round draft picks Darius Garland and Darius Bazley. The new regulations require that agents interested in representing players who are considering declaring for the NBA draft now must have a bachelor’s degree, be certified with the National Basketball Players Association for at least three years and take a comprehensive in-person exam at NCAA headquarters in Indianapolis. Paul, who never attended college, is one of many agents affected by this rule — but unquestionably the most prominent.  The NCAA’s move was instantly lambasted as hypocritical and vindictive. “The world is so afraid of ground breakers.…This is beyond sad &amp; major B.S.,” tweeted comedian Kevin Hart. James, Paul’s biggest client, longtime friend and confidant, could only laugh at the NCAA’s energy, saying, “Nothing will stop this movement and culture over here.”  Chris Rock explained the context for the NCAA mandate years ago. “We’re only 10% of the population,” he said on 2004’s Never Scared. “We’re 90% of the Final Four!”  Only basketball must adhere to the new NCAA mandate. The actual text doesn’t mention race. Nevertheless, the writing is not just written on the wall, it’s been carved. It’s a “race-neutral” rule that isn’t race-neutral. This comes with historical precedence that the NCAA knows all too well.  One of the worst-kept secrets in sports is how top-tier college football and basketball programs directly benefited from desegregation. Before integration, the vast majority of top black athletes had no choice but to attend historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Once the larger and richer predominantly white schools began to integrate, HBCUs couldn’t compete. But there’s been a parallel development too: The graduation rates for black athletes at top sports programs remain consistently and embarrassingly low.  Shaun R. Harper, executive director of the University of Southern California’s Race and Equity Center, found that, overall, black male athletes graduate at higher percentages than black males who are not involved in sports. But that’s not true for the NCAA’s wealthiest leagues: the Power 5 of the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC.  “The [NCAA] has claimed in television commercials that black male student-athletes at Division I institutions graduate rates are higher than black men in the general student body,” the report says. “This is true across the entire division, but not for the five conferences whose member institutions routinely win football and basketball championships, play in multimillion-dollar bowl games and the annual basketball championship tournament, and produce the largest share of Heisman Trophy winners.”  Black men made up 2.4% of the Power 5 student population but 55% and 56%, respectively, of its football and basketball teams. Of those numbers, 55% of black male athletes graduated in under six years, compared with 60% of black men in the overall undergraduate population and 76% of all college graduates.  “Over the past two years, 40% of these universities have actually had black male student-athlete graduation rates that have declined,” Harper said. “We’re supposed to be getting better, but actually 40% of these places have gotten worse.”  Meanwhile, the debate over paying college athletes is sharply divided by race. Most whites are against “pay to play,” while most blacks strongly support it because the current system exploits a largely black athletic base.  In the NBA, the sport is still primarily black. (The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport found that during the 2015-16 season, 81.7% of NBA players were people of color and 74.3% were black.) But black athletes have significant power and influence over everything from where they play to who coaches them to the structure of their contracts.  This shifting power dynamic is beginning earlier and earlier too. Bazley skipped college last year to become a million-dollar intern with New Balance. R.J. Hampton and LaMelo Ball, both touted as 2020 lottery picks, are taking their talents to Australia for a year before declaring for the NBA draft. Hampton has already inked a shoe deal with Li-Ning.  As Yahoo’s Dan Wetzel noted, the new rule’s standard doesn’t apply to college hockey players who can be drafted out of high school but can choose to attend college if their draft placement doesn’t appeal to them.  If this wasn’t about a young black man who achieved his success out of the mud and then empowered other black men to recognize their worth in spite of an organization that has for years manipulated their talents for the organization’s gain, if this wasn’t about yet another American institution attempting to police black mobility and freedom, then it’s difficult to see what the actual reasoning is.  This brings the discussion back to Paul and James. It’s often been said there is a Jay-Z lyric for any situation in life. Perhaps the most fitting here is a bar from Jay’s 2001 album The Blueprint, which entered the Library of Congress in March: All I need is the love of my crew / The whole industry can hate me, I thugged my way through, he pledged on “All I Need.” In essence, this has been the motto for Paul, James and the two other members of their inner circle, Maverick Carter and Randy Mims.  When James cut ties to agent Aaron Goodwin in 2005, eyebrows raised and many said that the young basketball phenom had risked his career before it truly tipped off. At the time, it was easy to understand why, given that Goodwin had helped the 2003 No. 1 overall draft pick obtain a bevy of endorsements, including Bubblicious chewing gum, Upper Deck trading cards, Sprite, Powerade and, most gaudy of them all, a seven-year, $90 million shoe deal with Nike. Few believed in James’ vision when he turned to three of his childhood friends to chart the course of his career on and off the court.  “James’ switcheroo a youthful mistake,” the Chicago Sun-Times wrote.  “I will promise you really ugly things will happen,” said former NFL player turned financial adviser Jim Corbett. “This is a big mistake, a bad decision that is going to cost LeBron.”  Which leads us to another Jay lyric, this one from 2009’s “Already Home”: And as for the critics, tell me I don’t get it / Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it. Thanks to the friends he entrusted with his career nearly 15 years ago, James is not only the most powerful player in basketball history but also a player in Hollywood, fashion, education and politics.  Money and power elicit respect, as elucidated by Kimberly Jones. But they also open the door for fear and angst. President Donald Trump took shots at LeBron on Twitter last August after the launch of his I Promise School in Akron, Ohio, saying it was hard to make “LeBron look smart” and weighed in on the NBA’s most contested debate, saying he preferred Michael Jordan over James — which Jordan quickly rebuffed. The two were labeled “mob bosses” by an unnamed Western Conference general manager last season after public attempts to move Anthony Davis to the Lakers (a move that eventually happened).  Rich Paul is a threat. To the status quo. To the hierarchy of power. And to the image of an industry that is still dominated by white males and has long exercised fiscal and moral authority over black athletes.  Basketball altered its rules to make it harder for three players who made the game look too easy (i.e., they dominated the white players too much): Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Maybe the NCAA didn’t implement this rule with Paul as its sole motivation. Just like maybe the NCAA wouldn’t be so open to criticism if it made the education of players a higher priority.  Unfortunately, the NCAA addressed a perceived problem while never addressing its own. Sometimes sports really is a reflection of life."
Just ran into a starving LeBron James sadly.
"""LeBron James with the FACIAL! He EXPLODES all OVER Marcus Smart!"""
"LeBron, 3-6 in the finals. All around most skilled player I've ever seen, and the best at a decent amount of those things.  He will never be the GOAT to me, and not just because of 2011. The man has claimed to be the greatest. I mean he really said it. Said he was gonna win 7 rings in Miami lol. Said winning in 2016 made him the GOAT. That's fucking laughable. You can't be the GOAT without true dominance over your own era. 8 or 9 straight conference titles don't cut it. It's impressive, but that's not it    Steph, 3-2 in the finals. Greatest high volume sniper ever, one of the best offensive players in the game and ever. I was born and raised in Oakland. Early on, I wanted them to trade Steph, I was hella wrong there, but his physicals prevent him from ever being the GOAT,and KD got him those last 2 rings. He only averages like 5 assists because hes a bit selfish in the PnR unless it's with Draymond. I'm not saying the man doesn't win games or put up 2k numbers, but he's not The One.    James Harden, 0-1 in the finals. Paul George, 0-[too high to care] in conference finals. How many times did they choke in elimination games. Come back after they've redeemed themselves at least once."
TIL LeBron James and Chris Paul (and DWade before he retired) are being blackballed by the NBA
Then you’re just a casual. You give up on lebron too after he shit the bed in the finals in 2011? How bout Steph when he choked in 2016? James harden game 6 vs the spurs?
"Nah man, Lebron James the GOAT can't do no wrong"
"If this guy shows up.. a line up of this Dwilight Howard, AD, Lebron James, Kuzma, Caruso is SCARY"
Lebron James
"Kawhi's defense is actually a closer match to Pippen's, not Jordan's.  At any rate, LeBron in his prime was in the neighborhood of Kawhi's DPOY days, and even held an edge statistically.  Remember, [Miami LeBron was found to be better than a theoretically ""perfect"" defender](https://deadspin.com/lebron-james-is-a-better-defender-than-the-computerized-456410614).  &gt; yet you're not mentioning that Jordan had the most blocks by a guard until who passed him? Lebrons teammate Wade. Lebron is still 600 steals behind MJ.  Wade was a very good defender from 2010 to 2014.  He was nowhere near Pippen.  Pippen is arguably the greatest all-around defender ever.  &gt; Lebron is still 600 steals behind MJ.  Blocks and steals are a naïve way to evaluate defense.  There's no measure for how often Jordan made a bad gamble, or was forced to make a gamble due to bad initial positioning.  Preventing a shot from every happening is the best form of defense, yet there was no direct way to measure that."
"His playing style transformed the way the game was played. We have him to thank for the likes of Magic Johnson,  Penny Hardaway, Scottie Pippen  and Lebron James.   We fail to recognize the importance he played in the beginning of free agency in the NBA   https://www.oscarrobertson.com/oscar-robertson-rule"
LeBron James
"Kawhi missed clutch free throws in the 2013 finals. Is that 'killer mentality'? He was scared in the beginning of the 2014 Finals going up against James Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy even remark on it during the telecast.  Prime Kawhi for 15 years makes you a contender yet the whole time he's resting and taking games off? HE hasn't even played 500 games in his career and his a career 18 point scorer (think Lebron in the 2011 finals, his greatest FAILURE)."
"Michael Jordan miraculously comes back, and, against all odds, has an epic finals clash against LeBron James, who, even though won the battle and the title, didnt win the war, a la Rocky Balboa's moral victory over Apolo Creed"
"Shaq is Diesel because he has the power of a diesel engine.  Kobe on his self-given Black Mamba nickname:  “I felt the need to separate myself, in a sense. There was a lot of things going on personally with the situation going on in Colorado, and flying back and forth for games, and trying to hold my family together, as well. It just felt like the game, which was always like a safe haven for me, was being compromised, as well. I needed to create some sort of an alter ego, just for myself, so when I step out on the court I’m somebody different, not the person that was sitting in a courthouse. I’m somebody different. And it helped me for my sanity. And then it just turned into something more.”  LeBron is King James because King James was a real person, and James is LeBron's last name, and his status as the best player in the NBA enabled him to wear the crown.  Have you seen Kawhi's hands? That's why he's Klaw.  Durantula is a clever portmanteau of Durant and Tarantula, and he's got very long, very thin limbs like a spider.  Shaq started calling Wade flash because he was fast. Like The Flash.  Howard is Superman because he was freakishly big and freakishly athletic and teammates started calling him that instead of Barbaro (which is truly an arbitrary nickname).  Spida, on the arbitrary scale is slightly less arbitrary than Barbaro."
"And Kobe Bryant, cry me a river. When a team like the Kings, Grizzlies, Bucks, Magic, Suns, and most of the league suck, they have to build from the ground up after several losing season to have a chance at fighting back to relevance. When the Lakers have to ""endure"" a rebuild, you guys are given Lebron Freaking James and Anthony Davis forces a trade to you at a discount. AD, Lebron, Shaq, Wilt, heck even Nash and Dwight, you guys are always handed top players by FA or forced trades because you guys are in LA. You are pretty much demonstrating why people don't like Lakers fans."
Im saying Kobe but thats just me.  The real answer is Lebron James.
LeBron James
I once beat LeBron James  With a bat
LeBron James!
Rajon Rondo had 325 more assists than LeBron James in 2016  Stockton was never a comparable playmaker to Magic Johnson
LeBron James is Hella underrated. People are acting like he's a walking turnstile when in fact his advanced metrics put him on a Kawhi Leonard/Paul George tier.
Most nicknames are arbitrary  Why is Shaq Diesel?  Why is Kobe Black Mamba?  Why is LeBron King James?  Why is Kawhi Klaw?  Why is Durant the Durantula? (Or the servant?)  Why is Dwyane Wade Flash?  Why is Dwight Howard Superman?
"right, or just have it be descriptive of what analysis is to come, like ""Analysis of Lebron James' effect on team assist numbers"" or something.  But bottom line is, youre not supposed to include the conclusions in the title"
"I don't really care about ""every year"" like tbh, you gotta prove it EVERY year. You don't get to coast to the 'best player' status. The best player of last year wasn't LeBron James and he's not the player to beat until he takes that title."
"By the standard of getting switched onto anyone and doing just fine than a good number of 3's and 4's can do that for a few possessions here and there. It's an annoying myth because it gets repeated on here constantly and the younger people on this sub start believing that he could actually do it. Like by the standard of Lebron being able to defend 1-5, Kobe and MJ could defend 1-4. It's just not an accurate representation of their abilities even though it's technically true if you're talking about switching.   It wasn't just West. Lebron couldn't defend Duncan, Garnett, Dirk, Randolph and a ton of the other 4's around during his time with the Heat. If he got switched onto them he wouldn't get killed right away but that's not the same thing as consistently defending them.   Like Chris Paul and Patrick Beverley have both been able to defend KD for stretches but that doesn't mean that they could actually guard 3's or 4's. James Harden and Jason Kidd could both hold their own in the post against 4's for a few plays here and there but you wouldn't say that they could guard 1-4."
"Bit late to the discussion but all you've shown here is that a team is worse at assists when Lebron James is off the court. Which... is pretty obvious.  But you haven't shown that Lebron James leads to good ball movement. In fact, if anything, you've shown more to suggest that he doesn't lead to good ball movement as all his teams have been fairly average in assist numbers despite him being an insanely good passer himself. This isn't actually a bad thing because Lebron is so good that its' a valid strategy to just give Lebron the ball. But if you're trying to figure out if Lebron stops ball movement, your stats would suggest that he DOES indeed stop ball movement.  However, this analysis isn't deep enough to draw any conclusions about anything other than 'A team is worse at assisting when Lebron James is subbed off for a bench player'.  Also, your conclusion, 'With Lebron on the court, his teams rank top 5 among all teams over the past 10 years', is really misleading because you haven't adjusted other teams for their star players being subbed off. You are essentially comparing Lebron playing 100% of the time to other teams who are making constant substitutions. And again, there is nothing we can reasonably conclude from this but if we WERE to conclude something, your stat is actually detrimental to your argument. This is because your stat says that even if Lebron James was able to play 100% of his minutes (at full fitness because your stat was adjusted for per 100 possessions), he still cannot beat out other teams in assists even though other teams are playing their bench half the time."
Nothing says mediocrity like signing LeBron James and still missing the playoffs.
"I don’t think LeBron wants to be a ball stopper, obviously I have no clue what he actually thinks but he just seems to like how he played with Miami and even the 17 Cavs.   Fast paced, ball movement much like the Spurs and Warriors. He’s even mentioned how much he likes those offenses.   It’s just when you have LeBron James it can be better offense to just give him the ball and let him go to work, especially when your other options are guys like what he had his last year in Cleveland and last year in LA. But I’d argue last season he wasn’t a ball stopper with the Lakers towards the end, they were playing fast paced with a lot of ball movement and it was great to watch."
"Giannis won last year. Winning back to back MVPs doesn’t happen often. Moses Malone. Larry Bird. Magic Johnson. Michael Jordan. Steve Nash. LeBron James. (x2). Stephen Curry.   There’s going to be one team in the West that overachieves without a pair of stars. And I think their leading man will get the MVP. Mitchell. Curry. Dame. Jokic. Holiday. (Hield? Doncic?) Hell, if Booker drags the Suns to like 35-40 wins, I’d be willing to give it to him."
"Oh shit I remember that thread. I don't think it's correct labeling me as a coward though. It's, unfortunately, a pretty common tool to garner interest in a thread. Had I written ""LeBron James system is not detrimental to his teams"" I would have gotten a few ""Ok, cool"" responses and not all of this discussion. I think it's fine to generate this much honest debate in the off-season."
"&gt; When he plays against someone that guards him well or the team switches well then there aren’t open shooters and their offense slows down. Lebron gets forced into hero ball and they typically lose the series.   In what world does LeBron James ""typically lose the series""? Are you just basing this on his finals record?   Which would be a completely wrong analysis of the situations because his teams mainly lost because of their defense and not their offense.   &gt;Anyone with a brain would have asked this question right away. Assists do not equal good ball movement.  But high team assist numbers certainly don't terrible ball movement. I never claimed LeBron's teams have been at the front of the league in this regard."
"Kobe Bryant. I think he has the intelligence and drive to succeed in a lot of areas.  LeBron James, also has has intelligence, discipline, and drive.  Steve Nash, very creative guy, bright."
Are you an idiot? The contract was seen as a risk. It wasn’t a cheap contract then. $11 million/year around 2012 was a lot for someone like him. LeBron James was making 19 million that season for reference. Warriors were criticized for giving Curry that amount.
LeBron James
"You forget that Lebron IS THE ACTUAL reason that his teams can't be constructed in a natural way and at the first sign of trouble they make trades. Those 2018 Cavs at first had Derrick Rose(who was great afterwards), DWade who had 20 PPG in playoffs for Miami and Crowder who was starter quality for the Jazz. Isiah Thomas is a wash because you could make a point that he was terrible because Lebron decide to put his EGO on the table and not to pass him.   After the trades they took George Hill and Rodney Hood whom were both amazing in this year playoffs .. away from Lebron. Aside from the top role players that James always have since 2010 his teams are :     2010 - Miami with Wade and Bosh   2014 - Cleveland with Kyrie and Love  2019 - Lakers with Davis and Cousins  Just when he sucks the Life of the teams he runs away and finds a fresh meat. You could make a case that he didnt have team in 2018 BUT all signs suggest that either Kawhi or PG would come. They didnt and he didnt even made the Playoffs in the West and started his passive agresive shit inside the locker room."
statistically... it's mixed. boring answer but true.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23684417/kevin-pelton-weekly-mailbag-does-lebron-james-make-teammates-better  which means that dude is wrong for saying that he makes all his teammates worse. also makes ya wrong to say pretty much every roleplayer played better.
"You're getting downvoted, but I agree with you. Bosh went down during the East Semis against the Pacers with the Heat finding themselves down 2-1. LeBron assumed a PF role and dropped 40/18/9 to tie the series before they eventually advanced to the ECF. Bosh missed the first half of the next series and the Heat find themselves again on the ropes after PP dropped a dagger 3 in front of LeBron, putting the Celtics up 3-2, needing one more home win to return to the Finals. That point, I think, was the most pressure (game-wise and narrative-wise) a player has been subjected to, knowing James choked big time last year after forming the Heatles - the most hated team in the league. Then the rest is history. LeBron dropped 45/15/5 in 3 1/2 quarters in an away playoff game at Boston before closing the series in 7 games to have a chance at redemption against a favored OKC team that just dominated the West playoffs by eliminating the last three West champs: sweeping the Mavs (2011 defending champs), gentleman-sweeping the Lakers (2009 and 2010 champs), and the Spurs (2007 Champs) in 6 games. Finally, the choker narrative opened once again after the Heat lost a close Game 1 led by KD (2012 scoring champ). But despite LeBron's jumpers failing him again in this series, he resorted to ultimate freight train mode and averaged 29/10/7, including a triple-double clincher performance and a go-ahead ""cramped leg"" three pointer the game before. To summarize, the Heat were down in a series for three consecutive times, and James led the way with all-time performances to claw the Hest back into winning those series. So yeah, personally and based on the context of thie 2012 playoffs, I believe it was a top-5 moment in NBA history."
"Same. I was 12 when LeBron was drafted. Maybe this makes me a stan or whatever, but I'm so glad I got to witness greatness. What got me into basketball, aside from playing it, was the Bulls' second threepeat, but holy shit do I feel fortunate to have seen LeBron James."

Lebron James has not been the best player in the league for some seasons now.
"Does LeBron James vote? Has he, or any other NBA star, had any activity advocating for increased voter turnout?  He has done various philanthropic things to support poor communities, access to education, etc. I wonder what impact an NBA star promoting voter registration would have (this does not mean endorsing any particular candidate or policy, just getting out to vote and be regostered)."
"&gt; I am gonna list some names that played with Wade throughout his career: Lebron James, Chris Bosh, Ray Allen, Shaq, Gary Payton. &gt;  &gt;   Yeah that's why he has rings. Give him more of that he'd have as many or more than Kobe.   ...is what I am saying."
"&gt; Jaylen Brown, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Magic Johnson.  &gt;  if you add in Jaylen Brown to that list, his name sounds like it belongs.  It's almost like it was *already there"
"I wouldn't put either Kobe Bryant or LeBron James in my top five but I do believe they deserve acknowledgement for their dunking prowess. LeBron's go-to was, indeed, that arm-stretch one-hander, but he's offered up more dunking diversity than he often gets credit for."
"Nearly 50 wins and a 2nd round exit is disappointing, but the Celtics weren't title favorites. At most they were ECF favorites, and that was still debatable.  Lebron James missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005-06, his 3rd year in the NBA. Over a decade straight of consecutive playoff appearances and title contention. Virtually the same Cavaliers roster that won 50 games and went to the Finals with Lebron, won only 19 games without him.   Meanwhile the Lakers went from 35 wins the year before....to 37."
Hmmmm... is he top 10 got me thinking. Off the top of my head I'm gonna try and name 10 better players that I would rather have to start a team.  1. Jordan 2. Hakeem 3. Kareem 4. Wilt 5. Bill Russell  6. Lebron James 7. Oscar Robertson  8. Kevin Durant 9. Kobe Bryant 10. Jerry West  I can't think of anyone else to take Kobe out. Maybe Shaq over Durant.

2020 Shaqtin MVP: Bruno Caboclo- thinks he's still playing in the FIBA world cup as he knocks LeBron James game-tying free throw off the rim resulting in a goal tending violation
uhh difference here is that there isn’t a fucking Lebron James on this team
"https://youtu.be/AcAW6g6BNao  At 3:08, LeBron does the same screen to John Lucas who is substantially smaller than James  and there's no whistle, except when Lucas retaliates."
"According to the posted article, LeBron invest any actual money into Liverpool, or in other words he didn't 'purchase' his stake, but 'acquired' it though other means.  &gt;In 2011, James acquired a minority stake in Liverpool F.C., an English Premier League soccer club. James ‘acquired’ his 2% stake in the soccer club rather than ‘purchased’ it because James was able to work out a deal with the club majority owners (Fenway Sports Group) where he didn’t actually have to risk any money.  Fenway Sports Grouph (FSG) and James made a deal where the NBA star agreed to be added to their official client list that they used to recruit new clients. James also agreed to allow FSG to pitch him other business deals where they would earn a commission. In exchange, James and his business partner Maverick Carter were given a 2% stake in Liverpool.  FSG wanted so badly to be in the LeBron James business, they gave up equity in their team for what amounted to commission checks on partnerships they got for James that included Dunkin’ Donuts and the Swiss watchmaker Audemars Piguet, according to Windhorst."
"&gt; because most of the fault rests with LeBron/Cavs for not seeing/calling the pick  I don't believe that's part of the officiating criteria, for obvious reasons.  Everything has to go right in order for that to work, in other words.  Therefore it comes down to the opponent setting the pick, and likely not much else.  In this case, Chandler went dangerously over the line by not just crossing his forearms, but also leaning way in to James."
"Lebron James is an exception, along with KD, MJ and a handful of other elite, game team changing players.   Westbrook is not that player."
Disagree. LeBron James definitely raises a team’s ceiling. Russ’s problem is that he’s such a bad shooter and he loses control sometimes. It’s not about on ball vs off ball players or ball movement systems or not.
"&gt;I mean, he still is very egotistical     So what? A lot of superstars are and there's nothing wrong with that, if I was the best basketball player in the world, I would be *very* egotistical. This is LeBron fucking James were talking about, although I hate him, he had every right to be egotistical."

"No buddy, I can’t believe I have to dumb this down for you.  They are not made for Lebron like athletes. No, no no. Why? Because buddy, Nike is a COMPANY, and it requires MONEY to run. You don’t make shoes meant for Lebron James like athlete, you make shoes fitting Lebron that is meant for the general public. This is literally objective and there is no argument for it.  This is one of the most dumbest shit I have ever read. A company who caters to 3-4 people in the world? Okay!!!  Ok grandpa, cool triple exclamation mark, really drives the point home. The product is going to cater to the couple million people with a similar build to LeBron (where the fuck did you get 3-4 from I don't know lmao), the millions upon millions of LeBron fans and casual buyers who think the shoes look cool.   &gt;Lebron James shoes are honestly like fast food restaurants. It’s easily accessible, but it’s clearly not good shoes considering it has no value in secondary market..  This makes no sense in literally any way you put it. Resale value does not correlate to the quality of shoe, the Chuck Taylors and Air Force 1s are considered some of the best (and highest quality) shoes ever and they're readily available for 70-90. Also, I'd be pretty worried if someone tried to resell me food from a restaurant.   &gt;Are you sure it’s not your love for Lebron that’s forbidding you to see this objectively?  I might like LeBron's basketball but I'm sure as hell not spending my time on protecting his shoes/any of his products lmfao. I'm speaking generally here."
"I love how delusional some people are  &gt; No, that's what you literally do, you make the shoe for the athlete that they're made for. Even in the video Tinker elaborates that Kobe likes his shoes light and sleek. Kobe shoes are that way.  This is precisely why you have no clue what you are talking about.   Kobe’s shoes were light and sleek, it was meant for Kobe, yes. But the build and design of the shoes were meant to be accepted by the general public.   LeBron James shoes can still be a good fit to Lebron and be a better fit for the public.    &gt; They are made for LeBron like athletes, because they're made for LeBron who is a LeBron like athlete, probably the most LeBron of them all. They're designed for his playstyle and weight.  No buddy, I can’t believe I have to dumb this down for you.   They are not made for Lebron like athletes. No, no no. Why? Because buddy, Nike is a COMPANY, and it requires MONEY to run. You don’t make shoes meant for Lebron James like athlete, you make shoes fitting Lebron that is meant for the general public. This is literally objective and there is no argument for it.   This is one of the most dumbest shit I have ever read. A company who caters to 3-4 people in the world? Okay!!!       &gt; Any flagship basketball shoe is designed to aid the player they're made for and their playstyle. The world also doesn't revolve around you, Nike isn't losing any sleep over you not buying his shoes, there's evidently a market for it since they keep pumping them out.  I know this is the third time saying so, but the delusion is baffling.   No, the core objective of flagship shoes is to make as much money as possible by putting in the athletes name next to the product. Why? Because they are a company.   Next, the world revolves around the customers for a company. They build products for the customers.. so yes, for Nike, their world revolves around their customer.   Lebron James shoes are honestly like a fast food restaurant. It’s easily accessible, but it’s clearly not a good shoes considering it has no value in secondary market..  It’s clearly not doing a good job in performance considering, once again, the niche that it’s apparently catering to, doesn’t like it that much (pro ball players)    &gt; The LeBron's also aren't that clunky or heavy, it just takes a bit to get used to them.   ..................... That’s the proof that it’s clunky and heavy........ Jesus Christ.   Put on a shot that weights 3 times more than what you would normally wear and as days go by you will get used to it. Funny how that works right?   My god lol  Are you sure it’s not your love for Lebron that’s forbidding you to see this objectively?"
"I don’t think the end result there is Lebron smarter although it’s fine to say he is regardless. Lebron did get the better of him on the first play, but James’ second score was on KD, not Green. The Warriors are switching there and KD can’t let Lebron beat him rejecting the screen."
"I am interested in knowing your reaction to [this response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzvux-RGjzU) by Lebron James regarding Charles Barkley's criticism of Lebron.  Charles Barkley questioned Lebron's will to compete when Lebron said they needed more despite having 2 other all stars already. Lebron responded by throwing personal jabs at Barkley, instead of actually addressing the criticism, he diverted the attention elsewhere completely unrelated to basketball.  Everyone's saying he's grown so much since then, is this the grown Lebron for yall?"
"His head did snap back, and that shit could be painful and dangerous like getting rear ended in a car.  I think James initially tried to throw up his hands to exaggerate the contact, but the pain hit him for real and he aborted the flop mid-way and ended up looking like a silly flop.  You can see Tyson accelerate moments before hitting LeBron for maximum impact, and that shit looked unexpected and painful."
"Anderson Varejao... I mean just looking at the roster it was just a bunch of nobodies.  Shannon Brown 21. Barely played in the league till they sent him back to the D league. Cavs called him back twice but not for very long.   Larry Hughes? Averaged 14 pts for his career. Averaged 40% from the field and 30% from 3pt, not bad on the FG%. However that year specifically he averaged 37% from the field and 34% from 3pt which was pretty decent during that era.   Damon Jones, played 10 yrs in the league. Career average points only 6.58 pts. 40%FG but 39% from 3. Only averaging less than 4 attempts per game tho. NBA journey man for those 10 years. Dude really got to know the United States. lol  The only guy I remember being pretty solid but was in the twilight of his career during this finals run was Zydrunas Ilgauskas. That was it. The rest of the team were nobodies. This HAS TO BE the worst team to get to the finals. It was definitely The LeBron James show featuring The Cleveland Cavaliers."

"Now here's the thing, It's extremely hard to take a Kobe fan's perspective as an honest one because they hardly ever blame the guy for anything. But here's the thing, we'd have to sit down and look at the game to really tell who had the most defensive lapses. Who missed their assignment. Who didn't close out on perimeter shots and who didn't hustle to cut off passing lanes. All I know is that, offensively, your guy took a shit ton of shots and missed a ton of shots. And his own teammate called him out for being the reason they lost that series.    We say the Detroit was this absolute monster defensive team yet they lost to the Spurs the year after and 2 years after that, lost to a 22-23yo LeBron James who was quite literally the sole threat on that team. So, I can't really buy that monster defense argument when you got the most dominant center in the league at 7'1 going up against a 6'9, Albeit, very muscular and physically capable, Ben Wallace. So, I don't know.   These are the things I look at. The series was very long ago. Hard to have kept a very detailed memory of that series, unless you've watched it recently. But putting the blame on two dudes that literally signed up for the free ring, I think is a major cop out. Just saying. What do you think?"
"I've said it before, and I'll say it again... r/nba is not ready to realize how bad a coach Luke was, and he'll be exposed on the Kings this year when the team ends up doing worse with better/improved talent.  He actively lost games on a regular basis with horrible 4th quarter coaching.  When one player in the rotation got injured, he would shake up the entire line-up and change every single players' role, compounding the loss.  [He had one set play with a single action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM5HtMLaMM4) which worked once every five games against a lottery team, and that's it.  That along with virtually zero half-court offense installed led to one of the worst fourth quarter teams in the league with a roster featuring LeBron James.  He made zero adjustments all game, allowing teams to exploit mismatches on both ends of the court over and over without any changes in strategy or line-up.  My prediction for the Kings' season: They're going to start off hot, leading the league in pace.  For the first few weeks, they might have one of the best records in the league before other teams feel like running with them.  Maybe 15-5 or something.  Then teams will pay attention to the scouting report and get back on defense.  The Kings will  then start to struggle in the half court, lose games due to collapses in the 4th quarter (despite being a great clutch 4th quarter team last year), go on a massive losing stretch, and be back below .500 before the ASB.  Despite the talent looking noticeably improved, with studs like Fox and Bagley taking a significant statistical leap, they'll finish with the the same record as last season if not worse."

LeBron James
"Because you admitted these are subjective lists so either you don’t know what subjective means or you are just arguing for the sake of begin right. If we go off of just stats and completely ignore any thing you don’t consider important the. Lebron James is the greatest laker of all time, either way you are wrong. Now run along and hide not that you’ve given yourself an out to not reply sounds like it’s past your bedtime in New York, it’s 8:30 right?"
Didn’t you know LeBron James is a part of a experiment and is actually a super soldier created in a lab? Some people even call him LaBron James to this very day.
"so you want to go ahead and put the blame on a couple of has been, bench players that got a slight increase in minutes? One of them being the #2 scoring leader  in the league's history?     2004 Pistons starting lineup:   1. Chauncey Billups   2. Richard Hamilton   3. Tayshaun Prince   4. Rasheed Wallace   5. Ben Wallace     2007 Pistons starting lineup:   Same exact as 04' except for Ben Wallace.       But they had a 33 yo Chris Webber and a 32 yo Antonio McDyess. Ben Wallace at that time was 33yo so I can see why they moved from him. Chauncey was 30 yo. Richard Hamilton and Tayshaun Prince were both in their primes at 28 yo and 26 yo, respectively.  Pretty much the same team but with more scorers than before.  No big noticeable presence in the paint, but when compared to LeBron James, Ben Wallace didn't tower over him. He was barely taller and a lot less agile. Blaming a couple of old dudes coming off the bench as being the reason ya'll lost is a cop-out. So... What exactly is so special about this ""Mamba Mentality"" that you guys always seem to talk about?  I didn't know it represented, folding under pressure. No idea why it constantly gets mentioned."
Let me get Allen Iverson Kobe Bryant lebron James Tim Duncan and dirk nowtiski
"Outplayed... well Durr, They beat their ass.  But they didn't deserve to win JUST BECAUSE they had Shaq (The Most dominant Center in the League, bar none) and Kobe ""The Black Mamba"" Bryant?? Phil Jackson as a Head Coach? STILL NOT ENOUGH?? What more do you need? Who did the Cavs have when he took them out? Please, I want you to make an argument for why LeBron James was successful against this exact same Pistons squad. Who did he get production out of that would come close to a Kobe Bryant or a Shaquille O'neil?"
"But weren't you beat up when you came out the West and still 4-0 the Pacers, the Nets and 4-1 76ers in back-to-back-to-back seasons? Oh but THAT LAST YEAR...Oh man let me tell you... They were practically handicapped.  They were shooting their warmups while sitting in wheelchairs.  They had to be careful not to get their IVs tangled up with their teammates so they avoided giving pounds which killed the team chemistry going into the finals. LMAO.    That EXACT SAME PISTONS SQUAD got outclassed by a 22-23yo LEBRON JAMES.  And that dude actually WAS THE TEAM. So please, stop with the excuses because that's what they are. Excuses."
Wow is LeBron James wearing a Jordan jersey?  MICHAEL **JEFFREY** JORDAN would NEVER wear the jersey of another player as he knows he's greater than ANYONE else in the history of basketball. Only the blind witnesses are ignorant of this and this is clearly why Jordan is greater than the so called King
"He literally said that he likes LeBron. Just creatively couldnt get on the same waves as James is more of a guy who shows you shoes he likes, rather than think about what he wants his own shoes to be."
TIL LeBron James started doing steroids in high school
"But my guy.... Lin is no longer in the league.  He was riding the bench his entire career leading to those few weeks where he exploded.  When Lin went to Miami, they checked his ass HARD. Lebron James and Wade made sure he never gained any traction.  Kobe Bryant....Laid down, applied the lube himself, and said to Lin: ""Be Gentle."""
"TBF most NBA players grew up well-off, but none more than LeBron James who had a multibillion corporation take him under their wing since he was 12."
Players ahead of Kobe in the Conversation of GOAT:     1. Kareem Abdul Jabbar   2. Michael Jefferey Jordan   3. LeBron James   4. Earvin 'Magic' Johnson   5. Shaquille O'neil   6. Tim Duncan  \----------------------------------------  7. Kobe Bryant / Larry Bird (it's honestly a toss up)
" We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

~~ESPN~~ /r/NBA: Carmelo Anthony no longer considers LeBron James as family
"Giannis Antetokounmpo contracts a deadly disease.  Zion Williamson is diagnosed with the same degenerative knee issue as Brandon Roy.  Any notable player coming out.  James Harden shaving his beard completely.  Kyrie Irving rupturing his Achilles.  Steve Ballmer involved in a scandal similar to Donald Sterling.  Any notable player (retired for nearly a decade) returning to play this season.  LeBron James retiring.  Evidence proving Michael Jordan abused PEDs his entire career, and specifically before his biggest games.  The Knicks overpaying any player to join them long term.  Kobe Bryant joining the Lakers coaching staff or buying the team.  A recent MVP, ROY, DPOY, or MIP gets their award revoked.  NBA/WNBA merger.  Major NBA expansion (Vancouver, Seattle, Las Vegas, etc.) effective immediately."
LeBron James would be bagging groceries if he wasn’t blessed by god with his athletic ability.
Then there are the years where the first pick is Andrea bargnani and the next years pick is lebron James
Lebron James suspended for PED use.
"Bruh, Duncan was great(obviously way past his prime) literally 5 years ago. He was a very productive player in the finals playing against a team featuring LeBron fucking James. He was dominating the league when LeBron was playing and LeBron can still ball the hell out now so I don’t get why Duncan couldn’t. You’re an actual idiot bro."
"Delly has 38.1% career three point percentage, better than Kevin Durant, LeBron James AND Trenton Hassell   And he has reinvented his shot, NEVER SETTLE, allowing him to shoot a mind boggling 60% from 3 over his last 1 games"
that commenter? LeBron James
That’s what I think. The man retired at 30. The last few years before that he was hurt a bunch. How amazing would his career have been if he would have had the durability of LeBron James?
ESPN: Carmelo Anthony no longer considers LeBron James as family
Lebron James would've been the perfect example of a human being if he's not a drama queen.
"Not even close.  Tim Duncan, Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Garnett, Jason Kidd, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady, Dirk Nowitzki, Ray Allen, Ben Wallace, Paul Pierce, Steve Nash, Amar'e Stoudemire, Yao Ming, LeBron James, Chauncey Billups, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Deron Williams and Tony Parker were all better than Joe Johnson in the 2000s.  That's 25 players. I can go deeper too but I think the point has been made."
"Holy shit. This is the worst reason to hate LeBron. ""DURRrr what if i theorefically want to make a podcast about tacos I HATE LEBRON JAMES FUCK HIM"""

"&gt; I also feel like a lot of folks aren’t legit fans of TD, but they just use him to validate their hate for Kobe and in some cases, Lebron.   I would agree with that, it honestly pisses me off as well when I see it. I just hate that he’s used as an argument against Kobe instead of being more appreciated for the player he is himself. My top 10 list is way different than most because I have both Tim and Kobe in my top 5 all time. I could care less which order they’re in as long as they are right next to each other. I view them as a Magic and Bird thing. To be honest anyone not named Michael Jordan or LeBron James will give you the same level of results in the top 10 in my opinion."

The GOAT and Lebron James. Good times.

That's nuts. The Warriors only get booed in OKC. The Heatles were booed in every single arena. The reception James got in Cleveland was 10x more hostile than the cupcakes Kd got in OKC. The Heat forming together was national news it ripped through the country like Trump winning the election. It wasn't like Kd's move that only shocked the basketball world. Lebron is a much bigger figure outside of sports too.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Did you know they acquired him for $12 million in Free Agency at a time when things weren’t necessarily looking like a dynasty. That first round pick could end up being the next Lebron James for all we know. He could also end up being the next Andrea Bargnani but if you risk it, you could end up with a championship team but if you don’t, then you have a good player in Andre Iguodala, an all-star in his prime but that’s it. Masai Ujiri traded DeMar Derozan, a guy who’s career had been similar to Iggy’s besides the rings late in his career. They both were not superstar players and weren’t capable of bringing a championship. It’s better to risk it for the possible superstar/bust than get a guy who you know won’t get you a championship."
Lebron James Worthy
He would've been a rich man's Lebron James if he learned to trademark Taco Tuesday.
LeBron James' perfection. People truly think he's perfect and has never cheated on his wife
LeBron James invented Taco Tuesday
If last names count adding lebron to the James team is pretty decent.
I’m sorry but what part of 73-9 do you not understand? This was in a time where the league was also balanced. Just because they ran into a spectacular performance by lebron James and kyrie does not mean that they weren’t the greatest team of all time.
"No one forgets that it’s a public school, But it’s an experiment for lower income families. If James had funded 100% of it, none of the people he wants to help would be able to afford it because then it would be considered a private establishment and they would have to pay a tuition to keep it open.   Also you act like education is a burden for taxpayers. And this is more than a regular school. James’ school has programs to get the parents GED’s, he has a room full of food/supplies that families can take for free. He has counselors for mental health on staff as well as fitness/dietary needs covered. All for free. The most recent reports are the students are exceeding expectations so they are expanding to other grades. This is a total education reformation beginning with teaching kids that they are worth more than their environment. He is giving low income families an opportunity to better their situation, not just the kids but the parents too. And then upon completion he is willing to pay their tuition for college. It’s more than a regular public school and Lebron is paying millions to try to make a bigger change within the system. He is working with the Akron school board and they are monitoring the success of this school to maybe expand this program. So yeah taxpayers are paying for it, but not anymore than they would be any other school. And this is not any other public school because Lebron James is a donor with an open wallet willing to spend whatever the tax payers cannot cover."
LeBron James sucks cock.
"Isn't LeBron James a clutch player, I hear? Yes, he is!"
"The answer is they would have the worst record in the league. I wouldn’t be surprised if they went 3-79  The best high school players in the league sometimes don’t even make the nba. Top college players flame out in the nba as well, e.g. Anthony Bennett   If you can guarantee me a team full of high school level LeBron James, sure, it is possible. But if you are talking about a team full of the typical high school players who are elite + mj or LeBron, they would get crushed. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if that team went 0-82...the skill gap between a shitty nba player and a typical elite high school player is that big."
Somewhere around lebron James and Jared Dudley
LeBron James will not sign with the Charlotte Hornets
"I don't think so. I play casual ball (not even in a varsity team), and presently an out of shape 31 year old dude, but there was a time I hit 3 straight triples in a pick up game off-the-glass, intentionally, just because I was feeling it and wanted to rub my big balls on my buddies' faces lol. Also, there's a certain angle plus the fact that you're not squared up, when banking it in will be relatively easier than trying to hit the shot directly.   Anyway, the point is, if I was able to do that once in my life, I'm goddamn sure LeBron fucking James did that on purpose. Does not change the fact that it was still a lucky shot, but he didn't ""miss it so badly it went in""."
"Yeah, he was a midseason move, so initial comparison is unfair, true, but again we are comparing two groups of players, and it just so happens that it ain't too crazy for the one not having LeBron James to be a better one overall.  I mean yeah... This scenario does give 17/18 Pels a benefit of ignoring the whole ""ThEy ArE bEtTeR wItHoUt BoOgIe"", and looking at Mirotic as an elite guy he was for a stretch with them... But just to think that there's a case to make for 17/18 Pels being able to put out a better squad on the court than 19/20 Lakers if LeBron declines this year... Yeah I mighy not agree, but it's an interesting hypothetical."
"Weird, last time I checked LeBron James wasn't 3 MVPs but let me double check just to be sure"
You literally missed the playoffs last year with **LeBron James** on your team
"Maybe an unpopular opinion but how much credit should be given to LeBron James for correctly assessing the fragile predicament the league officials were stuck in considering all of the questionable groin kicking and other shenanigans Draymond Green was engaging in during the lead up to the 2016 Finals?  It's obvious to some of us that LBJ was hyper-aware of the situation and made one of the more clutch gambles in recent history to step so disrespectfully over the fallen Dray and bait him into that overreaction that led to his one game suspension.    We all know how the dominoes fell afterwards. No matter what allegiance, that split second assessment by LeBron needs to be lauded more in retrospect."
Yeeah having Lebron  James and Anthony Davis on our team really makes us miss the pst
~~LeBron James~~  ~~Rajon Rondo~~  jk I always liked both of em ('cept in Heatles Era everyone pretty much had to hate Bron)  We probably still resent Dwight Howard a lot. Paul Pierce for sure.
"""A wave of Canadian players start to make some noise in the NBA and the rise is being attributed to Carter's influence in the Canadian basketball scene. Canadian entertainers feel that Carter opened up opportunities for them. More and more Canadian fans are now embracing basketball and Raptors as LeBron James voices out that he respects how the fans support their team. The film ends with Drake asking ""What if?"" Carter never played for the Raptors."" From the Carter Effect documentary.    Perhaps you can find answers from there."
"LeBron James, Devin Harris, the list goes on"
I predict by Christmas everyone is gonna complain that the lakers have a super team and pretend like they knew they were gonna be a beast of a team.   Its just a combination of laker hate and people hoping the lakers fail. Truth is they have 2 of the best players in the NBA. One of them being lebron freaking james. Everyone else is just icing on the cake.   The only thing that could stop this team from being great is injuries. But you could say that same about every team. Kawhi has missed more games these past 2 seasons then AD in 3 seasons yet Lakers have injury concerns.
Lakers 2019/20   PG Lebron James  SG Danny Green  SF Carmelo Anthony In his Prime?  PF Anthony Davis  C Boogie Cousins  Yeesh.
"[lmao they reacted to him fouling out like they just won the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA_G0MK-TBs)  don't blame them because it's lebron fucking james, but just interesting to see"
Then prove it without Lebron James on the court. What kind of numbers does Steph average playing alongside Lebron? Kyrie has never been worth shit without Lebron carrying the load.
"Love Simmons as a sports personality, sad he hates the Lakers so much that he's really trying to imply that LeBron's somehow on par with or worse than Jrue Holiday just because he's 35. No disrespect to Jrue but good lord man...it's LeBron ""In the conversation with Michael Jordan"" James we're talking about. He's 35, not 55. Also he's overstating Rondo's likely role on this team and completely forgetting Danny Green. ALSO also Kuzma might end up being better at just about everything than Mirotic depending on how he develops, he's still super young."
"**Larry Bird**  AST/TOV: 6.3/3.1  **Chris Paul**  AST/TOV: 9.7/2.4  **Steve Nash**  AST/TOV: 8.5/2.9  **Isiah Thomas**  AST/TOV: 9.3/3.8  **LeBron James**  AST/TOV: 7.2/3.5  **Kevin Johnson**  AST/TOV: 9.1/3.1  **Jason Kidd**  AST/TOV: 8.7/2.9  **John Stockton**  AST/TOV: 10.5/2.8  **Mark Jackson**  AST/TOV: 8.0/2.4  **Tim Hardaway**  AST/TOV: 8.2/2.9  **Magic Johnson**  AST/TOV: 11.2/3.9  **Jose Calderon**  AST/TOV: 5.8/1.5  I had some free time today so I decided to give you the stat you asked for. Of the stats you requested, this is the only one available for Bird. The only one in this list close to Bird's AST/TOV ratio is LeBron. They're both essentially 2/1, with LeBron having the slight edge. If you wanna argue Bird is a better passer than LeBron, we can have that debate, but I'll never not believe LeBron is the superior ""quality passer"".   I agree that Bird was a great passer,  but calling him the greatest ""quality passer"" ever is too much. That's my only point. Maybe I have him ranked 16th. Maybe you have him 9th. Whatever. Calling him the greatest ever is pure bullshit and trying to hide that bullshit behind some nonsense way of wording things is ridiculous. ""Let me create a vague and shifting definition of 'quality passer' so nobody can refute me."" You're not slick.  Now we're done here. Have a good one."
LeBron James &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kosta Koufos      Hairline...
LeBron James too.
"Well to be fair, LeBron James is not ALL OF AUSTRALIA."
Only one of them is named LeBron James
LeBron James
"Actually he's like LeBron James Jr. but like 20 years older and without the ""Jr""."
"You can't dismiss cream at the top just because we are talking ""top to bottom."" That doesn't mean value guys like Malik Beasley the same as LeBron James lol.   Sixers' bench has been completely overhauled -- especially if you consider the weaknesses they addressed from last year -- and they have the best starting five in the NBA. Players make their greatest leap between their second and third season, historically, and I think Ben Simmons is going to be elite. Josh Richardson is a fantastic player and arguably the most underrated player in the league.   The Lakers' rotation players are definitely question marks, and I think there's a timeline where it turns into a clown show, but I'm not betting on that. Their top end talent and cast of bench former stars is too good on paper to ignore at this point."
LeBron James is decent at basketball
"Two years ago, with DMC on the injured list, the Pel swept the first round.   Now add a healthy DMC to that team and LeBron James.  So... not 'just the Pels from 2 years ago'."
&gt;LeBron is not a closer  Game-tying/go-ahead field goals with under 10 seconds left in the postseason:  Michael Jordan: 7/15 (47%) LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)
"Being a Lakers fan will keep you entertained every single day. We have the most content ranging from news stories to independent analysis by people like Laker Film Room on twitter. Lots of other fanbases don’t have that.  Also you can enjoy our basketball history with legends from the beginning of the NBA to now, there’s tons of documentaries and content on youtube etc about those eras and players.  Also have LeBron James(!!!) and Anthony Davis and look like we’re going to be very competitive this year."
"&gt;No other player is ranked top 10 in both scoring and assists.  True.  &gt;LeBron James is the only player ever to rank in the top 10 of both points and assists  False. Multiple players have retired with this accolade. Off the top of my head, I know for certain that Oscar Robinson did it. The fact that they lost the position later does not mean that they didn't achieve it. It could happen to LeBron also."
I'm like 50% convinced James Jones is a mole for LeBron in Phoenix
"Yeah, why would you use ""Russell"" (Common first name) and ""James"" (Common first and Last name) for something like this when you could do ""Westbrook"" (Not that common) and ""Harden"" (Unique).  I was like, ""When did Bill Russell and Lebron James play together?"""
"I read James as Lebron James, had to do a double take"
He didn’t have James worthy that season an all time great? I just told you Steph won a chip vs LeBron with one all star. He averaged 26 in the finals too btw
"Well that's just bullshit because there are several examples of NBA iron men playing heavy minutes into their late thirties. And LeBron is unlike anybody we've ever seen physically. There's no pattern for players that were never injured just breaking down suddenly. Who are your examples of players that didn't get injured suddenly breaking down and becoming injury prone in their mid 30s? Because Duncan, Malone, Stockton, Kareem all had great careers deep into their 30s. I mean are you really buying into LeBron fucking James breaking down becaue3 he pulled a hammy and took his time coming back?"
"As a child of the 70s who clearly remembers watching all these players, the disputes on r/nba are... entertaining. I can't wait for all you guys to hit middle age and try to split hairs between players who played a generation apart at different positions and all you have are columns of stats to back up your argument.  We are obsessed with our top 10 lists and GOAT declarations. It's fun to argue and defend our favorites. But it just becomes impossible. Dr. J is perhaps my favorite player ever but I can't communicate to you all just how thrilling it was to see him in his prime, moving like a panther, doing things nobody had ever done. His stats and awards just don't do him justice. And MJ was Muhammad Ali and the Beatles and (early on) Shaft all rolled into one. He was the primary sex symbol of his age, as well as the greatest athlete of any sport, and (again early MJ) a rallying cry against the Reagan 80s. None of that shows up in his stats but my god was it important.  Bird and Magic duels really were all that. And yes, Hakeem is my favorite center of all time. Watching The Dream in the post was can't miss TV. You'd circle those games (we didn't have League Pass or nbastreams back then of course) and treat them like mini-holidays.  All that said, this is truly a golden age right now. For the last three years or so we've had nearly-universal strong franchises. Yes, MJ as the owner in Charlotte and Dolan and Sarver are the worst of the bunch but go back even ten years and they would have been middling/average owners. There were always half a dozen coaches or more who didn't deserve the job and now...? Maybe one or two. The entire league is deep with talent and player development.  You're seeing it happen right now with LeBron. Those who weren't watching even two years ago doubt his greatness. You will all learn the helpless frustration of reading articles in five years how Trae Young is better than King James ever was. JUST YOU WAIT."
"I agree except slightly better outside shooting. Lebron James is an exceptional shooter. He isn’t of course a Steph curry or Thompson, but if you gave lebron the amount of room to shoot like they do Giannis he’d average 50 points a game."
"Every shot of the 4th wasn't an iso for OKC either.   &gt;Also, LeBron never plays hero ball  Got it, so Billy just needed LeBron James to beat the Warriors. Sound strat. This is also wrong. LeBron has entered hero ball stretches in his career."
Must be LeBron James -OP
"Link to Box Score - https://basketball.realgm.com/national/boxscore/2006-09-01/United-States-at-Greece/58736  Team USA roster - LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul, Joe Johnson, Dwight Howard, Kirk Hinrich, Shane Battier, Elton Brand, Chris Bosh  Since 2008, Team USA has ripped off 24 consecutive victories in the Olympics and 18 straight victories in the FIBA World Championship/World Cup for a 42 game win steak (which is 43 if you count the 2006 Bronze Medal Game)"
&gt; you'll see him get Beverley or Lou Williams switched   [Artists rendering of LeBron when he sees Kawhi and PG on either side](https://i1.wp.com/www.sportressofblogitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/lebron-james-sweat.jpg?ssl=1)
4 of them with Prime LeBron James as his running mate (Bosh was good too)
"But didn’t he agree in the segment?   That whole segment was weird. I agree our roster has some issues at the one, but some of it didn’t make a lot of sense. These aren’t exact quotes, but they are things he said:  &gt; where’s Danny Green going to play if you have LeBron, AD, and Boogie?   That seems pretty obvious that Danny is playing the two, like he has for most of his career.   &gt; playing LeBron, AD, and boogie leaves Kuzma as the odd man out.   Kuz has played off the bench before, and is going to play off the bench again. He played off the bench most of his rookie season, started games last season after we lost Randle, and will go back to the bench with AD starting at his position.   &gt; they have rondo, Quinn cook, and Caruso at point - okay?  Yeah I agree here. That’s a pretty weak rotation at point. I’m not gonna argue that one.   &gt; how’re they going to play right when both AD and LeBron excel at the 4?   LeBron has played 4 in the past, but he’s played the 3 for most of his career. I don’t think it’s going to be a problem really.   &gt; their best starting five is LeBron, Green, Kuzma, Davis, and Cousins. Who’s guarding Dame and CJ in a close-our situation?  I agree that James isn’t playing the same level of defense that he has in the past (both due to age and his lack of effort), but he still has shown he can clamp down when he wants to. Danny Green isn’t the greatest perimeter defender, but he’s absolutely solid and is the best we’ve had in a long time. And Davis is a big who actually guards guards well.   All in all, I agree that the point guard rotation is weak, but I’m honestly fine with the rest of our roster. We could use one more forward to really round out the team, but I think it looks good otherwise."
Ceiling: Jayson Tatum   Floor: Lebron James
"You’re failing to understand how much pressure is/was on LeBron James.  A player needs to have a great team in order to be an all-time great, and he’s up to management to surround their star player with a good enough team.   Cleveland did **not** do a great job. Mo Williams was the best player LeBron had.. in comparison to Kobe who had Gasol, Odom, Bynum, Ariza/World Peace.   You wanted him to stay in Cleveland, so people like you can rag on him for having no rings?"
I'll take one LeBron James please
"&gt;You do understand a lot of people think Wade was snubbed for MVP in 2009?  Yeah, a lot of people who are wrong. You have to be out of your mind to think Wade deserved an MVP over prime LeBron James winning 66 games with the Cavs.  &gt;You do get that Dwyane Wade’s best teammate until Lebron was an aging shaq  Ageing Shaq was an MVP caliber player and they don't even sniff the title if he's not there.   And I'm not talking about who had better teams, or who had to carry their team more (and if we go that way that who was Harden's best teammate on the Rockets? A post back surgery Dwight and a declining CP3, that's much worse than a 32 year old Shaq). I'm talking about who's a better basketball player and that's James Harden, better scorer, better playmaker. Wade was a much better defender but offense &gt; defense and I'm taking Harden over him."
Lebron james for the memes i guess
"He says in the face of DeAndre Ayton, Ben Simmons, KAT, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin, Elton Brand, Tim Duncan, Allen Iverson, Glenn Robinson, Chris Webber, Shaq, Larry Johnson, Derrick Coleman, David Robinson, Patrick Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon, Ralph Sampson, James Worthy, Magic Johnson, Mark Aguirre, David Thompson, Bill Walton, Austin Carr, Bob Lanier, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elvin Hayes, Walt Bellamy, Oscar Robertson, Elgin Baylor, Frank Selvy, and Ray Felix."
"Tim Duncan = Tom Brady  Passing of the torch from one good player to the next (Drew Bledsoe -&gt; Tom Brady, David Robinson -&gt;Tim Duncan). Both won championships at the beginning, middle and end of their career, while always contending in between   Lebron James = Peyton and Eli Manning   Definitely kills it in the regular season, like Peyton. Has gotten outplayed in the championship, like Peyton. Has led miraculous comebacks like Eli  James Harden = Aaron Rodgers   Both part of offensive juggernauts (Packers 2011-14, Rockets 2017-now). Both started as backups behind all time greats"
LEBRON RAYMONE JAMES SR. WOULD NEVER
That's pretty pathetic. Just shows how ESPN's extreme obsession with Lebron James has almost no limits.  This kind of trivial stuff is what ESPN's snapchat story or Bleacher Report are for.
"True story. After Dirk defeated LeBron and the heat in a massive upset in the 2011 NBA finals, LeBron asked dirk to teach him his stellar fader. Audio was even collected when the two spoke after game 6 where LeBron was quoted saying, “Damn skinny u gotta teach me dat toasty fader.” Dirk agreed and that summer he held a secret camp dedicated to teach bron and other superstars his elite fade away. Clearly no one has mastered the shot like dirk, but his generous gesture to teach the next generation furthers his legacy as an all time great and ambassador of the game. Without this camp LeBron James likely would not be a 3 time champ and Zion Williamson would not have been born."
"I'm tired of this narrative.   LeBron James is a 34 year old coming off of his 16th season in the NBA, and his very first season with a somewhat serious injury, and he will turn 35 this December. He's 6'8"" 250lb and has played over 56k minutes professionally, playoffs included (more than Wilt Chamberlain's entire career for perspective). Unless while in Miami he found something that Ponce de Leon couldn't, or he's doing the Body by Jagr fitness plan, then he will soon start regressing.   PROS FOR THE LAKERS: Anthony Davis *should* be the focus offensively, and LeBron will not need to rely on his freakish athleticism for the Lakers to find success because he's an amazing passer/playmaker.  CONS: the Lakers lack depth in a very competitive Western conference, meaning he's likely going to need to shoulder a lot of the load.   Father Time is undefeated. How much longer can we realistically expect him to dominate the league? Karl Malone, John Stockton, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar are statistical anomalies who remained injury free throughout their 30s. I hope LeBron stays healthy, but I also think it's no longer a safe bet to gamble on him being Mr. Dominator.   Jordan at the same age was surrounded by HOF talent, a deep team full of reliable role players, and was coached by one of the absolute best in history. LeBron doesn't have the same assets right now. Kobe, in a more similar position, blew out his achilles. Dr. J, Clyde Drexler, and Dominique Wilkins all declined or were injured in the back end of their careers.   I think the Celtics are a better team the Lakers, and a better team without LeBron. The man is one of the greats, but greatness is fleeting, and I can only hope he's still got lots left in the tank."
Did AD and Lebron James die
"True story. After Dirk defeated LeBron and the heat in a massive upset in the 2011 NBA finals, LeBron asked dirk to teach him his stellar fader.

"my other comment   &gt;&gt;can you expand on this?  &gt;sure  &gt;defense in basketball is more about preventing something from even happening rather than reacting and stopping a ongoing action   &gt;getting a good contest on a shot is great, but not even allowing a fga is much much better   &gt;if you're playing good defense and only allow one contested shot a possession you're of course going to be happy with that, but forcing a turnover without allowing a shot is even better because every shot from anywhere has a chance at going in   &gt;""well then wouldn't steals and blocks be good indicators of defense?""   &gt;no, because swiping and swatting at the ball is always going to have a chance of being called a foul, even if it's not a foul   &gt;fouling aside it's probably a pump fake and now your in the air and your guy is now inbetween you and the basket, or you swiped at the ball and opened up a passing lane or overextended yourself and the ballhandler is waving as he drives right by you   &gt;you can also play perfect defense and the guy your guarding drops 33 on you on 17 shots because nba players are just that good, and when your guarding lebron james and kd that is just going to happen more often than not   &gt;and that goes for the opposite too, you can play garbage defense and hold a guy to 2/12 shooting  &gt;l just named a couple reasons but there are just so many factors in defense it's impossible to account for all of them    &gt;i'd also be curious to see how this data was tracked"
Since  LeBron James is one the best dunkers in the game why doesn't he just dunk or everytime and be the most efficient player in the league
Better question: who has had the better career Patrick McCaw 3-0 or Lebron James who has some MVP’s and a lot of Finals losses.
LeBron Raymone James Sr. would never.
"So your definition of a quality passer is a good passer. Gotcha. And your definition of quantity passer is someone who gets a lot of assists but is not a good passer. Lol gotcha. Like I said, meaningless bullshit.   Here are 10 quality passers who could out-quality quality passer Larry Bird with quality passes-  Chris Paul  Steve Nash  Isiah Thomas   LeBron James  Kevin Johnson  Jason Kidd  John Stockton  Mark Jackson  Tim Hardaway   Magic Johnson  Bonus player: Jose Calderon  All of these guys are better ""quality passers"" by your definition."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true          shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.

"[I'm agreeing with you:](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21941260/nba-playing-lebron-winning-nba-title-kyrie-irving-decided-move-question-why)  &gt;During a rare practice in the middle of last season, coach Tyronn Lue, who was standing next to assistant coach and Irving confidant Phil Handy, called out to his young point guard.  &gt;""Ky,"" Lue said, ""I want you to play a little faster.""  &gt;""Why?"" Irving asked.  &gt;""Because if we play faster, we get shots off easier.""  &gt;""I don't need to play faster to get my shot off,"" Irving replied. ""I can do that anytime.""  &gt;""I'm not talking about your shot. I'm talking about RJ and JR,"" Lue said, citing teammates Richard Jefferson and Smith.  &gt;""Well, that's No. 23's job,"" Irving replied, referring to James."
"&gt;James Harden had a better statline than LeBron  Ryan Hollins, is that you? Because I don't know what you're talking abut. LeBron had a higher FG%, Rebounds assists and blocks per game, less turnovers and less personal fouls (he also has more than Kawhi in all of those categories). [Do some research](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html) before you just start saying things. (Kawhi only played 5 more games than LeBron so that argument doesn't fly)  If a statline is your bar for best player, than that goes to Giannis.  Obviously you are entitled to your opinion, but if you're going to make another bland post we've all seen multiple times at least do us the favor of giving better support for it."
"Because we watched the finals? Kawhi was outplayed by Klay Thompson in the nba finals. Steph Curry was the leading scorer of the nba finals not Kawhi. Kawhi was outshined even by Kd in just the 11 minutes Kd played.  Kawhi's 4th quarter numbers in the finals were nonexistent. When Lebron put those stats up in the 2011 nba finals we all called it a black mark on his career.  Kawhi is not better than Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, or Lebron James."
"&gt;can you expand on this?  sure  defense in basketball is more about preventing something from even happening rather than reacting and stopping a ongoing action   getting a good contest on a shot is great, but not even allowing a fga is much much better   if you're playing good defense and only allow one contested shot a possession you're of course going to be happy with that, but forcing a turnover without allowing a shot is even better because every shot from anywhere has a chance at going in   ""well then wouldn't steals and blocks be good indicators of defense?""   no, because swiping and swatting at the ball is always going to have a chance of being called a foul, even if it's not a foul   fouling aside it's probably a pump fake and now your in the air and your guy is now inbetween you and the basket, or you swiped at the ball and opened up a passing lane or overextended yourself and the ballhandler is waving as he drives right by you   you can also play perfect defense and the guy your guarding drops 33 on you on 17 shots because nba players are just that good, and when your guarding lebron james and kd that is just going to happen more often than not   and that goes for the opposite too, you can play garbage defense and hold a guy to 2/12 shooting  l just named a couple reasons but there are just so many factors in defense it's impossible to account for all of them    i'd also be curious to see how this data was tracked"
"I think his best spot is at the 2 or 1 in a pinch and have a long boy lineup. To me his comp is James Harden. If he bulks up he could play 3 but right now he's too scrawny to be guarding dudes like LeBron, Kawhi.. dudes that are big and can play some bully ball will feast if he's playing 3 next to two smaller dudes"
"Spending the no.2 pick on Darko Milicic when the surrounding 4 picks were Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and Carmelo Anthony."
"The 2004 roster looks better than this current one, but it was still the pinnacle (up to this point) of the American NBA player Olympic drop-out era.  Here's some of the players missing off that 2004 club:  1. Shaquille O'Neal 2. Kobe Bryant 3. Kevin Garnett 4. Ray Allen 5. Tracy McGrady 6. Vince Carter 7. Paul Pierce 8. Jason Kidd  Not to mention next tier guys like:  1. Steve Francis 2. Jermaine O'Neal (third in MVP voting in '04) 3. Baron Davis 4. Ron Artest 5. Chauncey Billups 6. Ben Wallace 7. Michael Redd  Of the top 12 American vote-getters for NBA MVP in 2004, only two appeared on that year's Olympic team - rookies LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony. Those two averaged a combined 7.8 points per game in Olympic competition that year.   An easy argument could be made regarding head coach Larry Brown's decision play guys like James, Anthony, and Dwyane Wade sparingly behind the likes of Lamar Odom, Shawn Marion, and Carlos Boozer (no disrespect to those three).   I've always tried to imagine Larry Brown trying to wade through what had to have been a significant lack of cohesion where arguably your best player is silent and struggling to acclimate to international play (Tim Duncan), your backcourt's primary objective is to get shots (Iverson &amp; Marbury), and arguably three of your best players are considered too young to establish themselves among less talented but older vets.  [Here's the full roster, by the by](https://www.basketball-reference.com/olympics/teams/USA/2004/), for anyone interested."
"CP3 and Dennis have a pretty good trade value in 2k, they helped me a lot in the rebuild, SGA also develops really well. Got a ring in that span as well, ended up drafting LeBron James Jr.   Pretty much what will happen in reality."
Tmac apparently balled out in practice and supposedly did a good job of replicating Lebron James for their practice teams.
"2012 team is way better than the 2008 team tbh. Thats who should be compared to the dream team or the 96 team.  PG - Chris Paul, Deron Williams,  Russell Westbrook  SG- Kobe Bryant, James Harden  SF- Lebron, Kevin Durant, Carmelo, Iguodala  Bigs- Kevin Love, Anthony Davis, Tyson Chandler"
"It is 2019, Kobe Bryant is not a better player than LeBron James.   I seriously can’t believe people still try to argue this"
"See my post above. This was Team USA's roster in 2006, when they lost to Greece in the FIBA World Cup:  Carmelo Anthony  Dwight Howard  Brad Miller  Dwayne Wade  Joe Johnson  Antawn Jamison  LeBron James  Chris Paul  Shane Barrier  Elton Brand  Kirk Hinrich  Chris Bosh"
"It wasn't even the end. USA lost the 2006 World Cup as well. They lost to Greece who then lost to Spain in the final.  For reference, here's Team USA's roster in the 2006 FIBA World Cup:  Carmelo Anthony  Dwight Howard  Brad Miller  Dwayne Wade  Joe Johnson  Antawn Jamison  LeBron James  Chris Paul  Shane Barrier  Elton Brand  Kirk Hinrich  Chris Bosh"
"I'm hijacking this thread because it's dumb:  For Raptor fans like this guy, why do you choose to favor a team with Lebron James - a player who dad-dicked you so many times in the post-season and provided you with so much misery, over a team with Kawhi Leonard - who was a huge reason you won your title and finally got over  the hump.  This makes absolutely no sense to me. Are you guys really that upset that Kawhi ""I want to go to LA"" Leonard wanted to go to LA over Toronto?"
"So why would he still instead go to the Clippers who are in the same city, with none of the glory, to team up with Paul George INSTEAD of Anthony Davis and LeBron James if he was concerned with teaming up with a star?..."
Lebron James(heat lebron was stupid athletic)  Kobe  Steph  Kawhi  KD
LeBron James hands down lol  Kobe Bryant  KD  Steph  Kawhi
Lol the point is LeBron isn’t consensus best player in the world. Kd and Kawhi and James Harden and Steph had way better seasons last year while LeBron was at home “watching Godfather”
"I disagree. They were LUCKY AF to even get him for another season. Not only did you get him for an extra season, you got him during his BEST SEASON. But make no mistake, he originally wanted to go back home but in a rare circumstance was convinced to sign for more time in OKLAHOMA! An L.A. kid wanting to go back home but deciding to stay in OKLAHOMA after not liking it in INDIANA. (If you're not from a popular city, then I'm sorry but you wouldn't understand)  AD requested a trade in the middle of the season (essentially quitting on his teammates) , to a very specific franchise in the Lakers (Wreaks of tampering, but so was the whole PG to the Clips) and he did all this as the guy who was drafted there. Then they score the biggest basketball prospect since LeBron James (Although I think he's gonna be a bust until he loses some weight), and a bunch of other young promising players with possible upside to their game. I don't see how PGs request was worse. I really don't and I don't have a dog in this fight. Plus him wearing that Looney tunes shirt was the icing on the cake. Dude did not give a single fuck and showed it."
So FVV is better than LeBron James to you?
Good thing 35 year old Lebron James is still a top 10 player lmao
Just replace Jrue with LeBron fucking James and add Danny Green.
"Don’t you think that oversimplifies it - I’m not entirely referring to adding a ring to his resume as much as I’m adding “beat the best regular season team of all time” as well as beating Michael Jordan.  It’s as if EC team beat this past Warriors 73-9 team if they had Lebron James.  Also, I see the argument for why LBJ over MJ justified with comments like “Well, MJ never had a face a team like the Warriors”"
Wrong.  Wade found out that Lebron was leaving Miami the same time as the rest of us. Stop telling falsehoods.  http://heatzone.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2017/04/06/why-didnt-lebron-james-tell-dwyane-wade-he-was-leaving-to-cavaliers-they-couldnt-ask-dwyane-to-carry-that-secret/
Kobe Bryant is the best Kobe   LeBron James slightly edges out Lyndon B Johnson   Michael Jordan beats out Michael Jackson
Lebron James
So you had 70% of your season with LeBron James and still couldn't make the playoffs... still trash
"Even if Kawhi does not win a title with LA Clippers, I doubt he will be frustrated or unhappy. His goal was to go back home similar to what LeBron James did. But Kawhi doesn't feel the urge to bring a championship, it was more to be around with his family and enjoy life. He feels this is a crucial time in his life and chose over personal over basketball. It's all good. As a Raptors fan, it was tough seeing him go, but what he did here was historic and I will always cheer for No.2, Kawhi Leonard."
[in 2009 Jerry West said that LeBron James was a better player than Kobe Bryant](https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=4178437)   There's one example if you need it. I definitely have watched basketball for 20 years and worked in college basketball as well for a few years. I know my own history so I'm confident with where I stand in my own life man thanks
Can y'all really talk when you're the first team to not make the playoffs with LeBron James since his 2nd year in the league? 🤔
He benched 600 pounds when the record was set at 565 in 1959? In 1967 a man named Pat Casey set the record at 616 and became the first man to bench over 600.    Man Wilt could bench 600 with those long arms while these guys had to be built like tank-trex hybrid to accomplish their feats.    It’s just so incredible that people back in the day would never exaggerate his feats to be something ridiculous and that he could actually bench 600 pounds.    [Btw did you know that lebron has a photographic memory and has never forgotten a single play he’s ever seen and processes it all better than a supercomputer?](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11067098/lebron-james-greatest-weapon-brain) Super duper photographic memory. It’s incredible and totally not an exaggeration of his abilities.
Yeah ! They almost killed Lebron James sucking all the air in the arena ...
"I wanna say Shaq and Kobe because LeBron and AD haven't proven anything yet, but I've learned time and time again to never discount LeBron James. That man can do magical things for a team."
Lebron James
"&gt;And the Lakers were really only dysfunctional this year  Did you just start watching ball? How do you think Jeanie became owner in the first place?  Jim Buss fucked everything up, Kupchak continued to show he was incompetent. Jeanie legit strongarmed Jim out - and she even gloated about it in her leaked interviews.  What I don't get is the amount of Raptor fans jumping on sides with the Lakers - Are ya'll really that mad that Kawhi left that 1. you'd rather team up with the team that has Lebron James - the one guy that eternally dicked your team in the post-season and 2. ignore straight facts (Lakers have been a disorganized bunch since Jim took over."
"His ""defense"" was always based on his physical gifts, gambling for steals and chasedown blocks. But fundamentally, he is way behind Bird. Even the [defensive numbers per 100 possessions] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1_select=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1=jamesle01&amp;player_id2_hint=Larry+Bird&amp;player_id2_select=Larry+Bird&amp;player_id2=birdla01&amp;idx=players) slightly favor Larry and their steals and blocks numbers are similar. If only Bird was 19 or 20 when he entered the NBA and did not mess up his back, we would not even have this conversation. LeBron had the ""wow"" factor, freakish natural gifts and physique but basketball-wise, Larry Bird is above him."
"I have the same players, just in different order.   1) LeBron James  2) Steph Curry  3) Giannis Antetokounmpo  4) Anthony Davis  5) Kawhi Leonard  6) James Harden  7) Joel Emiid  8) Nikola Jokic  9) Paul George  10) Damian Lillard  KD would be number 2 if he was playing this year. Kawhi would be higher if he repeats his performance from last year. I could definitely see George ending up 12 or so because consistency has always been an issue and I can see last year being hard to duplicate. Towns, Westbrook, or Irving could find their way in ."
lol. Literally everything public facing the guy has done since like age 14 has been a very calculated business decision.  Not saying the guy is a monster or anything but it's not like he isn't a corporate shark in charge of Lebron James Inc
"Actually I was wrong, the stat is 2000 points and 600 asts in which only Derrick Rose, Michael Jordan and Lebron James achieved that in the modern era."
"First off, no player is going to be as efficient as Harden with that many shots and team control besides maybe Steph and LeBron. It’s not a good hypothetical. And that’s not Hardens fault. Half his team was injured last year and had only lost to the Warriors the last couple of years. Something the sub only looks positively at if you’re LeBron James.   Also, The team is designed that way and he himself has stated to Curry that he hates it. Curry never talks about other players and the fact that he mentioned that means a lot."
I think it should be:  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard  3. James Harden 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Stephen Curry 6. Anthony Davis 7. Joel Embiid 8. Nikola Jokic 9. Paul George 10. Damian Lillard

"RPM don’t lie, that’s why Robert Covington is objectively better than lebron james"
"“James was exposed in the fact that Taco Tuesday is currently trademarked by Taco John’s. The team of James, like any business mogul, regularly files trademark applications to limit exposure based on interests they intend to pursue.”  Not that ridiculous because limiting exposure means that LeBron decreases the chance he gets sued. If he loses because of commonplace usage etc. then he’s less liable to litigation. If he wins, then it’s cherry on top."
"Like the Lakers said last year ""we ain't winning with LeBron James"""

"&gt;I can't wait to see Ntilikina lock up Lebron James again   /s  ???  No?    &gt;   That literally never happened.. How the fuck does this horseshit and false comment get this many upvotes? No wonder this subreddit is just a cesspool of incels nephews.  It's embarrassing.    &gt;  Other than what he did with France yesterday, Frank's biggest relevant moment was when he was disrespecting LeBron, and kept on trying to go chest-to-chest with him, like some wannabe tough noob.  Then Kanter appeared, and tried to take away Frank's spotlight. That was literally it..   &gt;  But for fuck's sake.. in which fuckin timeline did Frank lock up LeBron? lol  That french boy would get murdered. Don't put that voo doo on him"
"You're definitely cherry picking with the numbers to suit your narrative. I question if you watched the Heatles at all. That Miami Heat team was probably at their worst in the 2010-11 season. Chris Bosh was the 3rd scoring option on the heat for many years which is reflected in his regular season and playoff numbers when compared to Dwayne Wade + Lebron James. Carlos Boozer on the other hand had many more opportunities to be a Primary and secondary scorer between 2010 - 2014 on the bulls due to Derrick Rose's injury after the 2010-11 season. Rose played 81, 39, 10, 51 regular season games in that time. Carlos Boozer continued to decline in performance since 2010 while Chris Bosh improved offensively(versatility) and defensively until the unfortunate early end of his career. Chris Bosh was also a 11 time NBA All Star compared to 2 from Carlos Boozer. The aforementioned is by the numbers. In actuality, Carlos Boozer at best was a budget version of Chris Bosh on the court. If not for the sudden health issue suffered by Chris Bosh this would be more apparent to the masses. So, yes, I believe you are statistically, figuratively, and literally disrespecting Chris Bosh when you put him in the same tier as Carlos Boozer."
LeBron James
"&gt; Jesus fuckin Christ the whole Doncic article is based on Dwayne Wade saying he hasn’t a rookie passer like Doncic since LBJ  Which is once again, was personal quotes along with box stats. That's literally what i said.   Lebron is a much better passer than Doncic, he just holds the ball more doing so.   &gt; The article about Melo’s dominance was by playing the 4 all tournament as a spot up shooter. Not 5. He played center for two minutes vs Australia because they had no bigs. Learn to fuckin read. Thats not “play him over Duncan” thats “Carlos Boozer can’t do that shit but lets play him over Melo”   Nope, the article talked mostly about how you should push Melo to create points off bigs. That's the literal point of that article.... you used the article without accounting for complete change in how basketball is played.   That's the point bud, ROOKIE MELO WAS NOT A BETTER PLAYER THAN FUCKING BOOZER/Duncan or whatever. Jesus Christ lol  Every possible shooting split has Boozer as the better shooter in mid range than rookie Melo as well.  &gt; You said having LBJ would be same as Marbury’s TEAM LEADING 3 assists per game because “they are both ball dominant players” and then claim I am trying to say LBJ is a bad passer.  Huh? What the fuck are you talking about? Seriously, learn how to read, please.   I never said Lebron wasn't a good passer. I said he was a terrible fit because he couldn't shoot and he had similar flaws with the players in question.   It's HILARIOUS, apparently we should replace Marbury because he was a ball dominant player and a poor defender... so we should replace him with fucking rookie Lebron who had the exact same flaws PLUS couldn't shoot?   My god lol  I love your usage of box stat assists to make an argument despite fucking negating the part where USA played a very slow game. No shit, the are not collecting much assists, it was slow pace, half court basketball with tons of isolation. Rookie Lebron wouldn't have done shit with that.  &gt; And in the same article citing the 2004 woes, the same Marbury claims the team’s system had no chance of working while Larry Brown’s own assistants said Brown’s system wouldn’t have worked with one of the the greatest passers in NBA history and it definitely wasn’t going to work with Iverson and Marbury.  Wait, wait, wait.   So let's pretty much destroy this juvenile argument:   Lebron James/Wade was a terrible fit for 2004 team because they were rookies, who couldn't shoot, couldn't defend, and could not use their best attribute of attacking during fast break. This pretty much should be the consensus. You argued that the issue with that team was because the rookie trio couldn't play, which is hilariously wrong. Saying there is a problem with the scheme for the US is not wrong; I don't disagree with that at all.   But:   If Larry completely changed the scheme for USA, I don't think rookies, Lebron/Wade/Melo, would have changed much tbh. Fast pace USA would've performed so much better  than they did.   &gt; Don’t pretend you didn’t change your narrative. You spent 10 comments talking about zone defense and lack of shooting hurting Team USA, then you switched to how they can’t guard the p&amp;r while still claiming rookie LBJ wasn’t a good enough passer compared to Marbury and Iverson to get more than three a game   Nope. Never, ever said Lebron was not a good enough passer. Seriously, are you incapable of reading? You know what? Please quote it for me? Please?   Lack of shooting DID hurt USA, when have i EVER backed up on that stance? huh?   I brought up lack of Pnr defense on that comment that I had to post again for you to see.   Once again, rookie Lebron was a ball dominant player who couldn't shoot, defend, nor use his skillset. I said this multiple times. Rookie Lebron didn't  move the needle much for his NBA team with much weaker talents, he wouldn't hugely impact a much more talented squad. My biggest issue with your delusion was your consistent complaint about ball dominant players than fucking use LEBRON of all people, one of the most ball dominant player ever, to use as proponent.   Just go home bud LOL"
"""LeBron James has no regard for human life"".  Larry Bird: Hold my beer, homes."
"LeBron James trying to make gains off of the phrase/idea of ""Taco Tuesday"" is perhaps the most fitting metaphor of the evermore ridiculous and vapidly gutted future that humanity has set up for ourselves"
"&gt; “I didn’t delete anything but I’ll repost what I deleted.” I also like how you changed your tone after reading one article. Here’s a few more.   Nope, seriously stop talking out of ur ass. i can pretty much screenshot the convo and show that there are literally two exact same  comments. You want me to bud?    &gt; https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/comparing-luka-doncic-and-lebron-james-rookie-seasons/1pfaapr0svz4c1fx5om6hts62y)  Why are you using box score metric to talk about passing habits? LOL What the fuck are you doing?   Btw, comparing Luka's playmaking abilities to rookie Lebron is a travesty. The latter was a much better passer with far high upside, albeit far less skilled as a rookie  &gt; A summary of the 2004 lineup inefficiencies  Yup!!!!   Remember when I said:   Lebron was terrific at finding teammates in fast breaks, sure. So how in god’s name does this help a team that’s mostly operating in the half court? What does this change? Being a good fastbreak player in a half court scheme is not a huge difference. Larry Brown, whether correct or not, didn't want to play a fast pace game.  **""I remember in the qualifier for the Olympics, he told Jason Kidd, ‘Hey Jason, I know you're really good at the fast break, but I want you to stop at the free-throw line and throw a bounce pass to one of the wings.’ And you're sitting here talking to the second all-time leading assist guy and one of the most dominant point guards of all time. Truth be told, that's probably why nine guys decided that they didn't want to go do the Olympics.""**   As I said, Larry didn't want to play a fast pace game.  It's funny huh? Apparently my tone changed because I read the article, when in fact i've been saying the same shit since the first fucking comment. Your articles are literally pointing out exactly what i've been saying.  &gt; A long form breakdown of why Melo is elite vs traditional FIBA systems  HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA    **Just let him play center and be done with it**   So, now I know for sure you have absolutely no clue what you are talking about.   You wanted that team to play fucking Melo as a center at the fucking 5 spot? Over Duncan?   You do know the entire premise of Carmelo playing a five (From the article) is to allow him to score over larger bigs. But you want to do that over fucking Duncan? Without any of the defensive upside Duncan provides? it was feasible in 2016 when teams can go small with great shooters every where, but in fucking 2004? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA  &gt; How Australia has been so successful with ball movement  Once again, you are continuously refusing to factor in difference in era.   &gt; Another about James passing ability as part of an offense  This is literally personal quotes about passing with assists numbers sprinkled in.   At this point, are you seriously trying to argue Lebron is not a ball dominant player? Seriously?   Like, what are you smoking for you to believe Lebron is not a ball dominant player?   Lebron, outside Shaq and Magic, is probably the least portable player in that top ten list, and doesn't nearly do as much off ball as other wings... outside ironically, Dwade.   Btw, we are talking about fucking rookie Lebron   &gt; First hand accounts of the 2004 team’s woes  LOL  from the article:  People see LeBron James, Carmelo and D-Wade on the roster and they’re like, “How could you lose?” **You’ve got to remember those guys were 19 years old, 18 years old, first time they’d ever played internationally, in most of those cases**   You didn't read any of the articles... did you lol?  Look man, just give up lol. You are completely morphing history at this point. My tone is changing because I'm having to put up with this LOL"

"&gt; Oh please, the fact that Greece got humiliated in the final just shows how much of a fluke it was. That was one of the greatest team shooting performances in FIBA history and the US were within ten the whole time with a chance to win down the stretch. You say the US destroyed all previous opponents then two sentences later say they had a disappointing overall performance. Make up your find before forcing a narrative.  They destroyed their opponents PRECISELY because they pressed hard and took advantage of their TO. That’s why USA was killing teams.   You are telling me Greece having only 10 TO was a fluke too?   You know what’s hilarious? These shots were open BECAUSE they were beating the press, hence great looks almost every time.   USA also had no understanding of how to guard the PnR.... hence wide open looks in the half court. I guess that’s also a fluke right?   It’s almost as if you didn’t even watch the game and have no clue what you are talking about. Lol  Gtfo lol.   Learn how to read if you are going to use my words against me bud.    &gt; Point remains the same, in 2002 they relied on Carlos Boozer and Stephon Marbury, who were well past their prime, and then put them with Tim Duncan, Iverson, and Shawn Marion and expected it to work. They lost twice in group play twice before getting upset and nothing about shooting would help placing two undersized, ball dominating guards who can’t play defense, along side a defensive specialist, and an over the hill defensive liability, and expect them to be competitive.  First I would like to mention it was the 2004 team  Second, stop talking out of ur ass please. Lebron nor wade were good defender as rookies. Both were very ball dominant guards as rookies as well. Once again, what are you talking about LOL?   Third, you beat zone defense by providing shooting from outside to elongate the defense. This is literal the biggest reason why they lost,   They needed shooting, Lebron wouldn’t have helped shit.     &gt; Even 19 yo LBJ would have been a better option than playing Iverson and Marbury together, or Carlos Boozer at all. Two compare the two teams like they had the same issues and rolled their problems from one tournament to another is ridiculous (or to claim shooting would have prevented not winning either tournament, especially 2004).  Why? Seriously why?   Lebron was just as ball dominant as any player you mentioned, outside Maybe iverson. Why are you talking out of ur ass man?   Dude, seriously, Lebron James, as great as he is, is universally considered one of the biggest ball holders in NBA history. What are you talking about?   Rookie Lebron was also a very inconsistent defender as well. Same with Wade obviously.   At least with Marbury he provides shooting.   Stop talking about topics you have zero understanding of."
"&gt; Lmao. You deleted it.  I didn’t delete anything.   &gt; Again, you can’t look at those two teams and say they had the same problem. Shooting is ONE WAY teams disrupt zones, another is quick passing and cycle players through previously filled space. Its why Australia has used Andrew Bogut of all people to kill zones in this tournament, and it is the exact opposite of what the 2004 Olympic team did. Having Marbury dominate the ball and say, “LeBron and Wade would have been the exact same” completely ignores the difference in playing styles.  In what way, seriously, did you watch early versions of Lebron and think he was a “quick” passer? He was generally a very ball dominant guard who held on to the ball before making reads.   Next, except the literal coach of the team specifically pointed out their need for shooting:   Because almost everyone who watched the game pretty much told you USA needed shooting. Jesus Christ lol  &gt; The 2006 team used that style and part of why mid-range king Carmelo Anthony has been so good in international competitions, since the style of play fits his game better (unless he is backing up Boozer of course), and he’s played the whole time next to a guy named Lebron James who is notorious for finding players in open space as he rotates through an offense, instead of being a ball dominating guard who relies on draw and kicks and drive and dumps for assists (a trait typically associated with under sized shoot first pgs, like Marbury or Iverson).   Once again, why are you changing history?   Lebron was THE definition of a player who held on to the ball as he made plays. There’s no fucking way you are trying to argue a very obvious point.   You are backtracking every single comment you have made:   Apparently rookie Lebron was a good defender? Apparently rookie Lebron didn’t dominate the ball?   Dude seriously, you have no clue why you are talking about.     &gt; Forcing turnovers is nice, but it wasn’t the whole purpose of their game plan. That team was 7-0 and only had one team get within ten points of them, and lost on a historic three point shooting performance that couldn’t be replicated by Greece in the final, and to say they equally struggled like the 2004 team vs FIBA defenses and playing styles is the definition of not knowing what you are talking about and talking out of your ass.    So yeah, since people with no knowledge of this topic is bombarding my box, let’s look at actual article of that game:   https://www.espn.com/olympics/wbc2006/news/story?id=2568543  The entire point of high press was to create TO for easy looks. Greece had the least amount of TO against team USA.   &gt; In the earlier rounds, the U.S. applied defensive pressure to create easy baskets. That didn't work against the methodical Greeks, who committed only 10 turnovers, the fewest by an American opponent.   Greece hit tons of threes because USA COULD NOT GUARD THE FUCKING PICK AND ROLL TO SAVE THEIR LIFE.   &gt; The Greeks did one thing beautifully in this game: the pick-and-roll. No matter what defense Krzyzewski tried, the Greeks found open shooters beyond the 3-point arc or open lanes to the basket. As a result, the Greeks shot 63 percent.  Wade straight up said:   &gt; They ran like one play the whole game,"" Wade said.      Next, I never said 2004 and 2006 struggled the same. I said they both failed. Learn how to read, please.   So reallllly? Everything you have said is straight up wrong. Just go home bud lol"

"I was going to say that I'm sure they love the benefits they receive by living in America, but that wouldn't necessarily mean they are patriotic.   Weird analogy but it's like loving your salary at your job, loving the benefits, loving some of the coworkers you have, but then refusing to show up for work.   In my opinion, if you are patriotic then it would be an absolute honor to represent your country in the thing you are best in life at. It's just funny that most other countries aren't as nationalistic but they see representing their country in *any* sport as an absolute honor. I mean, you're literally representing your country and competing against other countries in the thing you've worked at all your life.   I do agree that it can be expressed in many ways. I just see this as the epitome of patriotism, and you can't really claim to be patriotic if you shrug something like this off.   You bring up good points and I agree with a lot of them. I just feel that representing your country is one of those things that sets apart those who are patriotic and those who claim it for PR.   ""Oh yeah, I love America. But I don't love it enough to spend some of my free time bringing positive attention to America (for lack of better words, as ""bringing honor to America"" sounds cheesy as fuck). But I totally love America, just not when it inconveniences me"".   As someone else in the thread said (and going back to my point about other countries), other athletes in various sports see it as an honor and you have to have a damn good reason to turn it down. It's like the non-barbaric version of being drafted (except you're specifically chosen due to your skills as opposed to a random draft). You do it because you love your country. If you don't, then you're only ""patriotic"" when it benefits you, and that isn't exactly patriotism. If LeBron James got offered a billion dollars to play in China and took it, we wouldn't call him a patriot of China and we wouldn't truly believe he loves China even if he said so. Because he's only there because it benefits him."

"Wait, if you are going to use clutch stats, you do know we can use regular season as welll... where we have far more sample?  You do know if you include regular season, Lebron James has the worst game winning/tying shot percentage for his volume ever?   But if you want to only look at playoff:   Last five minutes, margin of five, both of them are at around 55% TS, which is both terrific.   Both Kobe’s league average efficiency is around 1-2% lower, so Kobe does have a pretty substantial edge. Oh! If you think this should be ignored, Kobe also has the highest clutch winning percentage in the playoffs out of any superstar in the modern era.   So yeah. Come on.

He doesn't have the sexy dominant body like LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard, but his body is just perfect. He's short by NBA standards but he's above average for a regular human and he isn't as muscular as a Joel EMbiid or Hassan Whiteside, but his body still has a good amount of muscle. With all do respect to Chris’ partner, I'd totally suck the meat off of his cock. Only under the circumstances where I'm forced."
"They are the two, as far as stars go, who popularized it and got pretty much their entire teams following along. *Teams* not taking heaves has never been a thing in league history before this. Stars not taking these shots has never been a norm, there is a massive difference between Battier doing something for the two opportunities he had per year to take one and LeBron James doing it nightly."
"Lebron James isn't human, I think it's too early to claim he's declining until he actually declines.   Much, much more likely he suffers a catastrophic injury though.   That said, there's a non zero chance AD ups his game next to Lebron and Lebron takes a big backseat role in the regular season, scoring less, playing less hard D, while AD is going ballistic carrying the team and getting set up for some of the easiest baskets of his career next to Lebron."
Like LeBron James to me he is one of the worse playoff clutch preformers. During the heat he lost the rep because of that Spurs game he played (even thou he shot the ball when they were ahead) and his one championship with the Cavs (Golden State chocked harder then LeBron ever could). Curry also has this problem during the playoffs even thou he is a monster during the regular season.
"Not taking any credits away from Stern, but the players are a huge part in making that a reality.  From Michael Jordan who just outright made NBA super popular, to players with great charisma such as Kobe, and to Lebron James an athlete who is not afraid to speak up."
"In 2023:  “I’m coming home”  KD didn’t get it as bad as Lebron did after his first exit, and James still found his way back.   I wouldn’t rule it out towards the end of his career, despite what he’s saying now."

"SHENZHEN, China — The descriptions of Kemba Walker from three of his Team USA mates, who just happen to be Celtics, make clear they’re drawing a comparison, even if they didn’t realize it.  “He fits in perfectly. Everything that Brad envisions as players, (Kemba) has it,” said Marcus Smart, referring  to Boston coach Brad Stevens.  “I didn’t know how down to Earth and how humble he was,” Jaylen Brown said.  “He’s really humble, and a guy like that you always want to be around because he gives off good energy,” Smart added.  “I think that resiliency that he carries will fit Boston’s personality very well,” Brown continued.  “Hopefully there are good things to come for the future,” Jayson Tatum offered.  Wow. It’s almost like Walker, who signed a four-year, $141 million contract to join the Celtics over the summer, is an All-Star point guard replacing another All-Star point guard who turned out not to exhibit those traits while he was in Boston.  It’s almost like, without using his name, the Celtics who are teamed with Walker at the FIBA World Cup are comparing him favorably to Kyrie Irving, who left a heaping pile of dysfunction in his wake on the way to signing with Brooklyn.  The Athletic did not, at any point, ask any of the Celtics interviewed for this story to compare Walker to Irving. The words you see mentioned above, they used without being led to them.  “I’m saying this about Kemba,” Brown said, when it was pointed out to him what all this is going to sound like. “I’m not saying this about everybody else. For me, like, I’m just moving forward. I’m looking forward to this year. I’m not thinking about last year. Last year was what it was.  “Spend your time in the past, you’re blinded by it and you’re missing your future,” he continued. “I’m not painting that picture at all. If people draw from that, that’s on them. I’m just making observations from what I see right now.”  Team USA has turned out to be a collection of egoless, agenda-absent warriors who are willing to take the unglamorous route to win. To a man, the players like each other. This is, of course, the polar opposite of how things went in Boston last season.  With LeBron James gone from the East, and both Irving and Gordon Hayward healthy after devastating injuries the season before, and the Celtics coming off a remarkable run to Game 7 of the conference finals without them, Boston was supposed to rule last year.  You know what happened instead — 49 wins, a fourth-place finish, a disappointing second-round exit from the playoffs and a whole bunch of locker room tumult that really can only be traced to Irving and how he chose to lead. He was abrasive, accusatory, then contrite and determined, and then distracting again.  Some of the Celtics’ problems were laid at Stevens’s feet, for failing to mold the talent he had, and he accepted those criticisms. He knows this is a players’ league, and, at least until the playoffs, Irving delivered to the tune of 23.8 points per game, a career-high 6.9 assists and numerous accolades for a willingness to play defense.  But Kyrie’s explosions were out in the open for all to see, and they affected his teammates in different ways.  “That’s bullshit,” Smart actually said during exit interviews, shortly after the Celtics were ousted by the Bucks from the playoffs. “Not one of us on this team knows what Kyrie’s been through. Probably a few amount of people in this world knows what Kyrie goes through. It was hard for him as well. He was forced into a situation where it was business over the friendships, where he had to come into a situation knowing that this is a group of guys that had something going before I come here, how will I fit in?   He didn’t want to disrupt that. And that says a lot. This is Kyrie Irving we’re talking about. And he’s talking about coming in and disrupting us? We took him in with full arms and we tried to understand it.  “Like I said, we never really understood. We’re not in his shoes. So that’s just a bullshit statement to say his leadership killed us. There’re four other guys out there, there’re 12, 13 other guys on the team, coaches and everything. So to blame it on one guy is bullshit.”  In the end, he just didn’t fit with the Celtics’ mentality. Smart confirmed that part.  To that end, the three Celtics playing with Walker on Team USA can’t help but view him through the lens of comparing him to Kyrie, because he is literally Irving’s replacement.  After Monday’s World Cup game against Brazil, Walker, 29, was leading Team USA with 14.6 points and 6.0 assists per game. He was the Americans’ high man against Greece Saturday with 15 points, in a win over Giannis Antetokounmpo, who helped knock the Celtics out of the postseason last season.  The Team USA Celtics, obviously, seem drawn to Walker’s laid-back, unassuming personality. On the court, they said, there have been a few surprises. They already knew him as a three-time All-Star and Charlotte’s all-time leading scorer.  “The dude can actually play defense,” Smart said.   “Guys who score the ball can kinda get that notion that, you know, they’re not really good defenders. Especially him being a little guy, it’s probably harder to play against him because of a lower center of gravity. Plus, he’s feisty. So he’s really good, he’s a really good defender and he plays both ends.  “You didn’t get to really see that a lot from him because he exerted so much energy on the offensive end that he had to take a couple of breaks off on the defensive end, understandably.”  Smart spoke to The Athletic after Team USA’s opening win over the Czech Republic, in which the Czechs tried to post the 6-1 Walker with 6-7 Tomas Satoransky, and Walker met the challenge. Defense has become the Americans’ collective calling card. To win, they have to defend. That’s what the Celtics do when they’ve been at their best under Stevens.  “I knew he could defend, even watching you could tell what kind of cloth he was cut from,” Brown said. “Kemba’s a tough dude. He’s from the Bronx, so you know he’s going to come with that personality, that swagger, but what I didn’t know was how down to earth and how humble he was.”  After the Americans crushed Japan last week, Walker was asked about his chemistry building with the Celtics, and he said he was trying to stick to Team USA.  “When we get back to Boston, then we’ll figure some things out,” Walker said. “But yeah, it’s been fun to just be around those guys. It’s mostly off the court stuff that I’m excited about. They’re really cool guys to be around; they’ve really welcomed me with open arms.”  As Smart spoke of Walker, he compared him (by name) not to Irving, but to Isaiah Thomas, the All-Star and MVP candidate point guard Boston had when chemistry was surging. Smart said “we had a little guy like that, similar to that on our team in Isaiah Thomas. It’s kind of funny some of those little guys that can score the ball, they have an energy and a motor about them you don’t see very often.  “(Walker) definitely fits to what Brad envisioned for us and what we thought he would do for us coming to the team,” Smart said.  The Celtics learned a lot from last season. For starters, just because things are supposed to be good, or look like they may be, doesn’t mean they always end up that way.  “Six months from now, observations can be different. Right now, Kemba’s a great guy to play with. He’s a hard worker. He’s easy to deal with, just a regular guy. (Top photo: Tang Yanjun / Getty Images))"
"I always think Durant's ""choke"" against Warriors is so overblown. He had one bad Game 6.  - Michael Jordan shot 5-19 in Game 6 of the 96 Finals.  - Kobe Bryant shot 6-24 in Game 7 of the 2010 Finals.  - Larry Bird shot 6-18 in Game 6 of the 84 Finals.  - LeBron James shot 9-21 in Game 1, shot 7-17 in Game 2 &amp; shot 9-24 in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals.  Durant had an all time bad shooting performance in Game 6. But in the other 3 losses, he scored extremely well.   - 29 points on 72 TS% in Game 2  - 40 points on 55 TS% in Game 5  - 27 points on 65 TS% in Game 7.  But let's pretend like a bad performance from Durant in 1 of the 4 losses is the reason they lost the series while completely ignoring the fact that if it doesn't coincide with Klay Thompson having the best game of his entire playoff career, the Thunder would've given Warriors a gentleman sweep.  Otherwise, Durant's Game 6 performance is forgotten just like Jordan, Kobe, Bird, and LeBron's."
About the same height as LeBron James killer J.J. Barea.
"Blaming young players, not taking responsibility after shooting 6-22 from the field, saying the other team won because they ""got lucky,"" these are things that create locker room issues. Locker room issues almost never correlate to winning.  Even if he was on the Phoenix Suns playing the Bucks, saying that after claiming that you ""want your **own** team"" (apparently winning a championship with LeBron fucking James isn't good enough lol), is unacceptable.  Also, solely due to inefficiency, he was NOT the best player on the team during that series."
"Dear diary,  My personal respect for LeBron James (for which I actually do have a lot), has decreased because he tried to trademark Taco Tuesday. If some random person made a lot of money by ""coming up with the idea"" of trademarking a phrase we have all been using for years/decades, it wouldn't make me feel good about him."
LeBron James isn't just walking down the street in Akron without getting absolutely mobbed especially with a camera and sound crew following him. There's no way in hell these streets weren't blocked off.

"Regular season is tough because you can save some money on courtsides but the experience isn’t as incredible because the crowd isn’t always going crazy and into it. Playoff courtsides basically require multiple loans and the sacrifice of a first born but if you can swing it, that’s where you splurge. I sat on the floor (feet on the floor behind the basket, so not the foldable chairs that are literally on the hardwood next to the stanchion, but the first row of stands just behind that) and it was phenomenal. There’s really nothing like being 20 feet away from Lebron James when he’s sprinting straight towards your basket for a dunk. I say do it but I’m the type to postpone moving into a better apartment for 6 months if it means I can sit courtside in november, so take it with a grain of salt."
"James Harden has been the best player in the league for a few years now. Right now he's in the 2011 LeBron zone, where we aren't willing to anoint him because he hasn't showed up in the playoffs. People are just waiting for the narrative to catch up to reality, but the truth is he's already there. Rockets win a ring or two and we will look back and say that he was the best player in the league during this whole period."
"Good thing to bring up at your job interview: ""I spent three years personally working for Lebron James"""
LeBron James started super teams and ruined the nba.  He also does not have the heart of a champion and has to surpass Kobe before we can even put him in the same convo as Michael.
Lebron James has played internationally many times with no issue.
"I honestly don't see how Green could have a drop off playing by LeBron James.  Raptors had a very excellent, balanced offense where Green was only like the 4th option, but LeBron always opens space for shooters.  As well, Green's excellent defense isn't much due to his athleticism but rather his positioning, length, and hustle. His transition defense already took a drop off last year which is the only time he really used his athleticism much on D. He's never been the fastest guy or highest jumper."
"He had significantly more wear and tear on his body than either of those two guys at 34. Jordan retired for two years and both guys played college ball, which was a lot less strenuous than the extra years of pro ball that LeBron went through. I'm not saying that his decline was inevitable, but take a look at what happened to guys like Garnett and Kobe around that age, and consider that James' game wasn't based on shooting; it wasn't unreasonable to think that he might drop off at that age."
"Back in 2017 I was talking with some guy about specific things we liked about different players. Basketball *really* isn't a thing in our country so people with knowledge of basketball that extends beyond ""LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson"" is rare. Anyway this third guy comes up who has a reputation for joining conversations and making unwelcomed comments about whatever the topic is. He continues to do the same thing here and eventually the LeBron is mentioned which prompts him to say  ""How old is he now""  ""Uh 32 I think""  ""Oh right he's probably got about 3 years left in him I think""  Still pisses me off to this day"
"You need a camera crew and sound crew. If there is a crew surrounding Lebron James on a busy street in the middle of the day, it would probably draw a bigger crowd than what we see in this clip. I’m sure they are actors."
"“Wait a minute. I know you! You're LeBron James! You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers.”  “I’m sorry honey, you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Ron. I work for Blaze Pizza.”"
Do you think LeBron James plays for portland?
Lebron James being called a little bitch by draymond. Made me feel warm and fuzzy
"Some of them did complain about Zika and the political climate but LBJ at least wanted the rest and hes even older now. ([LINK](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/23/lebron-james-olympic-games-2016-rio-basketball))   So im sure thats true for some of them, but with them being older too i think more will want rest"
“Along with with LeBron James”       What year is this?
I met LeBron James in a grocery store once.
Have we ever seen Ron and LeBron James in the same room? I'm not convinced they're not the same person
Dude LeBron James is your boss
Is LeBron James better than Donte DiVincenzo?
Imagine going about your day and you see Lebron fucking James. He made that little girl's day.

LeBron James would foul out in the first quarter of every game.

I had a friend from South Sudan who was convinced that Luol Deng was better than Lebron James
"Lebron James would not play a single minute after 3 games in the season if you weren’t allowed to touch the refs, dude grabs their shoulders, hand on their chest, touching all over them to appeal calls."
Yes because the rest of the Greece team would still suck and still never pass (Lebron) James (Harden) the ball.

Crippling depression their economy was based on LeBron James
 All signs point to Anthony Davis to having a career/MVP year. New environment. Teammate with Lebron James. He could have a Kyrie Irving type of career. Kyrie really elevated himself after Lebron’s arrival in Cleveland. AD can do the same thing.   Jayson Tatum and Brandon Ingram are the solid choices up here since they have none where but to go up.    I like Trae Young’s sophomore breakout chances  Derrick White is my pick for an Oladipo-type breakout surprise here. He has been a pleasant surprise every year.
"Strengths and Weaknesses becomes an essay quick, so here’s my very brief list. I can’t order the players well, so I tiered them instead.  1. The Best of the Best Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, LeBron James, James Harden, Kevin Durant (injured for season). These guys singlehandedly change the fortunes for any team they’re on. All except Giannis and Harden have won multiple championships, and those two came close to playing in the Finals before falling to historic teams.   2. Like A Hair Below Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic.  These guys do the same as the others with incredible two way dominance (yes, Jokic is a very good, if flawed, defensive player), with the caveat that they’ve had very little success so far and need to prove more before moving up. None of these three have advanced beyond the 2nd round of the playoffs.   After those 9 guys, it becomes hard to pick a single guy to round it out, because while there a lot of good options, nobody solidly takes that spot. Here are who I would put  3. The Jumble Damien Lillard, Karl Anthony-Towns, Paul George.  None of them have come particularly close to winning much, and Towns has barely been in the playoffs. But all it takes is a perfect storm and a change of fate for these guys to change that narrative."
"1. Kawhi - DPOY level talent year after year, historic playoff run   2. Harden - coming off of the greatest offensive season of all time (not counting inflated wilt stats...) with great defense too  3. Steph Curry - goat shooter, will be even better this year now that he had to take the load of kd and Klay  4. Nikolai Jokic - amazing and Mobile with passing for his size, fantastic offense force all around  5. Joel Embiid - Great defender, second best center in the league  6. Westbrook - top level talent, triple double machine, top defensive point guard, had a 20 20 20 game (!)  7. Anthony Davis - best player on the new lakers team, finally has top level players to boost his game to the next level. Already y’all of fame taken  8. LeBron James - still playing well, hopefully will be passing a lot and taking strain off of his body   9. Damian Lillard- fantastic rapper (lol) but still the most clutch player in the league, top tier point guard  10. Giannis - struggling in the yoffs big time, peaked last season stats wise, but still is a very good defender and good in the fast break"
"What about the Wade that was gonna go on to become the FMVP of the 2011 finals had the Heat won the series? Someone who could've gotten a FMVP over Lebron freakin James is not better than Pippen? Granted, overall their time together was too short and was at the back end of Wade's career riddled with injuries, but let's not sell Wade short because Lebron didn't 3peat with Wade AND Bosh. Lebron teamed up with a champion."
"&gt; 2 less games  *fewer. also why didn’t u just name this michael jordan vs. lebron james, which is what this post is really about"
"Don’t forget the garbage competition in the expansion era   MJs finals opponents-   91 Lakers-  Injured Byron Scott and James Worthy, no Kareem and Sam Perkins was starting. Magic would retire after this year.  92 Blazers-  1 Star   93 Suns-  No defense suns, MVP chuck and Kevin (lol) Johnson, but then the corpses of Tom Chambers and Dan   95 magic-  loses to a team that got swept by 6 seed rockets  96 sonics-  Gary Payton (calf injury) and Shawn Kemp outplayed Jordan, 30% shooting in last 3 games with Payton as primary defender.  97 and 98 jazz-  washed hornacek, stockton, antoinee carr starting at center, bryon russell lmao. basically shit version of lob city clippers  I would honestly say the worst team Lebron faced in the finals is better than the best team Jordan faced"
"He did a nice job playing LeBron James. That's not the same as playing entirely made up characters. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was already playing a ""character"" in his pro wrestling days and displaying his acting ability, so it was a much more natural transition."
LeBron James
"lol, wrestling is scripted, if LeBron wanted to wrestle for ~~WWF~~ WWE all he has to do is tell McMahon he wants to win Summer Slam, win Money In The Bank, Win The Royal Rumble and win Wrestlemania and hold the title longer than CM Punk did Vince will tell LeBron, ""no problem King James, whatever you want"".   It's also not good to put LeBron alongside The Rock, The Rock's acting is one dimensional."
Basketball is the ultimate team game?  Dude it's the most individual orientated team game our there.  1 player can dictate the future of a franchise  Name another big team sport where 1 LeBron James can alter a teams trajectory?
"Lebron blows Kobe out of water in every other way though so that argument goes no where. Stats, FMVPs, MVPs etc. The only people he doesn't blow out are MJ and Kareem, and all the stats put James right there with MJ and Kareem which is his true category."
"2014-2015  ""Kobe Bryant signs with the Spurs. The Lakers, sparing no expense to fill his shoes, acquire LeBron James.""   He was half right.  Also he nailed ""the president is a tyrant"", though he probably only gets half credit for that as well."
"&gt; also you realize, that when you're the best scoring option on the team...you're going to naturally have less assists ...because your coaches WANT you to be taking shots   Sure because thats what they excel at, but coaches will always make decisions that facilitate THE TEAM scoring more points.(Also this is not exactly 100% true, ala this years James Harden/MVP Westbrook season) Adding Lebron to a team has had a historic increase on offensive production literally every time he has done it other than this years laker team."

"Here are a few off the top of my head:  * **Warriors win 73 Games** &gt; ""Blocked by James!"" &gt; Cleveland ends its drought * **The Heatles collapsing in their first NBA Finals** &gt; ""Don't ask LeBron for change for a dollar, you'll only get three quarters"" &gt; Dirk gets his first ring  * **The era of player empowerment.** Paul George and AD all forced their way to LA with loads of time left on their contracts. Kawhi's saga with the Spurs, then leaving the Raptors after a great season. LeBron held a large amount of sway over the Cavs roster for quite some time. Kyrie managed to get to NYC, although this is not the same as the other ones. * **First ever championship won by a team outside the USA**  * The **incredibly rapid demise of the traditional big man**. See Roy Hibbert. * This one gets forgotten a bit here, but the **end of the 2010 Lakers/Celtics series was absolutely bonkers**. Three pointers from Ron Artest and Rajon Rondo to seal things is not what you'd expect.  * **Load Management**, the peak of which is probably that game in 2013 (?) in which the Spurs sat all their stars against Miami and were fined $250k. Oddly enough it wound up being a nail biter.  * **Advanced Stats In Basketball**. This was not a thing at the beginning of the decade. Again, from that 2010 finals, KG was the master of the foot-on-the-line deep two, and Kobe lived in the midrange. It's threes or oops these days."
If they metric for being a good passer is putting your teammates in the best possible position to succeed then yes. He was a better passer than both Chris Paul and Lebron James last year.
"Obviously not comprehensive  Championships:  * Kobe gets 1 more than Shaq, 2010  * Dirk and the Mavs beat the Big 3, 2011  * Lebron wins rings  * The Warriors dynasty is born  * 3-1 lead  * The Raptors get one for themselves  Games:  * Kobe's retirement game  * Game 7 2016  * Game 6 2013  Achievements:  * 73-9  * Russ going full Oscar  Plays:  * Rebound Bosh, Back out to Allen  * Back to Iguodala - Blocked by James!  * Is this the dagger?  Retirements:  * Dirk  * Kobe  * Wade  * Spurs big 3  Player Movements:   * Taking my talents to south beach  * Hardest Road  * Kawhi trade drama  * Cousins to GSW"
"The discussion of how good Scottie Pippen was, if he was underrated, and if the Bulls ""missed a beat"" sans Jordan has nothing to do with LeBron James. That's just you unnecessarily turning things into a GOAT debate for no real purpose."
Usually I'm defending Lowry in these kinds of debates for the same goes for Paul George.   The guy has had so many monster playoff performances.   Before he went west i considered him the scariest playoff performer in the east not named LeBron James.   He was unreal for Indiana.
&gt; Or better yet someone who has eyes and sees that the last decade produced literally zero FMVPs that were guards.  Because LeBron James isn't a guard.
"Agreed, but as a Raptors fan. I've learned the hard way to NOT bet against Lebron James."
Toe to toe? The cavs lost 4-1 to the dubs with kyrie and love. Then they got swept without kyrie. James harden and the rockets are the ones who went toe to toe with the kd warriors not lebron and the cavs.
"Your name here suggests that LeBron James is Batman and you’re asking if I’m ok. Lol. Alls I said is that Jordan is better, which is almost undisputed by people who aren’t nephews that didn’t see him play."

"Yeah, but then I still get to say I played in a pickup game against Lebron Fucking James."
"Ridiculously good point.  [LeBron James] fuck 2k, VC is overpriced #bullshit  PR nightmare lmfaooo"
"Dude, I’m not even in the NBA, I can barely dunk *sometimes*, and even I have the life-long dream of posterizing Lebron James.  Who wouldn’t want to be able to say, “I put Lebron on a poster.”"
"Yeah I think it's  * 5-6 years NBA experience = 25%  * 7-9 years NBA experience = 30%  * 10+ years NBA experience = 35%  So effectively you'd have to sign a RFA away from another team which, if they're actually worth a max contract, the other team would generally just match. Since this is usually happening at the end of year 4, if they sign a 4 year deal their next contract (beginning in their 9th year) will be for 30%. If they took a 5 year deal, their next contract would be year 10 and they'd qualify for 35%. In theory this is another structural advantage for the home team.  So you rarely see a team worrying about fitting a 25% max figure in under the cap. Virtually all players resign with their drafting team, and if they move on it's usually at the end (or right before the end) of that first max deal which financially set them for life.   &gt; Anyway, you make good points, but I was just trying to point out that the exact amount of the salary cap increase definitely could have an impact on whether a team might be able to give a cap-percentage-based contract like a max. idk if that has ever actually happened, but it's an interesting (albeit probably inconsequential) thought  It has, not infrequently, Usually players just take a little less. As you correctly pointed out yourself  &gt; Obviously a player isn't likely to refuse to sign just because the contract is only for 34.4% rather than the full 35% max  But, again as you said, you're also definitely technically correct. Another way you're correct is the percentage doesn't recalculate yearly. So in theory the yearly raise (bird or non-bird) could exceed or be lower than the yearly TV revenue increase. Like the raise 2020 to 2021 is about 7.2%. Meaning a bird extension raise would be a little higher (8%), so that a max contract signed in 2020 at 30% of the cap would actually be 30.8% of the cap in year 2.  So when you talk about scenarios involving a max player already on the books (like with LA and Lebron James this year), all kinds of best laid plans can get disrupted by small fluctuations. This happens all the time and you see these random salary dumps where a team suddenly has to ditch $3 million for no good reason and burns draft picks to do so (LA dumping Moritz Wagner and co. this offseason is a good illustration)."

"Well no, Lebron was drafted like 7 years after Kobe.   And also what is the point you’re trying to make? Do you just want people to agree with you that Lebron James, a 6’8 260 lbs freak of nature was a more efficient player than Kobe?"
"For all the idiots that aren't going to read the article and going LOLBRON:  Nobody scored more points in the 2010s than LeBron James, and he absolutely owned the paint.  Unlike the decade's other breakout superstars, James' scoring efficiency is mostly limited to one area. But that one area is the most vital spot in the sport. Despite the massive growth of 3-point scoring, shots around the rim still produce the biggest return on investment in the game.   Perhaps the decade's most staggering scoring stat reveals just how dominant the decade's best player was in the sport's most important zone. Check this out:  James led the NBA in total paint scoring and ranked No. 2 in paint efficiency out of 227 players with at least 1,500 attempts the past 10 seasons.  Yep, that's crazy. While interior shooting is an entirely different skill from jump-shooting, James is the Steph Curry of close-range buckets:  Dwight Howard ranked No. 2 in the NBA in the 2010s by converting a whopping 3,796 field goals within 8 feet of the basket. James made 4,434!  During the 2010s, 152 NBA players converted at least 1,000 field goals within 8 feet of the basket. Of that group, James ranked No. 1 in FG%, converting a ridiculous 69.2% of his shots."
"- Lebron James played against Kevin Willis. - Kevin Willis played against Bob McAdoo. - Bob McAdoo played against Wilt Chamberlain. - Wilt Chamberlain played against Paul Seymour (who played in the SECOND season of the NBA, 1947-48).  That's the best I can do without using the Bob Cousy ""cheat"" method."
Lebron James or Michael Jordan
Lebron James gave Carmelo the talk like Rogan gave Schaub the talk.
"LeBron has sold the most jerseys in the NBA since joining the Lakers. After signing, LeBron’s Lakers jersey sold 600% more than his Cleveland jersey, a return that was MUCH more of a shock and sold an insane amount of jerseys in its own right. But for the sake of argument, let’s say the team only makes 20 million. If it’s a team that’s perennially unsuccessful, like most teams shelling out 43 million for a 39 year old would be, they would most likely also be a large spike in ticket sales, as well as stadium revenue as people would want to see a top 5, arguably top 2 player of all time play before he retires.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/time.com/2981583/lebron-james-cleveland-cavs-money/%3famp=true  Here’s an article from 2014, where an economist breaks down Lebrons value to Cleveland after he resigned. Even if his value is 25% of what it was, he still nets the team $82 million. Even if it’s 10%, that’s still 7mil in the positive after his salary.  LeBron is the type of player that people will always want to see play. Basketball fans will want to tell their kids “yeah I saw LeBron play!” No matter how old he is."

That nobody would watch any of the games and that they would rather find a nickel on the ground than have season passes to their local WNBA team! Are you telling me that was rooted in sexism and not rational thinking??? Is James Harden, Kobe, LeBron, ect just really bad at telling what is and what isn't good basketball?"
"NBA informed teams of a $125M salary cap in summer of 2021 -- when LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Paul George are potential free agents."
"literally every move harden does is a travel. The guy takes 2 steps away from the defender to shoot 3s. Now he's adding on to his arsenal by also passing the ball to himself while he does it.   The point of having 2 steps is to perform a layup.   If you can just arbitrarily take 2 steps in any situation after picking up your dribble, then the NBA has no right to call a travel in any situation that this happens in. If I pick up my dribble and get cornered by 2 defenders, no problem, i can just take 2 giant steps through them and shoot a pullup jumper or pass to the open man.   They've already pushed the boundaries with this mythical 'gather step' that lets you take 3 steps as well as the idea that you can't palm the ball. They also have allowed offensive players to hook defenders into fouling them with their arms or legs. Now they've unchained the laws of taking steps. I want to congratulate the NBA referees for allowing players to bend the rules of the league to the point of them not existing over the years. Special shout out to Allen Iverson, Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, Chris Paul, James Harden and all of the other great players that are above the laws of the NBA.  I think next year they should just remove the requirement to dribble at all and turn the game into a form of Rugby with dunking and 3 pointers."
"Understandable. But you have to admit his cast elevated and played at top level and all-star level for some (Siakom, Gasol, Ibaka) during the playoffs. This wasn't Lebron James with the Cavs. He had NOTHING. Are other Toronto players that good? Who knows, time will tell. But during those playoffs, to say he didn't have help, is insanity.  Also, I like the comparison of Kawhi as an efficient Kobe. I see it. But as a Kobe homer, there is one thing I'll hang my hat on..Durability, 20 years baby. haha. Grats on the championship."

A guy thats consistently guarded james harden very well? And the raps decision to put him on lebron in his rookie year? You can reserve judgement for his offense but not his defense. Above average for sure.
James Worthy? Are you seriously proposing James Worthy has an argument of being better than LeBron James?
"He's better than Jokic on defense, but nowhere close to enough to offset the difference on the offensive side of the game... There's a good reason Jokic is a top 8-10 player and Marc Gasol is ""a great piece"" these days. Mark's passing is good and he's also one of the greatest playmakers of all time for his position, but Jokic is a total beast in that regard. Now that CP3 has lost a step, there's no better playmaker than Jokic in the league aside from LeBron James whose at worst the 2nd greatest player of all time.  Same goes for Rudy, just reverse the offense/defense... And don't sleep on Rudy's offense... He might not be the guy I want making plays with 10 seconds to go in game 7 of the finals, but he's a very, very efficient scorer. His offensive WSs ain't some anomaly that nerds came up with. He's that fucking consistent and efficient that his OWS (including OWS/48) rivals those of guys like Curry and Jokic for example. He might 'only' give you 16 points, but he'll get you the most efficient 16 points you could ask for at .682 TS%.  Also his PPG doesn't really oscillate that much on night to night basis, and him scoring over 20 pts usually means that Jazz won the game that night. He did so 19 times this year and Jazz has won 15 of those games."
LeBron James.
Wow this is really rich coming from a guy who likes a team literally owned by LeBron James. I appreciate the 2019 Raptors. They are very special for ending the Warriors dynasty and that roster was talented. But you guys have been shit for your entire history until recently and are not even going to sniff the finals this year. Kawhi made you.
"LeBron James, 2018 Playoffs"

"Dood.  Those top-20 players you mentioned all went to The Finals.    Even guys like AI and Dwight and young LeBron carried way shittier teams than HOU to the finals.    And yes, I know James went in 2012, when he scored 5, 8 and 9 points in a 5 game series.    He's good.   He's even great for his generation.   But that team, with him, has plateaued, at best.    I mean, it's your squad, dream and hope all you want.    But wish in one hand, what's in the other?"
"You think JJ Barea was locking down LeBron James for the entire series? LeBron put up elite numbers against players like Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Andre Iguodala, and Draymond Green but was locked down by 6’0 JJ Barea for a whole series?   You’re telling me to educate myself in the same comment that you’re telling me to look up defensive highlights to prove that Barea locked up LeBron lmfao"
"Yeah Barea’s 9 points on 45% TS was really crucial, while Terry’s 18 points on 60% TS didn’t do much.  What key possessions was JJ Barea guarding LeBron James in?"

"One bad game could happen even to a team filled with superstars. In 2006 USA had Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul, Chris Bosh, Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony. And they lost to Greece in semifinals.  Probably team filled with superstars would not struggle but they would still need to put effort and compete."
Is there a reason why the 2011-12 season had a cleared dip in 3 pointers and points per game?   Just googled the season and it was   a Miami heat/lebron James MVP and FMVP championship year and Kevin Durant top scorer. Also there was something called the nba lockout to do with contracts. Not sure if any of this has an effect on play style.
LeBron - Blocked By James
"“Oh yes, LeBron James. I remember him. Sure he can play”"
"Do people really not believe in a team starting Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Lebron James, and Anthony Davis, with Paul George, Jimmy  Butler, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, and Blake Griffin winning the tournament?"
"""No thanks, Lebron James and Steph Curry. I'll take Kemba Walker and Jayson Tatum instead because they showed up last year."""
"There is no reason to assume anything otherwise.  After 15 years of dominance and 58 straight wins we suddenly don't know who is better?  We're not allowed to assume anything based on that?  No, LeBron James and Kevin Durant are better than everyone at this tournament.  We know that."
"be consistent. most teams dont have more than 2 guys who can ""create their own shot on a consistent basis"". the teams that do include the warriors and raps which explains why they played the way they did with lots of high post action and dho's and spain pnrs and stuff  at least lebron, steph, harden, and jokic can create for others. who's going to be the playmaker on the clips? lou? yeah give up 120 points doing so. kawhi? while his kickouts have been getting better, hes not yet even a good playmaker. pg? maybe but hes not anymore more than great. he can do it here and there.  my point is that every team has their problems. but you cant just knock the lakers with freaking ad and lebron james out of the playoffs due to a weak supporting cast, which isnt even that weak in the first place.  clips have their problems as I outlined above (as well as poor interior d), as well as the warriors (defense and shooting ironically), nuggets (not top heavy and lack of consistent 2nd star play from murray), rockets (who knows whatll happen to them w wb and harden), and more"
"First, about Jerry West. He was a combo guard, but most of his career he played with Gail Goodrich who is considered more of an SG than PG. I mean if you consider him an SG than I would put Jerry West at Nr. 3. Personally, I consider him as an SG like Harden is considered as SG, like LeBron is considered as an SF even if he played like a PG most of his career.  Personal list:  1. Michael Jordan 1. Kobe Bryant 1. Jerry West 1. Dwyane Wade 1. James Harden 1. Allen Iverson 1. Clyde Drexler 1. George Gervin 1. Tracy McGrady 1. Ray Allen  Honorable mentions: at 11. Manu Ginóbili 12. Reggie Miller 13. Klay Thompson  You can change the order between Iverson, Drexler, and Gervin as you wish because there is enough viewpoints where you can put one over another.  Why Ray Allen at 10? People forget he was a 10-time All-Star; 2 All-NBA and a 2 time NBA champion while players Reggie was a 5 time All-Star and 3 times All-NBA; Klay Thompson was 5-time All-Star and 2 All-NBA Team. While Manu was only a 2-time All-Star and 2 time All-NBA, but his international career and the overall impact he had on the Spurs teams doesn't really translate how really good he was in awards."
"Yeah, and LeBron James was 16 once and probably could have started in the NBA.  What's your point?"

"Kevin Durant, not LeBron James, has been Team USA's best player whenever he's showed up over the last 10 years."
"Because why would you want to play with an aging, injured star getting max money? He could've been Tim Duncan, LeBron James, or even Magic Johnson."
"I hate equal pay in sports complainers. I’d like to make as much in my office job as Lebron James too. Just because you play a sport for a job doesn’t give you a god given right to millions of dollars, especially when that money isn’t there to begin with."
"There is one criteria that gets him at least 3 and arguably 4.  If MVP = Guy whose production does the most for his team While taking the surrounding talent he has to work with into heavy consideration (which isn't a bad definition of ""valuable"", tbh)  2015: He and Steph have similar production. Steph's team places a seed higher, but he has a LOT more help getting them there (Biggest disparity of talent on this list by a longshot)  2017: Reddit has bought into the trope that Westbrook's cast was way worse. It's not true... the truth is that the team was just assembled badly (partly due to KD's departure, but largely a philosophical desire for surrounding Russ with defenders and letting him do him) compared to Morey surrounding James with shooters. But all the top-100 lists at the time agreed pre-season that the starters on the Thunder were better than their Rockets counterparts. As Harden made his team better throughout the season, people fell for the narrative that Russ had total schlubs around him (which just wasn't true). But either way, it was at least close to a draw along with production. Seeding was a clear push to Harden.  2018: There's an argument to be made that Harden loses this MVP to LeBron based off the addition of ""surrounding talent"" criteria. But LeBron was the only one with an All-Star teammate and he brought a lot of that turmoil on himself, too. Either way, Harden's production and seed help push this to him.  2019: Harden clearly had the worse surrounding cast situation in perhaps the entire playoff picture... let alone among the top seeds. His production was bananas. The seed hurts, but in historical context was remarkable (and still only a missed free throw from the second seed)"
"This is an interesting point to discuss since, apparently, the WNBA is not a profitable venture.  I guess if they just continue playing indefinitely, they can grow the support of the game to a point of profitability.  There are companies now that lose of a ton of money(like Uber) that pay out high salaries and shareholding compensation to their employees because they think they will be insanely profitable in the future, therefore making the current contributions of their employees very valuable to the future profitability of the company, thus the need to pay those employees well.  There is a way to make a value argument based on contributions to growing the future profitability of the women’s game but I wouldn’t know how to calculate that.  I would be more sympathetic to collective bargaining for a higher share of revenues if the business was profitable at all. Realistically, the players are asking for 50% of $0 in profits. Revenues don’t mean anything if the business will always be a losing proposition. If salaries keep going up but the owners never turn over a profit then that will make it more likely the league shuts down.  I am not optimistic about the business proposition for the WNBA. The Lebron James’ of the world will always be way better than the Sue Bird’s of the world, and paying customers pay to watch the best and most entertaining.   The only counter example I can think of is women’s soccer, because the us men’s national team absolutely stinks and the women have won four world cups. So yes, the women are more popular socially, but i don’t care about women’s leagues, and I’m not watching a women’s international game unless it’s an Olympic or World Cup quarterfinal at least while I have no problem watching a meaningless us mens friendly."
"One could make a very strong argument for zero. (summary of below: This year, theres an argument for him wining, but when you get to the details its not clear wither way. 2017/2018 he should take everyone that voted out for Steak dinner for giving him Lebron James' MVP Award) . \*\*\*if your making an argument for harden over westbrook just go home  This year: IDK maybe he should have won it.  It was a historic season Just based on insane offensive numbers, Harden does have an EWA **(estimated wins added) of 28 to Giannis 22.8,** but thats inflated by the overall portion of offense Harden accounted for this season (1909 FGAs led NBA ...2nd was 1684;.. **1028 of those were 3pt-FGAs this is the most in NBA History 2nd all time is 886 3pt FGAs by steph Curry in 2015-2016)** And once again hardens efficiency in shooting was not remarkable in any way OVerall FG% (44.2% 83rd in NBA)  3pt-Fg% 36.8% 59th in NBA, and 57th in 2pt FG % (52.8) eFG%  he ranked 52nd (54.5%). And when you look at Win Shares added per 48 minutes Giannis is by far the league leader wit 0.292, (Harden 0.254 3rd). Giannis also led the league in player efficiency (offensively he had the highest field goal % for a Power Forward) Defensively there is clearly no argument that Giannis is a bigger factor than Harden. Giannis was also a rebound machine at 6th in the league with 12.5 RBPG.  However Harden did have by far the highest value above replacement player (VORP) 9.6 . Giannis was 2nd 7.6. Once again though I think this stat is skewed by scoring and overall FGAs Harden had, however at the same time one could argue the fact that he was so involved is further evidence for his ""most-valuable status"".   2017/2018: If you try and argue the MVP from raw stats as a measure of performance, Lebron James clearly had the upper hand (see below). Additionally, the narrative of Lebron James ""putting the team on his back"" this season was also there (and supported by advanced stats below), with lack of superstar level teammates compared to Harden with Chris Paul.   With regards to pure scoring and shooting, Lebron bests Harden in every category except PPG, however only by 4.28 PPG.  When you consider Harden averaged and \~1 more FGA per game and 50% of his FGAs were from 3-points compared lebrons 25%,and that Harden also averaged more FTAs (**10.09 Harden \[this is a FTA every other FGA\*\*\* Shout Out to the refs\*\];** James 6.45), it suggests the PPG margin should be much greater in Harden's favor, but it is not due to James' elite level shooting that year (see below.)  \[or hardens Pedestrian shooting whatever way you wanna look at it)  lebron James: 2259 pts scored (PPG 27.54);  FGs (857/1580) 54.2% eFG% (60.3%) 2pt FG (708/1174) 60.3% . 3pt FGs (149/406) 36.7%   James Harden 2191 pts scored (PPG 31.82);  FGs (651/1449) 44.9% eFG% (54.1%) 2pt FG (368/727) 53.1% . 3pt FGs (265/722) 36.7%   MOre advanced stats show James also bested Harden in most measurable areas as well (VA= Value added above replacement EWA= Estimated wins added). As shown below Lebron James was not only arguably a better offensive weapon (this is very close only area Harden may have been better is scoring), but all other metrics show lebron lightyears ahead. This is especially apparent when you consider where they ranked in the league that year. In scoring categories they were both #1 and #2, while the difference in shooting percentage has Lebron at 14 in the NBA with Harden at 81st. Lebron was 11th in the NBA in rebounds Harden 87th. This is reflected in the Value added and wins added.  This also puts into perspective the fact that while the rockets had the better record, Lebron's performance was more impactful in the win column. Once again, dont have to go into who was more valuable defensively (clearly Lebron James, but mostly Just not James Harden guy is league avg at best on defense)  **GP MPG**   [**TS%**](http://insider.espn.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/sort/trueShootingPct/year/2018)   [**AST**](http://insider.espn.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/sort/assistRatio/year/2018)  [**TO**](http://insider.espn.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/sort/turnoverRatio/order/false/year/2018)   [**USG**](http://insider.espn.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/sort/usageRate/year/2018)   [**ORR**](http://insider.espn.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/sort/offReboundRate/year/2018)   [**DRR**](http://insider.espn.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/sort/defReboundRate/year/2018)  [**REBR**](http://insider.espn.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/sort/reboundRate/year/2018)   [**PER**](http://insider.espn.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/order/false/year/2018) **.**    [**VA**](http://insider.espn.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/sort/VORP/year/2018) **.**     [**EWA**](http://insider.espn.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/sort/VORPe/year/2018)   72   35.4   .619  23.2  11.6  **35.9**   1.8     15.2   8.6 .    **29.87 .**  718.5 .  23.9 .

"We saw how a supporting cast minus LeBron James did. You can’t just minus a star away.  Prime KD on the Suns might not be in the conference finals, but they’d actually be IN the playoffs despite a degree of dysfunction that is league infamous."
" &gt; Didn't you ignore the fact that Mark Price, Ehlo were injured in 89 and both actually missed games and minutes? Mark Price played with a groin injury in game 5 too. You also choose to ignore Draymond was suspended for a total of 1 game for accumulating too much flagrants and they had 2 more games to play up 3-2. You disingenuous fuck.  Huh? Why are you talking out of ur ass? When did I ignore it? Huh?   I never talked about Jordan’s finals. I purely said that final series is overrated by stans such as your self? You feel?   Draymond was suspended for no fucking reason lol, he was given a flagrant despite Lebron James stepping over him. Oh btw! Lebron only got a tech. That was a bullshit call. LOL  &gt; And I laugh at the fact you mention Andrew ""12 MPG"" Bogut. The warriors mostly ran a small ball ""death"" lineup without Bogut.  Oh right. So it’s pure coincidence that Bogut leaving inflated shit tons of points in the paint. Right? It’s only coincidence that Lebron/Irving was finishing at the rim with authority without their starting center with the highest impact in the league defensively.  LOL. This is the issue, Bogut didn’t play much with injuries, but because Bogut was out, you essentially had to give that minute away to below average bigs. THATS the problem."
"&gt; Such a weird hill to stand on acting like Wade had defenders glued to him. Just so far from the truth, especially the by 2014 when his athleticism was not where it used to be.  Well obviously in 2014 it was different, but that was 1 out of four years. His knee blew out that year.   Dude, you have been wrong this entire discussion.   &gt; I remember in 2012 when Wade got hurt in January and the Heat went like 8-1 in a stretch when Wade was hurt. He came back in the middle of it and the Heat lost 3 straight. There was may more spacing was with James Jones/Mike Miller filling those minutes. Because good 3 point shooting is more value than Wade's cutting if you're looking at spacing alone. And it's not close.  Lol what the fuck is this?   Who gives a shit? Looking at fucking 12 game sample is pure garbage. Come on man lol.   Lebron is that good of a player to keep afloat a team without wade, what is ur point?   Huh? If good shooting was more important Wade’s impact, how come every single impact metric has Wade as a high impact player during those years? What the fuck?   Btw? Why are you literally proving my point? If Lebron is doing better with niche players over fucking all nba player.. that’s not an issue with the all nba player, it’s an issue with Lebron’s portability.    Magic, Larry, MJ, Kobe, etc would be absolutely fine with Wade as their option. So what are you saying?   You are proving my point that Lebron needs niche players because of his lack of portability, hence lowering the impact of great players.   Why are you agreeing with me?"
"Lol at the same reference line. That team was never the same even in 2005 without Okur, Corliss Williamson, and Mike James even. LeBron should get more credit for that 07 series. That’s when I knew for sure he’d be one of the best ever."
"Harden is right that the MVP award is mostly about narrative, but the one MVP award narrative that is almost always unbeatable is this one: the team with the league's best record is being led by a guy who's never won the MVP before. When that happens that player *almost always* wins the MVP, going back to the 80s.   * Larry Bird in 1984 wins his first MVP after leading Boston to a league best 62 wins.  * Magic Johnson in 1987 wins his first MVP after leading the Lakers to a league best 65 wins.  * Charles Barkley in 1993 wins his first MVP after leading Phoenix to a league best 62 wins.  * David Robinson in 1995 wins his first MVP after leading San Antonio to a league best 62 wins.  * Shaquille O'neal in 2000 wins his first MVP after leading the Lakers to a league best 67 wins.  * Steve Nash in 2005 wins his first MVP after leading Phoenix to a league best 62 wins.  * Dirk Nowitzki in 2007 wins his first MVP after leading Dallas to a league best 67 wins.  * LeBron James in 2009 wins his first MVP after leading Cleveland to a league best 66 wins.  * Derrick Rose in 2011 wins his first MVP after leading Chicago to a league best 62 wins.  * Steph Curry in 2015 wins his first MVP after leading Golden State to a league best 67 wins.  * James Harden in 2018 wins his first MVP after leading Houston to a league best 65 wins.  * Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019 wins his first MVP after leading Milwaukee to a league best 60 wins.  This isn't the only narrative that matters, but it's incredibly rare for voters to not give it to the best player on the team with the best record if that player has never won it before. It might be unfair but being someone who's never won it gives you an edge over someone who has."
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."
What about the celtics who couldn't beat lebron james 5 v 1 in the ECF in 2018. Up 2-0 and then 3-2 and blew it and only scored 79 points on the cavs in game 7 who's second best player was george fucking hill who averaged 9 pts a game. Lets also not forget that the cavs had the worst defensive rating that year by a large margin. Or what about the 2010 finals where the celtics were up 3-2 against the lakers and scored a merely 67 points in game 6 and 79 in game 7. Kobe dropped more points in one game by himself then the celtics could in game 6
What does this mean for LeBron James legacy
"What Harden's saying about narratives isn't really true though. Giannis wasn't the runaway favorite for MVP going into the season. Hell in August 2018 [he was behind LeBron, AD, KD, and Harden.] (https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24311269/nba-most-valuable-player-predictions-espn-summer-forecast)      Harden and Giannis were co-favorites by mid-January.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2815896-nba-mvp-odds-2019-james-harden-vaults-up-to-co-favorite-with-giannis    And then late in February Giannis was ahead again:      &gt;It seems like it was only yesterday that the entire NBA community had essentially named James Harden the 2018-19 MVP. Harden averaged 43.6 points per game in January, and honestly hasn’t missed much of a beat this month (37.3 PPG).  &gt;In fact, just one month ago he was listed as a -500 favorite to win the award. The race looked all but over.      https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/nba-mvp-betting-odds-giannis-antetokounmpo-james-harden-february-25-2019"
Lebron James - All 14 Finals losses to Steph Curry
"AD also was never teammates with Lebron James. I'm sure that help with his offense.  Regarding defense, he'll have Javale and Dwight to help. I'm not expecting much, but they'd still help out a bit."
"Yep doesn’t mean I wanna make fuckin Lebron James president. I’m good on that. He’s an athlete, that’s all he’s done his whole life. What kind of platform you think he would have? What policies and legislation do you think lebron would focus on??"
"This question makes you think about your team from a weird perspective. I like it. Losing Dame would leave us with CJ at point with Ant as backup, so I think we're okay for point guards. Let's deepen our 3/4 positions by trading Dame to the Lakers for their best forward, Lebron James. Embrace it, Bron. Get weird with us."
Based on watching them play. Only someone who has never watched Kobe would think defenders didn't fear his drive. Kobe was guarded by guards smaller than him his whole career he always had the same height and size advantage James does. That size difference is not the reason Lebron is a more willing passer and Kobe isn't and it doesn't explain their respective playstyles.

"No No No No No James Harden is to Steph Curry, what Kevin Durant is to lebron"
I wouldn't put KD over lebron but as a scorer James Harden is better than Lebron in just that aspect. The guy has scored more points than Lebron in the 2010s decade and thats coming off the bench the first 3 years of that and just had a 36 ppg season.
"For the nephews:  LeBron is like Goku:  Born with all the necessary tools and talent; he is and has been a genetic freak, in comparison to his peers, for his entire life/career.  A powerhouse, 'formally' best player in the league, his size and skill have served to overwhelm most of his opponents. LeBron needed a Master Roshi (Wade) to show him how to win. Once he figured this out, there was no stopping him...unless you were a Western Conference team that could exploit certain skill deficiencies...   Kobe is more like Vegita: Iron-will, his desire to be the best was driven by 'his' Goku (Jordan).  Kobe, at times throughout his career, wasn't even the 'best'player in the league and that just drove him to greater heights professionally.  Kobe was/is entirely self-motivated; outside of Jordan, who he emulated, did not feel the need to join Pierce, Duncan, or any of his other chief rivals of 'his' era (for which James isn't really a part of).  There were no holes in Kobe game. None. His skill-set was 10 of 10. His deficiencies-- his pride (surprise) and his inability to relate himself to his teammates.    &amp;#x200B;  Different eras. Different players. Different positions.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm still taking Prime Kobe over Lebron. W/o hesitation."
There is no chance he had the same 40 time as a 28 YEAR OLD LEBRON JAMES!!!
"Giannis was stopped by a team effort closing on him and cutting off passing angles. Kawhi slowed him and Gasol stifled him at the rim along with Pascal helping but the team was able to quickly rotate to hurt passing lanes and then recover back out to the perimeter. The roster that the clippers have doesn't have the personnel to do that same thing as none of their bigs are as good on defense as Gasol (or even Ibaka). Additionally, AD has more range than Giannis with a jumper so that technique of stifling him at the rim isn't as good. In addition to this the Lakers have LeBron fucking James who is so much better than the next best Bucks player it's not even funny. Lots of defensive attention will be sent his way do that defensive style used on Giannis won't be as effective even if AD and Giannis played alike on O"
People put guys like James Harden and KD over Lebron as a scorer when LeBron is a top 5 scorer of all time. People think that you cant be a great scorer without great shooting because of the 3 point era.
"It's a spin on 'economic royalist' - an FDR term he crafted to put opposition against the New Deal in a bad light. And also that plane  built for 380 people, and been outfitted to carry like 80. Sounds wasteful to me. I know jet fuel consumption is measured in part with  # of passengers aboard, so in a sense it's more environmentally 'friendly' to be flying less people, but it would, um, be even friendlier if these dudes just flew first class whatever. And yeah yeah I know 'you can't expect LeBron James &amp; Steph Curry to get up at 5 am to get to their terminal.' But we really gotta start thinking how sports would look in a greener world cause what we doing now is for sure efficient, in a sense, but it's not sustainable. Electrical aircraft won't be commuter standard until the middle of this century. And we can't just be going about doing things like there isn't a paradigm altering event happening all about us. OK there you have it, bring on 'the downvotes' or whatever"
Family dad/Taco Tuesday Lebron really is the best Lebron. better than black mask Lebron. better than 3-1 comeback Lebron. better than final 25 points vs Pistons Lebron. better than Lebronto lebron. better than death dunk on Jason Terry Lebron. better than BLOCKED BY JAMES Lebron. better than banana boat Lebron. Better than LeFuckYou 3s Lebron. better than U Bum Lebron. better than...God damn there have been a lot of great Lebrons. but by far the best is Taco Tuesday corny ass dad Lebron. Never retire Taco Tuesday!
LeBron James with no regard for human life
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit (/r/nba) hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't meme him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never memed Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't meme him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into r/Nbamemes and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: memes aren't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""what it do baby"" or ""LeRest"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's meme game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second memable SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who memed Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have memed basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2018, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win meming looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like JR Smith The Most Forgetful Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Lmao imagine being LeBron fucking James and your family is embarrassed by your antics 😂  This taco Tuesday stuff is hilarious and wholesome af

"Hey man it’s all right, there’s no way your dad would have been as good as Lebron James the Father. It’s Lebron James."
"I would never let LeBron James live rent free in my head. Matter of fact, he can't even afford rent in my head."
"I'm not sure if Kobe took well to being yelled at either. Phil Jackson and MDA aren't exactly known for yelling at their players. LeBron James also seems to hate being yelled at.  Heck, according to Spurs fans, Kawhi left because he was too soft and didn't like being yelled at by Pop. LMA wanted out, and most FAs refuse to even give SA a real chance. And this is Pop, universally acknowledged as one of the GOAT coaches. Can you imagine getting yelled at by Thibs, who hasn't won anything?   It seems like people want to yell at others and want to see others yelled at. But very, very few people will put up with it themselves. Or to their children. Imagine watching your daughter get berated by some middle aged soccer coach, not too many people will support that."
"Check out the summary on the LeBron James page  &gt;In a few weeks, he will likely move to No. 2 on this list. If I had fewer reservations about his ball-dominance scaling (and his lack of spot-up shooting), he’d be a spot higher already, and I do think he has an outside argument as the highest-peak player in NBA history. **And, barring injury or premature retirement, James will likely retire with the most valuable career ever**. For now, he’s etched on the Mt. Rushmore of the sport at No. 3.  I know what I'm doing. Besides, I wasn't even making the argument that LeBron was the best, just pointing out that, yes, he does have an argument."

You are using career numbers.  It's a flawed way to look at it because Kareem played unitil he was 41.

The Lakers. They have LeBron James and Anthony Davis despite years of trashness and incompetent leadership.

Anybody that has watched basketball since 2010 knows LeBron James is the reason the Miami Heat lost the 2011 NBA Finals.

"Google translate:  Yesterday's Dallas Mavericskov media day only fueled the impatience of all Luka Doncic fans, who are already counting down the days until the start of the new season. And with the start of the new season, we may be following Luka Doncic in basketball shoes that will not be Nike's. According to local Texas newspaper Dallas News, Doncic had a two-year contract with Nick yesterday, which he signed while playing for Real Madrid. The 180-day period has also expired, during which the US giant could equalize any offer the Slovenian ace received. When asked about it as part of a media day, he confirmed that he was free and did not know how to do it in the future. This is definitely a good time for the contract to expire, as Doncic will have an excellent negotiating position. This summer, Jordan's star Zion Williamson signed a fitting contract with the Jordan brand. It will cost him $ 75 million over five years, and he won it before he even played in the NBA. In any case, Doncic should exceed that amount, since he is a much more proven player who won the prestigious Freshman of the Year award last year, but statistically he can stand alongside LeBron James in the first season. His popularity with fans around the world is also evident, with 4.24 million votes last year behind only Giannis Antetokounmp and James. Doncic also said: “This is very important for me, because as you know I have a lot of shoes. This arrangement is very important. First things first, the boot has to be good for my foot, I want to have as long a career as possible. And of course, appearance is also important. ”"

"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."
"OOC, how do you tell the difference between people like this and people that legit just disagree with him on certain issues? I ask because I'm fine with LeBron James *as a person.*   *As a person,* I don't have a single thing negative to say about him. With that said, I do disagree with *his stance* on certain issues. IME, I find it pretty rare that I can express these disagreements without getting people blasting me for hating LeBron for his success or hating him because I'm jealous or hating him because of his race or etc.  Obviously, those things pretty much shut down rational conversation so would be nice to know if there is something that I can do to avoid giving this impression or if it is just something people are automatically going to assume no matter what."
"Biomechanics. Guys need to learn how to land properly, even how to run properly for their body types. Then you have Luck, landing on a wet spot is just bad luck. Then you also have physical fitness. Guys who lift and stretch properly, eat right, and get plenty of rest. Look at how much lebron invests into his body. James Harden apparently spends 3-500k on his body ever year, not the 1 mil lebron does but close. And he rarely Dunks even though he can, because he wants to lessen the strain on his body.   Even in other sports, Look at Tom Brady he does yoga, eats well, and learned how to take a hit and fall. Some D-linemen have said when they hit him, and drive him into the ground he goes kind of limp and ""melts"" into the turf(he also doesnt get hit often but still)."

"I think we just fundamentally disagree on how much Steph curry had to do with the 3pt revolution. I believe he had impact, but it was happening regardless. The amount of threes per game increased incrementally every year since the rule changes in 2005. I’m not saying curry didn’t have any impact, that wouldn’t  be true,  but it’s very overstated. What set the warriors apart from every roster in the NBA in 2016 was Their ability to go small and not lose any defensive value.  Yes, Curry had a 1 year regular season peak even higher than LeBron James, but when you look at multi-year peaks he’s, imo, below KD and on par with Harden. Curry is a bit better in the post season than harden however.  If you value Regular season peak, then Harden has to be in consideration for top 10 as well.   Curry can get top 10 if he has 9 ALL- NBA selections and wins another championship with Finals MVP. He then would have carried his team to two championships (2015,2020?) and that would be on par with Hakeem and Kobe. KD can challenge for top 10 too. He needs to win a ring with Brooklyn though."
Did you take into account that Mike Scott could have been a little drunk himself?

"&gt;The Lakers have Anthony Davis who is arguably a top-3 off-ball defender and rim protector,  Agree  &gt; LeBron James who is average to below average on-ball at this stage in his career but still almost as sharp as ever when it comes to his off-ball reads and switchability.   Agree  &gt;Jared dudley is also a really good off-ball defender and a god at taking smart charges  You're losing me. &gt;  &gt;Lakers also have solid to strong perimeter defenders in Alex Caruso, Avery Bradley and KCP.  Is it 2015? You lost me, how can you call someone who played 25 garbage games a good defender?"

"Exactly what i'm trying to say in my last paragraph. It was easy to predict, at the beginning of the last season, that LeBron James will not make playoffs? Foh"
"&gt;those guys were at some point considered undeniably the best in their era  Huh? Hakeem played in the middle of the Jordan Era. There was never a time where he would have undeniably been considered the best of his era. Same goes for Duncan who played with Kobe/Shaq and had LeBron in the league when he was only 28.  Based on your list, I don't think it's fair at all to say one has to have been the best in their era to be considered top 10. Especially when Steph's competition for that title was Lebron James who has been off and on, considered a better player than MJ(The actual Goat)."

"There are different parts of offense, and the lineup has 5 players. Yes James Harden is a better scorer than Klay, but Klay doesn't need a lot of touches, that's an important characteristic for a team with lots of talented players.  Its not so simple as well Harden is a top 3 player and Klay is a top 20 player so that must mean that Harden would be better on this team than Klay.  Klay could guard Mills on Australia so Kawhi could guard Ben Simmons.  The team already has creators with Steph and Lebron. They need finishers and knock down shooters/defenders."
KD was hitting these shots in front of Lebron James. I’m sure that felt a million times better then hitting them on street ballers.
"""The five-man team on which LeBron James and Anthony Davis played together so thoroughly dominated the second day of Los Angeles Lakers training camp Sunday that James was pulled to rest before the day's scrimmages were over."""
"Just stop LeBron James and Anthony Davis bro, it's that fucking easy"
"And he wasnt really even that bad.  There’s a reason teams dont target Lebron James on defense. He still has it if needed and they dont want him engaged in that area, really."
"OK. I'm black but this argument is pure shit. Race has fuck all to do with it. There's more to life than fucking race and I'm so tired of everything being seen through one perspective all the damn time. Every league in the world wants friendly, approachable icons. Every fucking face of the NBA other than maybe Larry Bird has been a black guy so you got have some serious tunnel vision to see this as a race issue. We wanted a friendlier league and we got a friendlier league. We don't have guys fighting on the court anymore, we don't have the Rons Artest of the world beating up fans anymore... If not wanting that is what you call racism then you have a twisted and incredibly racist opinion of what black culture is. The league we have today couldn't exist in the gangsta age with selfless teams like Golden State and a selfless Icon in LeBron James. It has nothing to do with them being black, they're both incredibly politically active and they will speak their minds openly about black issues with the full support of the league. Maybe we just don't want a selfish, thuggish, egotistical league... that has nothing to do with race."
People on this subreddit hate LeBron James
"Most teams try to keep it simple (because NBA players aren't geniuses). They probably have 2 to 3 variations of 5 basic plays which they do over and over again. It's the defense which is more complex most of the time. Even in the link you posted, Mike Brown is quoted as saying their plays are unscripted and the players are taught general principles, not moves specified to the dot.  If plays are so complex, only players like Lebron James would be able to remember them, and everyone else would run around the court like fools not knowing what to do. That's why coaches simplify their systems. Teach the players 5 basic plays, add a couple of variations, and that's it. They only pull complex plays during ATOs."
Dude are you looking for LeBron James highlights or the full games
Kinda feel like Kawhi willed his team like legit 3 months ago....lebron did it once (awesome but not every title was lebron willing a team lol)    Been tons of players who dominated as much as bron and win (Russell wilt kareem shaq jordan Duncan bird magic)    Russell and Kareems basketball resume is infinitely better than lebron james' hahahaha
"So you want to pack the paint well enough to defend Lebron James and Anthony Davis, but also be spread out enough to close out hard and fast enough on Danny Green? Do these defenders have fiber optic ligaments that allow for that kind of movement?  You’re also pretending like Lebron can’t make things happen from 3 himself.   Not to mention double teaming AD didn’t work all that well 2 years ago in New Orleans.   They’re not some unstoppable offensive force but stopping them is also not as easy as you seem to think."
"You must watch a lot of ESPN...  Spo is regarded as one of the best coaches in the league for a reason.  What he is able to do with his roster is special. He always finds the best way to use his players.  His locker room is always drama free. Even during the Heatles era.  His adjustments game to game and more importantly, during the game, are smart.   He is a defense first coach, always coaching up his guys to work within the system.  He is also able to turn players who are subpar into something better.  He always says the right thing to his players and to the media.  Pat fucking Riley gave this guy the keys, what else is there to be said?  The guy is a class act and a top level basketball mind.  He is also the ONLY coach to survive LeBron James for 4 years. That says a lot."
And now the moron has LeBron James and Anthony Davis
"Zions got like 3% chance at this exact moment.   Will rise or fall dramatically this year, but at this second, he has probably the most of anybody alive not named LeBron James or MJ.  GOAT has to come out the gates a fucking monster. Basically all second year players outside of Luka (~0.8%) and all third+ year players except LeBron, are out."
"Stockton wasn't that good of a passer. He just made a lot of easy passes. #2 should be LeBron James or Chris Paul  Scottie was a better perimeter defender than MJ, runner up should be Kawhi Leonard"
"That guy is a Celtics troll. He carefully clipped one quote from [an article in Sports Illustrated on Rich Paul](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-klutch-sports-group-lakers-pelicans-lebron-james-anthony-davis) where Paul was warning what would happen if the Celtics traded for him. He neglected a couple choice quotes from that article about how he felt about the Lakers though (and of course he didn't link to the article, because anyone reading it would see how full of shit he is). Quotes like this one:  &gt; “See, everybody wants to fabricate the facts when it’s me,” Paul says. “That’s just like saying, ‘No, A-Rod, don’t marry J-Lo. Are you out of your f---in’ mind, man?’ This is Jennifer Lopez! I mean, who would you rather me marry? **The Lakers are Jennifer Lopez.** You don’t want me to date Jennifer Lopez? Give me a reason I shouldn’t date J-Lo!”"
"Hey, that's from [the same article where Rich Paul said this:](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-klutch-sports-group-lakers-pelicans-lebron-james-anthony-davis)  &gt; ""My thing is: Take LeBron off the Lakers. Are the Lakers not a great destination for an arguably top-two player that went to Kentucky and won a national championship, signed with Nike? For a team that’s had centers from George Mikan to Wilt Chamberlain to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Shaq?""  &gt; “So now, when you add LeBron, that’s what? The cherry on top. LeBron’s 34 years old. Anthony Davis is 26. So when LeBron’s done playing, the Anthony Davis trade is still rolling. What better place to do it than L.A.?""  Nice attempt at spin though, Celtics fan 😂"

"I also love that when Simmons set out to analyze/trash Kobe, his idol [Bill Russell had a soft spot for Kobe](https://grantland.com/features/the-kobe-question/). As did Bill Walton.  &gt; So when Russell mentioned a current star devouring his book and stealing that specific concept — then thanking Russell for the help — naturally, I expected the player to be LeBron James, Chris Paul, Steve Nash, maybe even Kevin Durant. Nope.  &gt; Kobe Bryant.  &gt; “Really?” I said *incredulously*.  &gt; And that’s how I learned that basketball’s greatest teammate ever held *something of a soft spot for Kobe,* someone who’s battled more coworkers over the years than Chevy Chase. *Russell enjoys his competitiveness, loves his work ethic, appreciates his respect for history, and over anything else, loves how he borrowed that scouting idea*. No other player ever mentioned it to him. Just Kobe. *Which didn’t make sense to me.*   And Bill Walton arguing with Simmons  &gt; interview Bill Walton for my NBA book and we ended up arguing (in a good-natured way) about Kobe right after he won the 2009 title. My book argued that success hinged on “The Secret” of basketball — that it wasn’t actually about talent, but how you sacrificed your game and meshed with teammates. Walton maintained it was more like a “choice,” saying it was every player’s responsibility to find his own destiny. And that path was going to be different for every player. Walton believed that I didn’t like watching Kobe that much because he didn’t play basketball the way I liked to see basketball played. *That was my choice*, just like it was Kobe’s choice to play that way.   It's fun to see Simmons the hyper celtics fan and Kobe hater see each of his idols praising Kobe..."
I know you’re probably talking about LeBron but it makes me laugh to think you’re just talking about some dude named James
"1. LeBron James - seems like a rising star who could take the next step this year if he can stay in the weight room and get more athletic  2. Steph Curry - a smaller player who has shown the ability to make tough shots, he just needs to stay healthy to maybe put it all together  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo - with his length comes potential shot blocking and dunking ability but needs to learn to shoot if he ever wants a chance in this league  4. James Harden - has shown the tools to be a capable scorer but needs to shoot more 3s to add depth to his game  5. Alex Caruso - just joking, the presumptive MVP has more hype than ever going into a season. Prepare to see CarusGod highlights nightly"
"Bro LeBron is a real good guy outside of basketball, but I’m not a fan of his crying on the court and the narratives he writes.   It’s like James Harden. I’m sure he’s a nice guy, but his flopping is ridiculous. It makes it hard for me to want to watch him."
Tyler Johnson. James Johnson. Dion waiters. Whiteside. Such bad contracts. Can’t blame lebron leaving or bosh being forced to retire for this shit show.

Ehh, not my problem  Lebron James is actually really popular in China and his voice will be heard my hundreds of millions in China if he decided to speak up on this. Same goes with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kobe Bryant, etc."
LeBron James when he came into the league out of HS. Kind of confusing because you assume the person he's talking about is still 19
It's honestly confusing how he couldn't overcome that wet floor. Lebron James wouldn't have slipped there.
"That's the title of the article, but it's misleading.    Here's what the article really says if the tweet had come from Lebron or Steph  &gt;The NBA has tried both to grovel and stand up for free speech, trending toward the latter since league president Adam Silver entered the fray. Here’s guessing that if the offending tweet had been sent by LeBron James or Steph Curry, the league would have been even quicker to figure out which side it’s on(also doubtful is that the Chinese government would be relishing the fight quite so much)."

"Here is where we disagree, I think this is a human rights issue. Granted it is caused by politicians, so people will justify censorship based on ""no politics"" but than where do we stop?  Do you think that people like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Bill Russell should have been silenced as well when they fought for the rights of African Americans in US.   Or in modern times people like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Enes Kaner, when they spoke out against human rights violations and oppressive regimes of Trump and Erdogan?"

"LeBron James' 4 year averages against the Warriors (a great defensive team) in the finals is better than Kawhi's averages for his ""historic"" playoff run last year. LeBron literally averaged like 33/10/9 over his 4 finals against the Warriors, on over 60% TS."
"I think they’d have to be a LeBron/Greg Oden/Anthony Davis type phenom ever since they were in high school.  For my money, I think the next great player that’ll will have us wondering if they’re the greatest of all time by the time they retire  is a guy who can blend LeBron’s passing and athletic ability, with the shooting and creation of a James Harden or a Kobe Bryant.   And maybe he’s not as sheer monstrously athletic as somebody like LeBron, nor as good of a shooter as James Harden, but being in the ball-park of either in respective skills is an all-time level scorer, passer and defender."
"That doesn’t make any sense, of course it’s consequential.   They spoke out about issues that are important to them and not ones that aren’t as important to them. Yeah, Lebron James is going to talk about racism when somebody sprayed racist graffiti on his house and he’s worried his son might get shot by the police.   The fact that a lot of their fans agree with them is irrelevant when calling into question their personal integrity. You have no idea if it’s cost them any money or if that was a factor in their decision making.  They talk about American values as they pertain to America. Have they ever commented on Palestine? Catalonia? Des Gillet Jaunes? Biafra?   How often do you comment on those things? I bet it’s a loss less than Hong Kong because they’re less important to you."
"So they are only allowed to speak up on important issues if it will cost them money?   Personally, I think it's important to speak up on issues you can actually affect (since ya know...that's the whole point). LeBron James isn't going to have any impact on China's HK policy and I doubt he's well informed enough to speak meaningfully about it. He can have an impact on domestic issues that he understands first hand and can speak/act on though."
"We got guys over there. You know LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyrie irving and so on. Let's get them back first because I'm not sure if Trump would care to get them out and at the same time I don't want him taking credit if they do get out."

And their tiny influence on society is nothing compared to the influence China have on their income. Even LeBron James can't say shit like this. Nike will pull out all his endorsement deals if pressured by China. Look at Dolce and Gabanna lol.
"Ben Simmons - one of the potentially generational players for his age who is so notoriously terrible at shooting that he will do pretty much anything to avoid taking a shot. He just doesn’t shoot and has never made a 3 point shot in his entire NBA career despite being either elite or almost elite at just about every other aspect of his game. He’s touted as the next LeBron James by some. To put it into context he was the #1 draft pick when he entered the league, won Rookie of the Year in his first playing season and was an NBA All-Star in his second season despite not being able to shoot the ball - that’s how strong the rest of his game is.. it’s pretty well unheard of these days.  It’s been the single biggest flaw in his game and he just nailed his first 3 pointer on an NBA court (despite being an exhibition game against a Chinese team)."
Lebron James has faced less all nba 1st and all nba 2nd team players in his road to be finals streak then Damian lillards last playoff run.

"Rose definitely doesn’t need to play significant minutes. These aren’t just normal players, these are the best of the best and they consistently play 35+ minutes a night in the playoffs.  There are 48*5 (240) minutes in a game. In the 2018-19 playoffs these were their mpg averages: Russell Westbrook 39.4 Steph Curry 38.5 James Harden 38.5 Kevin Durant 36.8 Giannis Antetokounmpo 34.3  That’s a total of 187.5 minutes. That leaves 52.5 minutes for Lebron and Rose to split. In the 2017-18 playoffs Lebron averaged 41.9 minutes a game. Take that away and all you need from Rose is 10.6 minutes a game"
Ben Simmons has often been hyped as being one of the greatest basketball prodigies of his generation with some even claiming he could be the next Lebron James. But there’s always been one big issue: he can’t shoot. He has never been able to consistently shoot jump shots and never even made a single 3 point shot until this preseason game tonight. It’s become something of a meme. Also it happened against a Chinese basketball team so that adds to it given the current drama surrounding the NBA and the ChiComs

Ask Jeremy Lin to speak on it....better yet ask Donald Trump. It's his fucking job not Lebron James.
"If China seized LeBron James in China after he said something to the effect of supporting Morey’s tweet, what would the USA do?   Honest question. What would *specifically* Trump do? Dude would sell out James in a heartbeat if China offered him some small political concession (like help in an upcoming election?) or on the flip side, after he got in trouble for selling out to China, he might swing the other direction and launch a first strike against Chinese forces....  I know almost any other president we’ve ever had wouldn’t let that shit stand, but today? I really have no idea."
"I'd love to see someone edit it and attach LeBron James saying ""What the fuck, how did he just do that"""
"Why do people in this sub feel like if anyone in the NBA stands up for Hong Kong that they’ll change anything? They won’t. And if you’re wondering why they don’t say anything about this but will talk about police brutality, it’s because this is their country they have a platform here. Literally the only thing affected by NBA personnel speaking about this is going to be their money. Yes, I understand the atrocities happening in China, yes I wish the world was perfect but it isn’t and neither you nor I nor Lebron fucking James is going to change that. Let those people fight for their freedoms, we don’t need to get involved"

tbf they just stole Google's IP. They can't really steal Lebron James.
Lebron talks about the NCAA because in a couple years it could affect his firstborn son. He said he talks about police brutality because his children could be in the same situation as some of those victims. He tweeted to Trump because he had insulted our black American athletes. And he responded to the Fox News lady because she literally called him out by his government name and said “Lebron James shut up and dribble”   Lebron has a track record of speaking out about issues that he has direct firsthand knowledge on and directly impact him or his community. I’ve never heard him talking about the Dakota Access pipeline protests or whatever.
Lebron James is physically in China right now what exactly are you expecting him to say? He can’t even get on his Twitter if he wanted to tweet

"You got me to watch the play again, and that was actually really stupid of Hayward to do. You see kyrie waiting in the backcourt, ready to pop out, cause it’s obviously part of a play.

All good leaders have done it before... lebron James, michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant...."
"That would be the dumbest move the Chinese government could make in this situation. Detaining a foreign US sports team, including Lebron James one of the biggest athletes on earth, over WORDS of someone else in a different part of the organization may start a serious military crisis."

"&gt;Compare that to 25 NHL franchises in 101 seasons, and the NBA has a different champion slightly more frequently.   Hey man, I just wanted to touch on this also. When the NHL was founded in 1917, 101 years ago, there where 4 teams. Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, Ottawa Senators and Quebec Bulldogs. In 1942, the NHL consisted of 6 teams. It wasn't until 1967 that the NHL expanded to more than 6 teams.   &gt;and the NBA has a different champion slightly more frequently.   I think for us to really compare, we should look at them through a little more modern times. I don't have time, I'll look into it later, but I believe that the NHL has had more different champions than the NBA has. I don't think it's even close.  I think objectively you can see that the NHL has more parity than the NBA. For a lot of different reasons. Roster size being a big one. I maintain that you will never have parity if you have Lebron James and Demar Derozen making the same money per year."

"It isn't just 2 Kembas, it's 2 Kembas plus 10 decent to good players. LeBron on the floor there are still 4 other guys that will be outmatched. LeBron can't cover all of that. LeBron with the Lakers last year were a good team, but not really competitive for a championship. You'd have to subtract almost all of the other talent from that team for the scenario you're suggesting. Absolutely a 2 Kemba plus decent role players is going to beat a 1 LeBron with scrubs team.      &gt; The best thing for parity would be a salary cap, and no max contracts. That would increase parity.         You say that, but you haven't actually supported your position. Restating your position doesn't make it any more true.      &gt; The point is, right now, with max salaries you are going to have Lebron James and Demar Derozen making similar money. I think we all know what the outcome there is.         Except for the Warriors, and even with the Warriors, considering they lost in the Finals twice, what makes you think there isn't parity now? New teams challenge for the title every year. The ones that are bad are typically bad because of mismanagement, not because of salary cap/contract issues."
"&gt;That team would have the money to spend on non-scrubs to make a better overall team.  Would they be a better over all team though? Would having two Kembas be better than one lebron? I don't know about that.   &gt;But what you're really pointing out is that ""paying people what they are worth"" is really just not feasible with a salary cap.  I disagree. In regards to parity, having no salary cap would be a bad thing. The best thing for parity would be a salary cap, and no max contracts. That would increase parity.   The point is, right now, with max salaries you are going to have Lebron James and Demar Derozen making similar money. I think we all know what the outcome there is."
There's literally an example of a Chinese commentator calling LeBron James and ape and none of us or the NBA did anything about it so his point is literally wrong anyways.
LeBron james litterary called the president a Bum
Where the fuck is LeBron James? Mr. morally righteous is ghosting when it matters most.
"I don't agree with the Chinese companies' heavy-handed response to the tweet, but just as it's Morey's right to tweet, it's their right to stop doing business with the NBA because of the tweet. Not a good look for sure, but Morey's right to free speech does not extend to China.   Also, from a strictly business perspective, the Chinese market is essentially a client or business partner to the NBA. If you made a tweet criticizing the business practices of one of your clients from your personal Twitter account, is it unreasonable to expect backlash from the client or your boss? Or if Lebron James tweeted something like ""Fight for ethical manufacturing. Stand with ADIDAS."", how would Nike react?"
"Not even close to a significant cost. The President can’t affect NBA profit margins and 30% of the country isn’t trying to silence NBA players for tweets. LeBron James called the sitting President of the United States a bum over Twitter and there were zero repercussions.   Now that there are *actual repercussions* to Morey’s tweet, Steve Kerr’s gonna call an authoritarian dictatorship threatening democracy a “complex situation.” Give me a fucking break. I don’t believe anybody who only speaks out when it’s convenient for them is any sort of honest activist. I think they’re a coward."
He is gonna be NBA MVP runner up again isnt he? James Harden being MVP or runnerup  is going to be the new LeBron making it to the finals.
"He'd need to up his defense a little bit too, but yes. I'm arguing Ben Simmons, if he could shoot at an elite 41% of 8 jumpers a game, would be better than LeBron James.  &amp;#x200B;  Assuming he doesn't regress he's already statistically better at rebounding and passing than Bron is. We're forgetting how great an outside jumper opens up someones game and how guys literally step away from Ben Simmons like its a pickup game at the park."
"He absolutely should, but I don’t know if he will.  However, he’s LeBron James. He doesn’t need China and Nike is in no position to tell him otherwise.  It’s his move as the face of a league"
"I have never been a fan of Lebron James, but if he comes out with a hardline stance I'll fuckin buy in.   He won't ever catch Mike in terms of rings, but going strong on an issue like this can make him this generation of sports' Ali."
If lebron james couldn’t get rid of spo the jimmy butler definitely cant.
"Lebron James: “I support Kaepernick”  US Media Outlet: “Shut up and dribble”  Adam Silver: “I think in this day and age, you really do have to stand for something”  —————  Daryl Morey: “Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong”  China: “Shut up and dribble”  Adam Silver: “Extremely disappointed in Morey’s inappropriate statement. No doubt he’s severely hurt the feelings of China fans”"
"China’s outrage against the National Basketball Association escalated as citizens returned from a week-long holiday, transforming what was supposed to be a high-profile promotional week for the league in one of its biggest markets into a public-relations disaster.  Celebrities and fans joined the backlash by announcing they would skip the exhibition games this week in China where top stars like LeBron James were scheduled to play, while an NBA charity event at a Shanghai primary school was canceled on Tuesday.  The NBA is under pressure after Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted an image of a slogan supporting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters. While the message was quickly deleted, it sparked fury from supporters of the communist government, casting a shadow on one of China’s favorite teams.  How the NBA Got Into a No-Win Situation in China  The anger broadened beyond the Rockets to the entire league after Commissioner Adam Silver tried to defend Morey.  Acknowledging the economic impact from the tweet, he told Kyodo News in Japan that as a “values-based organization, I want to make it clear that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression.”  The comment added fuel to the flames after Chinese sponsors including sportswear maker Li Ning Co. suspended ties with the Rockets and broadcasters stopped airing their games. Sports forum Hupu said it has blocked all Rockets-related news, streaming and comments.  Big Show The backlash threatens what is supposed to be the NBA’s annual big show of commitment to China, its most important market outside the U.S., in the form of two pre-season games featuring different top teams every year. This year, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets are on the featured bill.  Through decades of painstaking deal-making, the NBA created a multibillion-dollar opportunity in the country, where 800 million people now watch its programming on various platforms every year. The league has seen double-digit growth in China annually since 2008.  NBA China Woes Put Billions of Dollars, Decades’ Work at Risk  Wu Jinyan, who became popular for her leading role in the costume drama “Story of Yanxi Palace,” was one of the celebrities advocating a boycott of the NBA’s events this week.  “It is every Chinese citizen’s undeniable responsibility and duty to resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Wu wrote on social-media platform Weibo. The actress wrote that she “opposes any comments or activities attempting to separate the country.”  Others declining to attend the events included actors Bai Jingting, Li Yifeng and Zhou Yiwei and singer Zheng Yunlong.  ‘One China’ The NBA is the latest international business feeling the heat from the standoff between pro-democracy demonstrators and Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed authorities that has escalated since June. For many Chinese, any support of the protesters is seen as a challenge to the nation’s sovereignty over its territory.  “The love and feelings of Chinese sons and daughters have been rooted in this wide land for thousands of years,” said Fan Chengcheng, the 19-year-old rapper who is also the younger brother of one of China’s most well-known actresses, Fan Bingbing.  Stressing on his official Weibo account that he firmly advocates the “one China” principle, he wrote, “We will not allow anyone to trample on this or tear this apart.”  In Hong Kong, meanwhile, some protest supporters see the NBA controversy as an opportunity to promote the cause. In discussions on LIHKG, a popular forum among protesters, some are proposing to wear Rockets gear together with gas masks at demonstrations."
"I love how Lebron “more than an athlete” James still hasn’t said a word. Also now it’s easy to see that all that pandering to left wig cunts is just for show. When actual issues come in front of these guys, they don’t want to talk about it"
"I had some ass Laker fan telling me Warriors fans are spoiled; talk about being a hypocrite.  Just ignoring their whole history of winning, the team legit had no one respectable when Lebron came. Their owner is a joke, who told the great Jerry West to fuck off. Their decision are partly made by the Rambii morons. One year later, their President just quit out of nowhere without telling anyone, and was running the Lakers like a side hustle. Now, they're stuck with Pelinka who's done an okay job.  Despite all this BS turmoil, Lebron James - the best player in the world - wanted to come to them. They legit got bailed out from another 5 years of shitty-ness.   At least our dominance was due to having a really good organization and forward thinking - we drafted all of our guys, then landed KD because we were an attractive destination with great team culture. We had a great coach, great GM, great president. Lakers had none of that and still lucked into 2 top 10 players."
LeBron James winning us a championship
"It will literally take Lebron James saying something for anything to happen. If Kerr can't sack up, then it's up to the King."
"I don’t even think you have to do that. Players are a lot smarter and savior than we give them credit for. But, listen, something has been bugging me about the social media reaction was as fans are having, giving the players grief for not standing up when they’ve stood up in the past.  When they’ve stood up in the past it has been for issues that are very fucking personal and real to them. Lebron James is a black man born in America. I expect him to know more, and feel more, about that experience and how it shapes him as a man, father, son, and teammate than I would the political realty in China.   I reject the horrors that the Chinese government is inflicting on its own people as I similarly reject the horrors the American government inflicts on other countries where the leaders do not align with our market/strategic interests as well as the horrors inflicted on the underpaid undocumented workers we rely on as a society to enrich our wealth, just as we have done with people of color for the entirety of our history as a country.  But I cannot condemn anyone for when, where, and how they choose to use their platform. The freedom of speech must extend to silence as well, even when we may wish they shared our outrage. We do not get to choose what others find abhorrent or are educated on, nor can we reflexively retreat to the cynicism of assuming they are silent to protect their earnings."
"Even if china officially censors the NBA, Chinese fans will still be able to watch it albeit illegally like many of us do. They have VPNs like the rest of us.  My problem with the NBA is that they supported LeBron James and other high profile players when they bash the US president. They had their backs when media told them to shut up and dribble.  And now they are doing that exact thing to Morey, telling him to shut up and GM.   I also have a feeling that if this was happening to people of their descent then NBA players would speak out but because Hong Kongers are not their race nor countrymen then they don’t care. I’m sad to see that no one else will stand up for my people."
“Chinese autocrats buy shoes too”.  -LeBron James
“Chinese autocrats buy shoes too.”  -LeBron James
"Nope.  But hey, make sure to tune in to watch LeBron James and the Lakers play the Brooklyn Alibabas live from China! Make sure and tell everyone how woke you are in the game thread while Pooh laughs at all of us because an actual sacrifice and boycott would be too hard for anyone."
[LeBron James does not care about Asian people.](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/kanye-west-comment-on-bush1.jpg)
So professional basketball LeBron James should be protesting every injustice in the world? Wouldn't it make more sense to begin with his own country's crimes (the same country that happens to be by far the most powerful in the world). Especially as his tax dollars are directly contributing to his country's crimes.
Lebron James has announced his retirement from the NBA
&gt; Donald Trump would not go to war over LeBron. Just saying.  if you think Ferguson was bad a non-response to the death of Lebron James in China would bring many cities burning.
I wonder why woke political dynamo Lebron James hasn’t spoken up to show support to morey and in support of democracy?
"kawhi was 16 in 2007, the same year the spurs adopted the ""squeeze every drive, force guys to make outside shots"" defensive strategy in the finals against LBJ's cavs. that defensive strategy forced LBJ to learn to shoot from 28' at an elite level. it's become the base defense against any elite scorer who isn't elite from outside. guys like giannis and simmons have Pop to thank for that.  kawhi was just part of that same defense 7 years later and offensively he was just nowhere close to a first option which is why he put up 18/6/2.   defensively, he wasn't stopping shit by himself, the whole spurs defense was still collapsing on james every time he penetrated. wade was a shitty outside shooter, bosh had just added the 3-ball to his game and the heat's spacing was horrible. they were right at the league average in 3p makes, attempts and percentage.  if you put kawhi in front of lebron and clear the court, he's getting points and vice versa. NBA defense has always been a team effort and the spurs offense was a team effort too. kawhi was not an impact player on either end at that point of his career and the best defensive player is never gonna be worth a top 25 offensive player. perfect defense doesn't even hinder perfect offense.  wade being past his prime and perma-injured but still eating up minutes on a team that needed more was all it took for that heat team to be unable to topple the spurs.  it's why the league became a 3pt shooting league because that spurs ""squeeze the paint"" defense was impossible to beat otherwise. it's what drove lebron to create the sharpshooting teams in cleveland which set all types of playoff records.  kawhi was mediocre on offense, part of a great defensive scheme that had hair on its nuts before he did and his team won. he won finals MVP because they weren't giving it to lebron and nobody else had stats good enough  but he didn't stop lebron, he hindered lebron the 15-20% of the possessions he guarded him.   NONE of that screams ""best player on either team"""
"Really hope Trey and Matt write this into the season. They've been known to do that before on a few days notice when the news presents the opportunity. This is just too perfect though. They called this a week ahead of time, even having James Harden and LeBron in the episode."
I don't know why but the first thing that popped into my head was Josh Smith + Jose Calderon.  Putting Calderon's brain into Josh Smith's head would basically make him LeBron James with a three-point shot.
This is basically Miami Heat Lebron James
"Okay, let us get away from broad statements. Let's look at individuals.   James Harden, Steph Curry and LeBron all look like massive hypocrites.  I guess they will just shut up and dribble if China says so."
"Great article I'd advise you guys to read.  To all those people saying ""what good would Lebron, Curry, etc speaking out do?"" This explains it very well in my opinion.  That's not to say it's an easy call for someone like Lebron to make, he has a lot to lose and I'm sure Nike would exert a lot of pressure to stop it, but it shows the decision making behind China reacting so extremely to one tweet.  &gt; No, what they fear is a parade of NBA declarations. More general managers. Teams. Famous figures. Steve Kerr or Gregg Popovich pregame press conferences. And, eventually, perhaps even LeBron James himself, or others like him.  &gt; If the star players start talking about this, tweeting about this, writing things on their shoes about this, well, that’s what can break through the censorship and reach the people. That's what might change minds. Maybe."
Lmao when James Harden and LeBron board the plane with Randy I fucking lost it
michael jordan and lebron james
"Eh the actual definition is debatable. Imo this situation falls under censorship and limits his freedom of speech.  It’s also a double standard. Why is it fair for say, LeBron James to give his opinion on social issues he deems important, but Morey isn’t? It’s a double standard and hypocritical.   Your entire argument is that a multi billion dollar company’s right to money is more important than a country’s citizens right to share their political opinions against oppression. If you can’t see why that is morally wrong then there’s nothing I can really do for you."
"They beat the Mavs who are looking like a playoffs team, they beat the Jazz who ARE a playoff team, they beat the Spurs who ARE a playoff team. That's 3 playoff teams beaten.  I feel like casual fans tunnel too hard into the Clippers loss. Clippers are a pre-existing team with many of the same players and the same coaching staff, no shit they're going to be better opening night.  Lakers are picking up these wins despite their offense being a mess. Their defense has been really impressive. And you can't tell me a Lebron James and Anthony Davis team is gonna have such a sputtering offense by the end of the season.  Lakers definitely look like contenders, but for sure they don't look like far and away the best in the league. Their offense is holding them back."
"I’ve been watching basketball since the late 70s. Here’s my list of generational talents. Julius Erving, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson and LeBron James.  Obviously this is a very subjective topic but I feel each one of these players skills revolutionized the game and changed the way we view the game."
RJ Barrett is not LeBron James
"Kobe and Duncan are decent examples, but an even better one to look at is Shaq.   Generational talents often transcend the sport they’re in most of the time. Once you go far back enough in time it changes a bit, but if you were to walk up to a random person (not a basketball fan) on the street, you’d be hard pressed to find someone who doesn’t know who Michael Jordan is, who Lebron James is, Kobe, Shaq, Magic, etc."
"There’s only very few true generational talents   And for Wade’s era, I believe Lebron James is the generational talent"
"I feel like people are underselling what “generational” is supposed to mean.     It means players that you will look back on in 50 years and easily be able to see the mark they left on the NBA.     LeBron James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant are the only people that fit this criteria currently.     Players such as Harden, Giannis, Kawhi, Davis, Westbrook, those guys are just superstars.      Even in the past you had Kobe and Duncan as generational, but guys like Wade, Dirk, CP3 were just superstars.      There’s a whole lot of MVP’s, championships, and FVMP’s in the non-generational group.     I think Doncic would be very lucky to join the ranks of the superstars above, but the people expecting him to be sitting alongside LeBron and Kobe are taking it too far."

"1985: Jordan’s 38-44 Bulls against a 59 win Bucks team that had Terry Cummings and Sidney Moncrief. Jordan averaged 29.3/5.8/8.5 with 2.8 steals and a block for the series.   1986: Jordan misses nearly the entire season with a broken foot. Bulls finish 30-52 and somehow make the playoffs where they play one of the greatest teams in NBA history, the 67 win Celtics. Jordan averaged 43.7/6.3/5.7 with 2.3 steals and 1.3 blocks  1987: Jordan’s 40-42 Bulls against 59 win defending Champion Celtics. Jordan averaged 35.7/7/6 with 2 steals and 2.3 blocks.   You mean Jordan’s first 3 years in the league? Did you see those Bulls teams? They were garbage. They were just as bad if not worse than any crap team LeBron James ever played on. And this was the East in the 80’s, not the cupcake East LeBron got to play in.   Jordan got, as you put it “gangbanged” by one of the best dynasties in NBA history in the Celtics and a Pistons team that went to 5 straight CF, 3 straight NBA Finals and won back to back championships from 87-91. No shame in that. Those teams were better. Jordan couldn’t beat those teams 1 on 5. Jordan never lost to a team that he was better than. Can LeBron say the same??   I’ll give credit to Jordan. He stayed on the Bulls and kept building the team. Every year, he chipped away at these teams. Once he finally got over the top, he didn’t look back. He didn’t bounce from team to team chasing rings and building super teams in order to do it."
32 is pretty old.... do you think everybody is LeBron James just killing it in their age 35 season?
Still think Lebron is 1.  James Harden over Giannis probably.
Rajon Rondo hit a game winner in 2018 against the Celtics while playing for the Lebron James led Los Angeles  Lakers
Trae averaged 34/6/9 on 66% TS before he had to leave a game prematurely which has affected his statline. He averaged 24/9 in the last 30 odd games of his rookie season. It's like arguing whether one team are morons for drafting Steph Curry instead of LeBron James. Somehow I think both teams are/will be happy with their guys.
"Applying that same logic, if Luka becomes all world on defense with his current offense, then he'll basically be LeBron James.  And I'm taking LeBron 10/10 over anyone besides MJ."
"LeBron James is making $37,436,858 this year on the Lakers, so I'm gonna go with a squad like this year's Lakers - 1 vet."
"Never lost it really. Confidence, maybe. But if anyone would set a player straight and say no bullshit, its Lebron James."

so lebron james harden?
"""Laker forward LeBron James praises his teammate, Dwight Howard, a fan favorite. They hope their backcourt is bolstered by the return of Rajon Rondo."""
LeBron James
"bruh you could've just said Lebron James Harden, missed opportunity there"
LeBron James and Dwight Howard are leading the Lakers in terms of on-off court offensive rating difference. Dwight has been mesmerizing.
"Luka ""Lebron James"" Doncic"
yeah this guy might be a monster. his passing is unreal. Hes a james harden lebron hybrid.
This Lebron James guy would probably be pretty good on any team
Lebron James
LEBRON JAMES EFFECT CRANKED UP TO ELEVEN?
"Quick, someone check if Luka Doncic and Lebron James are simultaneously the youngest and oldest players with back to back triple doubles."
"LeBron James is the offense. When he sits, the offense slows down."
Anthony Davis MVP. LeBron James FMVP is my dream.
"&gt;is playing with Lebron fuckin James  Ok, /u/LeBumNotTop100"
1945 was also the end of ww2. lebron just beat hitler. suck it james harden.
"LeBron ""Tom Brady"" James"
It’s been 6. Games. AD is playing with LeBron fuckin James. AD isn’t even the best player on his team. Can’t create his own shot efficiently like harden come on man
dwight howard and lebron james is the real lakers duo
"&gt;	Being clutch isn't just about hitting game winners. It's about delivering in the right moment.  Right, which lebron has done countless times as well. Game winners are plays that are also considered delivering in the right moment.   &gt;	James has already been to more NBA finals than Michael, yet he only has 4 rings.  This also means that Michael wasn’t able to lead his team to the finals as many times as lebron. Lebron has 3 rings btw."
Only one of them has ever posterized Lebron James though so I guess advantage Brogdon
Daniel house junior   Danilo Galinari   Joakim Noah   Carlos Boozer   Lebron James
What about this lineup;  Quincy Acy  LeBron James  Quentin Richardson   Jarrett Jack  Juan Dixon
Atm he is like 2 -3 minutes per game above about every roty besides brogdon in recent memory   Found this in the Knicks Sub.

They don't work well because they're competing with LeBron James.
"“So Mr. Spielberg, I know you said we need to cast the best basketball player in the world, but you see, Lebron James just shaved his head. Can’t use him. So we picked up Kelly Olynyk instead.”"
"Yeah, that Cavs team did that because of Lebron James, playing in a weaker east than the raptors did."
"You know... sometimes it would be good to give up and say mostly to yourself that the other guy may have a point he is trying to get across.  Obviously you do not think Luka is a superstar yet. The people seem to think he is. Look at the public vote for All Stars Game. His stats line is similar to Lebron James in his rookie year and so far (5 games) matches Lebron's second year.  It is clear he needs to win to make the final step - and that is going to be exciting to watch. If he keeps this pace up, he is superstar by any definition this year already."
"Of all the things you could talk about basketball related, you choose to talk about Lebron James' hair?"
"you're right. organ harvesting, surpressing free speech, and concentration camps are terrible. those are all reasons people from hong kong want to maintain some sort of autonomy from the mainland.   but this purist culture of I can only support HKers if I boycott any company with mainland china connections is ridiculous. I don't have the capacity to be outraged by everything, but I do support the people seeking freedom in Hong Kong and I will criticize athletes like Lebron James who speak against that."
Lebron James would like to have a word with you about that

"If he runs. Bigs have terrible habits on getting back. Probably because for ADs entire career he hasn’t had dudes like Danny Green and LeBron James who can stop what looks like automatic buckets, but so far I’ve not seen AD make it to the free throw line off a turnover -&gt; fast break.  Hopefully he sees the difference or is coached into making that effort, because there was a play at least once already where KCP stopped the fast break, but the teammate cleaned up the miss. If AD had run the floor, woulda been an easy rebound and fast break the other way with 4 on 3 the other way."
"&gt;Was LeBron disqualified from the conversation last yr for missing 18 games?  No, because Kawhi also missed 20 games.   &gt;Having the better season=/= the best player. That's why I said leave emotions aside. James harden and giannis can end up having a better statically season than both kawhi and LeBron. It doesn't mean they're better  Exactly. And in this case we know the levels Lebron can get to and what kind of player he is we have so much data on him. Nothing we know about Kawhi suggests he can reach those levels of performance."
"Agreed, or even go out there as is without the headband and hair plugs, you’re lebron fking James you can own it, but preferably shave it all off."
"What dunk? LeBron. Ain't. Dunking. The. Ball. Let's say he does, okay? Lakers need to foul immediately then hope that if a FT is missed, it's the first one because you need all the time. But let's say Mavs make both FTs, you're looking at a worse 3 point attempt than had the Lakers taken one instead of taking a 2 just because the Mavs gave them the opportunity to take it despite the Lakers knowing they're down 3.   I'm not quite following your logic. You're assuming that someone on the Lakers, namely LeBron James (who is one of the smartest players ever), would do something that really never happens because logically and statistically doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Yet, you think LeBron would have been like ""OMG, I can get a quick 2 with a second or two left and pray the full court heave after FTs will be accurate for the catch and shoot."" Not. Happening."
"A mix of Michael Jordan, Lebron James and a little bit of magic Johnson if I’m being completely honest"

The Raptors have never won a playoff series against Lebron James
"Slow down. Which top 6-7 player would he even replace? In no order Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Antepokoumpo, James Harden, LeBron James and Anthony Davis. I've been following him since his Real Madrid days and knew he was a surefire thing but cracking the top 5 is an insane leap so soon even for a player of his caliber."
Give me 1 LeBron James
Almost all of them were by players who were way older   Sure guys like Kareem and Duncan  had a better rookie year than Doncic but they were also 3-4 years older as rookies  Sure a guy like David Robinson had a better rookie year but he was 25 years old  Sure a guy like Blake Griffin had a comparable rookie season to Luka 10 years ago (Doncic still had a better season) but Blake was 3 years older     The only 19 year old seasons ever as good as Luka was LeBron James and Luka’s sophomore campaign has him looking like a bonafide superstar so far (which isn’t surprising considering Luka was already all star caliber last season as a rookie)
"MJ was a year older than Luka currently is and Luka will probably end up putting around 25-7-8 this year compared to Jordan who averaged like 28-5-5 on a 30 win team   LeBron is possibly the only better player at Doncic age the game has ever had.   Magic was awesome but Kareem deserved finals MVP. Luka and LeBron also didn’t have a top 3 player of all time  in their prime beside them at that age to get to the finals    Also notice how the three names you came up with are motherfucking Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, LeBron James because those are some of the only players ever comparable to Doncic at his age"
"We disagree about the definition of athleticism.  It's a well defined term, so it's not worth disagreeing about.  The 100m is under the category of ""athletics"" in the Olympics.  Olympic basketball is played under a category called ""sports"" which is separate and distinct from athletics.  It would be semantically correct to say that LeBron James has an Olympic gold medal in sport but not athletics.  Any sport where a 40 year old can compete at an elite level can't be taken seriously in a conversation about which is the most athletic sport.  A 40 year old will have enough athletic decline that they wouldn't be able to compete in a supremely athletically demanding sport"
"I disagree. When I think of athleticism. I think of:  Size, Speed, Strength, Grace, Hand Eye, Stamina, IQ, and probably more shit I'm not thinking of.   I also brought up the fact that I could not name a single rugby player. Not one. I'm admittedly not a Rugby fan. I know next to nothing about the sport, and have never followed it. I bet you kids from all over the world who know nothing about basketball have heard the name Lebron James. There is a reason for his fame. Can Usain Bolt dribble a basketball? Can he play multiple sports? I've never seen Lebron play Volleyball, but I would bet a significant amount of money that he'd be a pretty nasty Volleyball player after a few weeks practicing. I imagine he'd be good at baseball, football, cricket, you name it really minus endurance sports because he's a giant.   I have been a competitive endurance athlete my entire life. I have ran a 31 minute 10 k, and hold records summitting mountains where I live. I would call myself fit, I am not a particularly good athlete. There is a difference.  My coworkers main argument which I failed to state earlier was that Rugby players are running more, therefore they are more fit. I asked him if that makes me a better athlete than Rugby players simply because I'm a good distance runner to which he didn't have much to say. I understand what you are saying, I just don't agree fully. I think people mix up and misunderstand the terms Fit and Athletic."
Peak Lakers + most popular player on the team in LeBron James? Nothing tops that
"And not just any ole 17 seasons of play.. That's 17 seasons of insane minutes, and TONS of playoff games. To put things into perspective lets compare Lebron James to a relatively normal player Kyle Korver. They both are in year 17.  **Kyle Korver minutes:**  Regular: 30,290  Playoffs: 3,252  **Total: 33,542**  **Lebron minutes:**  Regular: 46,407  Playoffs:10,049  **Total:56,456**  That's 22,914 MORE minutes played... Lebron has 46,235 minutes played in the first 16 seasons of his career(regular season only) which is 2,889 minutes per season on average. That means that Lebron has played, at HIS level of minutes, about 8 more regular seasons worth of minutes than Kyle Korver.   If we take that 22,914 and divide it by Kyle Korver's regular season average minutes played of 1889 we'd have have lebron at 12.13 more ENTIRE SEASONS played.   It's absolutely mind blowing."
"or u know, theyre just not a good defensive team. if u watch them every game so far, u know theyre trash defensively.   2nd greatest player coasted to 27/7/7 and still manages to play over 74 games every season except last year due to injury and 2015 due to back problems, and still averages 35-37 minutes per game.   or did lebron james miss games on purpose throughout the season for 20+ games that i wasn't aware of?"
"lets put it this way. if u can't play AT LEAST 70 games when ur not injured, thats unfair to the other superstars who actually have to CARRY their teams on a nightly basis.   the point of a regular season is to fight through the grind of the process, and in the playoffs u find that mental toughness to kick it to another gear. that's why we appreciate the greatness of guys like jordan/kobe/lebron...   a guy like kawhi to me is funny. gets load management 4 games into a season when he averages less than 30 minutes a game is mind boggling. it's like he admits i can't fight through the grind of the regular season, so i'll be more healthy than every other player heading to the final stretch. that's like asking james harden to play 60 games so he can be fully healthy for the playoff run. harden wouldn't do that b/c that's disgraceful."
"AD is behind players such as Kawhi, James Harden, and Derrick Rose in usage%, Lebron is behind players like Siakam, Embiid, and Beal. So I don’t know what you’re saying about them using their stars more than other teams."
top 1    No team is beating a roster that has LeBron James + Anthony Davis + good role players
"I'm not crowning anyone. I never said kawhi was the best. Only said he was having a better season especially before the Mavs game outside of assists, he was leading in every major statistical category.  I just state something that's a fact and no, missing a game doesn't put up a 0/0/0/0. Are you going to keep that same argument when LeBron rests? Was LeBron disqualified from the conversation last yr for missing 18 games?  LeBron and kawhi have played the same amount of games and win the same amount of times. 4-1.  The clips lost one without kawhi.    Having the better season=/= the best player. That's why I said leave emotions aside. James harden and giannis can end up having a better statically season than both kawhi and LeBron. It doesn't mean they're better"
"Game 6 2016.  &gt;From the 5 minute mark of the 3rd quarter to the 2:26 minute mark of the 4th quarter [14 minutes 34 seconds], Lebron James scored or assisted on every single Cavs point [With the Exception of the Kyrie Irving Techincal Free Throw]. His stats during that time 25 pts 4 assists 3 rebounds 1 block.   Utter domination."
"It was not a ""toss up"". Luka had non-negligble odds of being on a Michael Jordan / LeBron James type career trajectory. Ayton's a great prospect but doesn't compare."
"Most of his career is yet to come. Also, his dad was good, not great. Certainly not comparable to LeBron James."
"You know who else has average athleticism? Larry bird, steph curry, james harden. Athleticism is largely overrated imo. Most star players dont play defense anymore and the best players are the most skilled. What makes jordan and lebron the goats its they are both the most skilled and most athletic but luka skills &gt; athleticism in today's nba"
he is the most overrated player when people are saying he's better than prime LeBron james lol
"Nope. He isn’t. And he won’t be. Like I said, Kawhi has spots. He gets to them. He shoots the ball. But he’s not the scorer LeBron James is. He can’t create. Since you’re so busy watching Kawhi, watch Lou Will. Kawhi isn’t even the best scorer on his team."
White lebron James
"Luka was incredible. HES IN HIS 2nd SEASON LOL. insane. Last season Ingram would shut him down when every they played, so I honestly didn’t expect him to go off like this. But if Powell makes that free throw, we lose this game.  Lebron James is Lebron James. I really hope this win is a boost and the team can run off that. McGee has been awful and Dwight again comes up big time with his rebounding and defense"
"Why is everyone acting like Trae Young is a bust?? Just to draw a parallel from their NBA counterparts based on how they look now, it'd be like saying the Hawks fucked up for picking Steph Curry (Trae) over LeBron James (Luka). I mean....no...that's not a fuck up lol"
"what do you expect her to say, fuck the Klutch Sports government? She's got business interests in Lebron James."
Over(?) 40 years of someone named Lebron James terrorising teams
"Between 1993 and 1995 (Jordan's first retirement), things definitely felt wide open in terms of there being an ""undisputed"" top dog. I know hindsight tells us it should have been Hakeem Olajuwon but at the time most of us weren't sitting around giving Hakeem the MJ treatment. Instead, while Hakeem was having a superb 1993-94 season, it can be argued that David Robinson and Shaquille O'Neal were getting most of the publicity. [Robinson even found himself labeled as Mr. MVP that year by SI before bowing out in the first round.](https://live.staticflickr.com/4110/5056748935_2971aca3d1_z.jpg)   Moreover, Scottie Pippen received a fair bit of recognition for carrying Chicago in Jordan's absence (they still won 50+). Still, no one mistook Pippen as a Jordan-like top dog.   I haven't seen anyone mention Grant Hill yet. When he arrived in 1994-95, he was getting a lot of ""next"" publicity. With the mix of great players but lack of ""the"" player in '94, folks were anxious for someone to take Jordan's mantle. Grant Hill was one of the first to show he might actually be able to fulfill not only the production side but also the pop culture side (leading All-Star vote getter as a rookie, all over television and commercials).   Even when Jordan came back in 1995, people were still on the lookout for the next guy, since Jordan's NBA mortality had already been fully experienced and we knew he wasn't going to play forever. Kobe Bryant received a lot of pub upon entry to the league too, particularly when he ended up matching up against Jordan in the '98 All-Star Game.   I always viewed the post-'98 era as the time when the league was filled with dudes trying their best to be Jordan but often misinterpreting that as meaning they should all base their games on isolating for 18 seconds before firing up and endless stream of mid-range fallaway jumpers. It's a crude over-simplification—particularly considering it worked for many players—but that was definitely an era where dudes like Kobe, Tracy McGrady, Allen Iverson, Vince Carter, Jerry Stackhouse, and Latrell Sprewell all tried their hand at being very ball-centric and shooting-centric stars.   It made for good debate. Folks could and would argue that Shaq was clearly the most dominant player but not necessarily a GOAT candidate (seemingly leading to the push for a different term which somehow didn't hold the same meaning: most dominant ever). Others would argue between McGrady, Kobe, and AI depending upon allegiance and preference.   But from a personal standpoint, it didn't feel like that next MJ messiah moment came again until the LeBron James hype kicked into full gear with ESPN covering his games as a senior. His approach—dominating through scoring, next-level athleticism for a dude that size, *and* a clear willingness to utilize and maximize his own teammates' abilities—just screamed legend in the making to me.   I've been wrong about a lot (thought the Pistons signing Chauncey in '02 was like signing a more expensive Chucky Atkins) but I felt LeBron was not only going to be a superstar, but a legit top-5 guy of all-time from pretty early on. He was the next ""MJ-type"" and while I had that feeling prior, his 48-point performance against the Pistons in 2007 removed all doubt.   **TL;DR** Jordan's first retirement was filled with great players who all didn't have the Jordan ""it"". Even when he returned, the search for the ""next"" MJ continued, often ending up being bestowed upon guys through wishful thinking (Grant Hill). Then Jordan's second retirement was mostly a bunch of uber-athletic iso wings vying for top dog status until LeBron came along."

"Luka's response...  ""That was just some crazy stuff for me,"" Doncic said of the compliment. ""I've been following him. He was my idol from the beginning. I can play against him and play a game like that, and the words that he said after the game were something that were very special for me.""  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27986211/lebron-james-outduels-luka-doncic-los-angeles-lakers-dallas-mavericks-ot-thriller"
"Over the past decade pretty much only Lebron James's team, the Spurs, the Warriors or the Lakers have won. That would be a lot of players we would have to hate on for not winning. Everyone has a stiffy for Anthony Davis and James Harden. They haven't won shit."
This didn’t age well. Luka Doncic will be this generation’s LeBron James.
You know us getting banged as a team and Lebron James was there for all the finals just shows and is a testament as to what an excellent player he is to be still performing at the highest level
"LeBron does not get the MVP votes that he deserves, much like Pop is disrespected as Coach and Executive. The award committee values stand out performances rather than sustained exceptionality. They vote for teams that come from the dumps to greatness rather than teams that are never truly bad thanks to the work of an exceptional player.  Go down the list of recent MVP vote getters and ask if that guy was, at that time, a better basketball player than LeBron James. LeBron is the best player since Kobe, but he has to be better than LeBron to get MVP votes, which is a very high bar."
In 2019 Lebron James is playing at a higher level than Kawhi without skipping games for rest.
Ref should be looking there but anybody who says the ref is trash is free to signup and referee themselves. Off ball officiating is hard and even harder when LeBron James is barreling towards the rim with 2 seconds on the clock.
ESPN be like   “LeBron James with 23 in the 3rd breaks the record of scoring the most points in a quarter on a Tuesday evening during a waxing crescent moon in a game where the total minutes played amounted to be more than 34.7 and with no fans in the first or second rows wearing tie-dye t-shirts. The feat overcomes Michael Jordan’s 16 in the first quarter of a 1992 game against the Cavaliers.”

"This is just not true. His defense has been solid, there were like two times were he lagged off of a possession, but he was really locked in like usual. Siakam was getting just as many contact fouls as LeBron. If anything, James should have had way more than 15 assists with how many openly bricked threes he passed to.

Somewhere between prime Lebron and prime James Harden
Lebron james is good
"This has been posted here before many times but look at [this video of LeBron leading work out with his Olympics team squad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD2N2nfVWjY). Even in these light sessions James comes across as a dedicated professional whereas Melo flat out doesn't.   LeBron's natural gift is exceptional but his work ethic cannot be discounted, along with his highly educated mind specializing in the Chinese diplomacy and domestic policies. (I suppose I have to add a sarcasm warning just to be safe)"
lmao did you seriously just try to argue that Kawhi Leonard is better than LeBron James in the playoffs? Stop it he was a fucking role player till 3 years ago Jesus Christ some of you people have no sense of history. Also did you forget about the Thunder series when they had 67 wins and he was completely outplayed in every facet by KD?
"Well yes, because I'm not a Lakers homer who thinks a team playing Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and 35-year old LeBron James major minutes is gonna be one of the best defenses in recent history. Do I think their defense will remain very good? Yes, I believe Davis, Green, and a resurgent Dwight Howard will keep them a top three defense. But there's a difference between great and all-time great.  And what was I wrong about with regards to their offense? I said it would improve as the team establishes chemistry but that their shooting is suspect."
I’ve never seen LeBron and Mao in the same room at the same time. [The similarity is damning](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1607607-lebron-james-china-comments)
Lebron James and Genghis Khan
Have you seen where he grew up? His background is about as Cosmopolitan as LeBron James’.
"Before the draft my only comparisons were Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Anthony Davis. They were the only players who had as much success as he did before the turned 19. Naismith/High school/Euroleague mvp. No freshman had ever done it before Durant and AD, and no 19 year old had ever come close to what Doncic did. He was the best prospect of the last 10 years besides AD and honestly it's not close."
"D, Lebron James and Steph? Are you serious?"
"""LeBron James appears to be heading to the locker room, but that could be because it's halftime."""
They don't have LeBron James to cover up the fact that their starting point guard is one of the worst offensive players we've ever seen during the last decade.
"No, and the reason is because Westbrook got that triple-double season in a time where it was seen as impossible and Wilt-like to even sniff a triple-double average. He did it again in 2018 and 2019, and wasn’t close to winning MVP. No doubt, Luka is a baller and he’s the next up. But a TD average as a 6 seed won’t get you the award, even if it’ll get him votes.  Tbh, while Harden is a disgusting scorer, his 37 PPG this year isn’t super impressive. They’re 6-3 and they’ve one of the easiest schedules in the league and have yet to beat a playoff team. He’s taking and forcing a ludicrous amount of shots and free throws right now.  Edit: Similarly, LeBron James at 20 years old (2nd year) averaged 27/7/7 and led the Cavs to 42-40 (missed playoffs albeit the positive record) and was 6th in MVP voting in a season where the winner Steve Nash (62 wins on 15/12) and Shaq (59 wins 23/10) were neck and neck in MVP voting."
"A. George Hill could’ve not missed the free throw. B. Lebron James could’ve been with KD instead of Klay Thompson, which would’ve meant JR Smith would’ve been with Klay, and thus not grabbed the rebound. C. They had a timeout, but NOBODY called for it."
LeBron James.
"alright first time 2010-11 season, I was not dumb, I was happy Lebron left for his own benefit as im more of a player &gt; franchise, unless if the player completely fucks over the franchise and it was done out of pettiness (mr Kevin) even though ive come to accept Kevins decision as well, I knew that he deserved better and whatever we ever tried was just not good for him, he gave his all and I appreciate that, I hated everyone who burned his jersey because he legit took us to the finals and we still gave him no help... I really hate big z btw, always thought that man was trash, BUT ANYWAYS, the season was hard to even watch, just going on losing streaks was just bad and it gave me a depression as I would just get made fun of for it a lot. I ended up just stop watching the season until Kyrie (my favorite NBA player of all time) came to Cleveland as I started favoring college basketball heavily that season over watching my Cavs lose so many times. he grew and grew and it was just amazing. loved watching him so close up and getting to see him flourish as he already looked so NBA Ready in his rookie season. he was just one of those guys you know will just only grow (and he did)   &amp;#x200B;  2013, the news came to me, Lebron is back from Miami to Cleveland, I couldn't believe it... Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, AND NOW LEBRON (even though Kevin was kind of upsetting seeing him on pace to be a all time great to slowly declining in Cleveland to just a unanimous ""good big man"") the season was exciting we kept going and going, everything just falling place, it took us obviously a couple of years to get where we got so imma just skip all the boring stuff and go straight to 2016. (even though 2015 was a great season, we will not talk about it) Lebron Kyrie and Kevin all now with great chemistry and teamwork as we see on Richard Jeffersons snapchat Story everyday. The team is looking GREAT, we are genuine contenders and we have the keys to littearly win the finals after DOMINATING, the hawks so bad they went into rebuilding mode, the Celtics to another level of disrespect, our rivals the bulls, and obviously the infamous lebronto... its just great dominating, feeling a lick of the championship, but were still not there yet, we defeat everyone in our way in 2016 playoffs WITH EASE, I remember certain shots and everything from each series, wether it was raptors, pistons, or hawks, it was just funny to see them losing and us winning so easily it just looked nic- game 1... 89 - 104 against the warriors, its not super bad but thats still a 15 point loss but its ok its just one gam- game 2... A 33 POINT LOSS, ABSOLUTELY DEVESTATING YEA SURE OK WE GET IT GS YOU ARE 73-9 YOU CAME BACK FROM 3-1 TO KEVIN DURANT AND RUSSELL WESTBROOK BUT THIS IS JUST NOT FAIR PLEASE STO- game 3... we beat them by 30... ok this was home, we won by 30, we are easily going to tie the series 2-2 in game 4, thank go- game 4 AT HOME and we lose, the only thoughts in my head, boy oh boy I cant wait til 2017 to get these fucking shitheads I swear they wont repeat, basically I really thought we lost right then and there, a lot of people did and its embarrassing to admit it but thats because I am willing to admit what many Cavs fans wont, we gave up, but ooooooohh just wait til you hear about game 5... game 5 KYRIE AND LEBRON GO OFF FOR 82 MOST POINTS BY A DUO IN NBA HISTORY IN THE FINALS, I just got an INSTANT Rush after that game, play by play going in hard sooo so hard, I loved it. Game 6... Super scary entering this game, we are at home court and if we lose, we are going to be so embarrassed losing the finals at our own home court, but w ended up picking up the win and it was so so anxiety filling cause all it was doing is teasing and teasing and teasing. We win the game by 14 points but even that is a nail biter, as 14 points is the least we need to feel safe against this RECORD SEASON team. We get to oracle arena in game 7 and when I open the tv to see Kyrie and LeBron wearing those same jerseys from game 5, omg I felt so excited, I loved those jerseys so much and its my all time favorite jersey, it holds history and its just purely really sexy lmaooo. but the first quarter is just so neck and neck and both teams are playing super aggressive with it, second quarter we get DOMINATED, im super quiet and dont know what to say, my warriors neighbors are celebrating every warriors point and booing every Cavs possession, (I live in California). third quarter we come back HUGE on points and we are playing really great out there, everything from LeBron getting assists to the open man, to fastbreaks happening so often (where most of our points are coming from), the defense look somewhat ok but somehow no one can stop draymond??!!?!? but still an effective Cavs third quarter, the 4th quarter was the longest 4th quarter I have ever watched, then it happened. Igoudala to curry back to igoudala, up for the layUP- OH BLOCKED BY JAMES! That block gave me AND STILL DOES give me goosebumps every single time. Ive seen LeBron do it many times before and ive see nlebron do it so many times after, but that one, omg that one right there was just too solid to ever forget about. That was the greatest thing ive ever witnessed in the history of the NB- the crowd chants ""defense \*clap clap\* defense \*clap clap\*"" ""Irving and Curry one on one, Irving PUTS IT UP, ITS GOOD, KYRIE IRVING FROM DOWNTOWN"" I WENT ABSOLUTELY BESERK SEEING THAT SHOT GO IN SO SMOOTHLY MADE MY HEART DROP AND SAY OMG THERE NEEDS TO BE A MIRACLE FOR THEM TO EVEN COME BACK AFTER THIS... The game ends and I fall into tears just as LeBron did, im so excited ive never cried over something equivalent to this. The whole city of Cleveland and basically all of Ohio erupted and it was great to see it all just unfold like that, I sat back in my couch relieved and excited at the same time, watching everyone just celebrate, LeBron holding that trophy (both of them), ""Cleveland this is for you!!!!!!"" ahh love it.  2017 that summer after the chip KD joins obvi the warriors and its a complete blow off if youre a Cavs fan, obviously very worrying, but man oh man we had confidence, we go through again destroying the east, disrepsticng the pacers, lebronto, and the Celtics with ease. but come the warriors time, we lose and go down 3-0 and after that one game that brought us back to 3-1 it was super unrealistic but many fans pretty much had that ""if we can do it once we can do it again"" and we honestly had a better structured team that year anyways, but you know things dont always go as planned. 4-1 we lose, we lose kyrie (personally devastating even though the drama idc I love kyrie)   2018 season happens, almost lose to Celtics but you know.. LeBron and stuff. Game 1 of 2018 happens, that was just demoralizing... it was just over from right there. that was our chance of momentum and it was gone. Always loved jr off court but on I hated him, even with good games, still never liked him. but its whatever.   now were here, in 2020 where the warriors are the worst team in the league? (not their fault) the Cavs are just as good/bad? the raptors are champions, LeBron is still the best player in the world but only certain occasions where he wants to show it basically cuz we've come to expect him to have inhumane numbers because thats the standard he has set for himself but obviously LeBron is a genius and is still playing amazing while preserving himself just putting himself as the second best player in the world behind kawhi and the Cavs are just here at the bottom with a dying Kevin and every fans favorite duo in Collin and Darius or waht we call in the Cavs sub... sexland!  but yeah we alright now, we had our fun (both teams) and now the suns are doing not bad, the nba will always facisnate me..."

I can. It's called Lebron James.
Lebron James has entered the chat
"Can't speak for the OP, but I guess for me it's a question of the severity of the overpay and how much they make the team better.  Would I pay an extra $5M to Lebron James? Definitely. Would I pay an extra $8 to Danny Green? Nope.  End of the day, I think you should only sign contracts you can trade even if you never intend to."
"All of these superstars have one thing in common - they've had contact with Lebron James. Think about it. LeBron had planted multiple leech pods on KD, Steph, Klay, and Hayward. 2017 Hayward faced off against LeBron and the Cavaliers in the start of 2017. Same game Hayward broke his foot mere moments after LeBron touched him before the game began. KD, Steph, and Klay came in contact through all of those intense Finals games. LeBron then proceeds to strain his groin last year. This year? LeBron is looking fresh, healthy, and full of energy. KD, Steph, Klay, and Hayward? Sidelined with injuries. My theory is that LeBron finally activated those leech seeds and stole their energy."
"He isn’t yet. That term is reserved for people like Jordan, Kobe, LeBron, KD, Shaq, people of that nature. He’s an amazing talent yes, but James Harden puts up ridiculous numbers every year and not many people at all call him a generational talent"
"Steph Curry, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis.   I guess they’re all American"
Because LeBron James has poured tonnes of resources into two things: a team dedicated to managing his body to prolong his career and a team dedicated to pruning and shaping his image in the media (both traditional and online).  Y’all really don’t get that Lebron wants to position himself to be a highly highly influential person in his career after basketball. He’s not like other people.
"I see what you mean but if he can keep being this consistent than he might have a shot at it.   Also not being the best player on your team doeant mean shit, Lebron James and AD are very good players but unfortunately they're overshadowed by Caruso."

"1. Kareem 2. Jordan 3. James  If LeBron beats Kareem's scoring record, I'd put him at 1."
"That's fine for MVP considerations, but jfc, the sports media and /r/nba nephews are taking this sitting out too seriously.  Clippers have already had 2 B2B's already while other teams have yet to have their first. If the NBA wants to make a big deal about it, then eliminate all B2Bs or don't schedule 2 within 1 week of each other.  Also, the media blow out is so much greater than it was for Lebron when he was in CLE. Any true basketball fan would prefer every star player is fully healthy in the post-season so that we can see the best basketball possible.  This is legit a [quote](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2699008-lebron-james-addresses-players-sitting-for-rest-during-nba-season) from Lebron:  &gt; I don't think the NBA can do anything about it. At the end of the day, it sucks at times where certain guys have to rest, but certain guys need rest. &gt;  &gt; And it's a long, strenuous season and the NBA does a great job of putting the schedule together as best as they can. You're going to have back-to-backs. You're going to have certain games where certain things fall on certain nights, but a coach's job is to figure out a way for their team to compete for a championship, not compete for a game."
Hakeem was selected first overall in 1984 draft. Hakeem = Ayton.   Jordan was selected 3rd overall in the 1984 draft. Luka = Jordan.  Hakeem won two championships with the Rockets so in this joke Ayton wins two with the suns.   An ageing James Harden wants a ring after many successful seasons in Houston so he goes to the Suns who are the two time defending champs. Harden = Barkley.  The Rockets lost to the Supersonics in 1996. Supersonics = OKC. Literally.  I had to change Luka to Lebron as there is no believable way that Luka leaves Dallas and the suns can't beat the Mavericks in the NBA finals.  Harden doesn't get his ring because Lebron ruins it for everyone again (just like Jordan and the Bulls) and Ayton's selection at #1 isn't universally panned as he was still successful with his team. Despite Phoenix passing on said future GOAT Luka.
Ayton gonna carry that Suns team to 2 championship then Harden is going to jump ship from Houston to Phoenix to get a ring and then lose to OKC in the western conference finals who then lose to 40 year old Lebron James who returned home from LA after Lebron James Jr is drafted 1st overall by Cleveland.
"https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2019/1/24/18196559/mavericks-luka-doncic-not-all-star-starter  &gt; Per the final votes, Doncic finished third in fan votes with 4,242,980, trailing Lebron James by just under 400,000 votes and Giannis Antetokounmpo by 130,000 votes."
"Better career for sure. Idc about that too much I care about who’s the guy I think was best. In a game at their peaks I want Shaq. Shaq can’t be stopped, anchors the defense, controls the boards and the paint, and gets better the more important the game is. Also think he has an incalculable impact of just how intimidating his physical presence is to the other team. There’s the whole free throw thing but I’m a firm believer that he hits em when they count, and the other team racks up fouls in the process. Shaq also works well with any type of player and allows them to flourish, whereas a lot of shot creators aren’t optional on a LeBron James lead team, and floor general and playmaking pgs are really only useful when he sits."
and definitely not LeBron James or Michael Jordan
"It's just typical sports media coming out and trying to create outrage over a tiny thing.  Here is a Lebron [quote](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2699008-lebron-james-addresses-players-sitting-for-rest-during-nba-season) from his stint on the Cavs when he sat out about 6 games, 5 for rest:  &gt; I don't think the NBA can do anything about it. At the end of the day, it sucks at times where certain guys have to rest, but certain guys need rest.  &gt; And it's a long, strenuous season and the NBA does a great job of putting the schedule together as best as they can.

You're going to have certain games where certain things fall on certain nights, but a coach's job is to figure out a way for their team to compete for a championship, not compete for a game.  I wish he came out in ""fuller"" support of Kawhi, considering he shares these thoughts instead of the ""if I'm not hurt, I'm playing"" quote.  Load management has been a thing for awhile"

"I think the Lakers and the Rockets have the best chance of hurting them out West. Lakers have an amazing defense and we all know how good AD and LeBron are offensively.   Rockets have James Harden and Russ. Once their whole team figures out how to play together I think their offense will be extremely deadly. Granted their defense is straight up bad right now.    Out East I see Philly and Bucks giving them a GOOD run for their money. The Clippers have very weak interior defense and I expect Embiid/Giannis to feast. Same with AD out West.   I still think that Clippers are the best team in the NBA, I just think that they can be challenged/beaten by some teams who can catch a break and exploit their #1 one weakness."
This is a bad example.  Would you rather be the Lakers or the Boston big 3 in 08 would be the better comparison.  James and Davis aren't just 30ppg guys they're monsters all over the court.  If you had 3 20 ppg guys who were also playmakers like LeBron and defenders like Davis you'd take the 3.

"This happens every year. Last year Kd, Klay, Dejounte Murray, Victor Oladipo, Nurkic, and Lebron James got injured. The year before Kyrie, Hayward, Kawhi, Porzingis, and Demarcus Cousins got injured."
LeBron James (hair) listed out on Sunday vs. Raptors.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"lol. Lebron James was the 10th highest player in the league in Miami. Kd, lol, was being paid less than Otto Porter when he was on the Warriors."
Even if fuckin prime heat LeBron James was on that sun team the year before Ayton they’d probably just barely sneak into the playoffs at a 6-8 seed
“How would you feel if Lebron James joined the Raptors?”  “That would be great. He’s a funny dude. You see his taco Tuesday videos? Hilarious stuff.”
"Nah I disagree, him calling Morey “misinformed” isn’t him supporting China. It’s him attacking somebody for speaking out when he believes they shouldn’t have.  That third part of your post is assuming his intentions as to why he said it. I think he was more protecting his financial interests, not supporting China.   I don’t support James at all, and I think he’s a moron for even commenting.  If we are going to call him out for it let’s at least make sure we have it right. James didn’t support China, James called out Morey for potentially costing him millions while at the same time ignoring that money is coming from a terrible country.  And again, we are speaking on behalf of a person we will never get to ask (I’m assuming you don’t know Lebron) so who knows, all opinion at this point."
"D-PIPMs of superstars:  LeBron James: +0.20  Kawhi Leonard: +0.46  Stephen Curry: +0.26  Anthony Davis: +2.57  Giannis Antetokounmpo: +3.08  James Harden: -1.03  So only one superstar has “bad” defense, and he is one of the best offensive players of all-time.  If you consider more than just those to be superstars:  Damian Lillard: -0.24  Kyrie Irving: -0.50  Joel Embiid: +2.86  Nikola Jokić: +1.18  Karl-Anthony Towns: +0.31  Jimmy Butler: +0.70  Luka Dončić has worse than all of these players except Harden for multi-year, but his current D-PIPM this year is -1.3 which is bottom 10 in the league and Harden’s is -0.9. So he’s probably the worst defender out of all these players, especially if we want to overreact to small sample sizes like this sub is doing to push Luka into the tier of these players, and only 1 top 15 player actually has bad defense. These don’t even include Durant and Paul George who are also positive defenders."
"I'm a cavs fan and when Cleveland won in 2016, there was not a fucking thing anyone could say to me to put Cleveland down. Lebron fucking James settled any and all disputes for a good year."
"I don’t remember the media going like this when LeBron James just sat out for the last few weeks in LA. Not only did they tank, the fans were also expecting a good product not the shit team they received. The Clippers, minus Leonard, are still a competitive team that’s fun to watch. LA fans who bought tickets expecting to see LeBron didn’t even get to see Ingram or Ball who were out with real injuries. LeBron was healthy enough to play, like Leonard, but wanted to rest to avoid hurting himself more. I support both guys doing what’s best for their bodies but let’s not just blast Leonard. If LeBron had a nagging injury and the doctor said it’s best to sit back to backs you bet your butt James is doing it because a championship run is more important. I know it stinks for the fans. I’ve been on the end of player rests and last second injuries before. It sucks, but at least the Clippers have a lot of fun players to watch even without Leonard."
I think you're all underestimating how hard this is - like you see how a player is playing at 25 and you think he'll be the same 10 years later. Literally the only guys who ever did that were Karl Malone and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and now LeBron James.  It's extremely unlikely he'll be able to keep up this level of play past age 32 like just about every other player in the history of the league.
1.	Boban 2.	Eric Paschall 3.	LeBron James 4.	Kawhi Leonard 5.	James Harden  So nope. Not there yet.
Remember that time James Johnson got yammed on by LeBron? Champion kickboxer is more scared of Alex Caruso than LeBron confirmed.

"Warriors are going to make another serious run once they retool. I think they're going to poach a big name free agent from a small market (sorry guys).  Luka Doncic plays until he's almost 40 and teams up with a bunch of people along the way.  We will see at least one proper Kentucky Big 3 (Booker, AD, KAT!?)  LeBron James Jr ends up becoming like a 1 or 2 time all-star.  Jahlil Okafor becomes a viable player on a contender."

Imagine making LeBron fucking James a stretch 5 so that Westbrook and Harden could maintain high usage rates... Tf?
You have Lebron James.... he can compete with any tier 1 team basically on his own.
This is the shortest argument EVER. Harden was way fucking better on offence than anybody else in the NBA including Giannis.    The only reason anybody gives a single flying fuck about defense is because people hate james harden.   Where was all this two way player talk when any of these guys won MVP?  Steph Curry. TWICE  Steve Nash TWICE  James Harden   Allen Iverson  Russel Westbrook     Hell let’s look at the top 2 contenders between 2015 and 2019  2015- James Harden and Steph Curry (both obviously notes defensive beats)  2016 - Just Steph Curry was a contender for MVP because it’s largely considered one of the best seasons ever. Obviously his lock down defense was part of the reason why  2017- Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Everybody was obviously so impressed by their two way ability)   2018- James Harden and LeBron James. - I’m gonna stop playing around this time but you get the point. Another year where the top 2 mvp candidates played trash defense  2019 - Giannis and Harden. Harden puts up the best offensive stats maybe ever while taking a less talented team and more injured team in the western conference to just 5 less wins than Giannis. Harden also had **BY FAR** the best defensive season of his career that year and yet people just hate harden and decided to create a new narrative to not give him the award
"I mean Kobe is not an easy person to play with.  He was always demanding the best and was serious in his craft.  Much different than LeBron ""Taco Tuesday"" James."
LeBron James will undoubtedly pass them.
And play through both the high and low post? But just with ad instead of two players? Its a pretty apt comparison. Its the grit and grind without the abuse of monsters like Carol and Randolph but the same high post low post action of ad plus the addition of one LeBron james
"Oh how the turn tables   &gt;LeBron James disagrees with NBA commissioner Adam Silver's memo demanding that team owners be involved with decisions to rest star players, and said the league is only calling it a ""problem"" because he's sat out a couple times this month.  &gt;""I love what Adam is doing for our league, but I don't see how that (would help),"" James said Tuesday. ""I don't understand why it's become a problem now, because I sit out a couple games?"" &gt;""Listen, Pop's been doing this for 10 years, 12 years, 15 years and everybody was like, 'You know what?

That's the smartest thing.  &gt;""But some of our coaches in our league don't have the stature that Pop has, and our head coach doesn't have it so he gets killed for it. So, I've got to keep winning to help my coach be able to have a reason why he can sit his players.""  &gt;""The owners be in the decision (making process) of resting players?"" James said. ""There's owners that are not even around the teams. There's owners that are just owning the team because they just own the team. It's whatever. What does that make any sense of?"""
All time Lebron James
Come on how the fk are you gonna score as a perimeter player on Kawhi OG and Siakam. Literally 3 of the most switchable wings in the game.  You’d need to be like Embiid in the post or like Harden/Steph/KD/Dame on the perimeter to have a shot. Or Lebron in full King James mode.
Not without LeBron James on his team

"Oooookay, lets do this.   In the 2018-19 season. . .   In terms of time per possession players possessed the ball, James Harden led the league with 9.3 minutes.   Rounding out the rest of the top five was Wall, Lillard, Westbrook, and Walker. Rounding out the top fifteen? Trae Young; Mike Conley; Chris Paul; Luka Doncic; Ben Simmons; D'angelo Russell; Lebron James; Jeff Teague; DJ Augustin; Devin Booker....  So, are you telling me, a guy who doesn't even rank in the top 15 in time of possession, SOMEHOW, is preventing a single teammate from averaging 20ppg?"
"LeBron 2.0 is Eric Paschall, who's been having an amazing rookie season so far.  He plays like a poor man's Lebron.  17/5/2 on 63/33/89 splits, including time as the #1 option while the rest of the team is hurt. That's his first 8 NBA games, counting 4 where he came off the bench. He's going to be a beast.   And James Wiseman is an athletic 7'1"" big man with a good shot.  Would perfectly compliment the run and gun gameplan."
"Eastern conference but also that roster was significantly better than what Steph had available to him in the first 4 games (he only played 4 before his hand fracture).  That roster in the playoffs had:  LeBron James  Kevin Love   J.R. Smith  George Hill  Jeff Green  Larry Nance  Tristan Thompson  Kyle Korver  Rodney Hood  Jordan Clarkson  That's not a *great* roster but that's not as trash as people make it out to be. There's real talent at a lot of positions on that roster. NBA veterans who know how to play the game.  In the season opener Curry had, in order of minutes played...   D'Lo  Eric Paschall  Glen Robinson III  Draymond Green  Jacob Evans  Jordan Poole  Marquese Chriss  Omari Spellman  2 of those players are rookies. Two of them are 2nd year players. Only 2 of them had ever played in an NBA game with Stephen Curry before. No true center.   And we've got people who want to take those 4 games, where his numbers weren't that bad outside of his 3's not falling, and try to make pronouncements about what kind of player he is?  Luckily even most of the nephews on r/NBA realize how ridiculous that is, hopefully the few people who espouse will get so embarrassed by their obvious axe to grind that they delete their accounts and never post again."
"Bro LeBron had a *much* better roster around him with the Lakers last season and he didn't carry shit.   They were playing  LeBron James  Brandom Ingram  Kyle Kuzma  Lonzo Ball  Rajon Rondo  JaVale McGee  Reggie Bullock  And that ""LeBron can carry any trash roster to the finals"" shit went out the window when he played atrocious defense, tried to trade his teammates away, and ended with a **37-45** record and missed the playoffs.   Michael Jefferey Jordan would *never!*  But hopefully you are beginning to understand how stupid your argument is."

"&gt;”Of course I am. LeBron James was the best player on the floor last night. He's not the best player in the league. The best player in the league is the undisputed leader of his team. At least in my book. You can compare what he did in this series vs. Rose, but the comparison can't be made. The Bulls didn't defend LeBron the way the Heat defended Rose. It's apples and oranges. I'm going to go with what one guy did the entire year vs. one series where Rose didn't have anything close to the same supporting cast in toughness or talent.”  Ahahaha what the fuck... was the LeBron hate train really that popular?"

LeBron “LeBron James” James
"He's played 82 games exactly one time in his entire career, and you want to use that one season as proof that he has never sat games for load management? Come on man, that's absurd. You can't possibly genuinely think that resting players for load management literally did not exist until last season when Kawhi started doing it.  [""Coaches and players are starting to understand load management more and more each year. Although the term is just being popularized now, it’s been happening for years, even dating back to the Tony Parker-Tim Duncan-Manu Ginobili Spurs in their prime. Gregg Popovich has been in trouble with the league multiple times over resting his stars together, sometimes on national TV nights.""](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2019/11/8/20954096/load-management-definition-kawhi-leonard-lebron-james-fines-controversy)  [LeBron James out vs. Warriors due to load management](https://www.nba.com/article/2019/02/02/lebron-james-out-vs-warriors)  [Lakers News: LeBron James out vs. Jazz Because of Load Management](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2826659-lakers-news-lebron-james-out-vs-jazz-because-of-load-management)    [""The Cavaliers will sit LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, and potentially Kevin Love tonight against the Heat in apparent choice of rest for the playoffs over continuing the fight for the No. 1 seed.""](https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2017/04/cavaliers_to_sit_big_3_tonight.html)"
That team signed Lebron James three days later if PG's agent didn't have his feelers out there and know that was a possibility than he is a terrible agent. You know I think you are right the Paul George's forgive PR fluff pieces are clearly working on people with short memories. Because you couldn't even remember that Lebron signed with the Lakers three days after PG signed with the Thunder.
"&gt;If I said Steph Curry was a better shooter than Lebron James:  &gt;* Does it mean I'm saying Lebron can't shoot?  &gt;  No.   I'm not saying Kobe can't defend or *hurr durr Kobe can't pass*, I'm saying one of those guys (Kobe) was really good at those things, one of those guys was historically good (KG).  You can say I'm taking a narrow view on Kobe, but the fact of the matter is that I'm acknowledging his talents, while you don't seem to be able to see any scenario at all where KG could do better.  &gt; It’s basically just your opinion, and we can agree to disagree.  This is just such a copout take... Yeah of course what I'm saying is opinion, everything you read about basketball is opinion.   The difference is, my opinion takes into account the career of more than just Kobe. I'm actually looking at what makes both guys great whereas your opinion comes from entirely disregarding one of the greatest players of all time because your Laker-based ego can't handle the idea of anyone doing anything better than Kobe.   And you still haven't answered the question:  &gt;do you think Kobe could be a top 3 MVP candidate while only taking 13 shots per game?  You keep saying his playmaking/defence/etc was great and could have been better under a different environment. Were those skills good enough on their own to be an MVP candidate on their own?"
"From a purely statistical POV, Lebron James is the greatest basketball player of all time."
Lebron James is such a fuckin pussy.
"That's a poor way to notate the difference in era. Here's a better way. Since Lebron's 40 point triple double in 2005, there have been 36 40 point triple doubles. 33 of them have come since 2015. Out of the other 3, 2 of them were also Lebron James."
"What an idiot, lol. He had a chance to join with Lebron James while keeping all the talented young players... Maybe use them later on to make a trade for idk... Anthony Davis?"
&gt;I don't like KD because he's mercurial.  And LeBron James isn't? Jumping on super teams whenever it benefits him?
"LeBron is one of the greatest passers to ever live, based on 17 years of volume of work.  In his second season, he wasn't what he is now.  He had good playmaking instincts but you can say the exact same about Luka, who's (so far) putting up better playmaking #s than LeBron did as a sophomore.   The trouble with trying to compare the sophomore season of a guy who's playing now to an all-time great like LeBron is that everyone knows what LeBron became afterwards, so when people run out of arguments they just say ""This is *LeBron James* we're talking about!  Oh well, you're probably just too young to remember.""    But people need to realize being older doesn't make your argument any better.  I watched both of these seasons happen and I can comfortably say that if Luka keeps his current pace, he will go down as having had the better sophomore season."
"Lebron James is playing less minutes than he ever has in the 17 years he's been in the NBA. So while it may seem like a lot to you, it's pretty lax for him. Vogel gives him more oportunities to rest and he doesn't take them.  &gt; As the Los Angeles Lakers were in the midst of trying to secure a tight win against the Phoenix Suns last week, head coach Frank Vogel did something he’s often tried to do in fourth quarters this season: Get LeBron James a rest.  &gt; To do achieve this goal, he told Alex Caruso to go wait at the scorer’s table to sub in for James, but quickly realized he had made a mistake.  “He told Alex to go back to the bench,” Vogel recalled with a laugh earlier this week. “Yelled out ‘what are you doing over there at the scorer’s table? Go back to the bench. What’s the matter with you?’”  - https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2019/11/19/20972592/lakers-frank-vogel-lebron-james-minutes-load-management-role-alex-caruso-bench-rest-anthony-davis"
"Lebron James is going to do what Lebron James is going to do. Frank Vogel had Alex Caruso ready to give him a rest in the fourth but with the score being so close, James wasn't having any of that.  &gt; “He told Alex to go back to the bench,” Vogel recalled with a laugh earlier this week. “Yelled out ‘what are you doing over there at the scorer’s table? Go back to the bench. What’s the matter with you?’”"
"Lebron averaged 7 more points on better TS than 2nd year Melo and made all nba while Melo was not even an all star. You really are a dunce, If what you said is remotely true you would be able to dig up shit in 2mins (It's Lebron fucking James).   Lebron has been ridiculed for coming short in the 4th quarter/not taking last minute shots or not being able to shoot better. Never has his defense been questioned to the point of what you said, btw people back then overrated Lebron defense if anything because he had highlight plays and racked up steals. Take care, next time don't lie unprovoked."
My buddy worked on their new stadium and put a Lebron James cavs Jersey in the cement foundation of their new stadium so I give him all the credit
"OK so you think  Dudley  is their glue guy, I'm saying it's Danny Green from what I saw in SA and in Toronto last year and then again this year with what he's doing with his podcast and social etc.  I don't know shit about Dudley so sure might be him.   I don't know why you gotta bring Lebron James into it? All you laker fans gotta bring Le Bron into everything.  I want to like you guys over the Clippers but man, you fans make it so hard to like the Lakers."
"&gt;	if they don’t move over for the person cleaning the floor  That’s an asshole move, yeah, but it could also be a mistake if you just were absorbed into something else like a text and didn’t see someone cleaning. Y’all are seriously out here judging someone an asshole off a few seconds of a clip where he’s stuck in an awkward situation with LeBron James 5 feet away from him... just because it involves someone who works in service. The dude is clearly just in an awkward situation.   &gt;	or if they don’t say hi to the receptionist.  So if I go up to the receptionist at a hotel and start with “I’d like to check in”, I’m suddenly an asshole because of that one action just because it was to someone working in service? This is such a small thing to judge someone’s whole character on."
Team captain? That’s hilarious if you think he’ll get near the votes as Lebron James will
James Harden/Luka Doncic/Giannis/Lebron
"He has to debate one side or the other, cuz that's the nature of the show. Of course his arguments are gonna sound like bullshit when the objective is to tear down LeBron fucking James lol"
"Would he be THIS efficient? I don’t know. Thing is, you don’t either. As I said, height does matter, but you’re removing all subtext. Players train to the physical tools they have. If LeBron James grew up on pace to be 5 inches shorter, would it not affect how he learned to play the game in the first place? As it stands, LeBron has developed his outside game with far more success than Westbrook ever has, despite being 5 inches taller.   If Westbrook was 5 inches taller, who’s to say he wouldn’t be an even worse shooter than he is now? I don’t know. We can only analyze what we have in front of us. As it stands, LeBron is taller, more efficient, and a better overall player. I also think he’s superior in the mental side of the game."
"&gt;Also, there’s volume to worry about. LeBron didn’t switch numbers because Nike made too many James 23. They’re not selling millions of KCP jerseys. They gotta worry about one backlog really.  Standard practice that's happened across multiple sports. LeBron could have bought them out. He chose not to."
"Who would you rather have last season - Joe Ingles or LeBron James?  Remember, Joe Ingles played all 82 games LeBron only played 55."
"He's never played with AD before, and never played full time point. Lebron James running full time point is always going to average more than 10 apg."
"I'm not trying to move the argument anywhere. My point from the start was exactly the same in both comments.   And it was a point backed up by your initial comment:  &gt;He still can take over the game **when every one deferred to him** like in the finals against Spain.  Your own comment pointed out that he wasn't taking over until he was deferred to...  When on a team where people are deferring to Kobe/KG, Kobe is the better player. KG was a top MVP candidate for an entire season **without** being deferred to.  It's arguable over who is better (but the consensus heavily leans to Kobe).   That being said, KG was still an all-time great in his own right, and I'm sorry, Kobe was not better than KG under all circumstances. That is a childish stance to take. They're both great players, but each has circumstances where they thrive.    If I said Steph Curry was a better shooter than Lebron James:  * Does it mean I'm attacking Lebron?    No.  * Does it mean I'm saying Lebron can't shoot?   No.  * Does it mean my point can be invalidated by a romanticised memory of a decade-old Olympic run?    No.  Don't be one of those embarrassing fans that take an observation about stylistic differences as an insult. I never said Kobe was bad.     ***  Back to the ""moving arguments"", between those two comments I even repeated the exact same point:  &gt;In 2008, KG was 3rd in MVP voting with only ~13FGA per game. KG could be a devastating player in any environment. Kobe was a devastating player in an environment that was built around him, he could never have ranked so high with such a limited role.  and  &gt;Do you think Kobe could be an MVP candidate with 13 shots per game?  My argument didn't change at all.   By the way, do you think Kobe could be a top 3 MVP candidate while only taking 13 shots per game?"
"LeBron is good at basketball, but LeBron is a trash person who loves his money more than even appearing to be supportive of human rights. If they're black, he's with it. If they're Asian, you had better come with a full Ph D.  Fuck LeBron James."
"I like the James/AD pairing better simply because there's less overlap in their skill sets.  LeBron and Wade occupied the same space on the court, and were primarily slashers (as opposed to straight up shooters) so it took time for their abilities to mesh.  Same with LeBron and Kyrie, but to a lesser extent because Irving was (still is) a better overall shooter than Wade and LeBron.  But now you have LBJ and AD - a classic point guard and a big! They don't tend to operate in the same space on the court since Davis can space the floor and their skill sets actually compliment each other."
"how good do Anthony Davis and Lebron James look together? I know it's only 14 games, but do they look better than Kyrie/Lebron or Wade/Lebron?"
"LeBron James, with no regard for human life!"
Lol he’s played ~15 Lebron James NBA careers worth of time on Runescape! That’s an insane amount of time for ANYTHING

"The Celtics have rediscovered their biggest strength. Coming off a disappointing season marred by chemistry issues, they have surpassed even the most optimistic projections in the first month of the season. Boston is tied for the NBA’s best record (11-2) and owns the third-best net rating (plus-8.3). Even losing Gordon Hayward, who is out for the next month with a broken hand, hasn’t slowed the Celtics down much. The key has been empowering Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.  The two top-3 picks broke out in the 2018 playoffs, when Tatum was 20 and Brown was 21. Each averaged 18 points per game while leading the Celtics to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals. But instead of getting a chance to build on that success last season, the return of Hayward and Kyrie Irving from injury pushed them into the background. There were too many cooks in the kitchen in Boston. Tatum was sixth on the team in touches (45.3 per game) while Brown moved to the bench and finished ninth (31.8). The duo played only 884 minutes together last season, tied for 16th most among two-man lineups on the Celtics.  This season has been a different story. Brown is back in the starting lineup and has played 224 minutes with Tatum in just 10 games. Tatum is second in touches (67.5) and Brown is fifth (47.2). The team’s top four players in touches last season (Kyrie, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, and Marcus Morris) are gone. Their replacements have accepted smaller roles in the offense, giving Brown and Tatum the opportunity to both average career highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and free throw attempts.  The two wings are tied for fifth in net rating (plus-16.0) among all two-man units in the NBA that have played more than 200 minutes this season. Look at how they compare with the most high-profile Big Twos around the league:  Big Two Comparison  Jaylen Brown + Jayson Tatum  Minutes: 224   Net Rating: plus-16.0  LeBron James + Anthony Davis  Minutes: 297  Net Rating: plus-14.7  Giannis Antetokounmpo + Khris Middleton  Minutes: 217  Net Rating: plus-12.4  Joel Embiid + Ben Simmons  Minutes: 122  Net Rating: plus-11.5  James Harden + Russell Westbrook  Minutes: 276  Net Rating: plus-10.4  But being that dominant is about more than just getting more opportunities. Boston’s two young wings are doing more with them, too.  Brown has always been an elite athlete. Now his skill level and feel for the game are catching up with his physical tools. The biggest difference this season is his ballhandling. He doesn’t have to settle for as many jumpers, and can attack off the dribble and use his size (6-foot-7 and 223 pounds) to finish among the trees. Brown has gone from ranking in the 55th percentile of scorers when handling the ball in the pick-and-roll last season to the 81st percentile this season. The defense is sending more help his way, which makes it easier for him to set up his teammates. His assist rate has gone up while his turnover rate has gone down. Boston coach Brad Stevens can now run offense through Brown, and trust him to make good decisions.  Tatum, unlike Brown, came into the NBA with a polished offensive game. His growth has come from learning how to better use those skills. He became known for killing the flow of the offense by holding the ball and settling for long 2s, but playing like Kobe Bryant and Carmelo Anthony never made sense for him. It’s more than just the difference in eras. Tatum doesn’t possess the all-world athleticism of Kobe or the sheer mass of Carmelo. He’s a wiry player at his best when using his size (6-foot-8 and 205 pounds) and shooting touch to shoot off movement and attack closeouts. Tatum is getting fewer post-ups this season and more shots off of dribble handoffs and off-ball screens, and he’s taking 2.4 more 3s per game than last season (up to 6.3) while cutting his percentage of shots taken between 16 feet and the 3-point line in half.  The NBA is a wing-dominated league, and few wing tandems can do as many things on both ends of the floor as the new and improved versions of Brown and Tatum. They can shoot 3s, attack the rim, defend multiple positions, and grab rebounds in traffic, a skill more important than ever for perimeter players. And they are two of only eight players under 6-foot-9 averaging at least 19 points and 7 rebounds per game this season. The other six? LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Pascal Siakam, Brandon Ingram, and Russell Westbrook.  Many NBA teams don’t have one wing with the size and athleticism of Tatum and Brown, much less two. Because of that, at least one has a mismatch in almost every game. According to NBA Advanced Stats, big men like Julius Randle, Dario Saric, and Nemanja Bjelica are among the most frequent defenders on Brown this season, while Tatum has spent a lot of time being guarded by undersized perimeter defenders like Bradley Beal and Kyle Lowry.  The beauty of building a team around long and athletic forwards like Tatum and Brown is that the mismatches rarely go both ways. There are a lot of players whom they can guard who can’t guard them. They have the speed to stay in front of smaller players on the perimeter and the size to hold their own against bigger players inside. The Celtics are interchangeable on defense, especially when Marcus Smart is playing with their two young wings. They can switch every screen across three positions and take turns on the best perimeter scorers on the opposing team.  Their perimeter length covers up for their lack of size upfront. For all the noise surrounding Kyrie’s departure, the biggest concern for Boston coming into the season wasn’t at point guard but at center, where it had to replace Al Horford and Aron Baynes. Enes Kanter started on opening night, but a knee injury opened a spot for Daniel Theis, a third-year big man from Germany. While he’s averaging only 6.4 points per game on 45.6 percent shooting, he’s a smart player who cleans the glass (7.2 rebounds per game), protects the rim (1.7 blocks), and is almost always in the right position on both ends of the floor. Theis is thriving despite being the smallest starting 5 (6-foot-8, 215 pounds) in the league.  The Celtics are this year’s closest thing to the spiritual heirs of the Warriors. They don’t have the same star power, but their key players all fit into similar roles. Kemba Walker, like Steph Curry, is a smaller guard who can bomb 3s and play on and off the ball, and they surround him with big wings who can defend multiple positions, space the floor, and create their own shot. Their best lineup, when everyone is healthy, doesn’t feature anyone above 6-foot-8: Kemba, Smart, Tatum, Brown, and Hayward.  Boston still has a lot of room to get better. Tatum, for as effective as he has been from 3 (37.8 percent) this season, has been in an epic shooting slump from 2-point range. He is second-to-last in 2-point field goal percentage (41.6) among the 54 players in the NBA averaging at least 10 attempts per game. He’s shooting only 47.8 percent within three feet of the rim, a massive decline from his first two seasons, when he shot 64.7 percent. While going to the rim more often has exposed some of his physical limitations in comparison to the league’s best players, the odds are that those percentages will normalize over time.  And even though Brown will probably never be a point forward, he can still improve as a passer. His assist-to-turnover ratio has gone from 1.07-to-1 to 1.44-to-1, and it could go even higher as he gets more comfortable as a playmaker. The growth he has shown in his first four seasons is encouraging. Brown came into the league with the same questions about his jumper and offensive polish that surrounded other überathletic wings like Justise Winslow and Stanley Johnson, and has answered them in ways his peers have yet to address.  Brown and Tatum are leading a legitimate youth movement in Boston. The Celtics have the least experienced roster in the NBA, with no one over 30. The team is getting contributions from rookies Grant Williams and Carsen Edwards, as well as second-year big man Robert Williams III. Stevens is still figuring out his rotation, going with as many as 11 players on any given night.  What Boston has done over the first month is not a fluke. This is a young team with a ton of depth and waves of athletes at every position. Instead of taking a step back after losing Kyrie and Horford, they are taking a step forward. The biggest question is not how they get through the regular season but how they match up in the playoffs with other elite teams in the East.  There are two 7-foot Leviathans standing in their way—Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid. The Celtics were steamrolled by Giannis in their second-round series last season, as he averaged 30.0 points on 58.5 percent shooting, 11.8 rebounds, and 6.0 assists over the last four games. And he has been even more dominant this season. A series against Embiid could expose the Celtics’ lack of size at center. Theis is much smaller than Horford and Baynes, who always gave the Sixers big man trouble last year. Boston may have to count on Robert Williams, who has shined in limited minutes, or hope they can go small and run Embiid off the floor.  The Celtics are a team of really good players, one that will need someone to make the leap to greatness in order to win a title. Tatum and Brown are still a long way from reaching the level of Giannis or Kawhi. The good news for Boston is that its young building blocks are only 21 and 23, respectively. Everyone may have jumped the gun on them last season. But the Celtics are now one of the best teams in the NBA—and the best version of this team is still a couple of years away."

Was LeBron James created in a lab and inseminated into his mom unknowingly? How come we have never seen someone like him before?
"There’s some history with Nike coming in and fucking up Jerseys though across sports.  They couldn’t get the eagles green correct for 4 seasons or something.   http://es.pn/1C2rqbv  Started then, but fans were pissed for years.  I think it’s happened in Soccer too.  Also, there’s volume to worry about. LeBron didn’t switch *numbers* because Nike made too many James 23. They’re not selling *millions* of KCP jerseys. They gotta worry about one backlog really.  If he changes his number, and Davis takes 23 next season, that would be the time to also change colors and designs again.   It’s legitimately an issue too. Fans are pretty vocal about the jersey color and doesn’t matter where the decision ultimately lands, Nike loses money if it’s wrong."
"1. 10 games to establish a trend, 20 to take it seriously. 40 games should be considered a norm for the season.   2. Jaylen but I'm biased. I think the jury is still out on both prospects. I'm more open to giving Jaylen his contract given the team, conference, and requirements for success he has in his circumstances.    3. Everyone laments whiffed top picks. You're not going to tell me everyone who passed on Steph Curry is happy about the decision in hindsight. Ben has two to four seasons of grace left. He's still too talented to trade especially given the health of Embid. Imagine being the team that traded James Harden prior to his maturation...   4. Golden State given current injuries. Otherwise you're looking at the Cavaliers or Hornets. Celtics or Clippers for the deepest. These teams should be able to send squads out in waves when fully healthy.   5. LAL - They will live and die by Lebron this year. LAC - It's time to find out how great Paul George really is. HOU - Rotations + 3 position. Not having a dynamic 3 is going to be a problem come playoff time. PHI - The health of Embid. MIL - Injury bug/Depth. BOS - Time. They need their young talent to grow quickly by the playoffs. HOU is the most worrying. I don't know how they will hold up in a 7 game series.    6. RJ Barrett is really good. Let's see what they can get in the offseason/draft. Go ahead and write off this current season as pure development for Barrett.    Bonus: The NBA title boils down to LAL, LAC, or PHI barring injury. Everyone else's roster is just not good enough as currently constructed."
I dunno guys...I think Lebron James might be good at basket ball
"In other news, Lebron James is really fucking great at basketball."
LeBron James is the best player on the planet.
"Who cares. The lakers benefit from fucking 100 calls per game and these idiots are like.  WHAT HOW DARE DEY CALL SOMETHING AGAINST LEBRON ""I LOVE CHINA"" JAMES."
The downside that comes with putting a 5’11 guard on LeBron James
"Who said anything about potential, NBA players have been injured in cameraman collisions as recently as last month. Fred VanVleet got injured. LeBron James has been injured this way before as well. If those injures didn't change it, then any near miss certainly wont."
Anthony Davis &gt;&gt; Lebron James  Lakers are too good with AD
I just got out of Chinese prison after 17 years. Is LeBron James the worst free throw shooter ever?

Why do you keep talking and James harden lol.  We're just talking about load management and people's memory if it should be win. We already saw that happened. I'm saying history will repeat itself and no one would care.   Especially if kawhi went through LeBron to get it.  Its not about who's anall time great. It's about load management and people caring.

"2018 was a stacked draft class. Ayton had elite length/athleticism and produced in high school and college. Bagley was ranked number 1 in the 2019 draft class over Zion and RJ Barrett before he reclassified, he was hype in high school and then he had an elite 1 and done college career with elite athleticism and freak motor. Luka had an argument to be top pick that draft class but I think the others did as well. Luka is maybe the most accomplished predraft player of all time but high school and 1 year college production as well as athleticism has to count for something otherwise you would have to admit you would have taken Luka over Lebron James. If Luka shot a little bit better he might have been drafted over them still."

Luka ‘dreams don’t come true’ Doncic and LeBron ‘just a kid from Akron’ James
How young are you?  The Lakers get media coverage when they're awful and are losing 50 games. The Lakers plus LeBron James? Might as well just not turn on ESPN if you want to hear about anything else.
his rookie to sophomore increase is pretty similar to LeBron James who didn't win MIP either since he was just too good.  LeBron wasn't even in the *top 25 votes* that year.
"So would LeBron, Steph Curry, James Harden, Dame, Luka, Kemba etc"
his rookie to sophomore stats are actually kinda similar to LeBron James who also didn't win MIP for being good.
"James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Lebron James are all shooting 34% from 3. Kawhi Leonard is shooting 28% from 3. 36% is good."
"James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Lebron James are all shooting 34% from 3. Kawhi Leonard is shooting 28% from 3. 36% is pretty good."
White James harden (not lebron cuz not athletic enough)
Luka is the black lebron james
"Yes.   Unless the coach is a complete moron, they build the offense around him unless they also have LeBron James on that team. In that case, they really only need to coach defense at that point."
More like the white LeBron James.
A underrated feature of his game is the he has a LeBron James-like ability to dominate the front page page of r/nba
who the fuck is lebron to give that nickname to anyone. didn’t he just calling himself king James? Not like anyone gave him that
"LeBron James, is a Los Angeles Laker."
"Even lebron james could barely beat the warriors one time out of 4, why does harden get criticized for losing to the same team?"

&gt;Lebron James
My evidence is Lebron James. At worst the 2nd greatest player to ever live.   Case fucking closed.
"Upvote, man, You’re completely right.  Unfortunately, box scores are by far the easiest way to ingest things with the rapid pace and plethora of games in this league. It takes time to properly understand what’s happening, and people just don’t have it.  Stats tell a story but they don’t tell the whole story. I think Luka is legit, but it’s why I think Harden and Giannis won’t ever be successful in the playoffs. I don’t really think that kind of system works in playoff basketball, unless you have LeBron James."
 Let me introduce you to front court guard Lebron James
"What time line are we living on?!  You pick and roll Rajon Rondo off you, ending up with Anthony Davis on you,  Danny Green on the strong side, Lebron James on the weak side, pump fake Anthony Davis for the blow by to take the mid-range and Dwight Howard comes up from the low post for the block.  Dudes waking up from a 9+ year long coma would literally have their heads explode."
You said LeBron James contributed to his panic episodes which is part of mental health.   And Kevin love came out and disputed it.  Windhorst said Kevin love felt beleaguered by LeBron James either directly or indirectly.  That's a big jump to LeBron James is causing someone panic attacks. 😂
lebron only has like 6 in his career. Its not an easy achievement at all. When it comes to high scoring triple doubles james harden is one of your best bets.
"I honestly don’t know exactly what Luka would have to do to surpass Dirk as GOAT in my book. Cuz Dirk didn’t just lead us to a ring, he fucking destroyed Kobe and the Lakers, then bested Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook (on the same fucking team!), then just went Disney Sports Movie on LeBron, Wade, and Bosh. Add his fucking fever game in that series and you got a hell of a mountain to climb if you wanna beat that. I’d say if Luka gets 2 rings for Dallas, he’d definitely be on par with Dirk imo."
Do you think LeBron James will make the hall of fame?
Draymond Green in a green Celtics jersey Sun Yue in a Suns jersey Lebron James in a Kings jersey Magic Johnson in a Magic jersey
"Lebron is already much better than those two so don't see your point.   He is a guy who takes very good care of his body and is 6'9 260.   Paul and Nash are small guards that had injury issues throughout their careers.   In terms of pure playmaking ability and technique, James is nowhere close to Nash or Paul.   His size gives him an advantage in seeing over defenses, but those guys were maestros at dissecting defenses."
Do you have an example of Lebron James hooking a player to get a foul?
"the second link for the Lebron James trip was one of the worst articles I have ever read, holy shit. Essentially says its possible that Lebron did steroids because someone with his initials signed into a miami steroid clinic LMAO."
"LeBron 'Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson' James"
"I think Giannis is the MVP. He's leading his team in all stats except for blocks. In 12 games so far this season, he has led his team in points, rebounds, and assists 30 of 36 times. 3 for 3 in all but 5 games.   If you go off of box plus minus Giannis(14.2) is #1, LeBron(11.1) is #2, and Harden(9.1) is #3. Paul George is 24.9 BPM through his first 2 games, lmao.  I think the MVP discussion will largely come down to how these players perform in head to head matchups. The Rockets have had a pretty easy schedule so far. Played the Clippers without PG and Kawhi. Harden also looked like a dumpster fire in the season opener going 2-13 against the Bucks.         If James Harden wins the MVP this season, I would really enjoy seeing how the Chinese media covers the news since the Rockets are blacklisted."

"[LeBron James: Not 1, not 2, not 3....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYe8B--jrbs)  I mean, KD took it to a new level. But let’s not get revisionist with the Heatles."
"They make some fair points.   &gt;The Lakers currently rank 27th in schedule strength, **meaning their schedule has been determined to be the fourth easiest** to this point in the season…As previously mentioned, their schedule has been one of the easiest in the entire NBA. With that being said, the wins haven’t come nearly as easy as they should have. Of their last six wins, four have come by five points or less.    &gt;   &gt;A win is a win, and the margin of victory counts for nothing, but that isn’t the issue…**The area for concern is how much effort has been needed in order to pull them out.**   &gt;   &gt;With AD averaging just 66 games a season for his career, and LeBron entering his 17th season after playing just 55 games in year 16, health is indeed something to monitor for this superstar duo. To this point, piling up November wins has served as much more of a priority for the Lakers than preserving LeBron and AD for the long grind that is an NBA season. **LeBron James is 8th in the NBA in minutes per game at 35.2, and AD is right behind him at 34.8.**   &gt;   &gt;**With these two stars amongst the league’s lead for minutes played, it is evident that the Lakers currently don’t feel confident enough in their ability to win games without riding LeBron and AD 35 minutes a night.**   &gt;   &gt;**It has been discussed that the current success of the Lakers can be met with equal skepticism considering the load LeBron and AD have needed to carry in order to squeak past bad teams. The opposite has been true for the Clippers, as they have made preservation of their superstars a point of emphasis.**   &gt;   &gt;**While LeBron is 8th in the league in minutes per game, Kawhi currently sits at just 53rd.** Paul George’s 29.0 MPG rank 92nd, placing his minutes in an even more manageable position than Kawhi’s. Perhaps even more important than the light load of minutes per game has been the number of games actually played.   &gt;   &gt;**For the Clippers, it is easy to see why not only will this level of success be easily sustainable, but it will also drastically ascend. They have needed very little from their new superstar duo, but it is only a matter of time before very little is no longer all they get.**"
Ty Lue just looks happier and healthier now that he doesn't have to work with that life-sucking LeBron James.
How she gonna label an entire fanbase racist when they're showing up to games and AD is sitting in the bench and not playing. His agent Rich Paul is forcing the trade so he can play with his biggest client LeBron James. Plus isn't NO mostly black 🤣🤣🤣 espn full of liberals
"Clippers, it would have the best storyline, plus LeBron James lives rent free in Kyle’s head."
That's some new (and very random) information right there.  Lebron James has never scored more than 23 points on the night before a lunar eclipse.
Great source clip. This was one of the examples mentioned in the article:  Lucas Nogueira dropping his shorts to his knees as Derrick Favors stood at the line in 2017. (Favors missed.) Kobe Bryant deploying the cliffhanger on Kyle Korver (87.7% career free throw shooter) in 2013 with 15 seconds left in a one-point game. (Korver missed.) **LeBron James touching Gilbert Arenas on the shoulder in the 2006 playoffs and saying something to him in a one-point game. (Arenas missed.)**
James Harden and Lebron also dont get enough credit for being the only ones to really challenge that team assembled to be unbeatable
Top 10 players right now according to fivethirtyeight Total RAPTOR.   1. Jimmy Butler  2. James Harden 3. Luka Doncic 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Will Barton 6. Lebron James 7. KAT 8. Montrezl Harrell 9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Aron Baynes
"Correct in comparison. LeBron played better players hands down.  Who did Jordan face that was at the time better than Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, James Harden, Russel Westbrook, etc?   Big wow he beat up on Byron Scott.  Gtfoh"
Doesn’t LeBron call his family the James Gang lol
I guess Lebron James can never the GOAT in your eyes after joining Miami Heat?
"damn i legit thought this post was "" luka doncic is closer to james harden , with better defense than lebron james "" i was like wtf . then i realize i haven't slept today lol"
"Probably get downvoted, but black athletes tend to only be revered when winning. There are numerous examples of how people can tolerate a person of color when playing for their team, but off court, the racism kicks in.   Lebron James got that in Los Angeles with the N-word sprayed painted on his house. The notion of ""Shut Up and Play"" is an extension of that.   Historically in the South, black folks were prized on their athletic ability, and that notion is still around today."
"I don’t know how LeBron feels/felt about the letter, nor do I *personally* think it was racist.  I just don’t have a problem if his camp took it that way. That letter came off as some entitled rich asshole who felt he was owed one LeBron James.  I think that just makes him an asshole. But if I was actually in that position, I may feel differently."
never said that https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/05/scottie-pippen-michael-jordan-lebron-james-debate-opinions-timeline-nba
"LeBron James, and Kyrie Irving"
No he definitely can. Judging his capabilities based on his only injury season at age 34 isn't it. You think a 25 year old Lebron James team would be barely .500 in the West? Hell no.
"He's great but he's just not LeBron, KD, Kawhi or James Harden"
I guess it’s a chicken or the egg type thing. Maverick Carter isn’t a marketing genius because he is able to successfully market LeBron James. LeBron markets himself and Carter just reaps the rewards and claims success.  LeBron would have been fine with with a disabled squirrel as his agent. He’s one of the best-known athletes on the planet so of course he’s going to get paid. LeBron was loyal to him and put him in a position to succeed but any agent LeBron has would have been successful.
"""That was LeBron James"""
"I also shit on Rich Paul because he would be an absolute nobody is he wasn’t friends with LeBron. Most agents have some formal legal training or at least experience in business negotiations, skills that are important when it comes to contract negotiation. Paul has none of that and instead hires lawyers to do all that for him and his clients. So what does he actually do?  He just attends parties and pals around with James and acts like he accomplishes something because he got TT a good contract when it was only because of LeBron."
"I'm not a Kyrie fan, but I do find it interesting how just 4 years ago people were arguing that Irving deserved finals MVP over James because he hit ""the shot"" but Kyrie really hasn't done anything since. He went to the Celts and hurt that team, now he's with the Nets and is sitting by himself. LeBron went back to the finals after Irving hit that shot. Irving hasn't done a thing. Just throwing it out there that maybe, just maybe, that shot, was Irvings Apex."
I’d say Tom Brady &amp; Lebron James have kicked Father Times ass
*laughs in LeBron James
"Fun fact, LeBron James was never exactly 27 years, 7 months, and 7 days old."
"I really don't think so. ""Playoff mode"" LeBron would've done it last year if he could in regards to doing James Harden numbers."
"1-1, No one on 16-17 golden state could guard Anthony Davis next to LeBron James"
"Lmao did you just try to tell me that Lebron isn’t in the same tier as MJ, Kareem and Bill AND call me a nephew? To say that Bill Russell is in the top tier and not Lebron is one of the biggest nephew and hater takes I’ve ever seen. Lebron James is the second greatest basketball player ever and if you can’t see that then you don’t know anything about basketball. Lebron is miles ahead Timmy who is a top 10 player don’t forget that."
"Luka is Overrated, dont compare that guy to LeBron James"
"Why does it always have to be considered disrespect to MJ whenever someone ranks LeBron higher than him. It’s LeBron James, been dominating the league for 17 years now.  So annoying when people “apologize” to Mike whenever someone says LBJ is a Bball player we’ve never seen before. Mike was a better and pure scorer. But all around, was not clearly better than LBJ so it shouldn’t be considered disrespect."
He's also a fraction of the player that LeBron James is
Lebron James Harden is all I got
"To be fair, this is *LeBron James* we're talking about. Second option or not, he could've played better (as you said, a bucket here and there and maybe they win it all). Seems like people are starting to give him a pass for 2011 while simultaneously (for example) shitting on Steph for not winning FMVP behind KD in 2017 and 2018."
"Let the record show, this counts as comparing Jerome Robinson to lebron james"
Lebron James
LeBron James Harden should be enough.
Lebron James.
They just got beat. Lebron played his role as the 2nd option well. 18/7/7 for the series. Made more 3 pointers than Dirk. They lost a close series. If he or someone else makes a couple more shots the Heat win that series with Lebron putting up those numbers.   But you're not going to get maximum Lebron James when he's standing in the corner and being used as a 3 &amp; D player. We got maximum Wade instead and it was great but just not enough. Next year they switched and it was.
"What argument is there for Kobe over these following players  Michael Jordan  Kareem Abdul Jabbar   Lebron James  Tim Duncan  Magic Johnson  Hakeem Olajuwon  Wilt Chamberlain  Larry Bird  Bill Russell  ?  Then you have players like Oscar, Dr J, Kevin Garnett etc who can all be put over Kobe too"
LeBron James because I started playing and watching basketball in 2012 and he has been unbelievable since
LeBron James because he's good
How dare Luka manipulate his own time of birth such that comparisons of himself would look favourable against that of LeBron James at his own age except 305 days younger. What a rascal!
You just got done saying reputation matters and here is a line up the lakers can roll out: Danny Green- All defense second team Avery Bradley- All defense first team LeBron James- All defense second team Anthony Davis- All defense first team Dwight Howard- All defense first team  You were saying?
I think you'd find this interesting: https://blogs.fangraphs.com/lets-imagine-a-baseball-playing-lebron-james/
&gt;let's stop pretending like the only reason Luka is this good is because of his pro experience in Europe.  no one was pretending that  i DO believe luka's pro experience in europe will cause him to reach his peak earlier in his nba career than greats like lebron james. it speeds his development imo
"It’s pretty funny how triggered people, especially white folks, got at Lebron saying Morey was uneducated about what the consequences of his tweet would be. Morey’s college education has nothing to do with the subject. James poorly worded the comments but the reaction to them was a massive overreaction especially to specific words he used like misinformed and uneducated. If one watches the whole roughly 8 minute interview it’s clear what he’s referring to since he clarified shortly after during the same interview. But people wanted to feel outraged so they chose to interpret it however they wished."
"Haha, yeah.  I'd rather be downvoted a million times on Reddit than be a LeBron James fan. Can you imagine being that gullible?"
"Mark Price was definitely better and for a long time too. Two-way monster Nance was too. It’s actually a logical crime to say he was better than Brad Daugherty as well.  Kyrie has one playoff run that was good. One or two healthy high level regular seasons. He was a chucking unhealthy loser with some of the worst defense in the NBA the 3 seasons before LeBron. Current Trae Young without half the passing talent and a bad body.  I will never let how bad his defense was that entire era go, or how he literally tried to hijack the offense for an entire round against Indiana in 2017 while getting smoked by Teague. If not for him that series wouldn’t have been so close. Played like trash against Toronto the next round, and had one good series against Boston. Worst mental defense and shot selection ever against GS in the finals. Such an overrated player. Spent his entire time in Cleveland clashing with coaches and players even pre-LeBron.   He gets more acclaim than Mark Price or ANY of the names I mentioned that anchored some amazing Cavs teams that had no player named LeBron James on it? All for one step back? Give me a break.  Kevin Love is still there too btw."
"I mean, there's a difference between hooking Kawhi Leonard's arm to draw a foul and trying to draw contact. Or jumping on a player's back to draw a foul. Yeah, I think it's pretty easy to separate Luka and James Harden.  Luka's method of drawing fouls has been something even someone like LeBron used to do in Miami when he flopped a lot. We've seen nothing at the level of James Harden. Doesn't mean James Harden isn't great, but it's not fun to watch."
"lebron had the whole 2019 playoffs for all the load management and taco Tuesdays he requires to stay fresh for an entire season.  a real answer though hes known to spend a lot of time and money in taking care of his body.  diets, workouts, treatments, therapy etc. etc. he probably does it all.  im not surprised hes so durable.  https://amp.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-body-care-workouts-diet-insane-2017-10  https://cleveland.cbslocal.com/2016/11/15/lebron-james-spends-about-1-5-million-per-year-to-maintain-his-body/"
He couldn't even complete basic hook shots or drop steps on those little guys in the post. It was REALLY embarrassing and something he took to heart that off season. Kirk Goldsberry [wrote up a great piece on Grantland in 2013](https://grantland.com/features/how-lebron-james-transformed-game-become-highly-efficient-scoring-machine/) on Lebron's evolution as a post scorer due to that series.
"I must've added wrong, I got 75 for Jordan and 74 for LeBron.  Either way, so they are very close in terms of finals opponents but Jordan blew Lebron out of the water in terms of results.  He also won more rings vs expected even when you account for their own teams as well  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-should-lebrons-finals-record-hurt-his-legacy/  &gt; if you add up the pre-series odds in the table above, you get an expected championship count of 2.8 for James — meaning he’s somehow running 0.2 titles above expectation, despite his record. Although that trails Jordan (who won 1.9 times more than we’d expect from the pre-series odds)"
Atlanta Hawks - Dominique Wilkins   Boston Celtics - Bill Russell   Brooklyn Nets - Jason Kidd   Cleveland Cavaliers - Lebron James   Chicago Bulls - Michael Jordan   Charlotte Hornets - Alonzo Mourning   Dallas Mavericks - Dirk Nowitzki   Denver Nuggets - Dikembe Mutumbo   Detroit Pistons - Isiah Thomas   Golden State Warriors - Steph Curry   Houston Rockets - Hakeem Olajuwon   Indiana Pacers - Reggie Miller   Los Angles Lakers - Magic Johnson   Los Angles Clippers - Bob McAdoo   Memphis Grizzlies - Zach Randolph   Miami Heat - Dwayne Wade   Minnesota Timberwolves - Kevin Garnett   Milwaukee Bucks - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   New York Knicks - Willis Reed   New Orleans Pelicans - Anthony Davis   Orlando Magic - Shaquille O’Neal   Philadelphia 76ers - Julius Erving   Portland Trailblazers- Clyde Drexler   Phoenix Suns - Steve Nash   Sacramento Kings - Chris Webber   San Antonio Spurs - Tim Duncan   Seattle SuperSonics - Gary Payton   Toronto Raptors - Vince Carter   Utah Jazz - Karl Malone   Washington Wizards - Wes Unseld  Idk why he didnt put in okc so here  OKC Thunder- Kevin Durant
"Ronaldo was lucky to play in one of the most talented Brazilian squads of all time? really? and the Real Madrid where Cristiano Ronaldo played? Casillas, Pepe, Ramos, Varane, Marcelo, Xabi Alonso, Ozil, Casemiro, Modric, Isco, Kroos, James Rodríguez, Di María, Higuaín, Benzema, Bale... do you think that Durant is so much better than LeBron? because Durant smashed LeBron in two consecutive finals, you know. obviously was only Durant against LeBron, like Cristiano Ronaldo winning all his titles alone, without the help of the biggest collection of superstars in the history of the sports AND the notorious help of the referees. dude, stop with the statsheets and go to watch some games"
"We don’t have to wait in see lmfao, he dominates the playoffs every single time he makes an appearance, and the only exception has been 2011. He is very obviously still the best player in the world and until he disappoints in the playoffs, we have no reason to doubt that. If you think we need to wait and see, I don’t think you’ve watched very much postseason lebron. His vision is the best it’s ever been, and he is still a freak athlete who can jump out of the building. He will dominate in the playoffs, there’s really no question at this point. If he doesn’t, then I’m wrong, but I have zero reason to doubt he will.   Also, there’s a difference between prime lebron James and playoff lebron James. They’re two different players"
LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo    2. Luka Dončić    3. LeBron James    4. James Harden    5. Kawhi Leonard    6. Anthony Davis    7. Jayson Tatum    8. Nikola Jokic    9. Pascal Siakam    10. Joel Embiid
One has Lebron James and solid team around him. The other one is Davis   Davis has been stat padding in mediocre teams his whole career
So Lebron at year 17 is Magic in his prime with the ability to still dunk like... Lebron James?
[There was an article on 538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-james-is-the-new-steph-curry/) showing that LeBron is actually the best shooter in the league at greater than 28 feet.

"Everybody gets mocked for giving themselves nickname, not just Kobe. Embiid gets made fun of for calling himself The Process, LeBron get tons of shit for calling himself King James. Weird thing to point out thou when talking about best players in that era. All great players have haters"
They need to just create a LeBron James award when he retires. For outstanding performance *and* resilience. To be awarded to players in the MVP running but have been in the league for more than 10 seasons.
"Laughing stock is what the Knicks have been, not you guys. You guys were always near the top of the standings, and you just happened to run into a man named Lebron James. A part of me hopes he signs with you guys this summer just to play out his career next to his best friend in the city he loves."
"Against Lebron James. I'm not saying WB or DD is better, but its disingenuous to compare being swept by Lebron to losing to the Jazz and Portland."
No  I don’t want a star  Not one bit lol  Even if we got Lebron Fucking James we aren’t going anywhere.
"Listen here, dont you dare question our suffering with luke  This is the dude that would bench the hot hand because he had set rotations. This is the same guy who would make Ingram run “point” but then proceed to make him pass the ball then let him stand in the corner.  This is the dude that put lebron james in a 1-4 high offense  This is the same fucking dude that misused brook lopez so bad he literally cried on the bench in frustration."
"**World**: Luka Doncic, Andrew Wiggins, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kristaps Porzingis, Joel Embiid  **USA**: James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Karl-Anthony Towns"
“Lebron James Lakers”   Yet he hasn’t contributed to a single banner. When did you become a Lakers Fan ? Yesterday ? Or when KD bounced from the Warriors ?
also the Lebron James Lakers have 14 more championships then the Houston Rockets
LeBron James wins the assist title in his **17th year** in the league.
Against Lebron James primarily.
Cleveland and Lebron James
Tonight Dejounte is the reason got a wide open 3 because he decided to hard double off of LeBron James. That's just a stupid decision. He also lets guys get a free run to the rim at least once a game because he goes for a steal he doesn't have to. Like I said I really question if he's actually helping the defense.
Congrats to Lebron James for being #1 in all-time LeFuckYou3s
You think any of the Europeans have anywhere near the ball IQ of Lebron James?

I think in a 7 game series Luka, Giannis and Jokic could will team Europe to 2 wins. This isn't even conidering Steph Curry or Kevin Durant who would clearly be starters for team USA.   Now if you combine Europe and Africa then I think it gets a little interesting."
Can we agree that lebron james might be good one day?
No.   Steph Curry James Harden LeBron James Kawhi Leonard Anthony Davis
&gt; Wins championship “No shit you win with Lebron James and AD. Lmao.  So they're saying we're just really good. Nice
“Teammates praise other teammate.” Wow what a source of proof lol.   I provided you a video. You’re giving me his teammates saying he doesn’t flop. You think they aren’t gonna praise him? Would be dumb to hate on your own teammate.   Funniest thing is that I’m not even the [only one](https://popculture.com/sports/amp/2019/10/23/lebron-james-draws-attention-season-opening-flop/) who noticed that flop from him against the Clippers. He still flops when it’s convenient. Idk why you’re trying to die on this hill.   And why’re you even replying to me like 2 days later? Was it that big of a deal? I thought you asked me to block you.
15-2 “They haven’t been tested. Easy schedule.”    Beats good teams “It’s the regular season. Playoffs are all that matters”   Wins championship “No shit you win with Lebron James and AD. Lmao. Lebron needs a second superstar to win anything”
LeBron “the black doncic” James
"We get that there are reasons to dislike someone at times, but to actively celebrate failure is wild. That’s more of what ppl are saying here.   Lots of hateful folks literally have no other purpose on this sub than to wait for a player to make a mistake and then absolutely troll ppl over it.  Like I don’t like Lebron James, but I’m not in threads where his team loses or he makes a mistake joining in on a circlejerk to get out all my anger/angst."
LeBron James wins MVP in his **17th year** in the league.
article from 2017 when the lakers were a lottery team and the dodgers were in the World Series. The lakers now have Lebron James which alone is enough to get them the extra 1% to move ahead of the dodgers
Lebron James people.
LeBron James good
Lebron James just running us over
The only reason I'd pick the Lakers over the Clippers in a playoff series is LeBron James. He's one of the only players I trust to truly dominate
look at the play-by-play. It's just LeBron James assists
"I made the same joke a couple of years ago, saying that the Cleveland Browns would legitamately be a better team if Kevin Love and LeBron James were on their rosters.   Not too far from the truth here, I doubt."
Lol you can’t be serious. Lavine over LeBron James? Even with the age difference lol come on my man
"He plays who's in front of him. He's LeBron James, his numbers are probably sustainable"
Counterpoint: LeBron James
"dude, it really isnt a big deal to admit that you're wrong.   &gt;villainous character. The top heel is the dominant monster at the top that everyone hates the most.  dominant monster at the top. how is pat bev a dominant monster at the top? he uses lebron james and kd as examples. it doesnt have to explicitly say anything. it's called reading comprehension."
+ Lebron James
Chappelle racial draft. We trade our first pick Jackie Chan for Lebron James. Siiiiike. We keep Jackie and take Lebron for nothing in return - the China way!
I’m kinda secretly hoping this thread will just be full of Lebron James. Some being spelled funny.
LeBron James
Lebron James is a coward.
"A few years ago I hated Kanter and really admired Lebron. Now I don't even want to like Kanter but I respect him, and meanwhile have lost literally every ounce of respect for James. Shit is weird, yo."
"People's Daily supports LeBron James: Basketball teaches us what is ""double standard"".  [https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/a716fd45ly1g8124b6pifj20u00u044o.jpg](https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/a716fd45ly1g8124b6pifj20u00u044o.jpg)"
"This is another important subject. The tweet itself means nothing and has no power in itself especially coming from someone who is not known outside of NBA. Heck I doubt many NBA causal fans know that he is the General Manager of the Houston Rockets without reading up on him.   Yet with all this said, here we all are discussing what China is doing or has done. To add fuel to the fire, a known player in Lebron James states publicly that such a simple tweet has financial ramifications."
Lebron James says something pro China.
"It's been almost a whole day. Still no one has answered my original question, just called me dumb and moved on. Why is LeBron James supporting China all of a sudden? If you don't have a good answer, just admit it."
"It's been almost a whole day. Still no one has answered my original question, just called me dumb and moved on. Why is LeBron James supporting China all of a sudden? If you don't have a good answer, just admit it."
Exactly the point. So why is LeBron James suddenly trying to change his political views?
Lebron James
&gt;I do. One option gets me a million dollars. The other option has no bearing on the outcome of the protests.  Lebron James is worth half a billion dollars. He's making 1 million every two weeks if he just has his money in mutual funds by not doing anything.  This would be closer to if someone offered you a McChicken that had been on the floor for awhile to come out against human rights.
"From my position as a basketball aficionado, i would be happy to concur that there is indeed not a chance to be stood whilst competing against both Lebron James and Anthony Davis"
"No, the question basically implied you need to have a certain degree or stance to speak up to injustice in the world. Even if he didn't have that in mind, he should've known better that it would've appear like that under these circumstances. Like, you know, the man of the hour himself, LeBron James.  Look at the Big Brain on you."
"Fuck LeBron James, fucking hypocrite! From today, tank mother fucker tank to the bottom!"
LeBron James may break his assist record in a game this season!
"""It's because it doesn't affect me and I have a zero percent chance of affecting it. ""  Lebron james and the NBA clearly have affected the conversation. Get your foot out of your mouth  LBJ is just out for his money, accept that and walk away. People do care about what happens to Hong Kong."
"But remarkable implies surprise. It shouldn't be surprising at all to anyone that LeBron James and Anthony Davis, of all players, work amazingly well together. I don't even think anyone can envision anything better out of current players if they wanted a dream duo."
"I dunno, if [even local media can't try and spin what he said,](https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2019-10-15/lebron-james-nba-china-daryl-morey-tweet-plaschke) there might be some booing on opening night for the Chosen One."
Ahhhh so great. Fuck Lebron James
"Well, turns out not actually in the taped segment, but he was apparently in the building and met LeiBron.   https://www.deseret.com/2018/11/23/20659564/how-utah-jazz-star-donovan-mitchell-drew-inspiration-from-attending-lebron-james-decision-at-age-13"
If you are in the West and facing one Lebron James and AD. You are in a heap of trouble.  Handling  Everyone's  Ass  Professionally
Free lebron james
"What an absolute dumpster fire.   I’m willing to bet when Morey tweeted that, he had no idea that it would cause a full on international incident. Free speech aside, I think if he had a mulligan he’d take it in a heartbeat.   And can we talk about LeBron for a minute? Fucking hell.  Not only did he look incredibly misinformed and ignorant in trying to distance himself / the NBA brand from Morey, he came across as selling out.   Reading between the lines, he was essentially saying that Morey fucked it up for himself and others across the league and should have kept his thoughts to himself. To hear him blatantly saying ridiculous shit like this after being so outspoken about social issues (e.g. BLM, police brutality, Kaepernick) pretty much destroys his credibility in my opinion.   Apparently he called a meeting when they were in China because he was nervous they were going to get questions about it. Turns out he was right and his concerns were valid given what a mess he has made out of this.  Sucks that he got thrust into the spotlight with a microphone, but you’re LeBron James."
The epitome of Lebron James
"Simple, because 1) he's the only one who's said anything at all and received no support from anyone else and 2) he was almost assuredly threatened to be fired if he didn't delete it. No one is gonna fire Lebron James if he says anything."
"LeBron James became embroiled in the China-NBA-Hong Kong flap, when he called out Morey for his tweet saying, “So just be careful what we tweet and say and we do, even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.”  He also said Morey was “misinformed or not really educated” on the situation.  LeBron jump in this himself. Hypocrisy is one thing but this guy was parroting lines straight out of the CPP playbook."
So [hmmm](https://www.theballzone.com/2019/10/16/lebron-james-pressured-adam-silver-to-punish-rockets-gm-daryl-morey-for-controversial-tweet/)
Lebron James with no regard for /r/NBA's feelings.
I mean sure if the discrepancy is that much. I cant claim I would pass up that much either.  But clearly lebron james has a lot more fuck you money than you or I
"Exactly. I think Lebron up to this point has been really good at PR and knowing when to shut up. Say it was because of the money or whatever it is his best interest. I think by taking a side (his comments were not even of approval towards China but who cares right? If he's not on your side he's against you)  he made a mistake. Hw hard was it to say ""not informed enough"" like Steph did.   The same reason this sub now hates him to death is because... well... he is Lebron James and whatever it is he says will have consequences. It just happened this time he went against the ""masses"" view of the conflict dictated by the mainstream media.  No other person in the league would have had even HALF of the backlash (or encouragement if it was the ppposite) like Lebron."

Jesus Christ. That’s Jason “LeBron James” Bourne
"What a fucking depressing take dude.  Change is never going to be the easy option, that's why we're all averse to it as humans. But fighting for change is the only way to make it happen, inch by inch. Justice may be elusive, however it's there if you search long enough. But if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for nothing. People underestimate the cultural power that these athletes have, that's why it's so disappointing when people like LeBron say what they say. Yeah, he's one guy, and alone he can't change a country with a population of 1 billion people. But on the other hand, he's LeBron fucking James, if he takes a stand, there's no way people don't follow, and that's the inch. One guy can't do it alone, but inspiring others to do SOMETHING is a step in the right direction."
"Pasch was just saying some general stuff about Zion and Jackson just randomly said ""He's not LeBron James"" which seemed to ruffle some feathers"
"""Are you on the Zion hype train?""    ""He is not Lebron James""    Fucking idiot"
"The fact that I'm not Lebron James and don't have his influence actually weakens your argument as I have done more speaking critically of China and have far more to lose in my quality of life than Lebron ever would if he did.  I'm not envious of Lebron's life whatsoever. Fame and fortune is nice, but there is literally nothing appealing to me about having to go through the physical grind and rehab of being a top level athlete being shuffled around the country year after year away from my family to make a living while the whole world scrutinizes me. So don't even use that strawman. I'm critical of Lebron because he's showing that despite prior rhetoric his activsim has a dollar price and he will ignore injustice at the highest level if it means more money. Either be consistent or have the integrity to own that you don't give shit about anything but money. You totally can, you just can't play both sides of the fence and not look bad."
Hes going to be in a very defined role with lebron james. He's going to get his points if hes in the right area.
I fucking love lebron James as a player He’s the reason I got into basketball I think he is a top 2 all time player it’s either him or Michael   Chinese lebron best villain ever but it’s weak af when he tries to be Muhammad Ali level of social significant when he just bent over and took the Chinese money   He already has almost all of it. But fuck it   Sweatshop Nike
Fuck Lebron James.         He's a great basketball player tho.
"I've always liked Joe Harris and I like him even more now, at least he's not afraid to speak out unlike LeBron ""Queen ""James  the QUEEN doesn't care about the rights of the Chinese(Hong Kong) people the only rights he cares about is the right to take their money. LeBron Queen James only cares about civil rights when it affects himself, or others that he knows, but most of all, LeBron QUEEN James only cares about GREEN as in money, dinero, yen,Qian, rubles, geld,molti soldi, pesos"
AD is dominating Marquese Chriss so far.   Lets see if Lebron James can handle Alfonzo McKinnie though.
"""AD has always been a top 5 player""  What, even when he was six?  Also: Nah.  In no particular order:  LeBron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant is six players who are better without taking more than thirty seconds to think about it."

"That's literally the first thing Skip said. After giving him a 1.  ""he's playing with LeBron James""   Dunno why the tweet paraphrased it and left that out.  He made a big point about how it'll split his votes."
Lebron James
We already know Lebron James is not good at making DECISIONS
"Today, every time I visited the post of LeBron James' face superimposed over Mao's, the fan of my computer kicked into high gear. I would force-kill Chrome, wait a few minutes to start it again, visit some other sites and reddit pages, then check out the LMAO James post again - fan started up immediately every time."
"Lets observe a interesting situation.  Morey say support Hong Kong. He is praised.  Leborn said Morey is ignorant and ignorance is born out of caring only about yourselves. He stated many people could be hurted. Not only from financially, but physically, emotionally, and spiritually. He was viewed negative.  Let’s see what Leborn said exactly.  “We all talk about freedom of speech — yes, we do have freedom of speech,"" James said. ""But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others and you're only thinking about yourself.  I don't believe — I don't want to get into a feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand. And he spoke. And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, and spiritually.”  American and those racists would have read Lebron tweet “many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, and spiritually.” as referring to the HK police and CCP, mainland Chinese, and NBA and players.  However, Leborn make no exclusive, but a statement of inclusive on everyone who is affected by the unrest - **including the innocent.** Which he stated here.  “there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others and you're only thinking about yourself.”  Lebron James made a surprising objective observation - a sin in a country where lables are worship and critical thinking is wrong.  **American and the racists seem to forget Hong Kong citizens are beaten up by the terrorists as well. For reasons from wanting to go work, going home, have a Chinese sounding name to simply cleaning up the wall**. If this is acceptable to those who support the terrorists, then you are justifying your hate for the Chinese government to allow violence on the Chinese, who is not the CCP. You are a racist. Your racism is extended to those you deemed inferior.  It is interesting to observe the rabid racism in American had them ignoring this. They view the protest is and only against CCP, while distorting and omitting the facts **the terrorists are breaking and burning and looting private and public property made by Hong Kong citizens.**  The leap of logic is also amusing. 1.) If the argument is that the small group of terrorists do not represent Hong Kong. Why is Morey supporting this group of terrorists and calling a stand for Hong Kong?  2.) If Hong Kong slient majority who is not involved with the protest, are not doing anything. Based on Democracy, the Hong Kong citizens do not Hong Kong to be tear apart from China.  3.) If the first protest was about the bill, then the whole movement was never about independence or Democracy. So why is American and its media and racists around the world calling this a fight for “Democracy”? Lying much?  Amusing isnt it? How American and racists who support this terrorism have such a gap of common sense and logic. **Why is it a fight for freedom turn into looting and burning and beating of Hong Kong innocent people? What does burning a Hong Kong build MRT and public and private owned shops, got to do with fight for Democracy.**  I have learn to expose people who are racist is to stop them from using whatisaboutism and their hate for CCP.  Debate how does any of these is a fight for freedom? And why did the majority of Hong Kong citizens do not want Hong Kong independence yet YOU elected yourself to represent them?  I can ensure the abuse of down voted will come. It is high expectation to expect quality from those who had none to begin with.  **For those who stand for the innocent, make your own answer and denounce the terrorists, the group of American who are ignorance and racists. ( which is a large number anyway ) Say no to racism.**"
"Sure. Me. I’m a fan of the athlete, LeBron James."
"First let me mention the clear hypocrisy of LeBron James, he wants others who aren't his people, who's problems aren't those of his people to listen and make changes for their social justice but he himself won't do so for others? He calls Morey's statement uneducated but he himself doesn't know enough on the situation to speak further on it but claims Morey has it all wrong?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;You are uneducated if you say something and don’t know the ramifications for doing so.  How are you so certain that Morey didn't know about the ramifications of his tweet. Honestly, who knows if Morey knew/understood the possible ramifications/extent of ramifications his tweet would cause financially to the NBA,  but did does it really matter? Either way China would have responded in the same way and where does this put LeBron's whole ""uneducated"" argument? He will not to stand for social justice if it means affecting him financially? Those who speak against social injustices are ""uneducated"" because they clearly don't see that its fucking up all his zeros. Is that what it means now to be uneducated?  Morey's tweets did have ramifications because China wants to censor people speaking out about it's dystopian rule. In a time right now in Hong Kong where protesters and first aid alike have to scream their names out to cameras when getting arrested or going to hospital so they don't ""disappear"", can you imagine the implications an extradition bill would have on Hongkongers. Especially when Carrie Lam and the Hong Kong police have already showed that they are subservient to China.  This subs like others is bringing forth other social issues happening in China because China is actively trying to silence and censor us and not only that, someone like LeBron of all people is doing his share of censoring due to their financial influence. This is not just a solely a Chinese issue  anymore  because this is a clear undermining of freedom and democracy internationally."

"You want to hate LeBron, go look at the public financials of the LeBron James Family Foundation. It’s a total sham."
Hopefully LeCommie will blow out his knee this year and that'll be it from him and he can just fade out or burn out (which would be kinda fun to see) from the league and thus the American Zeitgeist. I'm tired of Lebron James. Lets move on. I got tired of Kobe and thank God he's kinda shut up and just done his own thing. I'm tired of Lebron. Lets go. Kick this league into the future.
"[Trudeau] In light of the recent news regarding LeBron James, Canada has decided to change the city name of LeBronto back to Toronto.

"We're talking about LeBron James who's worth $450 million. I used the tasteless example of being black because it's pretty commonly known that they are oppressed to this day. But their oppression today isn't on the same level as the Uyghurs in China right now.  ""I want to speak for those who don't have a voice all across the world."" - LeBron James. I have no qualms with anybody, but LeBron."
"This is where this stuff gets tough to talk about, because at what point does it go from ""he doesn't need that money"" to ""it's okay, he needs that money?""   It's all relative. And while it's easy to say, ""LeBron James doesn't need a billion dollars,"" does Zach Lowe need his ESPN contract?   And that's a slippery slope, ya know?  Do any of us need electricity to survive? No.   How many of us would be willing to give that up in order to help someone else? Fuckin close to zero, ya know?"
Please say something stupid about this LeBron James.
a teammate of Lebron James has never won MVP  neither has a teammate of Michael Jordan  if AD wanted MVP he would have had to have gone the Harden or Westbrook route. i think he just wants to win the Finals
&gt; Do you know how many people say that and don't get any blowback?  Not everyone has as many twitter followers as Lebron James.  That's why this is an issue.  If it was you or me nobody would care.  That's the point.
&gt; LeBron James has literally talked about being a global voice for oppressed people.  yet he has only spoken up about black americans right?
LeBron James vs the combined forces of Hong Kong Protesters and the millions of Uyghurs Muslims in Chinese Concentration Camps
LeBron James has literally talked about being a global voice for oppressed people.   Back when it was convenient to do so.
"That is great two of them have. Also, some have spoken out against him. Then to think Lebron James would ask Kendrick to tweet this for him is ridiculous. I dont agree with what he said as much as anyone. But this is not how the world works"
Lol yeah. You're telling me the dude who massacred his own people 30 years ago is gonna care that lebron james said something. Your brain is the clown.
"LeBron James: ""Free speech has been a vehicle that's driven me for a long time. But I think that the importance of my finances outside of that has been something that I've been paying attention to a lot more. Free speech, human rights, it's an illusion in terms of certain material things that mean a lot more - I mean like, going after shoe deals or sponsorships in this league has been predicated on so many things that you're here"" - James raises his arms shoulder high - ""based upon what you've accomplished or how successful you are or how the Chinese Communist Party perceives you. In actuality, free speech doesn't mean anything. It doesn't really get me up in the morning every single day to want to profit, to want to appeal to China, to want to do things that fulfill my bank account."""
"If lebron had any sort of political influence in the states, trump wouldn't be president. Why in the hell would xi jinping give a shit about lebron james?"
"Lebron James and **Black people** in the NBA owe people in Hong Kong 0.  interesting that white people think **Black people** should do xyz labor regarding something in **China** when these same white people have done 0 to dismantle anti-Black systems in the US, I'm good luv"
"Jesus Christ you guys try to find these issues out of thin air sometimes   ~150 comments in 15 minutes, people are still taking notice  No fucking shit it’s not gonna catch the attention as LeBron fucking James saying it, but it’s not a fucking black vs white issue ffs"
"It's because it's being used by conservative concern trolls as a wedge issue against liberals.  The NBA veers liberal on social issues, and any tool that can be used to devalue their opinions helps their cause.    If you can take away the moral standing of Steve Kerr and Lebron James, now they can't use their influence to persuade millions of their followers as easily.  It also exposes them as hypocrites who only care about money, so that furthers the ""both sides are the same"" argument we all know and love.  It's gift-wrapped win for conservatives with a bow on top."
"Are you going to pretend that you don't think Lebron James, who is the most famous basketball player on the planet, who plays in LA which is one of the largest markets for Chinese viewers, whose team is sponsored by Wish, a Chinese company...who just got back from a tour in China specifically because of how big the NBA is there and is growing there....are you going to pretend to think that China doesn't affect his bottom line?"
I don’t rely on LeBron James to be a role model for anything outside of basketball.
That's what I was thinking too this morning just walking my dog.   What does Lebron James need *more* money for? Does he want to buy an NBA team? Everything he can look at for the rest of his life he could purchase and still be fabulously wealthy at the end of it.
"There was literally a post in r/lakers with a big list of corporations that caved to China, with LeBron at the end of the list. OP was asking why it’s ok for a company like Marriott to give in to China when it wasn’t ok for James.  [Found it](https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/dipsxy/all_of_reddit_right_now/)"
Someone called LeBron James was on the team.
Hypocrisy should not be a left versus right issue. If this was simply right-wingers railing against someone who has been critical of them could you please explain why they are burning LeBron James jerseys in Hong Kong? I doubt all the protesters in Hong Kong are but hurt right-wingers.

"People hate on Lebron because he's a hypocrite--true.  I 100% agree with that, certainly ain't his best look and [he's certainly back-tracking on his prior statements about other hotbed topics.](https://www.nba.com/article/2018/08/29/lebron-james-los-angeles-lakers-vows-speak-out-social-issues)  He certainly ain't about ""all societies,"" clearly, just the one he lives in.    Most people, after this, however, bring up China and their money, as to the cause of his reservations on this topic.  I think simply bringing up LeBron and his indirect ties with China's money, on one side of the argument, is very valid, but it's still present on the other side.    It unfortunately is a social and ethical topic, that happens to involve economic and political ramifications as well.  Because of that, I think there is no way this subject matter is, ""this is good, this is bad.""  There is just no way this subject matter can be so idealistic.  If it were only about morality?  Yeah.  Easy answer.  But it isn't.    Do I think Lebron is wrong for his response?  Yeah.   Do I think the hate he, Silver and the NBA are receiving isn't just a little misdirected?  Also, a yeah."

"The response they are getting is because they did pick sides on those issues and they have been known to voice their opinion in these type of issues. And now people expect a response from them. And I think honestly a lot of people thought that maybe Lebron would back Morey in this situation. But he didn't. He basically said not my issue, not my problem.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; I also don’t think every issue should be everybody’s problem as well. When things come up, there’s multiple things that we haven’t talked about that have happened in our own country that we don’t bring up.

Are you just like a Chinese-American college student who's also a super committed marxist-leninist-maoist?

"Most of my money's tied up helping family in Venezuela, but nice 'gotcha'.   On the real, Lebron James has done a lot to help a lot of people. A good deed doesn't undo a bad one, nor a bad deed a good one.  But this was a chance for him to prove he was more than a basketball player. I'm a little disappointed in him. I understand his rationale but it's not like if he had spoken up he'd be in the poorhouse."

"The Communist Party of China wants to shut up the NBA, an American owned corporation because a GM mildly alluded to the fact that they're a brutal totalitarian dictatorship that murders political dissidents and that the people of Hong Kong should have freedom and democracy. The CCP is purely evil and responsible for MILLIONS of innocent deaths. The people of Hong Kong want to be free from that tyrannical power.

But perhaps it indirectly impacts him via his kids, family, friends, teammates etc. I don't see how that's vastly different than how the hong kong situation indirectly impacts him.  He has fans in HK too.  Democracy and Freedom of speech is a global issue.  Hong Kong first, then Taiwan next?  What about the Tibetans and the Muslims?  So basically we're saying that he should only take a mantle for black issues?  Democracy is a black issue btw, and it's a white issue, and it's an asian issue etc.    Plus he went out of his way to actually criticize Morey and never said anything along the lines of - he has a right to his opinion because freedom of speech etc.  It's idiotic and hypocritical when you put up MLK quotes on your twitter.    TLDR Democracy is just as much an issue that impacts him, as any other issue."
"I’m not a republican by any means. Fuck Donald Trump and the racists he represents. I’m only interested in voting for Bernie every other democrat is basically bought for. Also, I am a life long Lakers fan.   With all that said, fuck LeBron James. For him to have a #morethananathlete shirt and whatnot and then to come off with the bullshit he did? Go fuck your self. His thing is that it’s not HIS problem? So is that the way we should have as a nation approached slavery? That’s not our problem. Fuck their suffering. Fuck the undocumented people living in their own shit, that’s not our problem. Fuck Hong Kong. Fuck all those people disappearing."

" “**Injustice anywhere** is a threat to justice **everywhere**. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” - Martin Luther King, Jr.  That quote was tweeted by Lebron James on Jan. 15th, 2018, with the added clarification of “our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.”   I don't think it's hard to understand why people are basically calling him a baby back bitch for picking and choosing the social issues that he wishes to throw his weight behind, or worse yet elevating certain issues while castigating others for briefly commenting on other issues that are just as pertinent. He damn well knows that people hang on his every word. He's been in the spotlight for \~20 years, and is one of the most recognizable names and faces. I don't even know what Morey looks like. So, if Morey is supposedly supposed to be smart enough to know the effect his words will have, then Lebron definitely should know better too. If he disagreed with Morey, then don't comment. Because this isn't a controversial topic for damn near anyone, including both parties in Congress. Yet, he made it sound like it was. That's why people are shitting on him.   That said, that's doesn't take away from anything Lebron has done, philanthropically. I'm just telling you how it is. Both need to man up for their dumb comments (though Morey's comment was far less idiotic). Muhammad Ali risked going to jail for 5 years during the prime of his career to fight for what he believed in. I highly doubt either Morey or Lebron would take that chance. They are both paper tigers (Chinese pun intended!)."
"Ah, yes, you seem to have completely understood my point.    LeBron James is a representative of a league that is responsible for a lot of peoples' financial well-being. If he says ""FREE HONG KONG"" or some sort, he has just cut the league off of tens of millions of NBA fans and billions of dollars that will affect the commissioner, the team owners, coaches, players, teams' athletic and administrative staffs, merchandisers, sponsors, arena staffs, TV producers, and so on and so on..."

"Yeah like I think in terms of someone being misinformed on the issues in china, that's a dumb statement by LeBron. However dude also went on to clarify that he thinks Morey wasn't informed on the ramifications of his words, which I feel is a bit true.  &amp;#x200B;  Its not JUST about LeBron James. In this issue where a government is waiting to pull out of the entire league he's right that the league needs to be the one to make that decision. Otherwise you're the one who costs everyone money without talking to them about it which is kinda fucked up."
"You genuinely believe that LeBron James supports human rights violations? Genuinely? You heard what he said, and instead of believing that he used the wrong words to describe what he meant, you’d rather believe that LeBron James believes in state-sponsored oppression?

I’m just not gonna let decades of charity get thrown out the window because of one (and honestly, comparatively small) incident. You aren’t gonna change my mind on this, so we can just agree to disagree here."
"Motherfuckers on here don't give two shits about freedom of speech. This Hong Kong shit is getting all this attention in internet circles for the sole purpose of propping China up as this foreign entity that wants to take away muh Amurican freedoms. Where was the reddit mayo brigade when 100+ people were killed in Sudan just last month? Why doesn't anybody care about the middle eastern and African atrocities that have been going on for decades? And targeting LeBron specifically to this degree has much more to do with silencing a black man who speaks for his community than human rights. This ""outrage"" is totally disproportionate and at this point people are just using this as an opportunity to vent their subconscious racist frustrations.   I'm seeing idiots compare Morey to Rosa Parks all in the name of propping him up against evil King James when even he apologized for the tweets and removed them 2 minutes after the controversy started. People are acting like LeBron came out and said death to Hong Kong when all he did was take a neutral stance and say the timing of Morey's tweet was inconsiderate for the players who were in China at the time. At worst it could be interpreted as somewhat hypocritical. But this site wide riot and people flooding every thread in every subreddit with ""DAE FUCK LABRON!?!"" and upvoting photoshops of him in semi blackface and getting bent over by Winnie the Pooh 100k times is straight up bullshit."

The rise and fall of lebron james
Lebron James
"See, you start with the reasonable take and use that to build to what you want. You don't jack knife straight to the outlandish. For instance, I once made a post on how LeBron could go to the Pelicans after the 17-18 season without them giving up Rondo, Holiday, AD, Cousins, or Mirotic. There was no way in hell that was going to happen, but it was still mathematically possible because LeBron had a player option he could have picked up and been traded to NOP. Cleveland would not have been receiving any contracts with more than 2 years left and they also would have gotten some draft assets.   Here's an example: LeBron James has not won a non All-Star game in New Orleans since 2013. Obviously, this means that if the Lakers and the Pelicans meet in the playoffs, not only do the Lakers need to have home court advantage, they need to take Games 1,2,5, and 7 or they will lose the series."

first of all nobody will ever feel bad for the lakers regardless of what happens lmao  and secondly nobody should feel bad about a team with LeBron James who legitimately got us AD and is still a top 5 player in the world.

"Jason Kidd to Lebron James and AD the day after Demarcus got hurt ""I told them 'There are 20-plus crying to the ref looks up for grabs.'  They both clinched their face and threw out their arms and said ""We're ready'"".  Lebron and AD each complained to the refs 34 times last night."

Joel Embiid   After that you have Lebron, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Anthony Davis, and maybe a few others that could make a stake for Top 10.  With Westbrook’s decline and KD’s injury, it’s surprisingly tough to knock Lebron out of the Top 10."
1) Lebron (Until Proven Otherwise  2) Wardell Stephen Curry  3) James Harden  4) Kai Leonard   5) Giannis Antetokoumpo ( Will be #1 at some point in the next decade.)
"Basically he wants to be known as like the number one Clippers superfan, yet when LeBron comes he makes a [post in Lakers gold and purple](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/07/los-angeles-lakers-lebron-james-clipper-darrell-switches).

And now that we have Kawhi and PG, he wants to be loud again? Fuck that guy."
"We ruin everyone.  We're picking #2 for numerous seasons, nobody's playing like we expect them to, we have LeBron James and AD and this happens.  The only ""guarantee"" we would have had was Kawhi, and he rejected us."

It’s the reason why people have a strong disdain for LeBron James honestly

Such next level standards to expect 20 points out of LeBron fuckin James
"Are people still going to compare LeBron James to michael jordan if he does not win another championship? Are future generations going to look back and make as many as excuses for why lebron didn't win more as we have even when he has gone and methodically teamed up with superstars (not holding that against him, just saying it's kind of ridiculous to simultaneously say he didn't have help when he went and got it while trying to say he's as good as Jordan/Kobe)?"
Probably because there was another game that included LeBron James Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard

"I would say this goes back to his 2nd sting with the Cavs. Having blow by first step speed is pretty rare for most wing players since they are naturally bigger   Lebron is still a fast player in transition, but he typically plays a slower pace anyways. Look at a guy like Harden who is smaller than James but doesn’t really use blow by speed to beat guys. Harden has a better handle than James, but James is a lot stronger and able to get space with strength a lot more/has a better post up game."

"""Who needs freedom of speech, when your game speaks for itself"" - LeBron James"
"&gt; We're not talking about best season outcomes.   When discussing a GOAT level season, the outcome matters.   &gt; But in terms of individual play, there weren't 7 better players. I don't think you're understanding how good it was. Scoring, facilitating, and defense are the 3 most important factors of a players basketball game, and dwyane wade is one of the only players in NBA history that was able to do all 3 at an elite level at the same time.  No I get it I watched that season. Wade absolutely had a historic season. But he didnt have a season where only 6 players had better seasons ever. Wade scored really well but only at 57 TS%. Good but not great. His defense was elite and so was his playmaking. But it didnt result in a championship. Duncan had just as good a season if not better and it resulted in a championship, Same thing with Hakeem and they both had arguably less help then Wade.   &gt; And yes, Hakeem did have a better season than Wade. Hakeem also had one of the best seasons of all time. But in terms of absolute peak, Wade was better than Magic, Kobe, and TD.   That is extremely debatable. All players had insane peaks that you cant say one definitely had a better peak.   Shaq in the 99-2000 season had 29/13/4 and 3 blocks. He was arguably the hardest player to ever defend that season. He scored efficiently and defended with the best of them. His passing was next level for a big man. I would rank this season higher then Wade's.   Michael Jordan in 1990-1991 season had 30/6/5 with amazing defense. Its one of his best seasons. I don't think I need to go into detail.   KAJ in the 79-71 season had 31/16/3. Arguably the greatest scorer ever and has a case for the best defender ever as well. This season was probably his peak.   Tim Duncan in the 02-03 season had 23/13/4. This season is arguably his best since its probably the best carry Job to a Championship ever.   Hakeem Olajuwon in the 93-94 season 27/12/3. He won an NBA title, MVP, Finals MVP and Defensive Player of the Year that year.   LeBron James 2011-2012 season had 27/8/6 with Amazing defense. He scored less but he did it at a higher rate. His defense was also better then Wade's. This is a GOAT level season.   Magic Johnson in the 86-87 season had 24/6/12. His defense wasnt elite but it was good. His offense is what makes this season special. He orchestrated one of the best offenses the NBA has ever seen. Winning MVP and  FMVP also helps this season be better then Wade's.   Larry Bird in the 85-86 season had 25/9/6 with amazing defense and was LeBrin before LeBron.   Kevin Garnetts 2003-2004 season had 24/14/5 with arguably the best defense in the league. He lead his team the WCF while winning MVP and should have win DPOY in my opinion.   Those are just some seasons I believe to be better then Wade's, I know I'm missing some but I dont want to go to deep into it. But if you want to go by PER alone then, wilt, Jordan, LeBron, Curry, Giannis, Anthony Davis, David Robinson, Shaq, Westbrook and Harden all had better seasons then wade did.   Kobe also had a season where he was top 5 in MVP and top 3 in DPOY. It doesn't fit your criteria but it was an amazing season as well.   But I named multiple players that had arguably better season. I could probably name some more if I really dug deep but I doubt you're willing to change on your stance."
"If you knew anything about LeBron and read/listened to his comments objectively, you’d understand that he is literally saying the same thing Shaq did in this clip when he talked about having to tiptoe around in business.  Which goes to show that YOU do not know what you’re talking about my friend, because you truly think LeBron James, of all people, is against the pro-democracy protests when in reality he was talking about the EFFECTS of Daryl Morey’s comments and what impact they have on the league, team, etc., due to his position &amp; the business he is in. It has NOTHING to do with his feelings on the events themselves.  Wishing the best for all the individuals affected by the events over the recent months from a stonch supporter of the pro-democracy protests. Stay safe."
Game-tying/go-ahead field goals with under 10 seconds left in the postseason:  Michael Jordan: 7/15 (47%) Kobe Bryant: 5/22 (23%) LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)  All I could find :/
"nah man, that's too much for Lebron fuckin James"
"You have LeBron James and AD, shut the fuck up"
"He’s Lebron James. The guy who calls himself king and proclaims himself the GOAT, you gotta take over and win that shit."
"When I look at LeBron James, I think of Beethoven and the age of the romantics."
The Los Angeles Lakers are now 0-1 since LeBron James supported China
"He needs to stop passing, he needs to takeover he's legit too generous with this ball.  You're LeBron James fucking go crazy with the ball."
Thanks for this post. Fuck LeBron James
This match up should be even better when Paul George and LeBron James are cleared to play.
Did Danny Green just absorb LeBron James' talent? LeBron's drive just petered off into nothing and Green just took it to the hoop
LeBron has lost more than one step. It's the beginning of the end. This season is going to be the LeBron James Decline-On-Display Tour.
"I was at the same hotel LeBron stayed at when they played the Bucks away. In the morning, I get up early around 6am to get breakfast. To my surprise LeBron James is there, sweating from his workout I assume. I actually had a towel on me that I was going to use for my light treadmill jog. I say good morning and he nods. He sees my towel and says “Ohh man thanks I’ve been looking for a towel” and he just takes the towel from my shoulder. I look a him with a slightly shocked face. Immediately, he keeps a dead-cold stare. Our eyes lock, and I notice he took the hotel’s orange juice carton and just starts drinking it from the carton, while maintaining eye contact. Then says “Yea, what’s up gaylord?” My eyes widen and now look shook. He then says “Yea I called you a gaylord. Who’s going to believe you though?” And then walks away with 10 packed pancakes and with his two elbows locked at his sides in order to hold a box of Trix and Lucky Charms. Charismatic guy though."
I heard that LeBron James has been personally ordering the imprisonment of demonstrators in Hong Kong
"I legit have no idea why people try to lay up the ball against a trailing Lebron James. If he's trailing you, you have to at least try to dunk it."
"Alright, if we adjust for pace, and go by per 100, there are 4 players who have had 40 points and 10 assists. Russel Westbrook, LeBron James, James Harden, and Dwyane Wade. If you lower it to 9 assists per 100, you add Steph and Jordan. Dwyane Wade in 09 had much better defense than all but Jordan and James, while still putting up ridiculous offense. Yes, assists are kind of limiting out centers here, but rn thats only 2 players, and IMO establishes a pretty high bar. Peak dwade was unbelievable."
#LEBRON RAMONE JAMES
When was the last time that LeBron James had a team that actually got better when he went to the bench?
When was the last time a lebron james team went on a 15-0 run without him
"This man is yelling the truth lol no one gave a shit two months ago and no one will give a shit in two months.  Fucking people love the WWE but give no shits about Yemen. I loved how you put where mad because it’s fucking up our entertainment it’s the same thing that happened with NFL and kneeling during the anthem  Like everyone is getting on Lebron but it’s like cmon he’s supposed to fuck up his bag , Nike’s bag and his teammates bag for something that dosent affect him that happening in a different country.   Like by him not saying anything that allows him to have more money to put into the things he does care about.  What’s better Lebron James a fucking NBA player speaking out against China or him opening up two more of his I promise schools?? He’s not a politician he’s a private citizen. Nephews on here crazy bruh"

Defense by Lebron James
That might be all it is. But it doesn’t explain why Lebron James is allowed to elbow people at will on offense.
LeBron Chinese James
"First year in the finals we did not deserve to win. We replied with 73 wins but lebron James took over and beat us fair and square. The next two years NBA teams other then the rockets gave up before the season started. I never enjoyed Those championships because it was to easy. When KD got injured I was excited for Klay Steph and Dray to show the world they are champions. Game 6 klay arrives and got injured. Warriors were on there route to game 7. Would they have won game 7 with a healthy klay, maybe we will never know. Maybe kawhi is just to good. Just sucks that your one good player in your history decided to dip. Oh well sucks for you"
Lebron James at point might be as bad of an experiment as Kuz playing center.
"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Tim Duncan.   All of them have Finals MVPs (Russell doesn't since it didnt exist back then but he would have won like 6+ of them if it did)."
the lakers also have lebron james

PATRICK BEVERELY PEST DEFENCE - Lebron James : yeah ight
"LeBron James, Bill Gates, and Jerry Seinfeld are talking alone in a room.   What's the conversation about?"
Lebron james does not care about asian people. I have only seen him stand up for his own kind. Not much different from the people that are racist against his own kind. It's easy to stand up against injustice if its your own kind involved. Like asian kanye west would say: lebron james does not care about asian people.
"""Injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere"".  LeBron James tweets that.  He didn't qualify it by asterisking it and saying ""only domestically. Foreign people oppressed under governments I profit from, uh, who GAF about you lolz""."
Who woulda thought lebron james would be a racist. Lebron does not care about asian people.
#LEBRON JAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"There's a large difference between folks on r/nba and Lebron James or literally any NBA player in terms of wealth and life though. Yeah he could cost himself and the companies he's apart of a lot of money and no one is really saying that's a smart move, but at what point are you forsaking pretty basic human rights for money? And that applies to a lot of people. But for LeBron specifically it also spits in the face of his Social Justice image right?   It's hard to compare a typical person on reddit to a person who could retire tomorrow and not worry about a thing unless he grossly mismanages his money and assets."
"Space Jam is a Nike movie, Shaq is with Reebok which is why Shaq was not in the first one and wont be in the second one.   &gt;not Lebron ""Sellout"" James.  People in Hong Kong are brazen with their bigotry and racial discrimination against Africans/blacks, why should LeBron hurt his business interests supporting people who dislike him because his skin is black? I am not sure why people think it's the job of blacks to fight other people's fights all over the world.  &gt;**Lok is president of the Hong Kong African Association, which she hopes will be allowed to convert an abandoned school in their village into an activity centre**. **Despite approval by the Town Planning Board, Lok’s plan faces strong opposition from villagers**.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;[**Over the past months, various protests have been launched, with residents citing security concerns and accusing African people in the community of being more likely to be criminals**](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2018/07/29/is-hong-kong-racist-prejudice-against-ethnic-minorities-especially-africans-undermines-the-citys-cla#lYAbqxv8IeDymzj2.99).  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Lok, in her 50s, is married to 45-year-old Nigerian Ezeakunne Sylvester and has been leading a lonely battle against what she says is a clear-cut case of racial discrimination that is part of a long-standing yet often neglected problem in Hong Kong.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;“They say they fear a rise in crimes (if the centre is located there),” Lok says of her detractors.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;“It’s such a ridiculous excuse. **Every time our association wants to do something, we are chased away like stray dogs**.””  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;**The couple are not alone in their uphill battle against a prejudice faced by ethnic minorities in all aspects of life in Hong Kong society, from job opportunities to flat rentals and daily interactions.**  &amp;nbsp;   &gt;**She applied three times to start an activity centre on a plot of vacant government land that will not only serve Africans, but also welcome Hongkongers to learn more about African cultures**.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;It took four years to identify a suitable site, **amid hostility from residents who hold a deep distrust for their African neighbours**.  &amp;nbsp;   &gt;But **her dreams of integration and acceptance were crushed by fellow locals**.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;**After the group gained approval from the Town Planning Board to use an abandoned school in Shek Wu Tong as a centre, more than 100 villagers signed a petition in May to force the Lands Department to suspend the plan**.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;**Villagers even threatened to block the car park outside the school to cut off access to the building**.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;**A black man from Africa was told by his employer at a learning center that he was a commercial risk to the company apparently because of the color of his skin. A well-qualified teacher, the man had applied for a job at the center four times and was hired only after a foreign teacher intervened on his behalf**.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;[**Three black men from Africa were harassed, spat at, called derogatory names referring to their race and threatened with a belt**](https://www.hrichina.org/en/content/4753).   &amp;nbsp;  So let me get this straight, Hong Kong, a country filled with people who have no problem being brazen with their racism and racial discrimination against Africans/blacks. LeBron is supposed to see past the fact if he was an African businessman in Hong Kong the citizens of Hong Kong would discriminate against him he's still supposed to come to their defense even though it will hurt his business interests?"
Starting 5 for Lakers PG Avery Bradley SG  Danny Green C JaVale McGee PF Lebron James SF Anthony Davis
Yeah but they just won a championship and the Lakers couldn’t make the playoffs with Lebron James
"Shaq should have been in Space Jam 2, not Lebron ""Sellout"" James."
Lebron james does not care about asian people.
Lebron just looking out for his money. As asian kanye would say it. Lebron james DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ASIAN people and his comments show it.
Lebron James.
"And this dude talking ""opposite ideals"" when China is out there harvesting organs from minorities in camps and apparently have the ability to make LeBron fucking James afraid for his life while there because of a tweet. Like, ""I'm not a fan of concentration camps, but I'll send 'em a few rifles because $$$"""
"Similar to the time these two met in March, expect to also see some Pat Beverley on LeBron James tonight."
"Are we just forgetting that the Lakers had a pretty good player named LeBron James miss almost 20 games, as well as their entire starting lineup? I can't remember the exact number, but their starting lineup only played like, 20 somethings games together last season. Turning this offseason into simple addition and subtraction is just disingenuous"
"Alright, I tapped out. Enjoy the undercard fight, I'll be waiting for the main event. I anticipate a virtuoso from one Lebron Ramon James."
"Ernie: “Let’s get an interview with LeBron James from our new on-court correspondent, Dwyane Wade!”  Shaq: “Flash! That man helped me win another ring, ya know.”  Chuck: “Hey Wade, while you’re there, who’s better: MJ or LeBron?”  D-Wade: “Uh-“  LeBron: “Yeah, D-Wade... WHO YOU GOT?”  D-Wade: “Uhhhh.... players only, baby?”"
"But I’m realistically asking you , it’s very easy to sit down on your parents couch and run your mouth on reddit. But are you doing anything to help combat China? Why don’t you send the Hong Kong protestors resources ? What is running your mouth about  Lebron James going to change . Do you even care about the Hong Kong people?"
Imagine falling below the Kings in the standings even though you had LeBron James and Kyle Kuzma. Even worse: that record was 33-49
The same team couldn’t do it with LeBron James no way they’re doing it with Zion
LeBron James isn't a hall of famer.. yet
Well in our defense we did just get Lebron James and Anthony Davis in the last 2 years so...
Lakers 117 - Clippers 101  Kawhi Leonard - 28-9-4   Anthony Davis - 41-15-3  LeBron James  25-7-11
TIL I'm Mario Chalmers.  So with that being said I would stand in the corner and brick a fair amount of threes and routinely get cussed out by LeBron James.
LEBRON RAYMONE JAMES IS ALREADY THE GOAT
"I don't know how I'm being downvoted, but in all seriousness I can get to 17 players definitively better that those guys.  In no particular order  West  LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Karl Anthony Towns, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook.  East  Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, and Kyrie Irving.  I am willing to concede Kemba Walker, which makes 18.   So, that's 2 spots.  Any 2 of Blake, Butler, Beal, and Oladipo are not definitively better than Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Lamarcus Aldridge, Demar Derozan, or Draymond Green, Kristaps Porzingis, or even Luka Doncic.  I would personally fill it out with DeRozan and Draymond because advanced stats are meaningless when you only manage to win 25 games.  OPs attempts to shoehorn in Al Horford and John Wall are peak EC stupidity."
"...if you don't think people were wildly speculating about LeBron leaving in his last year in Cleveland (which is all people are doing with AD), I don't know what to tell you.   I mean, just look: http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/5-on-5-130910/early-outlook-lebron-james-fate-2014-free-agency"
"The Sixers: Draft assets and role players Sometimes to acquire an All-NBA-level player -- albeit one on an expiring contract coming off an injury -- you have to push your chips to the middle of the table. The one chip that the Sixers kept in their pocket was former No. 1 pick Markelle Fultz.  NBA free agency and trades!  Here's the latest on another thrilling summer in the NBA:  • Offseason grades: Best in the West • Free-agency news, buzz and rumors • NBA Trade Machine: Make your own deals • Lowe: Winners and losers | Rating the deals • Details on each new free-agent contract • Team-by-team free agents for '18 and '19 • Trade tracker: Grades and details • World of Woj: Latest news | Transactions  While Philadelphia certainly had the draft assets to get a Kawhi trade done, namely the Miami Heat's unprotected 2021 first-rounder, the roster for the 76ers featured a mixed bag of expiring contracts and role players.  What was off the table: Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Markelle Fultz, JJ Redick (Dec. 15 trade restriction), Amir Johnson (Dec. 15 trade restriction), Zhaire Smith (Aug. 1 trade restriction) and Landry Shamet (Aug. 3 trade restriction)  Draft assets:  Own all first-round picks (2019 to 2025)  Miami's 2021 unprotected first-round pick  Second-round picks: 10 in the next three seasons  Cash: $5.2 million to send out  Rights to: Shake Milton (2018, second), Anzejs Pasecniks (2017, first) and Jonah Bolden (2017, second)  Tradable contracts:  1. Robert Covington: $10.5 million; under contract through 2021-22  2. Dario Saric: $2.5 million; under contract through 2019-20 (extension-eligible starting in July 2019 and a restricted free agent in 2020)  3. Wilson Chandler: $12.8 million; expiring contract  4. Jerryd Bayless: $8.6 million; expiring contract  5. Justin Anderson: $2.5 million; expiring contract  6. The former first-round picks: Furkan Korkmaz and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot  Complicating factors  How confident could Philly be that Leonard would commit long-term?  The Sixers have the opportunity to sign Leonard -- or a similar player in a strong 2019 free-agent class -- using cap space without sacrificing current players or picks.  Why the Lakers can wait Three major factors contributed to a Lakers deal not materializing.  The Luol Deng contract  Deng is owed $37 million over the next two years. The asking price around the league is two first-round picks to take back his remaining salary. The Lakers possibly could have moved the Deng contract to a third team like Sacramento with draft assets, but Los Angeles would not have any firsts left to send to San Antonio.  Making the salaries work  Remove Deng from any trade package and the Lakers were limited in the amount of salary they could send out in a deal, since the free agents signed this offseason cannot be moved until Dec. 15.  To take back the $20.1 million owed to Leonard (who would need to waive his $3 million trade bonus), the Lakers had to send back $16.1 million in salary.  That would have required clearing the deck and trading at least four of the below players, including both Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram:  Lonzo Ball: $7.46 million  Brandon Ingram: $5.75 million  Kyle Kuzma: $1.68 million  Josh Hart: $1.65 million  Moritz Wagner: $1.72 million (cannot be traded until July 31)  Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk: $1.48 million (cannot be traded until Aug. 9)  Isaac Bonga: $1.0 million (cannot be traded until Aug. 5)  Incentive to wait until free agency  The Lakers are in a position to have between $36 million and $43 million in salary-cap space next summer, which is good enough to sign Leonard outright without gutting their roster in a midseason trade.  Despite Paul George returning to the Oklahoma City Thunder when the Lakers could have acquired the All-Star in a trade last year, the presence of LeBron James should be a good enough sales pitch to lure a second star from the 2019 class to L.A., whether that's Leonard or someone else. Also, don't forget that James committed to the Lakers for at least three years and there is no rush for them to cash in their assets right now."

"I was at the game and it was super fun to boo PG every time he touched the ball. Especially since it actually seemed to throw him off in the 1st quarter. As a Laker fan, I don't think or care about PG anymore. We have Lebron James and I'm looking forward to the opportunity of signing Kawhi or trading for AD. If that doesn't work out then I'm looking forward to another trade that will improve our team. "

"Uhh, 4 solid starters and LeBron James, along with the cap space to sign a max player this off-season, is a solid young core.  Kuzma, obviously is a budding star.  Lonzo, while not a good shooter, great in transition, great playmaker, fantastic hustle, and imo an all NBA defensive player already (you can disagree there, but he's still a monster defensively)  Hart, is a dog, super reliable, extreme hustle, and just a really solid role player.  Ingram, while my least favorite, is still great on the defensive end, good ball handler, and if he becomes less of an iso heavy player, will be pretty great.  And they all do well playing with LeBron. Yeah, we're not as amazing as we like to seem, but every fan does that with their team, and we're still pretty good."
"Are you not aware of Adam Mendelsohn?  I can’t talk to someone who is denying facts. Adam Mendelsohn is Lebron’s media advisor. He runs a company that helps people rebuild their image.

He still is only a year removed from shooting above league average from 3 and it's almost entirely about the lack of fit with LeBron James. He's not a catch and shoot guy, hes an above average ISO scorer and playmaker off the dribble. LeBron literally got Dwyane Wade to play and Kyrie Irving to play off ball for stretches and they had it in their game with elite cutting and catch and shoot ability. Ingram doesn't have the insane BBIQ to cut like a 30 year old Dwyane Wade and he's not a Kyrie level shooter. All of this was known *before LeBron signed* what really did you expect?  Just because he's not hyper efficient in his ISOs in year fucking 3 is not bad at all. He's still bringing up his FG% over last year with his 3 pt. shot not being there including shooting over 50% from inside the arc. Including a bevy of good looking mid range jumpers over defenders. He's progressing in his game nicely and is still getting comfortable with being on a winning team. He's not Wiggins levels of inefficient and he's not a bust or needs to get shipped out for pennies."
[[Svi] It was Nice to meet you this evening Mr. Lebron James. Big fan of your game lol @KingJames](https://twitter.com/sviat_10/status/1080732463511494656?s=21))
"Boo him if you wish. It has been known to be therapeutic, and it’s certainly your right.  Four months ago, you might have found a few guys from the home locker room to join you. He abandoned them, even more than he abandoned you, and just because all of those players and coaches are taking the public high road now doesn’t mean they weren’t hurt and angry, too.  These are not robots, after all, even if Kawhi Leonard always did a convincing impersonation of one.  Leonard knows what’s coming tonight at the AT&amp;T Center. He asked for it, not only when he asked out of San Antonio but also when he declined, over and over again, to explain why.  He chose to let you draw your own conclusions, and now you have. That’s also your right.  Just know the Spurs don’t want it to be this way. They have found a way to move on, even if you haven’t, and they’d prefer to celebrate not necessarily Leonard the individual, but what he and the franchise became together.  It’s difficult, but take the last year out of the equation, and the story of Leonard and the Spurs is one of the most remarkable NBA success stories of the decade. More than even Tim Duncan — who was an undeniable star before he got here — Leonard’s ascent was a testament to how the Spurs can forge greatness out of talent the rest of the league might not recognize, and how well a system can work from scouting to player development to game management.  Leonard, in turn, lifted an entire franchise, taking the starring role in one championship and becoming so dominant in subsequent seasons that he gave the team a realistic chance for more. It is a shame people forget that, but they have, and will.  It’s only natural for there to be ill will. But Gregg Popovich has kept in touch with Leonard over the past few months, and the coach was legitimately appalled last month when his answer to a question about the team’s leaders last season was viewed as a shot at his former player.  Not only was Popovich sincere in his desire to keep Leonard in the fold last summer, he is sincere in his (naive?) hope that tonight’s game atmosphere will have everyone treated “with kindness and respect.” If Popovich could do anything to reduce the air of hostility in the arena — a speech about civility, a pat on Leonard’s back — he would.  But many of you paid top dollar for tickets to tonight’s game for the express purpose of letting Leonard know how you feel, and Popovich probably won’t be able to change your mind about that. Again, this is understandable, just as it’s difficult to muster much sympathy for the player who never even tried to articulate his side of the story.  He might have had his reasons. They might have been good ones. But with his stubborn silence he exhibited an utter disregard for the people here, not only in the stands but also on his team. It was about nine months ago when Leonard’s teammates confronted him the locker room, and all they wanted was what you did.  Some kind of update. Some kind of explanation. Something.  They never got it, and you didn’t either.  So now we’re left with a Raptors-Spurs showdown that will be awkward for everyone, including the people in charge of game presentation. In recent years, tribute videos honoring returning former players have become so ubiquitous that they are expected even for, shall we say, nonlegends.

The Rockets recently ran one for Trevor Ariza when he returned, and the Hawks even did one for Dwight Howard, who played in Atlanta for one forgettable season.  So it would be noteworthy if the Spurs didn’t run their own tribute video tonight, and they do have one prepared. If for no other reason, it would be great to honor Danny Green, who remains deservedly beloved and did not ask to be included in the deal that shipped Leonard to Toronto for DeMar DeRozan and Jakob Poeltl.  But it remains unclear whether the Spurs will air the video, because if Leonard is getting booed every time he touches the ball, would they want to add to the chorus during a timeout?  Perhaps images of Leonard hoisting a trophy will cut through the anger. Maybe when everyone gets a look at him staring down LeBron James in the 2014 Finals, not only holding his own but giving an entire city a corn-rowed reason to believe, the catcalls will wane.  Maybe flashbacks can be good. It depends, of course, on which details one chooses to remember.  And that, like everything else, is completely up to you.

The Cavs do not actually have high attendance  https://twitter.com/anthonyVslater/status/1070473050632667136/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1070473050632667136&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fsmokeroom.com%2F2018%2F12%2F06%2Fcleveland-cavaliers-lebron-james-leaving-open-seats%2F   A vast majority of NBA ticket sales are done on the secondary market. The Cavs have a ton of tickets that are technically sold but no one is actually using that ticket to go to the game. When LeBron left Cleveland their tickets on the secondary market plummeted in value going from some of the most expensive in the NBA to some of the cheapest in the NBA
"So here we go: LeBron James(1177 games)- 20+ assists 974 times, 10+ rebounds 278 times, 10+ assists 227 times. Roughly 83% of his games are 20+ points, 24% are 10+ rebounds, and 19% 10+ assists.    Carmelo(1064): 20+ points 753 times, 10+ rebounds 168 times, 10+ assists 6 times. Roughly 71%, 16%, and 0.6%  Derozan(713): 20+ points 364 times, 10+ rebounds 17 times, 10+ assists 5 times. Roughly 51%, 2%, and 0.7%  McGrady(938): 20+ points 467 times, 10+ rebounds 108, 10+ assists 40 times. Roughly 50%, 12%, and 4%  Kobe(1348): 20+ points 941 times, 10+ rebounds 113 times, 10+ assists 86 times. Roughly 70%, 8%, and 6%.   In contrast, Wiggins (through 360 games) is at 181, 5, and 0, for 50%, 1%, and 0%.    I was curious about Shaq so here he is: 1207 games:  826|741|1 68%|61%|0.08%"
LeBron James tho
"The year is 2025.  LeBron James Jr looks poised to take the Cavs to their first NBA finals since 2018. He’s already knocked off the Nets and the Celtics. He’s facing the lower-seeded Sixers in game seven of the conference finals.  With nine minutes left in the fourth quarter, James Jr elevates above Ben Simmons and slams the ball down. Running back to the other end, he shouts “this is my fucking city! My city, baby!”  The crowd is stunned. No one has done anything so vile as swear in an NBA game since 2021. The ref, after recovering from his shock, immediately gives James Jr a double tech. His coach is also ejected for allowing such bad language on the court.  The refs call an official timeout, and argue about whether or not to call the entire series for the Sixers. They decide that the Sixers, unable to cope with the mental trauma, should be awarded the series.  Following the game, NBA ~~commissioner~~ emperor Adam Silver publicly reprimands and bans James Jr from the league, calling his comments “the worst disgrace to the league since Donald Stirling”  Max Kellerman, earn $85 million per shitty take on a new show with Skip Bayles, calls James Jr the most evil basketball player since Rudy Gobert in the cup swatting incident of 2018.  The point is, let them play the gotdamn game."
"Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, DeMar Derozan, and Lebron James for kicks"
Lebron James will come back. 
Lebron with average young core this year then we can possibly sign Leonard or whoever with the depth we currently have without giving up anyone.   Magic held off trading for PG the year before and we nabbed Lebron James. I trust Magic right now.

"Relevant detail: ""Larry Bird, LeBron James, Paul Millsap, Russell Westbrook, Danny Ainge and Gary Payton shoot right-handed, but do almost everything left-handed off the courts"", including air guitar, apparently."
Tbh idk how you look bad by getting Lebron James. Lakers have a pretty decent chance at landing another big name player and if not there are a bunch players that we can add to this team to bolster the roster. 
"well tbf, they didnt have important players like lebron james or kuzma out there who they are used to playing with. the schemes were a bit messed up"
It would appear LeBron is good at basketball and helps the Lakers win games and without him they struggle. More at 11  Seriously tho I can't imagine getting honeydicked by PG and getting LeBron fucking James and still feeling salty about PG. 
"&gt;'Am I the only one that thinks that James Harden is one of the best scorers in the league?'... or 'When are we going to finally acknowledge that Lebron is an MVP candidate?'..... just dumb shit.   I really hate when a star has a good game and threads get spammed with ""but I was told he was trash"" as if seeing through somebody's dumb hot take makes you a genius. All it does it legitimize those dumb hot takes in the first place because you shouldnt even pay enough attention to them to take the time to refute it.   "
And people thought OKC would beat Lakers in a playoffs series...have you heard of this man named Lebron James..

I don’t care. They sound like incels mad that Stacy didn’t leave Chad for them. “Muh Paul George.” When we have fucking LeBron James on our team. 
"as far as i'm aware, one of the main reasons that major sports exist is so we all have a common ground on which to talk shit at each  this is, of course, an essential mechanism to society  so it stands, after very simple reasoning, that hot-take-heads like SAS and simmons exist pretty much only to make us angry about their takes, thus inspiring more page views  take the KD/LeBron bullshit last week or whatever. KD was quite obviously *not talking about LeBron himself*, but actually *the media chatter surrounding LeBron*. the network picked the quote to sound like KD was shitting on LeBron, just so LBJ and fans would get upset and click, click, click away on those videos.  hell, they even fooled lebron and durant; based on James' comments after the fact, both he and KD ended up swallowing ESPN's line, hence KD's half-hearted apology and LeBron's weak attempt at publicly saying he understood"
And LeBron can't win a ring without James Jones.  See how low IQ of an argument that is to make?  Please say hi to your middle school teacher for me tomorrow.

"The first names thing is weird. For some reason it seems totally fine with Westbrook and Curry, outright logical for LeBron and Klay (""James"" and ""Thompson"" are ambiguous, LeBron and Klay are not), and I assume people say Giannis because they can't spell Antetokounmpo.  But people calling Harden ""James"" and the like, it's weird as hell.  I have trouble with Paul George, though. Even referring to him as George feels weird."

"I'm not a Spurs fan, so I can't at all speak for them, but as ugly as the shit went for the past year with Kawhi, personally, I feel as if a small degree of respect has been earned for the guy who at a young age went out there and helped win a championship against Lebron James."

What Lebron James did to this man should never be forgiven. 
"lol did you even watch it? for one, it's 13th all-time. two, it's a fucking amazing buzzer beater game winner in the playoffs to go up 3-0 against a team a lot of people thought they'd lose to as he continued his dominant run against the eastern conference. emphasis on how amazing the actual shot was, by the way.  but anyway, it barely has more upvotes than ""[Klein] Hawks are all-in on fan experience.. 1st NBA team to offer fan friendly concession prices: $1 Chips; $2 Candy, pretzel's, bottled water; $3 Fries, hot dogs, nachos $4 pizza, bottomless popcorn, bottomless soda; $5 beer.""  it has less than ""With 4 minutes and 20 seconds left in the 4th quarter this was the score during the Warriors vs. Clippers summer league game""  i think it's pretty fucking appropriate  and as for the dennis system post.. that's also about the free-agency of lebron james (and a shit-post lol, just like the 420 shit)"
"i mean, if you haven't figured it out yet this is just what this board does. i think it's just how 'young adults' communicate... with fake outrage... like 'Am I the only one that thinks that James Harden is one of the best scorers in the league?'... or 'When are we going to finally acknowledge that Lebron is an MVP candidate?'.....  just dumb shit.

"Kd hired an analytics expert to track Lebron's game and openly says he looks up to him and tries to imitate him.  &gt;LeBron James has a not-so-secret admirer, and his name is Kevin Durant.  &gt;In an interview with Lee Jenkins of Sports Illustrated, Durant admits to a number of things, including his distaste for second place, his employment of a personal analytics expert and an affinity for LeBron:  &gt;LeBron is the most dominant player in the league and also one of the most efficient producers. He's the best, and Durant wants to be the best, so why not study (you guessed it) the best?  &gt;""That’s my guy,” Durant said (via Jenkins). “I looked up to him [James], and now I battle him.”  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1615870-kevin-durant-hires-analytics-expert-checks-lebron-james-stats-every-game?goback=.gde_4344339_member_235403911  However his recent interviews come off as salty I agree. He's probably disappointed he doesn't get the respect Lebron gets after winning his championships."
"Eh, the problem in 2015 was more the fact that they had no shooting as well as Playmaking. Playing without Love and having Tristan Thompson and Timofey Mozgov meant LeBron had to work in a clogged paint the whole series. Nowhere near as bad as it was in the 90s with illegal defense. The Pistons had the Jordan rules, but they still had to pretend to respect the illegal defense rules so their guys were roaming off people about 1-2 steps less than modern defenses like the Warriors in 2015 do.   Also, the physicality of the 90s is wildly overrated by a few clotheslines at the basket by Bill Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn. Iggy was getting away with murder that entire 2015 series vs Lebron and even during the finals people were commenting on how much handchecking the Warriors do and how many fouls they committed against LeBron without getting called. This is the same series where LeBron got taken out by Bogut in midair and got cut when his head banged against a camera.   I do appreciate what Kyrie did in that series and it absolutely speaks to how much of a team game it is, but people really don't appreciate the level LeBron reached in the second half of that series. People appreciate the comeback for what it is and generally understand LeBron beasted, but no it's a lot more than that. For those 3 games when his back was against the wall, this man tapped into something within himself and entered a flow state that literally transcended all of the basketball that came before him. He was the GOAT that series. There is no doubt about it. No one was greater at the peak of their powers than Lebron Raymone James. "
"I think Lonzo is definitely in the debate and I am pretty sure I am not deluded, sure he's on the losing end of the debate but it's definitely a debate.   If you drop Fox's usage rate to Lonzo's and then add Lebron James and Rajon Rondo to his team his numbers would look very comparable Lonzo's if not worse. The most sizable advantage Fox has over Lonzo is his 3 point shooting but he's only taking ~3 attempts a game to lonzo's ~5. I don't think that advantage is so major that it completely negates for Lonzo's advantages in size, defense, rebounding and assisting. Most people think that Fox magically became a better passer this year becuase he's getting more assists but if you look at lonzo's first year when he didn't have LBJ and Rondo dominating the ball, Lonzo was averaging 7.2 assists with a 17.4% USG  while Fox needs a 25% USG rate to get 7.5 assists. To me that indicates that Lonzo is the superior passer and it matches the eye test for me from watching them in NCAA and in the NBA.   Lonzo's stats over the last three games without Rondo/LBJ are 17.4/8/5.4  Fox's stats this year 18/7.5/3.6. Looks comparable to me...  If all that means nothing to you go watch the the SAC vs LAL game on the 27th, if you see how they both performed in that game and account for Lonzo's superior defense and still think to yourself Fox is so astronomically ahead of Lonzo to the point where it isn't even debatable then I think you're deluded.  "
"yeah and they went to 4 finals and won a chip, how dare this lebron james guy!!"
"Wow. You know if CP3 didn’t get injured, he had a great chance to win last year against the most stacked team ever. Keep your first born, it’s not a good man do.  He was 22 years old against Lebron F-ing James,wade and Bosh. Did you put money on them to win?  Last year he failed because his best teammate went down. 1 Star vs 4 All stars including 2 ExMVPs in prime. Even if you put Lebron in his shoes do you think out come would be different? Especially when there were only 7 playable guys and some of them played like shit? Is Lebron an all-time great?"
The Bucks has the best 2 and the Celtics has the next 4 and an actual head coach.  No superstar can win a series when literally all but one other player on your team played at or above the level they did all season and you have a straight up idiot who will never be a head coach in the NBA as the HC. The Sixers got beat even worse than the Bucks did and no one is out here blaming Embiid. You are showing that you know nothing about basketball. Lebron James was a couple points away from being sent home by that same team. Do you blame Lebron for the series being so close?
"LMFAO please tell me more about how Kyrie came anywhere close to what LBJ was doing on defense that series. I'll leave you to stew with this copypasta   LeBron’s defense alone in those playoffs/Finals are noteworthy. Combine that with his offense and it’s the greatest of all time Finals performance.   Sideshow had an RPM estimate of +8 to +9 on offense and +5 to +6 on defense. That’s a +15 player and that’s bonkers. It’s like one of the crazy “How good would Magic Pippen” or “How good would Hakeem Curry” creations come to life.  LeBron’s defense In the playoffs was ridiculous:  Overall: 31.9 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 45.9%, -14.0% Threes: 24.1 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 36.7%, -12. 6% Twos: 36.6 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 50.5%, -13.9% &lt;6ft: 37.9 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 61.3%, -23.5%  LeBron In the finals was utterly ridiculous:  Overall: 31.6 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 47.9%, -16.3% Threes: 29.0 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 39.6%, -10.6% Twos: 33.3 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 53.6%, -20.3% &lt;6ft: 38.5 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 63.6%, -25.1%  LeBron In the finals’ last three games was I don’t know what:  Overall: 19.4 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 47.4, -28.4% Threes: 12.5 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 40.7%, -28.2% Twos: 25 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 52.4%, -27.4% &lt;6ft: 15.4 DFG%, opponents usually shoot 60.6%, -45.2  This was game 5 defense ‪https://stats.nba.com/player/2544/defense-dash/?Season=2015-16&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;DateTo=06%2F13%2F2016&amp;DateFrom=06%2F13%2F2016&amp;PORound=4‬  This was game 6 defense ‪https://stats.nba.com/player/2544/defense-dash/?Season=2015-16&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;DateTo=06%2F16%2F2016&amp;DateFrom=06%2F16%2F2016&amp;PORound=4‬  The Warriors shot 4 for 28 overall (3/17 in game 5, 1/11 in game 6) in those two games (14.3%) when going against LeBron and that doesn’t include his team defense, defensive rebounding, rotations, etc,   The Warriors shot 2/13 AT THE RIM against LeBron during the final three games. Had James not stopped those shots (everyone knows the blocked shot on Iggy), Warriors win.   The guy not only led them in scoring and creating offense for others, he led their perimeter defense AND was one of the best rim protectors in the 2016 NBA playoffs. "
"When lebron was on teams that were way better than kobe's after 2010 I don't really know how much it makes to prop up their records against each other. I think it speaks volumes that you have to hide your argument behind stats when I can on the other hand link you one on one play between the two of them and show you Kobe routinely dominating a player as amazing as lebron james.     Kobe won 5 chips with 2 all stars, Lebron won 3 with 4. Kobe at 20, 21, 22 won 3 rings in a row with shaq and was even better than shaq in 2 of those series (Spurs, Kings) at that young age. For Lebron in his prime with prime wade and prime bosh he could only repeat. Kobe played in a tougher conference, holds the record for victories against plus 50 win teams at 24 on the dot. Kobe was a better defender, holds the record for 1st nba all defense with MJ and Payton.     Hopefully Lebron can win more championships! I would love it! "
"After 2010 it wasn't a competition between kobe and lebron because of the teams they were on, if you can use that stat as a way to credit lebron it's kind of just ridiculous don't you think?     And again you can say kobe ""isn't in the same tier"" as lebron, when the fact remains in real life in one on one situations kobe actually dominated lebron, and it really wasn't even close. I can show you the gameplay.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JABKg2azkp0     This isn't even the whole tape. But kobe makes lebron james look like a flee. There is no one else in the league who did this so routinely. You can't just dismiss observable reality in favor of your own nonsensical opinions about all time tiers of players especially when kobe has more championships than him, the most difficult accomplishment in the sport, the whole point of the game, did it with fewer all stars and played in a tougher conference. Also is tied with MJ for most 1st team all defense awards ever. Kobe's dominance of the Spurs really exacerbates how ridiculous he was. Kobe was better than Prime Shaq in those series as a kid.  "
"Lol Lebron James? Notorious flopper, traveler and carrier of the ball??"
Q: How do you know when it's Lebron James' Birthday?   A: Everyone gets to leave work 12 minutes early.   
"I think maybe he'll learn he works out all year long so that he can skip those workouts in crunch time in the playoffs, so that he has more energy for the games.   Or maybe he'll just step to the next level and won't be fatigued this year, I don't know.  The all time greats all seem like monsters that don't get tired. I don't know how they do it, but it's consistent through different sports.

All your examples are terrible.  Kobe = Black Mamba  Giannis = Greek Freak  Lebron = King James
Also the argument that kyrie won it for him. As if Lebron James isn’t good enough himself.  God forbid he has a really good teammate by his side that hits a clutch shot so the TEAM wins a ring. Because it’s the Cleveland cavaliers. Not the Cleveland Lebrons.  I’ll never get how people can use that argument after watching his historic post season last year. How can you watch that run and not like him as a player?
“Sprite Cranberry &gt; Sprite Lemon = Sprite Lime” - Lebron James
Okay perfect. You just made my point for me. Aside from a Lebron James outlier signing because that was his hometown. None of those teams are are attracting major free agents.   But I get it. You think no salary cap would help small market teams even though there is no history of that being backed up at all. I disagree. I’m okay with you thinking that 
but LeBron James jr is only 14 and he still hasn't made it to the NBA yet. He'll never be good.  /s
LEBRON JOFREY JAMES
LeBron James is a very good basketball player
"I'm just gonna say I dislike all of you 13 year olds who continue to give Screamin A Shit airtime by justifying you watching him because it's still ""entertaining"" just as much as I hate Screamin A Shit.   Furthermore. Audacity. Lebron James. "

I did.  His name was LeBron James.
"Since the day I was born, my mama has always told me that I’m “too white” to do the things that I love to do. If I had a nickel for every time she said “you’re just a lil’ white boy,” I’d be sittin’ pretty. I wouldn’t have all this student debt, either. That’s for sure.  Here’s the thing— she ain’t wrong, though. I’m what you call a “reverse Oreo.” On the inside, I’m an Atlanta-based trap lord who balls bigger than LaVar in his dreams. But, on the outside, I’m whiter than a fresh jar of marshmallow fluff. I know, it's tacky. But, I am what I am. I love to rap. . . which is not a particularly “white” activity. I love to play basketball, which is also not really known as a “Caucasian pass-time,” if you will. I even have dudes on my Y-League team that say I “talk gangster.” No one ever wants to be that guy. Alas, here I stand. Based on what I’ve said, one could understand why I have a certain appreciation for guys like Larry Bird or Steve Nash. Those were two dudes that, despite all odds, made it to the NBA looking like milk-truck drivers. Overall, LeBron James is my favorite player. But, it's always a little exciting when you see a white dude block him twice on the same play.  That white dude is a man by the name of Luka Doncic. For us white kids, the athleticism of a LeBron James or a Russell Westbrook just isn’t really in the cards. I mean, we have Mac McLung at Georgetown puttin’ on for the honkeys. . . but other than that, there just isn’t that much God-given bounce to go around. I mean, the movie White Guys Can’t Jump didn’t just come out of nowhere. Stereotypes exist for a reason. However, Luka Doncic is quite athletic. He was doubted during the pre-draft process because scouts didn’t think he could adjust to the speed of the NBA after coming over from Europe. Yeah, I think he’s doing just fine. He hasn’t seemed to miss a step after being the MVP of the Euro League. He might not blaze past people like a Kemba Walker or Kyrie Irving, but he holds his own and makes it look easy around the basket as well. Speaking of finishes— for us white kids, the Euro-step was a staple if slashing was your game. It was a glorious move that created new space and angles for guys like Manu Ginobili. It was a cornerstone of white boy ballin’ until James Harden went and appropriated it. But, Luka Doncic did it right back. He went and appropriated that step-back jumper The Beard loves so much. Have you ever seen Doncic hit a step back that’s smoother than Harden’s? Because I have. I see it in every highlight reel that Luca has. And, he doesn’t sport a wack-ass beard while doing it. Double win. Now, this last one is something all basketball fans can relate to, especially if you play a lot of pick-up. You ever see a white guy make some nice moves on the court but he still looks really white while doing it? Like SO WHITE it kinda makes you a little itchy? Cough cough Joe Ingles cough cough. You know what I’m talking about, right? Anyway, Luka does all of these moves and looks smoother than butter dipped in olive oil. His game has so much finesse that he attended the same academy that Gunna rapped about on the hook of “YOSEMITE.” He’s out here making dudes look foolish, like they can’t believe they’re getting crossed up by a saltine in Nikes. Not only is Luka Doncic a baller and should be around for the next 12-15 years in the NBA, he puts a smile on my face. He is the next Great White Hope. He gives all of us charge-takers a glimmer of pride as we watch from our couches and talk about our JV glory days. He's our hero.  I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns."
"Nothing will top the the Thad Young, Magic Johnson, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird stat"
"&gt;or calling them by their first names like we actually know them personally.  I've been following James-san since he got drafted, and I still feel like it'd be disrespectful to call him LeBron or God forbid Bron-chan."
"&gt;Has the MVP Hunt become a Two-man race  Too early to tell. James Harden’s legendary strech is relatively small of a sample size to say he’s gonna win but the competition this year is very tight given how we don’t owe Westbrook and Harden their MVPs anymore. Giannis and Embiid is on the lose and who knows, Steph Curry and LeBron James might have their own set of stretches of greatness but so far, Harden is leading.  &gt;What Will the Warriors Look Like Once They Flip the Switch?  They’ll either struggle a bit when Boogie comes back or steamroll the competition due to the talent disparity. If the latter happens at any point in time, league is fucked.  &gt;When Will the Dust Finally Settle in the West? The competition is too tight this year, 3rd to 8th seed are up for grabs, Although I think the Warriors, Denver, Thunder, Rockets and Blazers in that particular order are sure lock in the play-offs. Next in line would be a bloodbath.  &gt;Will We Get a Season-Swinging Trade at the Deadline?  Yes.   &gt;Are the 2019 Tank Wars Even Fiercer Than Last Year’s? Zion Williamson. RJ Barrett . Cam Reddish. Nassir Little. Bol Bol. Ja Morant and to an extent Rui Hachimura. The draft looks top heavy if you ask me.    If the media is true that Zion is like the second coming of a LeBron-esque player and the most talented prospect since Anthony Davis then why wouldn’t a team not draft Zion.    "
"You think Harden belongs in the top 10 right now?  Harden has a better career than Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Larry Bird right now? Ok lol."
Lebron James

Why can't you answer a simple question?  Is Lebron James saying he is a top 10 player?  Or is Lebron James saying he is the GOAT?  What players should Lebron's record be compated to if he wants to say he is the greatest NBA player of all time?  
That list is pure bullshit! First off Lebron didn’t take on all those people to get to the finals. Lebron James mentally checked out or quit 3 times in the playoffs. You can say what ever you want but is a fact. 1) Heat vs Dallas: mentally check out 2) 2018 Cavs vs Warriors: Gave the fuck up! 3) Cavs vs Boston: quit on the team.   Lebron is a great player but he’s mentally weak. He gets his stats but checks out when the going gets rough. 
I have you tagged as claiming that Russell Westbrook and Steph Curry are better all time players than LeBron James. Can that possibly be true?
"A really good rook indeed.  Rookie LeBron averaged 20.9 pts, 5.5 rebs, 5.9 assists on 42% FG, 29% 3PFG, in 39.5 minutes per game.  Doncic is averaging 19.5 pts, 6.6 rebs, 5.0 assists on 43% FG, 38% 3PFG, in 32 minutes per game.   Of course, Doncic is a mediocre defender as of now. I think he could eventually become a top-10 / top-5 player in the league based mostly on offensive production, a la James Harden. In fact I think he and Harden are kinda similar"
Lebron James has lost in the finals like literally 15 times
"TIL channing frye, richard jefferson and lebron james are white"
5 Lebron James vs 5 Kyle Singlers. Singler may be the GOAT but Lebron is just too big and strong for singler to stop him

"Seriously - first we have to share a division with LeBron James, then Derrick Rose, Giannis, LeBron again...yikes. Spare us the 2nd coming "
"He acts like he's sure fire next LeBron James, he took that ""prince"" nickname too seriously. "
"Durant, Kawhi, and PG are all making a run for James spot (assuming Giannis is a lock for the other). Which voters are brave enough though to put LeBron on 2nd team?"
LeBron James
"GOAT conversation is mostly simple at this point. It just comes down to comparing players to Lebron/Jordan. People have said Giannis has got started too late to be in the conversation (like you're dismissal right now), but that's nonsense.  Right now, Giannis is in his 24 year old season.  Through their 23 year old seasons, Lebron had 1 finals appearance, no major awards. Michael Jordan had 0 finals appearances, and no major awards.  Giannis Antekoumpo through his 23 year old season has 0 finals apperances and no major awards.  In their 24 year old season, Lebron had still yet to win a championship, but won his first MVP. Through his 24 year old season, Michael Jordan had yet to win a championship, but won both his first MVP and DPOY in his 24 year old season.  Right now in his 24 year old season, Giannis Antekoumpo is on the best team in the NBA through the first half of the season. As of right now, he is probably the favorite for both MVP and DPOY (although James Harden could steal the MVP if he keeps it up).  There's a possibility he wins MVP/DPOY this season and wins a championship, which would put him ahead of the pace that Jordan/Lebron were at, at this age.  I would say that Giannis has is a better physical specimen than both Lebron/Jordan as well, so his potential ceiling is higher if he continues to add more skilled play to his game, like both Lebron/Jordan did as they aged.   Will he do it? Probably not, there's so much that can go wrong in trying to pursue being the best ever at something. Is it possible? Sure."
"Alright then, let's go through his career and show you that Paul Pierce undeniably was trash:  Many remember and have heard about Boston's amazing Game 2 comeback against the Nets and how they took a 2-1 lead in the series. But we never hear about what happened afterwards.  Pierce averages 23.7 PPG on 36 FG% with 3.5 TOPG in the final 3 gms.  Elimination: 14Pts 34FG% 4TOs   Against the same Nets team the following season, Pierce falls loses the first 2 games, falling down 0-2 in the series.  How does the legend respond in the rest of the series?  Pierce shot 32% from the field and averaged 6.3 TOs per game as Boston loses both games, getting swept.  In this 2003 Nets series, these were his Elimination game stats:  27 Points  10 Rebounds  7 Assists  29 FG%  7 TOs    In his next playoff appearance, Pierce faces the Indiana Pacers, and after a couple ugly playoff exits, surely the legend responds with a great series.  Nope.  Pierce shoots another abysmal 34% from the field for the series, along with averaging and amazingly terrible 6.3 TOPG.   Pierce's solo career did not get any better from this point on as these were the results of his next three seasons as the best player on his team.  2005 - First Round Exit 2006 - No Playoffs 2007 - No Playoffs    ""He played like this because his teams were so bad""  ""He had nothing to win with""  Fine. Lets absolve every playoff shortcoming before Garnett and Allen arrived.  How did Pierce perform with one of the best rosters in the league?  Playing on a first seeded 66-win team with two players better than himself, Playoff Pierce was still Playoff Pierce.  Ever wondered why the Big 3 always played 6 and 7 games series against mediocre teams? One common denominator.  In Pierce's very first series as a member of the Big 3, against the EIGHTH SEED Atlanta Hawks.  In the first five games of the series, Pierce averaged 16.3 PPG on 40 FG%.  In the elimination game? 22 and 8 while shooting 35%.   Except this time his teammates could bail him out.  You seem to remember that Game 7 against LeBron well, ever wonder why it even when to 7?  Pierce in Games 1-6: 15.8 PPG  5.2 RPG  3.3 APG  3.3 TOPG  36 FG%  ""If I was younger, LeBrons legacy would have been different"" For sure not   In 2009, Garnett goes down, and Pierce is expected to take the lead of a 60+ win team. The result was being taken to 7 games by a Chicago team lead by Rookie Derrick Rose.  In the last 4 games, averaged 24.3 PPG on 40%, 3.5 TOs   And with all the flack Kobe got for his Game 7 performance in 2010, Pierce was worse finishing the series.  In the last 2 games of the 2010 NBA Finals after going up 3-2:  15.0 PPG  7.0 RPG  4 TOPG  38 FG%   And a quick visit of his career against LeBron James.  Pierce in 2010 vs Cleveland averaged 13.5 PPG and 4.7 RPG while shooting 34% from the field.  After going down 0-2, Pierce averaged 18.6 PPG on 34 FG% against Miami in 2012. Luckily, KG and Rondo carried Boston to a 3-2 lead.  And lastly, this.  Pierce asks to guard LeBron James before a game and LeBron during that game, drops his playoff career high of 49 points on the Brooklyn Nets.   Paul Pierce does not have any more than 1 season without at least one terrible playoff series or elimination/closeout game. He got consistently outplayed by his matchups. He cant be a top 75 player of all time, and could not ever be considered a superstar.  Glorified Joe Johnson."
"&gt; Lmao KCP has his own coach funny enough  Exactly why he's the best shooter in the team. Lethal Shooter does that.   &gt;And how come you're only taking select point and just replying ""shooting coach"" rather than taking my entire point into discussion, like how we're still an efficient offense with overall improvement every year Luke Walton has been coach without a shooting coach?  Because that's the main point of the original comment? I'm arguing for getting a shooting coach to help us improve in FTs that have literally lost us games and 3s our team very much likes to shoot that we could really improve on. 3/4 of our young core badly need to improve on those.   Of course the main problem of the losing skid is not having LeBron fucking James, Rondo, &amp; Kuzma on the court. Of course our defensive lapses are also a problem. Of course BI &amp; Ball struggling in the clutch is a problem. But those problems are either currently out of our hands, being handled by ""we should man up and improve on those"", or getting more experience. Thinking of problems WE COULD solve is one of the only things we should focus on. "
"Not his fault per se, it's just that a lot of people portray it as LeBron is on the team so they MUST be a contender. Games lost = they fucking suck and need to be replaced.  Outside a lot of delusional fans I don't see however in the world anyone and especially LeBron looked at last years 35-47 team and thought that a LeBron James is all they need to win it all.  LeBron signed 4 years well knowing they have some time. There's time for them to work as a group, there's time for the young guys to develop further and there's time to get another star or maybe even 2 through a trade, which would be in the 2nd/3rd year of his contract and that's another year of development for the young guys and a chance of doing something at that point."

"Respecting another man's ability in a given profession is great, especially if it inspires you to push yourself in life. But to passively follow them as a *fan*, comes across as insecure and beta.

And you decided to latch on to a professional athlete, the one who was most popular when you were developing, to serve as the father figure you never had.   You cried for him, you emulate him, you feel a sense of allegiance to someone who does not even know or care that you exist. Your insecurity is the reason you made this post to begin with, meaning that whatever bizarre relationship you have with a pro athlete, its not fulfilling your need for guidance, how could it, when its a one way street ""relationship"" with someone you only see on TV.

Scores from literally anywhere on the court in any type of way. Gervin used to be the GOAT scorer, but KD has taken that mantle.   &gt; KD is not a better scorer than Michael Jordan or Lebron James. Both have more 30, 40, 50, and 60 point games than him. Both have higher career ppgs than him in the regular season and in the playoffs.

DeAndre jordan is a better FT shooter than Lebron James. 
"Huh? Kings don't even has a 2nd star or a 1st star to be injured. Lebron has led the Lakers without a 2nd star all year, and even then the supposed 2nd best player Brandon Ingram has missed half the season with suspension and injury. If you think Rondo is their 2nd best player he has missed more than half the season. If you think Javale McGee is their 2nd best player he has been absent as long as CP3.  The fact is the Rockets are supposed to be at the top of the West. Now that they're finally meeting expectations does not make it impressive.   What Mike Conley has done with the Grizzlies and Lebron James has done with the Lakers is more impressive than what Harden is doing."
It's not a playoff vs regular season debate it's an overall scoring debate. Harden over Kd at least has some merit. Harden has more 40 point games than Durant in his career (67 vs 63). Lebron James though has 91.   James Harden has 11 50 points games in his career. Kevin Durant has 6. Lebron James has 13.  James Harden's career high is 60 points. Kevin Durant's career high is 54. Lebron James career high is 61.  Harden is shooting 30 times a game to average 40 points. He ends up averaging a big flashy number but he is shooting it a shit ton he is shooting 40% FG the last 6 games while averaging 42ppg.   Harden's regular season career average is 23.5ppg. His playoff career average is 22ppg.   Lebron's regular season career average is 27.2ppg. His playoff career average is 28.9ppg.  Last year Harden averaged 28.6ppg in the playoffs. Lebron averaged 34ppg in the playoffs.   Last year against the Warriors in the playoffs Harden averaged 28.7ppg on 53% TS. Last year against the Warriors Lebron James averaged 34ppg on 62% TS.  Like it is not even close Lebron James is in the fact the best scorer in the nba since Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain.

"I like how you’re including jump on back when it happens 3 times ever. I believe you when you say you didn’t watch much of Harden lmao. His play is all about getting the defender out of position with dribbles, fakes, crosses, step backs and drives. Lebron flails worse than anyone I’ve ever seen. It’s no surprise he’s going into Hollywood. Kawhi Leonard learned how to hook arms from James Harden bc pop made him watch tape and learn how to do it. Says a lot about that particular ability. But keep on hating.   So ignorant lol. It most def is a circle jerk.

"Remember the post that said Kevin Love became mentally depressed because he played with LeBron James, and it got like 10k upvotes?"
"His defensive issues and playoff struggles (on top of any watchability concerns) have really clouded the conversation around Harden - he's on the inroads to being an inner circle guy in the HOF.  Over the last four years he's averaged 30.0-9.1-6.5-1.7 on .612 TS% (!!!). If we assume this year is his peak, and he'll start that decline next season, you're talking about a guy still putting up 27/7/6 on elite scoring efficiency in his age 34 season (aka the LeBron James).   Since becoming the focal point of an offense in 2012-2013, he leads the league in total points scored with 13014. The next closest is LeBron at 11993. Provided good health, he has a very strong chance to finish inside the top 10 total points scorers ever."
I’m so sick of hearing from this dude. He acts like he’s LeBron James when he’s not even that good. What’s he ever done? Someone remind me.

Lebron James (aye)
"They all come with qualifiers.  If James harden keeps playing out of his gourd, the Rockets by far  If Denver's stars can stay healthy, the Nuggets (and it's too early to look at next year but I'm really excited/hopefully to see what happens with MPJ, I want him to succeed really badly)  If Russ has a good shooting series, the Thunder  If LeBron activates playoff Bron mode, the Lakers "
Not really. James Harden was up double digits going into the second half twice and became a no show when his team needed him. Lebron could definitely close them out under those circumstances.
"No James, we wouldnt have anything to talk about if you would quit your shenanigans.  Nobody denies hes an incredible talent, but he brings criticism on himself by flopping and triggering refs all the time. If we criticise Giannis, LeBron, Westbrook or KD we criticise their game. But when it comes to Harden and CP3 there is all the extra shit they allow everyone to see.  Love his swagger though."
I mean unless you think James harden is better playoff performer than Lebron James than why are we having this discussion.
"Lebron was worse in literally every advanced statistic except for VORP, which is cumulative. I'd be happy to show you a graph if that helps prove my point.       Also, 15 more wins  Also, got swept by Golden State  Also, are you seriously arguing 6'8 LeBron James has more rpg than 6'5 James Harden?  Also, Harden took more threes and maintained the same percentage  Also, LeBron is a net negative on defense  Also, LeBron coasted hard. January stats back it up and again I'd be happy to provide data"
Ok LeBron James Harden 
Jordan was a worse scorer (worse efficiency) and a worse defender (couldn't guard 4s and 5s).  Google LeBron James Derrick Rose torture chamber.  Jordan couldn't defend like that.  Jordan was also a worse passer and rebounder.  And he played on better teams with a better coach
They guy who helped lead a team to an nba finals and won finals MVP and the guy that can recruit lebron james.
"Lol everyone here saying he's an average passer. The dude has been hoovering around 5 assists per game for 6 years now (Second only to LeBron among SF). He's an all-time great scorer Top 3, can D up solidly when he wants to and can pass the rock as good as any SF not named LeBron James or Larry Bird. He's just too good at scoring which is why people's perceptive on his all-round game is skewed"
"If you're making a joke, I don't get it. If you're serious, Stephen Adams twice and then Lebron James."
"Yes.  LeBron is and will always be one of the greatest players of all time, but James Harden is flat out dangerous in the current era. Until the rest of the NBA finds a way to guard him, he appears to be unstoppable."
"Advanced stats are not terrible. Maybe some are not the best, but many of the best ones out there, such as RPM, give a very good view at what some of the most impactful players have been that the eye test itself can not see clearly.   Of course, they are not infallible, but the best analysis happens when advanced stats and the eye test are used in tandem, in   Over the last 5 years, the best players according to aggregated RPM have been Steph Curry, LeBron James, Chris Paul, and James Harden - not a bad list at all, I would say."
"Most advanced stats are terrible and people only use them when it fits their agenda.  When Isaiah Thomas was last in DRPM everyone used it as ""proof"" for him being the worst defender in the league. But the fact that the same stat ranked Kawhi Leonard and Lebron James as average and Klay Thompson as below average defenders was just ignored.   Any stat that ranks Eric Bledsoe above Lebron James shouldn't be taken seriously. "
&gt;Since Lebron James injury.  I couldn't have made it anymore clear
&gt;Since Lebron James injury.  It's right there in the headline lol
"If this was Lebron James saying it, this sub would be up in flames"
Try to Harden's hardon out of your mouth before you speak. We will be able to understand you more clearly. The Rockets struggled against a team the Lakers blew out without Lebron. What a joke of a team. Lebron is gonna sweep on his way to ring this year if James Floppens is all the East can muster this year.
Any rapper: \*releases a song\*      LeBron James' Instagram story: It's Free Real Estate
"""Lebron"" James Harden. Yeah he's a top 3 player (imo) but shit man, it's not like he's being targeted for fouls every game, he literally goes hunting for these things daily. We all know he's going to get his with or without FT, so it's a valid criticism. "

A FC spot and two Wild Cards. I think it's going to come down to him, KAT, Booker, Doncic (who might make it as a starter), which would remove one of the WC spots from these locks), Conley, Klay, Marc Gasol, Devin Booker, Jrue Holiday, his teammate DeMar, and Tobias Harris.   Just looking at that list, I think he probably has a good shot to make it, especially with how he's been playing as of late. I think KAT, Booker and Klay are his biggest competition, and he has a good case against them. I'd give him \~55% chance of making the team in the West. "
"I stand by that shit man, I see this narrative here all the time from people who (rightfully) hate on Gilbert for his handling of LeBron's first tenure and his petty letter after the decision. Then he put aside his ego, hired good people and shelled out the luxury $ to get the city its first championship in 150 seasons.   Ever since LeBron became loved here it's been a meme to mock the Cavs organization because ""lol Anthony Bennett"". People don't understand how hard it is to run a small-market team with LeBron James. When you win a championship, it's because of him. But apparently losing Kyrie, re-signing LeBron's friends and putting in a puppet head coach are all on organization? The Heat had Riley &amp; Wade, the Lakers have Magic, the Cavs have no one close to LeBron's influence.   Most people here would probably name the Cavs as the worst-run franchise because they've never heard of the Nets, Magic, Suns, Knicks, Wolves, Kings, Wizards, Bulls or Hornets since they weren't alive when any of those teams were last relevant.

"You're 100% right but people will still use all stars as a measuring stick for legends of the past. I'm aware they only earned 80-90% of their appearances as well, but the court of public opinion is heavily ruled by all star appearances. Before tip off an announcer will say ""13 time all star LeBron James suits up to take on the San Antonio Spurs"" and never ""7 time All-NBA first team, 3 team All-NBA second team..."" etc. I do agree with you on a personal level because I think legacy being determined by the first half of your season is stupid and leads to fraudulent all stars like Roy Hibbert, but there are plenty of people who will only look so deep and make their assessments from there"
Can confirm. I bought those gloves and I am now LeBron James. AMA!

"The issue wasn’t so clear cut as it sounds.    Kyrie is a good playmaker, but was reluctant to do so.    See this exchange:     &gt; During a rare practice in the middle of last season, coach Tyronn Lue, who was standing next to assistant coach and Irving confidante Phil Handy, called out to his young point guard.  &gt;“Ky,” Lue said, “I want you to play a little faster.”  &gt;“Why?” Irving asked.  &gt;“Because if we play faster, we get shots off easier.”  &gt;“I don’t need to play faster to get my shot off,” Irving replied. &gt;“I can do that anytime.”  &gt;“I’m not talking about your shot. I’m talking about RJ and JR,” Lue said, citing teammates Richard Jefferson and Smith.  &gt;[“Well, that’s No. 23’s job,” Irving replied, referring to James.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/thebiglead.com/2018/01/04/kyrie-irving-ty-lue-lebron-cavs/amp/)  &gt;According to members of the Cavs organization who witnessed the exchange, Lue ended the conversation by walking away, shaking his head."

"Can you read the actual article instead of posting garbage every single time. This is a serious pattern with you. Let me just quote the article which makes this a total non-issue.  &gt;The contentiousness connected to the two teams went in many different directions, reportedly including an unofficial ban by the Cavaliers on any sneakers endorsed by Warriors’ point guard Stephen Curry.  Not an official ban, if anything the contents contained in the story make this more of an understanding than an actual ""ban"". But let's continue through the article since this is the only chance you read anything in the actual article.  &gt;Ric Bucher of Bleacher Report looked at how NBA rivalries and the competitive nature of individual players help drive what footwear is worn. He noted that edict by the Cavaliers after citing Golden State forward Draymond Green’s similar attitude about wearing shoes endorsed by former Cavs forward LeBron James.  This talks about it as a policy across the NBA as a whole. You don't wear your rivals' shoes. This is very understandable. It's why Nike's owner might choose to never wear Adidas. It's not a true ban, it's about how rivalries influence the choice of shoe.  &gt;It was understood more than plainly stated, leaving one member of the Cavs’ Finals roster last year unaware of the rule—but only, perhaps, because he never considered wearing UAs. Another former Cavalier texted: ‘There was no way anyone on [Cleveland] the last few years would wear [them], for the obvious reasons.'  Read as: If you aren't a dipshit, you would understand why Cavs would never wear a Curry shoe.  This is such a non-issue and you want to pretend like it's something substantial. You're a joke."
"If LeBron James is Zion's ceiling, Guerschon Yabusele is his bottom. "
"You’re overstating this if you’re blaming it primarily on Lebron. No, it was the whole team he was beating. He had a number of drives on Kuzma and Hart. He fooled the guy you represent in your flair and the Lakers switching by slipping a back screen for a layup. He blew by Lonzo baseline on a closeout for a score. He fooled Lebron stepping back for a long time when James thought he was going to use a hand off to Din.   Blaming Lebron for this is wishful thinking because if it’s Lebron it can be mitigated with better effort from him. It was mostly Kuzma who the Lakers attacked, but Dudley got the other guys too. Unlike with Lebron, Kuz getting worked by a guy like Dudley is not something that probably changes. "
&gt;He noted that edict by the Cavaliers after citing Golden State forward Draymond Green’s similar attitude about wearing shoes endorsed by former Cavs forward LeBron James:
"If teams treated every late first as ""maybe LeBron"" they would never be traded, lol. And the thing about late firsts is that it turned into Anzejs Pasecniks, who is decidedly not LeBron James."
"The rules are about tampering, difference is there is no chance what Kevin Knox wants is affecting the choices of other NBA players. What Lebron James wants could easily affect the plans on other NBA players, and he has a history of doing that (Wade/Bosh, forced the trade for Love, was the defacto GM in Cleveland for a few years, ect.)"
"If you are a top-5 NBA player and Kevin Knox says ""lets team up"" and Lebron James says ""lets team up"" who are you going to listen in on. Which one are you going to laugh out of the park unless there is something else there?  "
"Ones lebron james , ones kevin knox  If you need an explanation on the difference thats too bad, its pretty obvious"
"Easy, ask who is Kevin Knox to the average casual NBA fan, they might recognize him as a top-10 pick, but not when or to who for the most part.   Ask the average casual NBA fan who Lebron James is and they are talking about his diet that ESPN went over this morning "
Pretty obviously LeBron James. Probably followed by Bird/Durant/Irving.

"if you have to sit here and tell me i should have more respect for brian fucking cardinal when dirk was up against lebron james, dwayne wade, and chris bosh, i'm not sure we'll ever see eye to eye on this. like yes, championship teams have good players, excellent point, but you're missing the point in a huge way here."
"Yall dont understand the concept of ""hot take"" do you?  Here are some actual hot takes  1. Ben simmons is a rich man's evan turner  2.

"Ah yes, it was unacceptable when the mediocre 47 win Heat added pre-prime LeBron James and Chris Bosh, or the 47 win Bulls signing Rodman (a risky signing at the time, because Rodman was known for being impossible to work with and wasn't even that good yet).  Those are definitely comparable to what many consider *the best team of all time* that won 73 games adding the 2nd best player in the league at a discount rate and then adding one of the best centers (if healthy) in the league for a league average salary. Uhu."

"Last year's Last 2 Minute Report analysis by 538 shows that Kemba Walker, Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Demar Derozan, Damian Lillard, and Kyrie Irving (among others) had calls more often called against them than in their favor.  James Harden, Giannis Antentokoumpo, and Demarcus Cousins were among the few stars who got more calls in their favor in the last 2 minutes than calls against them.  https://pudding.cool/2017/02/two-minute-report/"
He got murdered by James and now he's taking revenge on James. Next we'll see Jamal posterizing Lebron.

Because the Celtics don't have a LeBron James.
And that was before social media era . Word spread slower back then compared to the way people consume entertainment now .   Lebron James was probably one of the most 5-10 recognizable people in the United States during his senior year of HS. I doubt we'll ever see anything like that again . 
"No offense to Zion, but compared to LeBron, Zion is a novelty.  LeBron was dubbed King James at age 16.  Zion is basically - look at this really big guy jump!  "
"if lebron got calls like 10+ every night with how much he drives his 70% career FT rating would be a much bigger deal than it is, it's still a problem but he's not a guard and he usually gets less than 10 FT's a game so it's not as big as it -could- be  but for a guard like lonzo who most definitely could see more than 10 + ft's a game when he's got the ball more and is suppose to be the one to drive to the basket to open things up, it becomes a gigantic problem for him to be shooting bad, especially 60% or less  can you even imagine harden shooting as bad as james or heaven forbid lonzo at the ft line? that'd be a HUGE fucking problem  you'd go from a free 10-15 points a night to like 6-7 and probably get fouled even more so you had to go to the line instead of doing the step back 3's  when your shitty ft % makes you miss out on 30-50% of your career point average shit is an issue"
"So teams can guard Durant, LeBron, Steph, AD, Giannis, properly? Or James Hardens game is built on drawing fouls? "

"Yeah man, heaven forbid someone need to get off reddit for an hour and a half in the middle of the day.  If that’s your strongest argument for ESPN consistently telling lies, I think my point stands. Part of the problem is people like you are so fucking eager to prove ESPN wrong, you ignore half of the words that are being said and hear what you want to hear to prove your point.  If we take SAS at his word, a person close to Lebron said he would be “tempted” to beat Kyrie’s ass if he was in front of him at that moment. Again, assuming SAS is being truthful right now, do you think he was reporting that Lebron James was seriously going to risk his career and potentially his freedom to physically assault Kyrie Irving, or do you think his source was saying he was so angry at the situation that he would be “tempted” to want to lash out physically?

"The Golden State Warriors unironically broke the NBA regular season record with 73 wins, came back from a 3-1 deficit against the Oklahoma City Thunder, gained a 3-1 lead on the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals, and then lost 3 games in a row and did not win the championship. Stephen Curry unironically won unanimous MVP, back to back MVPs, and exclaimed ""We not goin' home!"" during a game, before being blocked by LeBron James a record 7 times in one series and indeed going home. Klay Thompson unironically said in a post game interview after going up 3-1 that basketball ""is a man's game"" and LeBron James ""got his feelings hurt"", LeBron proceeded to average 36pts/12ast/10reb and won the next 3 games and the championship. Draymond Green unironically avoided suspension for kicking Steven Adams in the balls twice, then STILL continued to play dirty and finally got suspended during the most important series of his life and ultimately cost his team its once historic and now infamous season. These things all actually happened, the thoughts of this reality stay with me at all times. I go to sleep at night looking up at the stars, wondering what celestial being aligned the universe in such a way to make an event as amazing as this occur. I wake up smiling every morning knowing that the Warriors genuinely went 73-9 and choked a 3-1 lead in the Finals. That even if time is a nonlinear fourth dimension, going to back to stop it from happening will simply create another universe where it happens again. That the state of ass-blastedness emanating from the city of Oakland is eternal and infinite, it crosses countless dimensions of the multiverse and its unending torment knows no bounds. I gaze into the endless cosmic wonders around me, still in disbelief that it actually happened, but knowing that my purpose in life was to be born just in time to see LeGod get one for da land."
"[Buha] As Lebron finished his dinner, Luke Walton was on the table watching and waiting. When Walton saw James finish, he started walking towards him. James saw Walton and sped up, running away to the restroom as Walton yelled “Lebron! Lebron!” with his hand out."

"Arvydas has a son who plays for the Indiana Pacers (Domantas)   Golden State are absolutely the dominant force in the league, everyone hates them  The league is obsessed with three pointers now.  Lebron James is pretty much 100% the best player in the league, after that the list gets very subjective  Many teams are trying to lose on purpose, so they can get a high pick in the draft. Not sure if this was as common back in the late 90s/early aughts.  My best advice to catch up would be to look at the past few award winners online (MVP, ROY, All-Nba teams, etc.) And search YouTube for videos on the sport, like the youtubers takes on who is the best in the league. You'll get plenty of bias, but take everything with a grain of salt and you'll be fine."
The Warriors are the most stacked team in the league and it's not close  The top players are   LeBron James (top 3 player ever)  Kevin Durant and Steph Curry (both on the warriors)  James Harden (reigning MVP)  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Anthony Davis  The Warriors have won 3 of the last 4 championships.

"I believe Lebron and Kyrie's relationship is still very strong. The hyperbole is that they had a falling out. Maybe that was the case at first when Kyrie thought Lebron was trying to trade him, but now it is known Lebron rejected all those trades. It seems Kyrie left because he felt disrespected by the Cavs franchise for even including him in trade talks in the first place.  Everything else about Kyrie and Lebron's relationship shows they still respect each other. They still do their secret handshake after games, Lebron has publicly talked about not wanting his 'superstar point guard' traded, Kyrie has called Lebron the real MVP over James Harden, they're seen together at the all-star game sitting beside each talking and laughing etc.  That said, if Kyrie goes to LA he would have to accept being second banana forever and I don't think that's his mindset. On the other hand, he knows he could win more with Lbj, and every bad loss with Boston will make his free agency decision more difficult. I think Kyrie is the guy to choose the more difficult path, but when that path is so frustrating and looks to be failing, it's possible Kyrie's decision making changes."
"Yes it is passive aggressive bullshit if it doesn’t work, but this is Lebron James. The guy is a leader, and he understands how to get through to his teammates and make them understand what it takes to be a champion. Him being injured rn, although coincidental, is teaching the same lesson to his teams: we’re in the big leagues now, and everyone will come at us so we have to play every night together.  He knows what it takes to be a champion and what it is to lose, so yeah it could have been petty bullshit, but he knew what he was doing"

"Haha, I usually do this on articles because I understand where you're coming from, but this time I decided not to because I started to feel like people didn't actually cared about reading articles that much to want them on reddit (when they can't access the font). Thank you for showing I was wrong!  So, I'll do it in two parts because of the length of it, hope you don't mind.    ----- &amp;nbsp;  #How Cedi Osman earned LeBron James' respect and built a special bond that goes beyond basketball  &amp;nbsp;  The relationship between Cedi Osman and LeBron James got off on the wrong foot. Literally.  ""The thing I remember clearly is how quiet that gym got,"" Cavs head coach Larry Drew recalls about Sept. 27, 2017. ""Practice is going. There's all the talk, all the chatter and then that happened and it was just total silence.""  There was Osman, a rookie taking part in his first official NBA training camp. He had left Turkey and was in a new country, trying to prove that he belonged, trying to earn the respect of his new teammates that had only known him from grainy YouTube clips and a Head and Shoulders commercial.  Then in his opening scrimmage, he stepped on James' foot, sending the franchise player hobbling off the court with a nasty ankle sprain.  ""Man, Cedi saw his life -- and his career -- flash before his eyes,"" Channing Frye told cleveland.com while laughing. ""He was about to be on the first flight back to Istanbul.""  In a strange twist, that was James' first glimpse of the qualities he has come to appreciate. That terrifying moment actually sparked what has become a tight bond between James and Osman.  ""That was the time when I felt I started earning that respect,"" Osman said. ""That's what he liked to see, that I'm fighting hard, that I'm working hard.""  &amp;nbsp;  #Beyond basketball  On Feb. 7, 2018, following weeks of tension and questions about the season slipping away, James rescued the Cavaliers once again. He punctuated his triple-double with a game-winning fade-away jumper at the buzzer that gave Cleveland renewed hope. While the Minnesota Timberwolves were left in shock, James went sprinting toward his teammates. Well, one in particular. Osman.  The two jumped for joy and chest-bumped. It was the kind of celebration that made it seem like they had known each other for years.  It took time to get to that point.  Most of the early conversations weren't even about basketball. The intention was for James to learn about Osman the person. The two discussed their love of soccer. James would ask Osman about European culture. Osman would inquire about James' younger days growing up as a basketball prodigy while also facing plenty of hardships along the way.  Eventually, road trips led to lunches and dinners. It was small group of four. James, Osman, Jeff Green and Jose Calderon.  Osman and Calderon favor classical music. James and Green love rap.  ""Every moment we had together was amazing because every day we were on the road we were talking about something different,"" Osman said.  As the season progressed, James started singling out Osman in postgame interviews, praising the rookie for his basketball IQ, work ethic, hustle and professional approach.  ""For me, every practice with him, dinner, lunch, being together was special. It was my favorite,"" Osman said. ""I will say I was really proud when he was talking about me to the media. What he was saying about me, all that good stuff, that was really special to me.""  &amp;nbsp;  #Exclusive summer workout  It was Game 5 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals. As the clock ticked down, James launched a 3-pointer at the buzzer that dropped through the net and gave the Cavaliers a 3-2 series lead over the feisty Indiana Pacers.  Just like his heroics a few months earlier against the Timberwolves, James rushed toward his teammates to celebrate.  Once again, Osman was there to catch him mid-flight.  That photo was the same one Osman used for his heartfelt Instagram post on July 2, the day after James announced his decision to join the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BkvoE7InqB-  ""Some people bring out the worst in you, others bring out the best,"" Osman wrote. ""And there are remarkably rare ones, who just bring out the most of everything that even you don't know that you have. They build you up. They make you feel alive. They make you feel strong. They make you feel indisputable. From the first moment we met, you've always been that rare one for me, King.  ""I don't believe in coincidences. I choose to believe my path crossed with you for a reason. And that reason will be uncovered as I continue to walk through. Please accept my highest gratitude for your support and appreciation for your inspiration. I'm truly blessed to have been surrounded by your charm.""  Even though James was headed for LA, Osman believed the two would still stay close. During Las Vegas Summer League, they got together for dinner.  That's when James extended an invitation to Osman, asking his former teammate if he was interested in an exclusive workout with some of the league's best small forwards.  James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Osman.  ""What do you expect me to say? I said, 'Of course, you know, that would be perfect,'"" Osman said. ""First day we worked out together and then the next day he said we were going to work out with KD and Kawhi. I was like so excited and said, 'Wow, three best small forwards in the world and I'm going to have opportunity to learn from them and work out with them.'  ""That's something I will not forget ever. Because always watching them on the TV when I was a kid or playing the games with them and then one time practicing with them so it was an amazing feeling.""  https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmwqhy7H2L7  Osman remembers being a nervous wreck taking jumpers alongside those perennial MVP candidates. He can still picture himself clanking outside jumpers off the front of the rim before Durant gave him a pointer to help his form.  In a way, it was like those early days inside Cleveland Clinic Courts, when James welcomed Osman into his post-shootaround group.  ""Cedi is an awesome human being and I think the way he plays lends itself to, like most people who are around him want him to be really, really good,"" Frye said. ""I think Bron just took that and saw that Cedi has a fire so Bron is like, well I'm going to continue to stoke it. I think Bron and Cedi, their relationship is more like big brother, little brother. It's a great relationship for Cedi. I think it's good for Bron to have somebody that looks up to him.""  &amp;nbsp;  #Checking in  Osman has James' number but he doesn't want to be a bother. He usually attempts to text James once or twice every two weeks just to catch up and see how the season is going. It's their way of keeping the relationship strong despite being thousands of miles away.   In November, when Osman was forced to miss a pair of games with back spasms, James reached out.  ""He was asking how I was feeling and stuff like that,"" Osman said. ""He's my favorite player in the world but having him ask how my back is and caring about me, that's something that's really special.""  When James returned to Cleveland on Nov. 21, he embraced his former teammates prior to tipoff. Then Osman got a few chances to guard James during the game, something Osman had been thinking about since James' departure in free agency.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BqfWZknl_9O  The Lakers got the best of the Cavs, 109-105, as James delivered yet another reminder of what Cleveland no longer has.  After the LA win, James sipped down a banana milkshake from Swenson's and reflected on his 11 years in Cleveland. He also heaped more praise on Osman.  ""My relationship has grown even stronger with Cedi even though I've been on another coast,"" James said. ""I've been keeping up with him throughout this season and the best thing I told him tonight, I told him, 'You finally took my advice and started wearing Nikes.'""  So what was it about Osman -- a wide-eyed, over-eager, unpolished rookie when they first met -- that made James take him under his wing?  ""By showing up on time, every single day. Putting in the work every single day. And being a professional every single day,"" James said. ""Cedi is one of my favorite guys that I've played with and it was only a year, but he's a sponge and you can see that he has a love of the game.""  "

"Right, obviously everyone knows that. The point is more that when Kyrie's talking about the young guys not knowing what it takes to get to the Finals/win a championship, the thing that irks a lot of fans is that Kyrie hasn't shown *he* knows what it takes to do that either, without the best player in the world on his team. Like, obviously Tatum and Brown and Smart and Hayward and Horford would reach the finals *with LeBron fucking James on their EC team*. Which is all Kyrie's ever done -- great success with LeBron. He has a chance to prove he can do more and I believe he will, but he hasn't yet. "
"If you want to know about PEDs in NBA, ask european players. Because in Europe are so caring about PEDs in basketball and soccer.  You can ask Pau Gasol for example, what gave/offer to him to go from 2'15 and 99 kilos playing in Barcelona with 19 years old, and then being 128 kilos playing with the spanish olympic team 7 years later.  Why do you think the NBA does bot reevaluate weights of players?? Do you think LeBron James is/was 250?? Is vox populi he reached nearly 280 with the Miami Heat. Or Giannis. See his change in 5 years. AD gained 20 pounds in one summer. Do you think Embiid is 260?? Like Tim Duncan??   I mean... Rice and chicken... Pasta and eggs... There is a limit"

Patrick Beverley just said something ridiculous to Griffin who is now “Jim Halpern’ing” into the camera.   Kemba of course is stoked and looking to his fellow players, but nobody noticed him. Sorry Kemba, but that’s Charlotte.    "
"*Flashback to Lebron taking his talents to South Beach*  *Flashback to incecently listening to the 'I'm Coming Home' song/article with the kind of smile that make strangers want to take you down a peg*  *Flashback to Lebron announcing he's leaving on the day my child is born, still give him the middle name James, somber and bittersweet*  *Perk back up when I remember 'The East runs through Cleveland'*  "
absolutely spot on. He's acting like these young dudes are in the same position he was in when LeBron came back. They almost clawed their way to the NBA FINALS for god's sake and played a team-oriented style of basketball that was fantastic to watch. And I'm certainly not going to forget how good they looked.  All season I've been reading Kyrie dogging his teammates. That only works when you have the cache of a LeBron James and even then it's criticized. 
35 FOR LEBRON JAMES!!!
"Leave it to the guy with a ""\[NBA\] Lebron James"" flair lmao. So lame. "
"Man, I know that feeling. I'm a Rockets fan who has dared being critical of our team, and same shit happens.  I've been downvoted so much that I can only post on /r/Rockets once every 9 minutes now.  And it's not like I'm posting hot takes. It's just stuff like the recent post where they ask if James Harden is the best player in the league, and my answer is *No, LeBron is*. Same thing with ""Are we going to win the championship""? No GSW is.   Nothing dramatic, but it seems like the fanbase of teams that have success always turns delusional and somewhat toxic."
Probably talking about his own team which has been swept in the past two years by Lebron James despite overhauling their playing style and roster
Top ten MVP candidates according to Basketball Reference (based on past voting patterns):  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. James Harden  3. Anthony Davis  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. Kevin Durant  6. Nikola Jokic  7. Stephen Curry  8. Joel Embiid  9. LeBron James  10. Paul George  Many would put Harden ahead of Giannis because Harden has been historically hot in the last month.  Keep in mind that team record is a big component of this formula.
ITT: Kyrie isn't LeBron James
Hot take: Lebron James is better than Kyrie Irving.
"Either you stay LeKyrie Jamesson or leave long enough to come Kyrie *""LeBron James""* Irving."
"Imagine being Lebron James and being called ""a bust #1 pick""."
"I tend to agree. Dirk had a lot of failures before his magnum opus that was the 2011 playoffs. I feel like people bring up Dirk's greatest accomplishment, the 2011 Finals, only as a means to put down LeBron, rather than to elevate Dirk. People don't realize how good that Mavs team was. Of course, this doesn't excuse the choke by James, but they act like the Mavs that year were scrubs. They made work of the Thunder and ran a train on Kobe's Lakers. Many people just take things for face value "
I literally said he's not LeBron James? 
And slip in an image of a flat Earth . . .   . . . And Lebron James . . .
"LeBron James and Kevin Durant deserve more than the Max. But even if we ignore that, Hayward, pre-injury, was also made an impact on the defensive end, and had ball handling skills. He was skilled at almost all aspects of the game. Jack of all trades, master of none. That also isn't to say he is only okay at any one of these traits. He is legitimately skilled. It's more than 20ppg. It's defensive impact, it's spacing, it's ball handling, it's most aspects of the game. He was at the start of his Prime, 26-27 years old is a normal start to a prime, and it's not everyday someone STARTING their prime are available. He is absolutely worth the Max based off ALL these factors coming together."
Guy who average 20ppg once on his contract year is not worth the same amount as Kevin Durant and Lebron James.

He's awfully full of himself for a dude who lead his team to 33 fucking wins without LeBron James
"Players who have experience with reaching and succeeding in the playoffs without LeBron James:  - Tatum, Brown, Rozier, Smart, etc  Players who do not have that experience:  - Kyrie Irving  Maybe Kyrie should talk less shit."
lol. People really tried to say Kyrie was a better leader than fucking Lebron James.
LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION!
"Ya know, that LeBron James guy knows a thing or two about championship level teams. Would be crazy to see Kyrie play with LeBron, wonder if they could win one?"
"Lebron, Durant and Kobe in any given season have never attempted as many FT per game as James Harden has this year (11.0)   In fact, for the past 5 years James Hardens *average* is higher than the career highs of Lebron, Durant and Kobe."
It takes Lebron James to be a championship team if Kyrie is any indication.

Look here: [Herosports Conparison](https://m.herosports.com/nba/player-comparison/lebron-james-vs-luka-doncic)   Pay attention to minutes per game so the stats are actually closer if you equalize them to 36 minutes per game for both.

LeBron James 
Bruce Bowen is a legend lol. THE stopper on some of the best defensive teams of all time.  A guy who shut down Lebron James and Richard Hamilton in finals series. Not to mention all the great players he had to guard to get to the finals. If you want to knock the spurs for bad jersey retirements why not bring up Avery Johnson? Bruce Bowen would have gotten his jersey retired by any other team if he did the same things he did for the spurs. 
"How about ""shutting down Lebron James in the Finals"" as being the thing you're most remembered for. Pretty fuckin awesome. "
Because Lebron James didn’t play for okc Thunder 
"&gt;Harden doesn’t shoot off screens often cause he is the one shooting or distributing 90% of the time.  And he's far and away worse at it and it's not remotely close. He handles the ball so much because he's worthless off the ball.  &gt;Free throws Curry has a better free throw percentage by 5%  Yep.  &gt;Again Harden has the ball in his hands most the time, and is guarded all the way up to court so that’s some serious spacing  Not remotely close to what steph does to defenses.  &gt;Harden doesn’t really set screens, people set them for him because he is the best shooter on his team  Yep, again, Steph is better. Lmao sounds like you don't watch much basketball if you don't think shooters should be setting screens. By your logic Steph shouldn't set screens for any player who has ever played.  &gt;Harden is one of the best guards at defending the post, Curry is a liability everywhere on defense and that’s why most teams ISO him  That's literally Harden's only strength on defense and he literally ball watches the rest of the time. He's a horrendous liability on defense. Steph is easily a better defender and teams iso him because that's the better option (and guess what: it [doesn't work](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/6/8/17441998/lebron-james-steph-curry-mismatch-2018-nba-finals)  &gt;And Curry has just as many bad games, but has other all time shooters to help him out  Doesn't choke nearly as hard as Harden does basically every single year.  &gt;Overall, I disagree with most of what you said  Actually sounds like you agreed with most, just throwing out excuses"
Crazy that Westbrook has the same number of triple doubles as LeBron James and James Harden combined lol
"If Lebron James had these numbers and the Lakers record was the same as the Rockets right now....then Lebron would be unanimous MVP. I don't think the Rockets and Lakers rosters sans James Harden and Lebron are too different in talent.   &amp;#x200B;  What Harden is doing right now is incredible, and deserving of an MVP. "

"Honestly having a bad supporting cast actually helps in terms of counting stats for a lot of people.  &amp;#x200B;  Like James Harden kind of just... doesn't have someone else that dribbles beyond a 3rd grade level when Eric Gordan and CP3 were out. The offense became ""Uhhh... dribble and shot and shit Harden"" and he did that for posession after posession. He's an elite offensive player and with as many shots as he takes someone like KD or LeBron would get similar production.  &amp;#x200B;  However because he HAS to do that his case for MVP is bolstered. His counting stats look better."
The sub is basically centered around KD being a snake and joining the Warriors . Harden being a great player to be argued by people convinced he just great at drawing fouls.  Everything and anything about Lebron and the endless debate of who's better Jordan or James and all things hate related from Golden State accept Curry and Klay.

"&gt;From a business perspective it’s a tremendous move but it’s a terrible move from the perspective of basketball operations      Is this a real fucking opinion? No GM in the ENTIRE LEAGUE is going to agree with your opinion that signing Lebron James is a terrible move from the perspective of basketball operations.   This is the most idiotic take I've ever read on this website, bar none. "
Let's take these final minutes to talk about something more important. Lebron James. We all know he will eventually lose his athleticism. He already looks a bit slower and god knows what happens at age 35 with all that wear and tear. I think the solution to this is if Lebron turns into black Jokic. That means he does ass to the grass squats and bulks up to play the four position and basically become black Jokic. A big man with great passing ability. Deceptive speed around the rim and in the perimeter. Ability to hit the spot up 3. Black Jokic. This will allow to extend his career to age 40 and continue to be very productive. It will be hard for Lebron to accept the much needed adjustment but it's the best thing for his legacy going forward.
That massive contract and him keeping the team competitive is going to hamper the teams growth for several years. He will be 37 if he takes his option in his final year. Do you think he will still be Lebron by then? He may not even be Lebron next year and already showing the wear and tear.  From a business perspective it’s a tremendous move but it’s a terrible move from the perspective of basketball operations. A GM looking for sustained success should know the Lakers were too young for that signing to make sense and it’s already been shown to be a lousy move because they aren’t that much better with James on the floor.  They are going to be hamstrung for 4-7 years because of that signing. If they win a ring with Lebron there it will be s miracle and they will feel the effects of the signing for several years after he’s gone.

"Today's awards I feel are too seasonal narrative based. Before the season even started we were already clamoring for Giannis MVP, then James Harden has recently gone on a tear. Before that, it was Russel Westbrook's triple double season as the solo star after Durant left.. And worst of all, Lebron/Curry are not in consideration for MVP just because of voters fatigue.. like what tf does that even mean.. (and I say this as someone who doesn't like LBJ and the Warriors)"
"When I think “Most Valuable Player”, I think of the player that contributed the most value to a team.  Without Harden, the Rockets are still a hugely successful team that wins 50+ games without struggle. A great team made marginally better. But put Harden on a bad team, and they don’t suddenly become a great team, or even a good team. Put him on a different great team, and you end  up with much the same results. Obviously speculative, but there’s no world where James Harden transforms the uncontested worst team in the league into the second best team in the league single-handedly.   Lebron did that, and you could get similar results by putting Lebron on literally any other team.   So, if you swap Lebron and Harden in 2017-2018, the Cavs are now a shit team and the Rockets win the championship.   In what world is Harden more valuable to a team than Lebron is to any team he’s on?"

You cant compare them because of the eras to me. The fact that mj existed in a time where you could literally punch people and it wasnt a foul makes a difference. Obviously lebron James is tough enough to take that. But could he do what Jordan did? Just hard to say without seeing it. 
"When scoring a bucket in gargabe time against a tanking team means the same for this guy's list than scoring a game winning shot in the PO in a game 7 then that list has no value whatsoever.  Not to mention that he just puts the weight he wants on the things he wants.  Chris Paul as #21 player of all time ahead of Stockton, Curry, Durant or D-Wade is enough to just qualify that list as complete garbage.  Im sorry but KG at #8 is insane.   &gt; I think a reasonable downgrade is fair, but that still leaves Pippen in the top thirty.  Pippen was in the low 40s of that list when it was released. We are talking about a guy with 0 MVPs, 0 finals MVP and 7 All-Stars that averaged 16ppg in his career. There are a lot of players that have more accolades, more awards and better stats than him .... and actually leading their teams.  Duncan, Kobe, Lebron, Gary Payton, Garnett, D-Wade, Allen Iverson, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden and Russell Westbrook  would all enter for sure in a new top 50 list and that will put Pippen out of the list guaranteed."

"I dont see why people would pick him all the seasons. Last 2 seasons I'd picked James Harden. I'd also have picked Curry and Durant in their MVP seasons.  Curry in his 2nd MVP scored 30ppg (Lebron only averaged that once in his career) shooting 50/45/90 on 67% TS. It was INSANE.  Lebron best offensive rating in his career was 116 in 2017. Curry has had  117, 120, 119 and 120 in the last 4 seasons.  In that 2nd MVP, Curry also had a defensive rating of 99.4 when Lebron only averaged lower than that once in his career (during his prime in Miami in 2012).  Literally Lebron has never had a single regular season better than Steph Curry in 2015/16. Nor better either than what Curry did in 2014/15 aswell."
"I don't know why this is the case, but people just do not want to recognize greatness and enjoy it while it's happening. Instead they want to bitch and dismiss things, then retroactively act like they enjoyed it all and compare the next new great player negatively to said past player they were shitting on.  I've been watching sports for 30+ years. It's always been this way. This subreddit is young and for whatever reason sports journalists purposely won't admit it and will either rely on the young age of viewers or goldfish level attention span of viewers to not notice.  I have heard constant criticisms of great players, often even while they were winning chips when they're young.  Michael Jordan was a ballhog. The rules changed to favor him. Tom Brady is a system player. Peyton Manning is a choker. Dirk is soft and can't play defense. Alex Ovechkin is a loser. Sidney Crosby is a crybaby. LeBron James is a coach killer and can't win at the top level. Kobe blew up a dynasty and is a chucker. It just goes on and on.  And somehow, someway everyone just forgets or doesn't know. Somehow they just never were around for this stuff or outright deny it. Perhaps the easiest way to tell a player is truly great and will be worshiped in the future is when they are shit on in the present. If they're not actually getting shit on, nobody actually cares much and they'll likely be forgotten.   "
"I normally want to say something more constructive, but this is pretty much trash. I appreciate your effort, but it is very selective the stats you are putting up. You skip a lot of Lebron seasons and you skip a lot of MJ seasons, while including his baseball year for some reason. You also don’t note that 4/6 and 2/3 are the ummm... same.  But what is more interesting is the evolution of the MVP voting if anything. Bosh was an MVP candidate when forming the super trio. And Lebron was always the leader of the Cavs, which took the air out of the rise of Kyrie and stymied teammates of MVP calibers like Love and Bosh.   Somewhere Bosh wrote about this. The sacrifice of being in a supportive role rather than the growth of an individual player with freedom to be great on their own.   In 2016, Kyrie’s was overlooked for his role, when he was getting 20-30pts per playoff game. In 2017, Lebron was on a team with Derrick Rose, Wade, Isaiah Thomas, and Kevin Love.   I think what would be an interesting comparison is how many aggregate allstar appearances his teammates had. For instance, look at Harden and CP3. If CP3 was on his own, he would have finished much higher in MVP voting. Westbrook wasn’t in the conversation when Durant was the “leader,” of the Thunder. And Paul George took a backseat to Westbrook last year.   Getting MVP votes does not denote the quality of players. Steph Curry isn’t surrounded by nobody’s because Klay Thompson, Draymond, Igoudala, and now Durant, and it doesn’t say a single thing about Steph’s value or individual abilities.  James notoriously builds his teams with other superstars. When he returned to Cleveland, he joined Kyrie and pushed for the trade for Kevin Love. Nearly an entire roster was uprooted. Same with Miami and their moves to bring in James and Bosh.   They are very close in skill and abilities and their leadership. I don’t take anything away from either of them and there’s a reason there’s such a tight debate. Measuring MVP votes is arbitrary and not at all a controlled environment for comparison because the opponents aren’t the same and voting isn’t the same, let alone a valuable measure of talent, leadership, or domination. "
And it's not like we just shipped him to Phoenix or something. We sent him to play with LeBron James 
"I mean, if you actually did the MVP on who was the most valuable player to a team, there would've only been 2 winners over the past decade.  LeBron James and Stephen Curry."

"Depends what you mean by MVP. Was LeBron still the better player? yea. Was he more valuable to his team than James Harden was to his? Hell yea. But did James Harden have a better 82 game stretch? Yes, and this is the criteria people have to vote on if they want to keep the MVP race interesting"
"I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. Cause I watched Nash play in his prime and he was the most talented passer of the basketball I ever saw. Didn't get to see prime Magic or Pistol Pete. Nash had flair, but also very efficient with it. Curry just doesn't have that level of creativity, vision and technique. Even though Curry can be very flashy at times with his passing, he is more tier 2. Just like Jordan was also a very underrated passer, but nobody will ever compare his passing ability to that of Larry Bird or Lebron James. "

"i find it hard to believe that he’s drawing more legitimate contact in the paint than lebron james or  giannis.  regardless, the point is that he is the superstar with the *most* calls"
"Michael Jordan is leagues above LeBron James. If you disagree, chances are you are too young to have ever watched him play.   I would put any one year highlight reel from Michael Jordan's career up against LeBron's CAREER highlight reel any day. Michael Jordan was not human. He moved like gravity didn't exist. He was magic. LeBron has a few powerful drunks and a couple deep threes and that's about it.   Half of basketball is defense. Michael Jordan was a monster on defense. He won All Defensive nine times. in one season alone he had over 150 steals and 100 blocked shots. There's no way LeBron even came close to that as a defender.   Lastly, MJ changed the game of basketball. That Bulls dynasty changed the way coaches coach and players play. He brought in billions of endowment deals, to him and the league, shot TV ratings through the roof and was treated like a god internationally around the world.   I would put Kobe and Wilt Chamberlin ahead of LeBron James as best players in NBA history.   6× NBA champion: 1991–93, 1996–98 5× NBA Most Valuable Player: 1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998[1][2] 6× NBA Finals MVP: 1991–93, 1996–98[3] NBA Defensive Player of the Year: 1987–88[4] 10× scoring champion: 1987–93, 1996–98[5] 3× steals leader: 1988, 1990, 1993 3× minutes leader: 1987–89 14× NBA All-Star: 1985–93, 1996–98, 2002–03[6] 3× NBA All-Star Game MVP: 1988, 1996, 1998[7] 2× IBM Award winner: 1985, 1989 11× All-NBA selection: 9× All-Defensive selection:"

"I love how you just shitted on your own team just to justify lebron beating them. MJ would have lost to that team. 3 all stars. Greatest shooting backcourt of all time. Curry is the best shooter of all time no question. Jordan would have sat there bewildered seeing Curry drop 7 3s like nothing.  Tell me did MJ drop 50pts on 4 all stars and 2 MVPs in a finals game?  Jordan never played against competition as good as Lebron.   MJ came into the league in 84. He got eliminated in 84,85,86,87,88, 89 and 90. The pistons and Celtics whupped his ass every time. LeBron took that sorry ass 2007 Cavs team to the finals at age 22.  Jordan scored 60+ in one game against the Celtics and still lost. It don’t matter how great you are... you ain’t gonna win by yourself. It is a team sport.   Let’s talk about the 6 finals MJ was in. He went against the Lakers the first time. That was Magic’s last season and he had AIDS. James worthy and Byron Scott were out of that series because they were hurt. So it was MJ against a sorry lakers team.   Next year he went against Portland. They didn’t have nobody except Clyde Drexler and Kevin Duckworth (who??) and Jerome kersey. Pathetic   Next year he went against the Suns. They had Charles Barkley and who else? Kevin Johnson and Dan Majerle? That ain’t no competition.   Then he leaves to play baseball and Scottie Pippen still manages 55 wins and goes to the playoffs and takes them to the Semifinals.  Then he came back and played the Seattle SuperSonics. Who did they play beat? Nobody.. went to the finals once and played Gary Payton. Pathetic   Then he played against a 34 and 35 year old John Stockton and Karl Malone? That’s who he went up against?? An old ass Utah team? Pathetic   It don’t matter if he went 6x to the finals. LeBron done it 9x already.  Then the same team that beat the lakers in 2004... LeBron beat that same team by himself! Nobody on his team.   It don’t matter if LeBron got swept by the spurs. If Jordan had managed to get to the finals in 89 he would have got his ass whupped by the showtime lakers. Facts.   Jordan was good but he used to kick it out to Paxon (money). Kick it out to Bj Armstrong (money) kick it out to Steve Kerr (money!!) Scottie Pippen best two way player during that era. "
Lebron James has only won championships when playing on teams with James Jones  Coincidence I think not.

"Dude is using ""mvp votes"" as a metric lol.  No offence but even if we were to take into account the actual amount of votes, mvp votes from other players should not be anything even remotely definative for determining whos a better player. Remember, a lot of those votes are more of a popularity contest and not even entirly about actual skill.  If it were the case of pure skill, curry sould be leading the mvp votes this season (along with james) and certain players (like lebron, curry, kd etc.) should be a canidate EVERY SINGLE YEAR. But they all are not, which goes to show mvp is heavily weighs either popularity or ""the new guy"", which is an AWEFUL metric for trying to determine skill.   "

Lebron 'Joffrey ~~Baratheon~~  Lannister-Lannister' James
I guess that depends on whether or not their best player is better at basketball than any of the Warriors players. Or LeBron James.
"MJ achieved everything that he did at a younger age, which in my opinion makes him better than  Lebron James."
"&gt;Take Lebron James’ postseason run last year.  &gt;Michael Jordan did that every postseason.  Wow, after that guy saying LeBron would win 0 titles on the Bulls, this might be the dumbest comment in this thread"
"Lebron james, Dwayne Wade and Chris bosh. The other 2 players don't even matter, that's how talented they are"
"Two different players, two different eras, two different positions, and totally different circumstances. They are both the greatest players   in the world during their career.  They are the GOATS. It's fine to enjoy both of them as is. This debate is silly and exhausting as it's impossible to come to a conclusion.   I'd be happy to start a team with either of them. However the only difference is LeBron has carried some crap teams to the finals a couple times and Jordans teams were typically the best in the league... I'm looking at you Larry Hughes, Damon Jones, Sasha Pavlovic AND Dellavedova, Mozgov, James Jones, Shumpert"
Homecourt Advantage  Bill Russell 22-1(10-0 Vs 50 win teams) Michael Jordan 24-0(14-0 Vs 50 Win teams) Magic 29-3(9-2 Vs 50 wins teams) Tim Duncan 26-6(16-5 vs 50 win Teams) Hakeem 9-2(4-0 Vs 50 Win teams) Larry Bird 24-7(10-6 Vs 50 win teams) Kobe Bryant 25-2(18-2 vs 50 win teams) Lebron James 16-3(3-3 Vs 50 win teams) Wilt 13-5(4-3 Vs 50 Win Teams) Kareem 34-5(11-3 vs 50 win teams)  This isn't my list but it is spot on.  I think this is better example by teams or i could be mistaken 
"I don't think any one will argue Mike IS a better scorer than Lebron, but are we gonna ignore that he had the luxury of also getting to play primarily isolation basketball. He could completely change the tempo of the game by slowing the shit out of it with post ups later in his career.   Because of illegal defense rules in the 90s help could only come from spots that jordan knew well. This meant that any double could be seen from a mile away. It was seriously child's play for someone of Jordan's skill level tbh.   It is very similar to how people complain the league hampers defenses with rules that make it just about impossible to defend James Harden today, the same could have been said for MJ.   Believe me, if you put Lebron in those days he would have been an absolute monster. There wasn't anyone big and quick enough for jordan, imagine making him about 20lbs heavier and 2 inches taller, and giving him better passing. Seriously he would have been unstoppable.   at the end of the day I agree jordan is better, but i just think there are caveats that make his accomplishments, which at first glance look ridiculous (and they are tbf), more real. You can see why it happened, you can see what he used as leverage and how he was able to maximize his impact.   For example he played at a time when the pace was slow enough that if you could get about 30 a night, and games would average scores of 70-80, i mean that is like half of your team's scoring (and this is not counting assists, hockey assists, etc). So you add in that he and pippen were two of the best wing defenders the league has seen, and it really is no wonder he had the success he did. Truly amazing.   Lebron decided early on to take a 'team' approach to the game, but ironically Jordan had a better team the majority of the time despite taking a more 'selfish' approach lol "
"when i say cockiness, i mean basically extreme overconfidence. it’s one thing to say “yea i can probably move that 50lb rock” it’s another to go “yea i’m so strong i could lift that mountain no problem” and actually mean it. if you can’t lift the 50 lb rock then you can train more, maybe you had an injury, whatever. saying you can lift a mountain (not 6, not 7..) not only makes you look like an idiot for thinking that, you look even stupider when you come up not even close (only 2 in Mia + biggest choke job ever).   Jordan has *earned* his cockiness in a way by proving the confidence he had in himself. LeBron didn’t *earn* anything at the time. he was given everything in a sense (being dubbed the Chosen One and King James before even entering the league) and he was trying to prove himself in the process and failed miserably, which is what a lot of people praise Jordan for never doing.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better. You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair? "
"thats simply not true. his 3PA foul rate is highest in the league (by an absurd amount, difference between him and #2 is the difference between #2 and #45 or so) and his 2PA foul rate is top 5 or so, higher than gobert, embiid, and lebron james."
"The Bulls had dominant regular seasons because they much better TEAMS than almost any LeBron has played on. I don't know if any of LeBron's Finals teams were better than ANY of Jordan's championship teams. Subtract Jordan from those teams and almost all of them still make the playoffs, that's not true of most of James' teams. It might only be true of those Miami teams. There's a reason why the Cavs got the #1 pick after LeBron left while Jordan's Bulls won 50+ when he was off playing baseball."
"Who the fuck cares about Michael jordan or LeBron James, why the fuck is no one talking about dj Wilson? Y'all out here talking about goats and and leaving out dj smh."
"Yawn... this again... The only players that have suffered from Lebron being around are bosh and love, who went from first to third options. Does Paul pierce make his teammates worse because KG’s stats cratered when he went to Boston?   What about players like Delonte west, boobie Gibson, Anderson varejao, mike Miller, Shane battier, big Z, mo Williams, jr Smith, Matthew dellavedova, timofey mozgov, Mario chalmers, James jones, JJ Hickson, Jamario moon, and others whose careers were either made or resurrected playing with Lebron?  Y’all have short memories."
"This is a poor argument.  The reason Jordan's Bulls were favored most times was because the Bulls had dominant regular seasons offensively and defensively.   Lebron James' lead teams for the most part did not have dominant regular season records as well as not great defense much to the fact that Lebron coasts in the regular season. Of course at rhe end of the regular season you will pick the team with better overall stats and record.  In contrast, all you have to do is look at how good Lebrons teams were projected to be prior to the start of any season. Upon Lebrons arrival in Miami and first 2 years in Cleveland, he had the only superteam in the league (outside of the 2012-2013 lakers) and you would have many more people projecting him to win titles based off of how much more talent he was playing with alone compared to other teams."
"LeBron has never had a hall of fame coach. Your hypothetical is based on something we have no history of. Lebron has a history of trying to force out head coaches when things aren’t going his way. There’s a background to what I’m saying. It’s like saying a serial killer could hypothetically not kill someone again, but their past history predicts it will probably happen again. Sure LeBron could not have issues with a HOF coach, but past history says their could be. It didn’t even take a month for Luke Walton to be put under pressure from James and the media.  My general point was hypotheticals like yours shouldn’t even be a talked about point when comparing careers. LeBron hasn’t had a HOF coach, end of story. Very few all time greats ever get the chance to play with a hall of fame coach.  That goes for MJ too. “What if he didn’t play baseball?”. Well he did and we can’t get those years back. "
Lmfao you think those uncle Joey looking white dudes would stop Lebron in the paint you’re crazy. They couldn’t guard 6’6 225 MJ but they can DEFINITELY guard the weak 6’8 260 lb freak Lebron James. 
"I might get downvoted but I just cant see LeBron fucking James sitting out a month for a strained groin. Especially cuz you know many Laker fans are gonna be like ""Kobe would never sit this many games with a groin injury""  I agree theres gotta be some ulterior motive or something else hes focused on rn"
LeBron James
"The way I see it is that every time LeBron has been on since ‘08 relies so heavily on his play that he is the foundation of the team. Everything is literally built around the concept of LeBron James, you take that away, and the house falls apart. That’s why some people see it as “LeBron ruins every team he’s in.”"
"Do you want to know why so many people hate LeBron James? It's because when he came into the league, this is exactly what happened, only much worse because the mainstream media was pushing it."
Isn’t he a generic Magic Johnson compared to LeBron James?  I mean that as a compliment. 
"Take Lebron James’ postseason run last year.  Michael Jordan did that every postseason.  Don’t believe me? Jordan averaged 33.4 for his career in the postseason and Finals numbers are CRAZY.  1991 Finals 31 ppg / 11 apg / 7 rbg That’s right, he can pass  1992 Finals 36 ppg / 7 apg / 5 rbg That’s right, he can score  1993 Finals 41 ppg / 6 apg / 9 rbg That’s right, he can REALLY score  1996 Finals 27 ppg / 4 apg / 5 rbg The Glove put in serious work here, made Jordan have a below MJ level series  1997 Finals 32 ppg / 6 apg / 7 rbg He’s back (33 years old by the way)  1998 Finals 34 ppg / 2 apg / 4 rbg He can really get it going  For me, I don’t even bother with the rings argument or the teammate argument. All I know, is that no matter who has been on his team, he has been killing teams.  Before he ever won a ring, let’s look at Jordan’s PPG in the playoffs:  29 ppg 44 ppg 36 ppg 35 ppg 37 ppg  Lebron’s only dominated like that in like 3 of his playoffs. Now you may argue Lebron impacts the game more than Jordan. How so?   Jordan is better defensively.   Lebron gets a couple more rebounds because of his position okay fine.   Assists? One guy was able to play within a system and the other guy drives and kicks to shooters, and he only averages 3 assists per game.  In terms of Finals stats, Lebron only cracked 30 in 2015, 2017, and 2018. Now THOSE were some Jordan-esque series. Overall though, Jordan’s just been way more consistent."
"Because this is a thread supporting Lebron James, and this guy is saying Lebron isn’t the best. Which Lebron is the best he’d average 50ppg in that clown 90s league against those plumbers. "
He shot 44% and Lebron is at 48% in elimination games per https://fadeawayworld.net/2018/04/30/comparing-lebron-james-and-kobe-bryants-stats-in-elimination-games/  Lebron is obviously better but don’t make stuff up
"Why are people obsessed with the shooting coach?  You think if Magic Johnson or Lebron James, two of the greatest of all time, thought it was a problem, they would hesitate to get one?"
I agree with mj being the goat but your arguments are invalid. Lebron's numbers in the Playoffs go up as well. He is a 27ppg scorer (30+ in the playoffs) while its Not even bis biggest strength. Yes MJ was the Better Defender but lbj in his Prime was also a beast and many think he should have ein dpoy over Marc. He is a better playmaker than jordan. When it comes to playoff difficulty he couldnt do anything before pippen came and then the timing was perfect with the Bird boston Team getting old. Though overall he faced harder Teams than james except for the finals how many were favourites to beat the bulls. Now the finals Opponents difference leads to the 6-0 &gt; 3-6 Argument lebron cant overcome. I dont get mad at people thinking lbj is the goat. He has a legitimate claim. Though de should all agree that both are Top 3. Some people dont have lbj in the Top 3 or have kobe above James and that i dont understand.  Wow this ended up being longer than i thought
Tough to be an OKC fan.  Even tougher to keep criticizing KD for leaving OKC when you see how they perform against this young team with no Lebron James.
"That Lebron James guy couldn't even score a single point, what a scrub... We should trade him asap for whatever we can get before it's too late., we are wasring Zubat prime years imo"
Who decided they are playing like a 45 win team ? They lost to Cleveland at home the other day who are you impressed by ? Also don’t know if you’ve heard but the Lakers have this guy Lebron James and are expected to be a little better than the Sacramento Kings so when the Kings are 2 games out of the playoffs for the first time in 14 years I think we can spare them a little praise 
"James Harden is # 1 right now. He's playing like the best player in the league.   Obviously LeBron KD and others are better players, but right now Harden is playing like the best"
Last year: Why would anyone want to play in Los Angeles with kids?  This year: Why would anyone want to play in Los Angeles with LeBron James?

Didn't know Raymone James' 1st name was LeBron. Wow

"Literally word for word. https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-calls-environment-playing-with-lebron-james-toxic-says-it-ventures-beyond-the-basketball-court/  So much hype comes from being around LeBron from other people,"" Durant said. ""He has so many fanboys in the media. Even the beat writers just fawn over him. I'm like, we're playing basketball here, and it's not even about basketball at certain points. So I get why anyone wouldn't want to be in that environment because it's toxic. Especially when the attention is bullshit attention, fluff. It's not LeBron's fault at all; it's just the fact you have so many groupies in the media that love to hang on every word. Just get out of the way and let us play basketball."""
"pretty much everyone that has a max contract is a bad contract when guys like Westbrook, Chris Paul and Gordon Hayward are being paid the same amount of money as Stephen Curry and LeBron James.. how are you supposed to compete when you're paying inferior players the same amount of money?"

BREAKING: Lakers acquire JR Smith  \*five minutes later\*  BREAKING: Sources say LeBron James is demanding a trade from the Lakers to literally anywhere else
"I'd rather have actual gameplay footage than the 100th top 10 list or MVP rankings or James Harden defense/complaint post, ""Westbrooks' TS is 47%"", Westbrook does things other than score, Lakers are x-x without LeBron, Kobe/Harden and Harden/Curry comparisons.  Did I miss anything?"
"Brandon ""LeBron James"" Ingram puts the team on his back."
LeBron James will not sign with the Memphis Grizzles 
"What about that guy.... uhhhh whats his name? Oh yea, Lebron James"
Lebron James
We've seen it happen multiple times with LeBron James
the rockets should trade for kuzma &amp; lebron tbh  im sure the lakers would accept gerald green and james ennis
"Ah yes, Lebron James my favorite nba team."
Lebron James. 
LeBron James
"Yeah if he came back. If he stayed on the lakers he wouldnt have been able to work Kenny Atkinson, and he wouldnt have had a fire lit under his ass to start improving, and he wouldnt have been what he is right now. As far as we know he wasnt a hard worker and he wasnt a good player on the lakers, so there wasnt any reason not to trade him. And may i add that that same trade gave us the cap room to add LeBron James, so i would still trade him 10/10 times"
LeBron James is one that comes to my mind 
"Kyrie ""LeBron ""get on my back"" James"" Irving "
"Honestly, this is like asking your team to acquire somebody like Lebron James because he’s pretty good. "

"I’ll give you Steph Kyrie and CP3 being as good as of better than Harden. But KD, Kemba and Dame lmao? They’re better ball handlers than Harden? Dame isn’t even the best ball handler on his own team lol. CJ’s handles are way better. D rose? Lebron? Are you serious lmao? That’s such a bad take.   The speed and precision of his dribbles is insane. There’s a reason he mesmerizes defenders and gets by them at will. He uses feints and fakes yes but without his dribble none of it is as effective lol. The reason you don’t see it as being special is that it isn’t particularly flashy. It’s all about invoking a reaction to exploit. And when he does decide to get flashy and put the dribble moves on he can get the ooos and ahs too.   But what are you basing any of this off of lol? His dribble is elite. If you don’t think so idk what to tell you lol. He’s one of the best ball handlers in the league hands down.   And yes any player technically could cross any player. But nobody does it with the frequency or brutality Harden does. He has highlights that never make it to r/NBA. If you don’t watch him you wouldn’t know.   &gt; Harden has fantastic feints but people that think he has 'great dribbles n' handles' are basically coming into the world of basketball with soccermom/ESPN commentary understanding of what a fucking dribble is. Everything Harden does that is  And this is also a terrible take. You just dismiss anyone who thinks his dribble is elite bc you simply disagree lmao? I play basketball. I’m a ball handler. I know what a fucking dribble is lol. It’s why I appreciate James and recognize that his dribble is elite.   **Just to prove my side with actual evidence or a take from a more reputable source than some random guy on Reddit:  http://www.nba.com/2015/news/hca/04/06/the-list-top-10-ballhanders/  Harden is listed as the** *#3 ball handler* **in the league and that list is from 2015.**"
"""Earning Lebron James' approval""  I guess anything Lebron does will get clicks. "
"Giving up on a player only means shit when you’re in a worse position after getting rid of them, like OKC after harden going from finalists to never reaching the finals again. That trade itself netted us Kuzma who’s arguably playing at the level of D’Lo in his sophomore year and it got rid of the worst contract in the league which helped us sign Lebron fucking James.   If getting rid of D’Lo means landing Lebron James then shit I hope we get rid of Ingram, Zo and Kuzma too maybe we’ll land 3 other hall of famers."
"LeBron, Patrick Beverly and James Harden."
"Lol if anyyyyy other team in the league got rid of him and in turn signed Lebron James you wouldn’t hear a peep, but because it’s lakers it’s “they give up on him”.  We landed Kuzma and the space to sign Lebron. We didn’t give up on shit."
"plus 18 ppg on 61% shooting lmao. if that plus insane defense and a career high 29 pts at the time, during a finals series against lebron james isn’t breaking out idk what is. "
"Luka ""Lebron Michael Jordan James"" Doncic"
You need to be more specific. Football is a scheme heavy sport when compared to basketball which is more free flow. There's only so many ways you can break down a step back 3 or Lebron James barreling to the rim to casual fans. Plus in basketball the game doesn't stop after every play giving the commentators more time to bring things down. I feel this just shows how bad other football commentators are.
"&gt;about the same as LeBron James  I love Harden. But I just don't believe this, whatever the numbers say."

In 2018 Lebron outplayed KD in Game 1.  In Game 2 Lebron scored 29 vs 26 for KD. But KD was much more efficient at 82.5% TS vs Lebron at 60% TS. KD also had 2 blocks and played elite defense.  In Game 3 KD dropped 43/13/7 on 82.4% TS. James was good with 33 but not as good as KD. KD also closed the door with the 33 foot pull up that ended the series.

"Consider Joakim Noah saying he was ""too lit"" for Next York city. If you saw that article. Comparing to everything about Jimmy not partying and instead mostly playing dominos.  So want extreme analogy would be comparing how LeBron James treats his body vs Lamar Odom."
"Yes, the perfect balance of athleticism and skill, right in the middle of their prime.  Michael Jordan was 27 when he won his first championship.  So was LeBron James.  When Kareem was 27 he broke his hand punching another player, but the next season was his statistical best."
Age 27 seasons for the following players:  Kobe Bryant 2005-2006  Stephen Curry 2015-2016  Dwyane Wade 2008-2009  Dirk Nowitzki 2005-2006  Lebron James 2011-2012  Michael Jordan 1990-1991  Magic Johnson 1986-1987  Kevin Garnett 2003-2004  Shaquille O'Neal 1999-2000
"When I read “aesthetic”, and you put Lebron James in there.  🤔 where is the aestetic? The grace? A la Jordan or Kobe’s footwork? That’s aesthetic.  Lebron walks like a duck, his toes pointing outwards, that’s not aesthetic at all.  😂😂😂"
His defense isn't nearly as bad as some say.  He is a better defender than Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook..... and about the same as LeBron James the last three seasons.  Earlier in his career he missed switches and had issues under the basket. Now his issues are usually a result of leading the league in minutes and having an ungodly offensive load.  I didn't like Harden for years but have just accepted that he is THAT good.

"Bro you have Michael Jordan, Lebron James and Kareem on the floor at the same time and you are worried if their offense will be okay??  These are the 3 greatest players ever... stop with this parroted talk of oooo not enough spacing... sounds ridiculous "
No wonder many people hate him. Lebron James didn't even say anything despite getting insulted by a women. And this moron is swearing at that guy just for the cheap hat?  Another reason to hate GayWarriors and kd.   I would do the same thing if I were that guy poor guy keeps saying I'm a huge fan 
"&gt;Again, maybe he could have worked it out   The fact that you think its more extremely unlikely than an actual probability is ridiculous. That is blasphemy. Not to Jordan...but to common sense. Tons of guys are adding it to their game year by year now. And you think that its only a minute possibility that Michael Jordan could do that. That's downright ridiculous. Come on man....I'm a skinny  6'8"" ex community college player. Nothing that special, but I've played. I would say I was a skilled shooter. It took a summer of hard work for me to add a great shot from distance. So not that long. Once you have touch, and a feel for a good shot....its not that hard. You are saying MICHAEL JORDAN can't add a three point shot? Lebron James did. Lebron is not the shooter that MJ was. And what's your obsession with the two motion shot? I don't disagree that's its harder to be accurate consistently from deep with it, but you admitted its not impossible yourself. And its Michael Jordan. Rivaled only by Kobe Bryant for his  meticulous attention to detail. One motion...two motion.....he would figure it out. I'm not that good. I figured it out. Go watch Jordan's 3 point barrage against the Blazers. He has a two motion shot...but he does not jump like he does on his jumpshots. He doesn't jump like Ray Allen does. (As far as your example of a successful two motion shooter.) He barely jumps on them. Its a pretty steady shot. He just hated shooting them.   And this ""one motion shot"" thing is a more modern idea. But plenty of guys were fantastic from deep with a two motion. So get off that. I'm not arguing that Jordan could be Steph from deep. I'm arguing he'd be good from deep. You're arguing he would be Derozan from 3. Whats really more likely?   Larry Bird? Chris Mullin? Drazen Petrovic? REGGIE MILLER? Two motion shots. "
"Doubt JR passes him, same with Lowry.  Harden should definitely pass him next year. LeBron MIGHT barely pass him at the tail end of his career. Klay will take a few years. Reddick like James MIGHT pass him.  KD will pass and so will Lillard."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"You might be right.  Year|MVP|PER Leader|PER 2019|N/A|Anthony Davis|30.8 2018|James Harden|James Harden|29.8 2017|Russell Westbrook|Russell Westbrook|30.6 2016|Steph Curry|Steph Curry|31.5 2015|Steph Curry|Anthony Davis|30.8 2014|Kevin Durant|Kevin Durant|29.8 2013|Lebron James|Lebron James|31.6 2012|Lebron James|Lebron James|30.7 2011|Derrick Rose|Lebron James|27.3 2010|Lebron James|Lebron James|31.1 2009|Lebron James|Lebron James|31.7  So correctly predicts 8/10 of the last MVPs. Notably doesn't predict 2015 (AD and Westbrook were ahead of Steph), and completely off 2011 (D Rose was only 9th in PER, Lebron had the highest but much lower than his usual standards). "

Because besides Lebron, Lebron's defender is the most valuable person.  &gt;Just because put a block or defended someone in a certain posession doesnt mean he is a great defender.  No, consistently defending whoever is causing your team trouble on defense makes Lebron a great defender. Having the ability to defend all positions makes him a great defender. Being the defensive coordinator and vocally calling out defensive coverages makes him a great defender.  Getting important blocks, steals, deflections, and turnovers makes him a great defender. Being 1st team All-Defense shows he was a great defender. Being 2nd in DPOY voting TWICE show he was a great defender.  &gt; Elite defender was Jordan, , no Lebron lol.  What does this have to do with Jordan? Yes Jordan was an elite defender so was Lebron. If one is an elite defender that doesn't mean the other is a bad defender. jesus you must be failing school.  "

"If 2016 Curry blows Harden out of the water, that means 2016 Curry also blows Jordan and Kobe's career years out of the water, and is easily the greatest basketball player of all time.

He was known for being the GOAT, a step above his peers and just a half step above LeBron James as the GOAT.  But you're literally claiming Curry is so damn good that we can't even have a discussion.

"I think the ""guarded LeBron James"" argument is a bit silly, but emerging as our top scorer that series was phenomenal."
"Ingram and Hart  You just won't find a better value per dollar player than Kuz right now and believe that Ball is a better fit than Ingram on this team with a healthy Lebron. I also think that Ingram's future is at the 3/4 and not the 2. That also happens to be where James, and Kuz start at, so he is kind of redundant on our team as it is currently constructed. Hart is a good player, and he fits the Lakers system well when his shot is falling. He is just an appetizer and not an entree though, so if you get substantial talent in return for him...you really can't say no. "
"Last 2 seasons? Why the fuck are you comparing his last two seasons to Curry's peak, and then claiming Lebron never had a season like Curry in 2015? Lebron has won 60 games multiple times with role players he has easily had significantly BETTER seasons than Curry in 2015.  Jason Terry was always the Mavs closer like Ginobli is for the Spurs. Why do people try to underrate these guys like they are bums? Anyways, Terry 'dicking down' Lebron doesn't prove Lebron is a bad defender. Terry himself said he couldn't even see over Lebron and was just chucking them and they all went in for him. Good for him. But don't like he doesn't always do that he closed out all those Western Conference teams too.  &gt;Chase-down blocks are spectacular but Lebron's defensive capabilities have been overrated ... a lot.  If anything, his defensive capablities are being underrated because of his recent slide with age. Lebron has shut down premier players in the playoffs of all positions numerous times. In 2011 the MVP Derrick Rose shot 6.3% while being guarded by Lebron. In the 2013 Finals Lebron was put on Tony Parker to shut him down when he was blowing by the Heat guards, and then when Duncan got going, it was Lebron coming up with clutch blocks on Duncan.   Just this season Lebron has guarded centers like Jokic and Aldridge and held them scoreless in 4th quarters. In the Denver game this year Jokic was killing the Lakers for most of the game. So Luke put Lebron on Jokic and the Joker never even got a shot off with James guarding him for 9 straight possessions in the 4th quarter. Here is the matchup data from nba stats: https://stats.nba.com/game/0021800066/matchups/?OFF_PLAYER_ID=203999&amp;DEF_PLAYER_ID=2544  The same happened in the two Spurs games with Lebron guarding Aldridge late in the 4th. Aldridge could not get the ball with James guarding him in the 1st Lakers vs Spurs game, and in the 2nd game, Aldridge again failed to score on James in 7 consecutive possessions with James guarding him in the 4th, and he missed the only turnaround shot he got off against James after comically failing to post James up and move him. Here is the matchup data from nba stats: https://stats.nba.com/game/0021800082/matchups/?OFF_PLAYER_ID=200746&amp;DEF_PLAYER_ID=2544  Lebron was an elite defender at his peak. Just because someone scored on him in a big moment doesn't prove otherwise. It is fucking disgusting you would compare Curry's defense to Lebron the former literally gets benched for clutch defensive possessions."

"His body language is way better now. This is actually a newer thing, he's finally taken that last step in maturation and leadership.  Whether that translates into the playoffs or not I don't know.

The teamless James Harden defeats the Lebron-less Lakers
Lebron throws his left hand out every time there's contact.   And let me get this straight...if James Harden is leading in attempts its cause he flops (he does) and cause the refs cheat...but Lebron should be first every year?? Ok

You're stupid to think that the most athletic forward in the draft since Lebron James was gonna go anywhere but first. This isn't Kwame Brown or Michael Olowokandi.
"Lol. I'm saying he's a great scorer. But what puts him over the top is the fouls. The way he drives and jumps into the defender, the way he jumps into the player on a step back 3 so the defender can't come that close, etc. The gameplan for James harden is to not play physical because he will be clever and create fouls. I think a good example is lebron guarding him with hands behind his back. To say Harden doesn't abuse the referees is simply delusional. "

"Let’s be frank about it  They came into the season a team built around LeBron, who does not play for the team.  Their next best player has basically missed the whole year.  They changed coaches.  If you removed the two best players from a team that wasn’t elite anyway, you’d probably have a terrible team in most situations - especially when one of those players is LeBron James"

You were better off posting in r/nbadiscussion then. This honestly isnt worth too much detail.   2009 Lebron James was the best player in the NBA essentially. Giannis is not the best player in the NBA right now. That right there is pretty much all you need to know about how they compare. The game is so different today
This is like saying Lamar Odom was LeBron James before LeBron James. 
KD is such a deadly player that he is a better pick to start your team than LeBron James. You don't need your star to play like a point guard. LeBron just likes to.
"Speaking of LeBron, [he’s another player whose deep threes are crazy efficient](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-james-is-the-new-steph-curry/), although he doesn’t shoot them with as much frequency as Steph did in ‘15-‘16."
"James harden had Chris paul, who’s capable of 20pts/10ast, Eric Gordon, who’s capable of 20pts, Clint capela, who’s capable of 20pts/12reb, and a top 10 defense.  Not to mention, Lebron averaged 33/12/10 on 56% FG%. He clearly did more than enough  Harden averaged 26/5/6 on 40%FG%. James played way better than harden did, so it would be weird to criticize James for the outcome when he did way more than any player on the rockets. Outside of him and kyrie, the Cavs lineup was quiet. Both Paul and Gordon averaged 20ppg in the series, the Cavs defense was terrible compared to the rockets, etc."
"How can you be ranking NBA players, type ""13. LeBron James"" and not pause and think ""hmm, something is off here""?

How is LeBron possibly missing the playoffs or possibly losing in the first round a factor in being ranked 13th? How is Kawhi possibly going to LA a factor?   And how is he ranking players 100+, what did Luol Deng do in the last 10 days to make him move up 39 spots? What makes Kalin Lucas worse than Jaylen Adams? Makes zero sense. "

"I mean whos fault is it  that they didn't improve in the offseason as soon as Lebron signed and instead picked up underwhelming vets like Beasley and Lance?? Their young core was obviously overrated (5-10 without Lebron James) I mean the way they've been playing, they wouldn't even make a playoff spot in the East"
"That's a bad argument dude.  Kevin Durant is considered by most people to be the 2nd greatest player in the NBA generally speaking, and he's most definitely on almost everyone's top 5. He's also primarily a scorer, which is exactly the system that Kerr operates, and Kerr's worked with the guy for more than 2 whole years now.   When Curry is out, Kevin Durant just has to settle for... the 2nd best 3 point specialist in the league, Klay Thompson, who is also a really good defensive player. And to round that out, they also have an all-star and fantastic 6th man in Andre Iguodala.   And the rest of the roster has pretty much been handpicked by Warriors and Kerr. It's not like Curry having to deal with injuries is a shock to anyone - the dude has had to deal with injuries a lot throughout his career. So we have to assume that if Kerr is a good coach, he has contingencies for that within the rest of his squad.  Despite all this, Kerr was only able to round up a 19-14 record over the past 2 years in games that Curry has been out and KD has been in. Nothing to scoff at for sure, but not great. Compare that to KD in 2017 being out for a stretch of 18 games where Curry played, and the Warriors garnering a 15-3 record over that stretch. It's a major difference.   ----  My conclusions from this:  1. Draymond was totally right. The Warriors don't need Durant to win. He helps a lot for sure, but it's not needed at all. The Warriors system relies a lot on Steph and KD really just provides a peripheral (but seriously intense) offensive threat to that system.  2. Kerr is a good coach in that he designed an offensive system around Steph that is so intense that it led to 3 championships. He's also had some playoffs luck for sure, but everyone has playoff luck when they are talented. I would never call someone a bad coach when they manage to attain that level of success, especially in the face of Lebron James. You need a good coach to beat Lebron.   3. Kerr has been given a massive set of tools to use throughout the past 3 years but has not been able to capitalize nearly as well with the rest of his players as he has with Steph Curry. Yes, he manages to corral egos and get these stars to work together, but part of that comes from the players as well. Steph appears to be a humble guy, and Klay appears to be a major team player. But I would expect a great coach, let alone ""the best coach in the NBA right now,"" to be able to show dominance or at the very least unexpected excellence with whatever squad they were handed. I would argue that label falls more with someone like Doc Rivers and the Clippers, Malone with the Nuggets, and Bud with the Bucks. But definitely not Kerr."
Multiple sources confirming a mega trade between Minnesota offering Giogui dieng for lebron James . Magic is ready to wave that wand 
"It's almost impossible to gain 7 lbs of water weight during the course of an NBA game. This claim has been refuted by multiple [sports nutritionists](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/3/19/17140056/lebron-james-seven-pounds-game-sports-nutritionists-playoffs-espn) and [hydration experts.](https://deadspin.com/we-asked-a-sports-science-expert-if-lebron-could-have-r-1823899338)   &gt;It’s borderline impossible to gain that much mass in a basketball match. Even if it’s 2 hours start to finish (if you include warmups and half time and so forth), he’s had a net gain of 3.5 lbs per hour, despite playing say 40 minutes of high intensity basketball. In those 40 minutes, I would expect that he could lose 2kg.  &gt;There’s a study, but the way, on elite young basketball players showing that their sweat rate was 2.7 L/hour, which would give you 1.8 L in 40 minutes of play (by the way, in this study, it was hot - 30 degrees celsius, which I think is a lot warmer than in an air-conditioned arena). So I think 1.8 to 2 L of sweat loss is a pretty aggressive estimate. Maybe it’s more likely 1.5 L of total sweat loss  &gt;Anyway, it would mean that he’s had to drink (or eat, maybe he had a big halftime meal, haha) about 8 to 9 lbs worth of fluid or food to end up 7 lbs heavier after the match.  Perhaps this was caused by a severe over-consumption of fluid?   &gt;Is that what happened to LeBron? I doubt it. For a few reasons. One is that he probably didn’t do anything different compared to normal. Had he changed his usual routine he would’ve been able to explain it, not describe it as “weird”. Whereas if he was in the regular habit of drinking too much fluid, then he would have seen it often and it also wouldn’t have been weird.  So is Brian Windhorst lying? That would discredit his other reports (that you've presented) about LeBron's suspicious activities."
"&gt; Curry was nowhere near as good as LeBron as purely a player in 2015 or 16.  Lebron has never had a better regular season than 2016 Curry. The guy shot 67% TS as a guard and he was THE REASON they went 73-9.  &gt; KD was worse in 2014 than he is now, and he is still nowhere close to LeBron  Lebron isnt a better player than KD right now.  &gt; James Harden wasn't anywhere close to as good as LeBron last year.  Get out of here, lol.  I get that you are a fanboy/fangirl, but it is completely ridiculous to pretend that Lebron has had the best individual season every single year."
"If I was just about a foot taller, a hundred pounds heavier, and if I had a lot more basketball skill I'd basically be LeBron James "
That’s a fair point but if the lakers don’t get anyone they will either have to trade for AD or wait another full season to sign and by that time lebron would be 36.... like or not everything rides on this off-season for a LeBron James led championship as a laker

"I don't know enough about Ben Simmons' dunk ability to comment about him in particular but historically there's been certain guys who bring the noise in games but lack the necessities to be a great contest dunker.   Kenyon Martin, for instance, was an incredible in-game dunker but I'd wonder if he'd have the creativity and versatility necessary to be a stellar contest dunker.   Others, meanwhile, have long maintained that a guy like LeBron James may not have fared too well in a dunk contest due to his relatively lack of versatility and tendency to rely upon one-footed takeoffs. I personally think he could have done some nice distance-related dunks around 2005 or so, but his McDonald's High School All-American dunk contest wasn't too encouraging (I have memories of normal-ish dunks but just done by jumping really high).   Dunk contests require something different from players in terms of dunk ability, versatility, style, and showmanship. Not all dunkers thrive with that combination. "

It’s worse... Lebron James has more impact collectively then all of those players and that’s not to mention the Lakers have been decimated by injuries at other positions 
"1. Chauncey Billups is (one of) the best on court leader of his era. He predicted exactly what the Lakers would do in their NBA Finals matchup.   2. Wizards (with Wall) will be much improved next year. John Wall gets most of the blame for the bad start this season, but Markieff Morris doesn't get enough. He's not considered part of their ""big 3"", but the team made a conscience effort to get him minutes, even after he was moved from the starting unit. The 4s on the team are better at the job, and he's not a 5, which is where Brooks had to play him. Though many are quick to say Washington is playing better without Wall, they aren't exactly missing Morris either. I think they reload with a better set rotation.    3. Anthony Davis should choose Miami, if offered, over LA or Boston. I get that it's enticing to play with LeBron James or Kyrie Irving in the two of most decorated NBA franchises, but I think the Erik Spoelstra/Pat Riley combination is too good to pass up (again, if offered). They have a track record of finding talent and building winning teams. If not, Anthony Davis, then some star or budding star needs to join that organization.  "

You can follow the others all you want but James is living in your head.   Lebron flops and baits all the time. In fact he does the exact thing you posted on Harden. The shoulder extension? That’s Lebron’s go to on a drive lmao. So why did you single out Harden and insinuate that was shady/cheating/etc when a player you follow does it as a go to move?  Imagine if Curry was drafted by the Hawks instead of GS. Would he still be as great a player as he is if he didn’t have a team built around him through good drafting? Hell no lol. He’d be a Devin Booker type. We’d know he’s good but he’d constantly lose. Curry wouldn’t even have his last two titles without KD and wouldn’t have the first one without injury luck.   Giannis: So I was curious about this, saw your post on Harden creating space with his forearm and watched his recent highlights against the Hornets here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHtyNB6RRn8  At 0:22 he illegally hooks with his off arm on a layup  At 0:29 he blatantly pushes off to create space for the oop  At 1:50 extends his forearm to create space (not enough contact to be a foul)  At 2:05 literally sits on top of a player's head   Every great player you follow can also be smeared like Harden if we all tried as hard as you do. The difference is that rest of us normal folks don’t have the level of hatred you have in your heart for these players to scour and cherrypick plays the way you do. "

"Wait, not even trying to be a dick, but how does LeBron James = less basketball?"
"&gt;The NBA needs a hard salary cap. I don't really care if players like LeBron get underpaid based on market value, but talk to anyone that doesn't like the NBA and the #1 reason is because of there is no parity in this league. Realistically there are only ever 2-4 title contenders each year. Also, the Lakers being able to get away with paying 4 future HOFers and a solid starter is disgraceful.  Well well well.....  &gt;OKC traded away their best player. In a few years time it won't be Westbrook vs Harden debate, it would be a Harden vs Durant debate.  Interesting.  &gt;Kevin Durant's efficiency would be *much* worse without Westbrook. Westbrook basically makes KD as good as he is.  KD won MVP the next year...  &gt;James Harden is very overrated and is a glorified jump shooter. Yes he does draw lots of fouls, but he goes into the lane looking for a foul rather than trying to score a basket. This has always been something frustrating for me, players looking to get fouls rather than score, thats not basketball!  Some things never change  &gt;KD will never win a championship with Westbrook as his PG.  Indeed  &amp;#x200B;"
"That 8th seed was led by James Harden and were far better than their RS record by that point seeing as they were a 54 win team and immediate contender the following year.     Also LOL @ blaming Durant for that team crashing and burning. He averaged 31.8/9.9/6.2 57.8 TS%. And those numbers actually underrate his play because it includes his last game where he was literally broken down from averaging 45.1 MPG over 10 straight games with multiple games over 48 minutes. He was averaging 33.1/10.1/6.3 60.4 TS% in the 9 games prior to that. When LeBron puts up those numbers in the playoffs, people talk about how he's having a GOAT playoff run. With KD it was well why can't his team win? He shouldn't need more help,  he should be able to carry his team no matter what.    Meanwhile this was the garbage he was dealing with    Post Westbrook injury in a total of 8 playoff games, OKC was -79 in 145 minutes with Perkins on the floor and +59 in 239 minutes without him. His 3 game stretch vs Houston was thing of legends. How TF does a starting center have more personal fouls and turnovers than points, rebounds, assists, and blocks combined? OKC -17  in 9 minutes with Perkins and +15 in 39 minutes without Perkins in G4. OKC was -13 in 15 minutes with Perkins and +6 in 33 minutes without Perkins in G5. OKC was -9 in 4 minutes with Perkins and +18 in 44 minutes without Perkins in G6. In G4 &amp; G6, he managed 0 points, 1 rebound, 0 assists, 0 blocks, 0 steals, 6 turnovers, and 5 fouls in 13 minutes??? The mother fucker only had 1 rebound and attempted only 1 shot, how did he even have the ball enough to commit 6 turnovers in that timeframe? It's not like OKC was running it's offense through him in the low post or having him run sets at the top of the key    |Rk|Date||Opp||MP|FG|FGA|FG%|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PF|PTS|GmSc|+/-| |-:|:-|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |4|2013-04-29||HOU|L (-2)|9:10|0|1|.000|1|1|0|0|0|4|4|0|-6.0|-17| |5|2013-05-01||HOU|L (-7)|15:38|1|3|.333|4|5|1|1|0|0|3|2|2.7|-13| |6|2013-05-03||HOU|W (+9)|4:22|0|0||0|0|0|0|0|2|1|0|-2.4|-9|    For an encore, he followed that up with what was LITERALLY the worst series for a starting player in NBA history vs Memphis   Averaging 23.3 MPG, Kendrick Perkins managed -A statline of of 2.4/4.2/0.8 with 2.0 TOV and .6 BLK on 23.3 TS% -Almost as many turnovers(10) as total points(12) -Almost as many Fouls(18) as Total Rebounds(21) -More Bad Pass turnovers(7) than Assists(4) -His Shot was Blocked(11) almost 4 times as much as he blocked another shot(3) -He shot 16.7%(4-24) from the field including 2-11(18.2%) on layups and tip-ins -His Offensive Rating(55) is the lowest ever in a series for a player averaging &gt;20 minutes -His Net Rating was was -49 -His Game Score for the series was NEGATIVE(-0.6) -His TOV%(28.0) was 5 times higher than his AST%(5.3) -He allowed Gasol &amp; Randolph to combine for 37.8/19.2/4.6 with only 15 total turnovers in 5 games -Memphis SG Tony Allen had a TRB% equal to Perkins for the series(10.3%)  Perkins TOV%(28.6%) would have been the the highest I've ever seen for a 5 game series, but then I noticed his Thunder teammate Nick Collison actually blew that number out of the water with his own 34.8%. Collison managed 10 turnovers in 88 total minutes. He actually did accumulate more fouls(26) than total rebounds(20) or total points(18).  Perkins also became the 1st player in NBA history to post a negative PER for the playoffs(-6.7). That means OKC would have actually been better off playing 4 on 5 than with Perkins. And amazingly he wasn't even OKC's worst C in some of those games. i.e. Nick Collison G2 2013 WCSF  0/0/1/0/0 0 FGA 4 TOV 6 PF 15:22 MP  A center managed to gather 0 rebounds in 15 minutes. Additionally, he fouled in that short span of time. Oh and he somehow managed to have 4 TOVs despite attempting 0 shots, gathering 0 rebounds, and only creating 1 assist. How did he even touch the ball enough to turn it over 4 times? He obviously wasn't rebounding it or shooting, so what happened? Collison can't dribble so he obviously wasn't running sets in some pseudo point forward role. And he wasn't an offensive threat, so OKC wouldn't try to go inside to him. So how the fuck did he manage to have 3 more TOVs than FGA, points, blocks, steals, assists, and rebounds combined? But hey, good job getting that 1 assist in exchange for 4 TOVs Nick  And for good measure, OKC's other 2 bigs were Thabeet and Perkins. Hasheem Thabeet filled in for Collison after he fouled out and managed a 0/3/0/0/0 2 PF statline in 12:45. OKC starting C Kendrick Perkins had 4/6/0/0/1 3 TOV 4 PF on 1-4 FG in 24:13  Summary: OKC's rotation of C's combined for 4 points, 9 rebs, 1 assist, 7 TOVs, and 12 PF's on 1-5 shooting in 52 minutes and 25 seconds. This was in G2 of a playoff game where OKC lost 99-93. "
He is LeBron fucking James 
"Oh yeah, the NBA and its refs totally decided one day that James Harden should be the face of the league, and that it wouldn't be better for them to help LeBron, and that they instead needed to take him down.  Uh huh..."
"Maybe the NBA just decided they wanted to make a star out of this random dude in Houston with a beard?  I mean, clearly the NBA loves James Harden and just hates Steph Curry and LeBron James, right? "
"Okay... and if he or Curry or Trae Young wanna do that I don't give a damn because they accomplish nothing with it because they're weaker and smaller. If a much bigger, much stronger, much more massive player does it - that means it will have much more severe consequences.  If a 190lbs Kyrie dips his shoulder at you you can shove him into the ground. If a 270lbs LeBron fucking James dips his shoulder into you, he's likely to flip you over - or fly into the 3rd row"

Obviously the answer is ""No"", but the statement ""Sources say X has discussed a deal involving Lebron James with GM Magic Johnson"" and they *technically* wouldnt be wrong. "
Is that supposed to make me think LeBron James will do and think like Lance Armstrong?

"The NBPA agreed to HGH testing in the CBA negotiations in 2011  https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wizards-insider/post/nba-players-agree-to-hgh-testing/2011/12/07/gIQALvBZdO_blog.html?utm_term=.926b1c24e4aa  This was not a new development.   A couple of players in the league doing off-season diets is nothing uncommon. It probably happens dozens of times every off-season. It just happened to be two of the biggest stars. LeBron was inspired by his teammate Ray Allen who has done ketogenic diets regularly.   http://kediet.com/blog/lebron-james-discusses-ketogenic-paleo-weight-loss-no-carbs-sugar-for-67-days/   The NBA started HGH testing beginning of the 2015-16 season, more than a year after LeBrons 67 day diet.  http://www.nba.com/2015/news/04/16/nba-players-to-be-tested-for-hgh-starting-next-season.ap/  Looking at pictures it's **evident** that LeBron gained a large majority of the weight back he lost the previous year. So much for ""hurrdurr he doesn't pump HGH into his body anymore""    He was reportedly in the worst shape of his career in the 2014 season.  https://www.businessinsider.com/skinny-lebron-james-2014-8?IR=T  &gt;Windhorst says LeBron is losing weight for two reasons: 1) he entered last season in the ""the worst shape he's been in in a while,"" and 2) he has become a bit self-conscious about his weight in recent years.   https://grantland.com/the-triangle/b-s-report-brian-windhorst-plus-a-transcript-of-brian-and-bill-on-a-possible-midseason-nba-tournament/   A diet change is literally the most logical step after that.   I know you really want to believe there is a correlation between weight loss and PED use but the simpler explanation makes infinitely more sense to anyone unbiased.    "
"This all took place at the beginning of the season following a summer where [LeBron] (https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2014823/rs_600x600-140923095628-600-lebron-james-skinny.ls.92214.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&amp;output-quality=90) and [Melo] (https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--f86fJ-m1--/c_fit,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_320/i1f9lt9kzvt0vl6duep4.png) suddenly lost significant weight.

[LeBron was noticeably less explosive at the beginning of that season.](https://youtu.be/R3yVpxr038M) He regained his form shortly after his mid-season hiatus.   But of course, these must all be coincidences. "
"Since the day I was born, my mama has always told me that I’m “too white” to do the things that I love to do. If I had a nickel for every time she said “you’re just a lil’ white boy,” I’d be sittin’ pretty. I wouldn’t have all this student debt, either. That’s for sure.   Here’s the thing— she ain’t wrong, though. I’m what you call a “reverse Oreo.” On the inside, I’m an Atlanta-based trap lord who balls bigger than LaVar in his dreams. But, on the outside, I’m whiter than a fresh jar of marshmallow fluff. I know, it's tacky. But, I am what I am. I love to rap. . . which is not a particularly “white” activity. I love to play basketball, which is also not really known as a “Caucasian pass-time,” if you will. I even have dudes on my Y-League team that say I “talk gangster.” No one ever wants to be that guy. Alas, here I stand. Based on what I’ve said, one could understand why I have a certain appreciation for guys like Larry Bird or Steve Nash. Those were two dudes that, despite all odds, made it to the NBA looking like milk-truck drivers. Overall, LeBron James is my favorite player. But, it's always a little exciting when you see a white dude block him twice on the same play. That white dude is a man by the name of Luka Doncic. For us white kids, the athleticism of a LeBron James or a Russell Westbrook just isn’t really in the cards. I mean, we have Mac McLung at Georgetown puttin’ on for the honkeys. . . but other than that, there just isn’t that much God-given bounce to go around. I mean, the movie White Guys Can’t Jump didn’t just come out of nowhere. Stereotypes exist for a reason. However, Luka Doncic is quite athletic. He was doubted during the pre-draft process because scouts didn’t think he could adjust to the speed of the NBA after coming over from Europe. Yeah, I think he’s doing just fine. He hasn’t seemed to miss a step after being the MVP of the Euro League. He might not blaze past people like a Kemba Walker or Kyrie Irving, but he holds his own and makes it look easy around the basket as well. Speaking of finishes— for us white kids, the Euro-step was a staple if slashing was your game. It was a glorious move that created new space and angles for guys like Manu Ginobili. It was a cornerstone of white boy ballin’ until James Harden went and appropriated it. But, Luka Doncic did it right back. He went and appropriated that step-back jumper The Beard loves so much. Have you ever seen Doncic hit a step back that’s smoother than Harden’s? Because I have. I see it in every highlight reel that Luca has. And, he doesn’t sport a wack-ass beard while doing it. Double win. Now, this last one is something all basketball fans can relate to, especially if you play a lot of pick-up. You ever see a white guy make some nice moves on the court but he still looks really white while doing it? Like SO WHITE it kinda makes you a little itchy? Cough cough Joe Ingles cough cough. You know what I’m talking about, right? Anyway, Luka does all of these moves and looks smoother than butter dipped in olive oil. His game has so much finesse that he attended the same academy that Gunna rapped about on the hook of “YOSEMITE.” He’s out here making dudes look foolish, like they can’t believe they’re getting crossed up by a saltine in Nikes. Not only is Luka Doncic a baller and should be around for the next 12-15 years in the NBA, he puts a smile on my face. He is the next Great White Hope. He gives all of us charge-takers a glimmer of pride as we watch from our couches and talk about our JV glory days. He's our hero. "

i’ll take the team with the 2 lockdown guards and 1 lebron james 
"No it isn't. Did you even read the article because it clearly states how you're mistaken.   2010: Heat pitch LeBron. He wants to know if Riley will coach, Riley says no.   2011: Heatles lose to Dallas, LeBron bumps Spo. Reports come out about friction between Spo and the team/LeBron.   2011: after losing to Dallas Riley holds a meeting with the big 3 and they tell him they aren't happy with the team and LeBron once again asks Riley to coach   2016: Riley denies stuff  2018: A book published *in 2018* with quote from Riley *in 2018* about the events *in 2010 and 2011* that Riley talks about *in 2018*.   No, every single player/coach interaction does not mean a player asked a coach to be fired.   Not every player is LeBron James and not every situation is the same.   Wade wasn't happy with Spo either. LeBron is bigger news so his name gets attached to it but the big 3 weren't happy...as stated by Riley.  Ty Lue only got the job because of LeBron after he got Blatt fired. Ty Lue is LeBron's friend and was just there to call LeBron out on his bs.   10 times out of 10 GSW pick Kerr over Draymond and Draymond yells at everyone on the team.   Just because other players might not have done it doesn't mean anything...that's a pointless argument.   What other player has the power that LeBron has had. He is by far the best player in the League that can completely alter a franchise. He has the ability to demand things and he has done exactly that.   You can choose not to believe whatever you want but there is plenty of evidence to back it up. "
"That’s what I mean tho. Nothing indicated that Kyrie is the second fiddle on the floor, but if you are the teammate of LeBron fucking James, you are always going to play the second fiddle at best and the media will make sure to let you know of that twice a day, as well. And that’s why Kyrie left. "
Agreed. When you’re playing with LeBron James it will always be “his team”
"this season : Suns will sneak to PO. hey its Book, late season Josh Jackson, my 2nd choice in the draft Mikal Bridges, ultimate role player Ariza, and Haitian Kanter. its good in the paper tho. but suns still be suns. why?

LeBron James and kyrie Irving
"Dudes who get invites for the most part are young and upcoming up players who insane verticals who have a reputation from highschool and college for their dunks. They send them out to superstars who have the ability to put on spectacular dunks so simply being a superstar is not enough. I'm certain Kawhi or Durant were never on the radar but guys like Westbrook absolutely. LeBron James used to campaign essentially every year back in the day to drum up interest for his participation but would always not attend. The NBA would loved for him to do it and let's be honest, he would have won anyway because the voting system is subjective and story-driven when the need arises. LeBron didn't even need that conspiracy theory shit to win considering he'd put on crazy dunks during the allstar game itself that were in some respects superior to the best dunks from that same year in the contest.   "
"Rich guy from Harvard Business School buys a sports franchise for millions of dollars.  Talk about a fucking inspirational story, this is the best one right here, guys.  Rocky, Rudy, LeBron James - all bums compared to Mr Joe Lacob buying the Warriors.  I’m getting all emotional over here ..."
"lonzo has been developing foh. and BI doubled his stats from rookie to soph year.  adding the greatest player in the world LEBRON JAMES changes how you adjust your playstyle, and BI was aided by brook's gravity last season. be patient!"
"lol that's the thing Riley is responding too. This thing happened in 2010 after their 9-8 start:  &gt;Riley revealed in the book that the day after the Heat’s loss to Dallas, he asked James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to meet him in his office for 10 minutes to check on how the team leaders felt the young season was progressing.  &gt;“They just said, ‘We’re not feeling it,’ or something like that,” Riley told Thomsen. “We talked about the typical things that we have to do, have patience and all of that stuff.  &gt;“And I remember LeBron looking at me, and he said, ‘Don’t you ever get the itch?’ I said, ‘The itch for what?’ He said, ‘The itch to coach again?’ I said, ‘No, I don’t have the itch.’ He didn’t ask any more questions, and I didn’t offer any more answers. But I know what it meant, and I always go back and wonder about what he was thinking at that time. He walked out scratching his leg like it was itching.”  Riley's quote denying Lebron was trying to fire Spo is from 2016."
"Everyone deserves the same calls IMO. I don't like ""superstar calls"" at all. If James Harden gets some type of call then not only should LeBron and Steph Curry get that call but so should Troy Daniels and Cam Payne. The game should be reffed consistently."
"That 2013 team was unbelievable. We were a bad matchup against the LeBron James Heat. We defeated them 3-1 in the regular season and I truly believe that if we managed to defeat the Pacers, we couldve been champs. Jason Kidd and Tyson Chandler providing leadership. Melo scoring buckets. I miss that team. "
"I was replying casually. What's your problem with that ?   The thing is, you are all giving way to much credit to players who do not deserve it, this whole sub  ""Booker is phenomenal"" - ne he aint. If he didnt score that ridiculous 70pt game where even Boston players cheered for him to do it, he would have at least half the hype around his name, and even with that, the due isnt playing D, cant or wont play it and he is not a player that this sub holds him for, or at least the prospect you lot makes him out to be   ""Harden best"" - have we seen a payoff success from James Harden ? You can ISO your way to MVP and that deserves much respect Iverson did exactly that years ago, but that will never lead to a title. The guy IS ruining basketball with his foul and foul-draw gimmicks, he will never be able to lead a team to a championship. It's one thing to be a leader of a team (LeBron, Curry) and another thing to be leading player in a team (Harden) - and you people make him out to be compared with greats and even to mention his name with 4-5-6 rings winners.   Cousins is also a cry-baby self-centered douche that if gets a ring, it will only be due to this transfer to GSW. Dude still doesnt have a positive season record in his NBA career. If someone cant lead his team to wins, no matter the stats - he aint great. He good at best, and you people are constantly mistaking that two.   Players who post individual stats get way to much praise on this sub. And people tend to mistakenly compare them with great basketball players who are able to post similar numbers, but also contribute to their team winnings.   That's why I even posted this in the first place - all the praise going into wrong places. No one writes how shitty rest of the rockets players must feel with one guy hogging the ball that much (20 3pt attempts and 20 ft attempts in one game ? ) and no one is making any kind of critique to such type of play, not realizing that GSW aint a bunch of ""all stars"" in one team, but a bunch of team players - who post all star stats. They built that for themselves, they didnt take other's credit for it, and that is what makes them so good. Yeah, people will mention Harden's streaks, Russ tripple-doubles, those are truly phenomenal feats, but there is not enough credit given for team play, which GSW are masters of. "

"Kobe Bryant is a better basketball player than Lebron James. Lebron is a better athlete, and he’s so much a better athlete that it may make him a better overall player.   Jordan was so much a better player that it transcends Lebron’s athleticism.   I know that’s complicated, but it’s how I’ve always felt.  Also, it’s disrespectful to put Kobe in the top 10. He’s a top 5 all-time player. He was absolutely unreal to watch in his prime. For you newbies, imagine his final game where he scored 60, subtract the slowness and the unnecessary shot taking and you get Kobe Bryant’s prime almost game in and game out.   Yes, I know he shot a lot in general, but it was nearly always in the flow of the game. At least until the last year or two of his career. "
LeBron James   James Harden  
Just the Cousins injury was bad luck?   Jrue Holiday’s wife having a brain tumor is pretty fucking bad luck. So is Eric Gordon’s inability to stay healthy before he goes to Houston and is instantly the 6moy. Plus Davis himself has missed crucial points of basically every season (including this one) due to injury. They were just decimated in 2016. All their key guys got hurt.  Also Ryan Anderson’s girlfriend killed herself the same year he had a bad neck injury.  They never had a chance to properly test out a Jrue-Tyreke-Gordon-Ryno-AD lineup. Mostly due to injuries but AD exacerbated things by demanding a big center to play next to him. They certainly fucked up huge giving Asik such a long deal about a year before that type of center became basically eradicated from the league.  Etwaun Moore’s contract didn’t kill them. Hill’s contract is terrible but it wasn’t worse than Luol Deng’s. Looking back that money would’ve been much better spent retaining Gordon. Maybe that would’ve made the difference.  Fact of the matter is that this is probably all moot because there’s only one team that gets to have LeBron James. So their biggest mistake was the same one that half the NBA made: not drafting Giannis with their 2013 pick.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"Something about a redditor saying LeBron fucking James needs more  motivation is hilarious. Clearly coming from being a poor ass kid in Ohio to the face of the NBA and one of, if not, THE best athlete on the planet and becoming a legit contender for GOAT didn't take much motivation. Such a lazy bum."
You sure about that?   &gt;Isiah Thomas: ‘LeBron James is a much better basketball player than Michael Jordan’ - ESPN.  Heres the link too in case you want to fact check your statement.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AAbRz6ZRS0
Imagine saying Lebron James is in “iffy” shape.
"Kobe never won a MVP and Finals MVP in the same season. All the GOATs have.  The only players to win MVP and Finals MVP in the same season This list consists of some of the best players that dominated the NBA for an entire season, winning both MVP and Finals MVP in the same season.  Willis Reed (1970) Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1971) Moses Malone (1983) Larry Bird (1984, 1986) Magic Johnson (1987) Michael Jordan (1991, 1992, 1996, 1998) Hakeem Olajuwon (1994) Shaquille O'Neal (2000) Tim Duncan (2003) LeBron James (2012, 2013)"
"I saw LeBron James giving up after a barrage of spurs 3's. He gave up, and then collected points in garbage time when the game was over. He could have won that series. But all I'm saying is, it's hard to compare teammates because every situation is different with 1000s of variables, but his teammates being awful and uncomparable to Kobe's or even Jordan's is false. "
Fact. Yes.   Game-tying/go-ahead field goals with under 10 seconds left in the postseason:  &gt;Michael Jordan: 7/15 (47%) &gt;Kobe Bryant: 5/22 (23%) &gt;LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)
"If you look at one play and think he plays defense, you would think harden and westbrook are the best defense players in the league. Defense is about consistency. Going at every play 100%, no shot goes up uncontested. That's what makes Kawhi so great, nearly every shot someone takes on him is contested. That's why blocks and steals aren't a good indicator of defense prowess.  LeBron James literally doesn't play defense, I watched nearly every Cavs and Lakers games with LeBron on them, he doesn't play defense. I'm not necessarily faulting him for it, but if you want the mamba mentality label, you gotta play defense consistently"
...how? One trio played all the way to Game 7 in the Eastern Conference Finals against Lebron James...another trio has never played a single playoff game and don't win games.
"Jrue Holiday yelled, “There you go!” Nikola Mirotic gave a look of pleasant surprise. Jahlil Okafor belted, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Lebron James could speak, ex-Pelican star Anthony Davis hugged him and cried &amp; said, “They need me.”"
Wow what scrubs they lost to Lebron James
"Not really, time and time again we dismiss even the most ridiculous rumor's until it hits us like a train. Ala Kyrie Irving trade, LeBron James to the Lakers, Kawhi Leonard trade."
1. Kobe  2. Kareem  3. Magic  4. Bird  5. Michael Jeffery Jordan  6. Russell  7. Wilt  8. Duncan  9. LeBron James  10. Dr J
celtics had nothing to do with lakers being front runners. they were front runners because they had lebron james who is looking for another star and the lakers have lots of young assets.  celtics can't even trade before july so it's unrelated. calm your tits.
"It’s not as bad here as is popularly memed but they do exist and they are very annoying.  The Lakers signed LeBron fucking James, the best basketball player in the world and their response was to bitch about him not being Kobe."
Except is LeBron James and Anthony Davis 
"People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"There are two players that opposing irrationally teams fear. Steph Curry and LeBron James. Steph would lead a team of scrubs to the playoffs because his gravity pulls the defense to leave his teammates open. NBA ""rejects"" can make open shots. Steph on an open corner three is better than a wide open fast break dunk. He's better than any two point shot can possibly be. If you understand why Shaq got double-teamed back in the day, you understand why multiple players will rush Curry off a pick or a broken play when he's moving to the three point line. Unlike Shaq, Steph is an above-average passer for a starting point guard and an elite ball handler. Trying to guard the threats he creates tears defenses apart. The only reason he doesn't average 36 per game like Harden is because he doesn't have to. Absolute respect for what James Harden is doing, but the only reason Steph isn't right there with him is because he doesn't have to be."
"The Robert Mueller investigation has concluded that LeBron James has a very intense case of herpes (HSV2). While these herpes don’t have much of an effect on his play, it definitely puts Kobe Bryant back into the conversation. "
Yeah except their big men would be Lebron James and Anthony Davis
"No no no and no. Anyone who has played basketball at a relatively high level knows why Kobe is better.   LeBron cannot play off-ball, cannot play in system, only 2 coaches that was system he fired one (Blatt) and tried to fire spol), he has never made his teammates better hence why his teammates always shit the bed (he can't be ALWAYS unlucky - if everywhere you go smells like shit, look under your foot). Kobe made his teammates better, dominated the ball way less hence why less assists and less turnovers. He understand what it takes to be a championship team, which is ball movement and trusting teammates to get in rhythm. LeBron James dominates the ball only passes if he gets an assist. Making your teammates better isn't just passing them the ball to shoot, it's trusting them to make a play and have your offense in cohesion.   Basically LeBron is praised for his high BB IQ despite not knowing what it takes to win at a high level. The highest assist per games to win championship is 8.1 by Kidd, all the rest below 8, albeit magic's Lakers. Spread of assists is what wins games not 1 game getting 10 assists "
Yeah except their big men would be Lebron James and Anthony Davis
Yeah Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond is definitely the same as Lebron James and AD lmao 
Ever heard of a guy named Lebron James?
"A few overall stats to make the picture more clear:  Kobe Bryant PER - 25th all-time WS/48 - 58th BPM - 37th VORP - 17th  Clearly a great player, but nowhere close to these two:  Michael Jordan PER - 1st WS/48 - 1st BPM - 2nd VORP - 2nd  LeBron James PER - 2nd WS/48 - 6th BPM - 1st VORP - 1st  There are levels to this and he is on a level below the GOATs. "
"Jrue Holiday yelled, “There you go!” Nikola Mirotic gave a look of pleasant surprise. Jahlil Okafor belted, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Lebron James could speak, ex-Pelican star Anthony Davis hugged him &amp; said, “How come they don’t need me?”"
It’s crazy to think that at one point the eastern conference all star starting line up consists of lebron james and the atlanta hawks.
"22 years old.   I like dogs, video games, sports, and music.   I'm from Boston  My favorite ballers are LeBron James, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Jaylen Brown."
Lebron James 100%
"kobe and duncan &gt; lebron  lebum james is a whiny bitch, doesn't crack my top 10"
"That is a false analogy. Rack your mind and try to understand how many variables are involved. Half the people in this sub take it as gospel that MJ is the greatest player without even ever having watched him play. Wikipedia and BBallref stats. Context is everything.  I disagree that all evidence points towards MJ being definitively better than Kobe.   And this is not even a debate about “GOAT”. In that topic there is argument for Hakeem Olajuwon, Tim Duncan, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and Lebron James. But I’m sure you’ve watched 50 years of basketball and have clear opinions that are backed fully by comprehensive accounting of the factors that go into that discussion as well."
Its LeBron James. Theres a difference between players not wanting to play with him and GM’s not wanting to trade with us and make us better. 
LEBRON JAMES IS A POOR MAN'S COREY MAGGETE
"Alright,  There you go. We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Ron Baker.

And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets.

No way a tweaked groin is real, right? He's got to be playing head games.   Bron knows how important it is for his legacy for him to make the playoffs in the West, he knows the standings and what's at stake, no way he'd play head games at the expense of missing the playoffs.

Skip and SAS used to violate Lebron the day after just for flopping once in a game. There are youtube compilations of Lebron flopping with people giving him a bunch of crap on it. You can make a harden flop compilation at least 10mins longer than Lebrons.  &amp;#x200B;  One thing I will agree with you is about the amount of posts that would be on Lebron's dick if he was to be going on a scoring tear like Harden, but I can also tell you that Lebron has way more fans than harden, and he also has way more haters than harden.

"And if Ray Allen doesnt hit that 3, if James Harden doesnt choke in the 2012 finals, and if Draymond doesnt get suspended/Bogut and Iggy dont get hurt, Lebron wouldnt even be in the discussion"
LeBron James is practically his agent. The only way he would make me believe he stays with the Celtics is if he leaves Klutch Sports after signing there. 
I love to see the Lakers miss the playoffs for the sixth straight year and with Lebron James on your team
"Really isn't.  This is the first time in 9 years he does not start the season on a team with 3 All Nba players.   How many players could have won the 2011 NBA finals if they replaced Lebron james?  KD, Melo, Kobe, Amare, Rosee, Blake, Russ, Dwight, LMA, KG, Paul Pierce.  Lebron was literally a replacement level starter in the 2011 NBA Finals. Probably a dozen other players could have took his place and the Heat win in 6 games."
"He has the 5th highest defensive rating in the league, the 2nd guard on the list is Oladipo at 15th  Also has a better AST/TO ratio than Ben Simmons, John Wall, Lebron, and James Harden to name a few  Also has a better +/- than guys like Kawhi, Jokic, Klay, and Harden  Really the only thing off this year is his shooting (and to be fair it’s been very far off for most of the season), but everything else has been phenomenal"
Paul George and Julius Randle both left LA and were represented by the same agent who has a negative history with the Lakers.  Anthony Davis is represented by Lebron James. It's not the same thing. 
Uhhhh they signed LeBron James?
"Sexton isn’t on the right team IMO. His best skill is his iso ability and playing hero ball every possession. That’s the team Cleveland was before LeBron left, now because he’s gone they’re trying to play the sharing game, where everyone touches the ball. That’s not his game. It’s like Austin Rivers, who is more of an iso player and played better on a team where he was able to do that on Chris Paul’s Clippers and James Harden’s Rockets. Cleveland is trying to play a similar offense as the Wizards and it’s just not his game. "
"Nope. Lebron started it.  How many players could have won the 2011 NBA finals if they replaced Lebron james?  KD, Melo, Kobe, Amare, Rosee, Blake, Russ, Dwight, LMA, KG, Paul Pierce.  Lebron was literally a replacement level starter in the 2011 NBA Finals. Probably a dozen other players could have took his place and the Heat win in 6 games."
"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Giannis (idk how to spell his last name), Kawhi Leonard   I’d put those 6 above him"
I see it's not longer KD or Westbrook that Steph fans are insecure about on Reddit but James Harden.   Every single thread about Harden win or lose someone compare him to Steph even though their games are nothing alike. Harden right now is more like playoff LeBron than Steph. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do to keep an injured team above water and that's what Harden is doing.    &amp;#x200B;
"Yes, I’m one of those old men.  Kareem was not talked about as GOAT until well after Jordan retired.  At first some stat-oriented contrarians made the argument.  But the argument really took off when fans of LeBron James were looking for a way he could pass Jordan.  If Kareem, not Jordan, was the GOAT, then James still has a chance to surpass Kareem’s career stats.  This argument may not be wrong.  Maybe too much emphasis was placed on championship rings and Finals MVPs, and not enough on career stats.  But I still think the fans of LeBron made the argument much more popular because it served their purposes.  Kareem’s stock rose because it gave LeBron a path to GOAT status."
Jah: I'm like bitch who is your mans?  AD: Lebron James.  Jah: My bitch don't love me no more...
You forgot 2011 colapse of Lebron James. 
"""His averages are worse than last year""  Ignores that he's had to adjust to playing with Lebron James, getting suspended, getting injured, then once he's healthy he lost every playmaker.  "
"Who needs Paul George when you have LeBron James, who's twice the player Paul George could ever be"
"Your comment just assured me that you don’t even watch the games. I know I’ll get downvoted for having the audacity to defend Harden, but your points are just idiotic. Teams game plan their whole strategy around stopping Harden, and you’re suggesting he’s not even being defended and getting open shots *every time*? [Coaches talk about how they have to throw 2 to 3 guys on Harden to try to stop him, and Dwayne Casey says the reason he’s so good at drawing fouls is because “a lot of it is {defenders} being undisciplined once he drives in. He's so strong once he drives into the basket. You have to use your body, your chest and get in front of him.""(https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.chron.com/sports/rockets/amp/Pistons-coach-Dwane-Casey-on-Rockets-James-Harden-13413249.php).   Sure, he also draws some bs fouls every game by initiating contact, but to suggest that he couldn’t even score 26 when he’s scoring over 36 per game is just insane and your analysis couldn’t even be farther from the truth. LeBron also initiates contact and benefits from foul calls, but could you imagine if someone suggested that’s the only reason why he’s impossible to guard? They get so many calls because of their combination of speed, strength, ball handling, finishing ability, threat of kicking it out, as well as their ability to sell contact.   Just a quick look through your search history shows that you’re either a troll or clueless, since you legitimately believe Klay is better than Harden right now and legitimately believe Doncic should’ve been named all-star captain from the West over Curry, KD, LeBron, PG, and of course Harden (not to mention Dame, AD, etc. who couldn’t even break the starters because the West is so stacked)."
"This is such bullshit lol. In Miami, you had LeBron James and Dwayne Wade on the roster. What, do you want Chris Bosh taking 20 shots a game with those two on the team?"
"You see... LeBron. There’s been a lot of focus on James Harden, Luka, and PG-13. However, when LeBron comes back, he is going to make sure that everyone bows down... to the king."
"No I have realized that, but it's always good to point it out again because there are plenty of lebron James cult followers "
"&gt;Kuzma, Ball, and Lonzo when all healthy have a 5-7 record without Lebron James   They're 5-5, unless you're counting the OKC game where Kuzma got hurt a few minutes in?"
"Doncic is also an overseas player. I think more than anything that was the knock on him. It wasn’t a fair knock, but I think some GMs were legit scared of drafting the next Mario Hezonja or Jan Vesely.   Zion is something different. He’s pretty abnormal. He’s a combination of size, speed, and athleticism. He’s shown he can defend. He’s shown he can rebound and create a shot. He has the type of highlight plays that’ll be on TV every night - something teams love since it’s easy to draw casual fans in that way. The only thing he hasn’t been great at is shooting, but even there he’s improving. I’ve heard some people say that since 2000, the two other players to receive this much praise from scouts were LeBron James and Anthony Davis. "
"ESPN: Source /u/TheDanSandwich confirms Kevin Durant would like to play for the Lakers alongside LeBron James.  I almost put inb4 bathwater jokes, but I love lobbin' alley oops to r/NBA lol."
he’s lebron james he’s allowed to do whatever the fuck he wants
"Lebron James, a forward playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, is good at basketball."
LEBRON JAMES HARDEN
I could be wrong but it’s worth noting that for those 26 games they didn’t have LeBron James
2 words Lebron James 
"Zo, Ingram, Kuz, Randle. Not sure what else a rebuilding task could ask for than a young core like that.   Like hypothetically if you were a lottery team for years and you got to chose between 4 young guys like that, or two elite superstars like say Lebron James and Anthony Davis, you’d obviously go with the young squad right?"
"Lol LeBron James is the precursor to this shit from Harden. The amount of times I have watched that dude drive into the lane, shove the defender with his arm then finish and get a call for the and 1."
"Yeah I think overall there's no chance that people will have KD over LeBron in all time rankings. Back in 2011 we thought this would be KDs League after 2013 and by now it was supposed to be ADs League lol. KD being some years younger might still make him the best player in the league, given that LeBron declines and KD can sustain his level of play up until he's 33 or something. So it'd be like prime KD is better than declining LeBron for some years. However, if LeBron remains a force in the playoffs (by now one shouldn't doubt James in general lol this guy is a tank and will probably play on this level till hes 38 imo), he'd still have an argument for highest peak player while KD may be more productive on a night-to-night basis."
"NBA Free Agency Is Months Away. It’s Already Crazier Than Baseball’s. BEN COHEN FEBRUARY 06, 2019 NBA free agency is five months away, and teams have already taken extreme measures to offer Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving the maximum amount of money they’re legally permitted as soon as they possibly can.  Major League Baseball’s free agency began more than three months ago. Bryce Harper and Manny Machado remain unsigned. Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel are waiting for teams to stop twiddling their thumbs. Meanwhile, spring training starts in a week.  Baseball players can be paid anything they can convince teams to pay in the sports economy that most closely resembles a free market, but they are angrier than they have been in a quarter-century. Basketball players have their earning potential artificially deflated by a salary cap, and yet they have tilted the balance of power their way.  That contradiction shows that it’s not just a torrent of 3-pointers that is propelling the NBA or an epidemic of slow games that is hobbling MLB. It’s the structure of the employment markets that is helping to drive the sports in opposite directions.  Baseball is the only major North American league without a salary cap, a landmark achievement for the players’ union that earned players the right to earn whatever the market will bear with no restrictions on the length or dollar amount of contracts.  But in recent winters, the hot stove has been frigid. MLB teams are refusing to award the monster contracts to superstars they once dished out like candy. The biggest free-agent deal ever was given to Alex Rodríguez for $275 million more than a decade ago. The rapidly changing power dynamic has caused baseball’s labor relations to sink their lowest point since the strike of 1994, stoking fears of a work stoppage when the current collective bargaining agreement expires after the 2021 season.  It has now been 100 days since Harper and Machado officially hit the market in the primes of their careers. LeBron James agreed to his contract with the Los Angeles Lakers last summer less than 24 hours after becoming a free agent.  The salary cap and floor in the NBA mean that someone with as much influence on his team as James will never know what he might be worth on the open market. He’s limited to a maximum salary of about $35 million this year. But what the most valuable basketball players sacrifice in earning potential they have gained in control over their own careers.  “The wage compression in the NBA has led to superstars being massively underpaid by the salary cap,” said Yale economist Florian Ederer. “We moved from an equilibrium with highly paid but powerless star players to an equilibrium with underpaid but powerful star players.”  What will Kyrie Irving do this summer? The entire NBA is waiting to find out.Photo: Maddie Meyer/Getty Images  The saga involving a potential trade for Davis that has the entire league refreshing Twitter ahead of Thursday’s trade deadline is only the latest example of their power.  A brief list of the NBA luminaries who have requested trades includes Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Lakers president Magic Johnson. But what makes Davis unique is that he won’t be a free agent for nearly 18 months. That didn’t stop him from attempting to reroute his talents to Los Angeles in what could be the most consequential NBA deal in decades, and the Lakers would swap almost their entire roster because they might not be able to lure another player of his caliber this summer.  But they also lusted after him because any basketball team with James and Davis—or Durant and Irving—is a title contender even if the bench consists of kitchen appliances. The difference in baseball is that a team could sign Harper, Machado and Keuchel and realistically still miss the playoffs.  Call it the Albert Pujols rule. He was the best player in baseball when the Los Angeles Angels signed him to a $240 million contract seven years ago. They also have Mike Trout, the best player in baseball now, and they still haven’t won a playoff game.  David Samson, the former president of the Miami Marlins, remembers watching Derek Jeter in the dugout during the final inning of the 2003 World Series. He realized that, with Jeter not due up to bat, he could do nothing but watch helplessly as Josh Beckett closed out a championship for the Marlins. But when the Miami Heat signed James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, they could almost guarantee that a major star would determine their fate when it mattered. The Heat went to four straight NBA Finals after assembling that trio.  “When Bosh, Wade and LeBron say to themselves they are going to play together, they are deciding the future of the NBA,” Samson said. “Baseball has no players who can do that.”  When will a team sign Manny Machado? The entire baseball world is still waiting for the answer.Photo: Armando Arorizo/Zuma Press  Basketball players are taking shorter contracts and feeling obligated to partner with each other to win championships. The result is that the NBA has become a league in which the trades and transactions get more attention than the games themselves. The season and offseason are one.  Baseball’s actual free agency is an interminable slog by comparison.  “With all the dynamics that exist in a true open market, you have to go through hours and hours of negotiations with a team,” said Scott Boras, Harper’s agent. “It’s a much more in depth process in baseball.”  Baseball would love for Harper, one of the most enticing free agents in history, to preside over a spectacle to unveil his new home. Instead the announcement will likely come in an unceremonious tweet from a reporter.  The anticlimactic ending highlights the challenge that baseball continues to face in marketing its most valuable assets. Multiple companies have approached Harper’s representatives about the possibility of a staged announcement, Boras said, but he’s declined those overtures in large part because of his belief that such a concept could never work in baseball.  “I can see where the attention would be grand,” Boras said. “But the truth of the matter is the circuitry of our system is very, very silent.”  The last few weeks in the NBA have been ear-splitting. The flurry of trades is only a sneak preview of the noise to come this offseason. There could be seven max-salary slots in New York and Los Angeles alone, and teams are playing an expensive game of musical chairs to land their superstars.  The mere possibility of angsty players moving around is enough to create hope in unlikely places. Knicks fans can entertain themselves with visions of Durant and Irving, for example, because simply having a shot at two free agents may be the greatest thing that’s happened to the franchise this decade. It was risky for them to dump Kristaps Porzingis and make room on their books, but that sort of aggressive maneuvering is almost necessary to have a presence in free agency.  Some players don’t even bother waiting that long. Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Irving and Davis all requested trades in recent seasons. They help explain the relentless frenzy of today’s NBA because of something else those players have in common: They were on the same court in the All-Star Game two years ago.  There were 25 basketball players selected as All-Stars in 2017. By the end of this week, more than half of them could be on new teams."

Rich Paul. LeBron James. Lakers as a franchise. 
"Hindsight is 20/20. Pacers (just like Spurs and just like Pelicans now) keep wanting more from Lakers for trades than they ask from other teams. He didn't fail to get PG. He walked away. PG was not the same PG we see now. He constructed a team that doesn't work yes, but to keep cap flexibility for this upcoming year. You do know that was the plan that is pretty much public. So yeah, let's lose sight of the big picture? And yeah, what can Magic do if teams just don't want to trade with the Lakers?  ANd sure, Lebron only came here for Hollywood right? THen why do people claim he's GMing his way to another title. Why create all this mess if he came here to retire? Also, THis:  https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-lebron-james-20180701-story.html"
being a basketball star in europe is way less profitable than being a basketball star in the us or china tho  would you rather try to market tony parker and pau gasol or lebron james and dwyane wade

"BI is averaging more points and assists with less touches, on the same team as LeBron “forty percent usage” James."
"Lebron James went 3-6 in the NBA Finals for his playing career, including a 1-3 record against the Warriors (once in 7 games, once in 6). If you flip that around he's 5-4 in the NBA Finals gunning for his 6th ring to tie Jordan. The Laker's this year might not make the playoffs. But if you flip that around the Lakers are making the finals and winning the championship and his reputation goes from top-5 all time to arguably GOAT. But if you flip that around that actually makes him the worst player of all time. So in a way, Jerry West turning the warriors into a dynasty saved Lebron's legacy."

"Those leaks are all coming from NOLA. They instantly drop any talk they have to WOJ. It’s honestly a purposefully disrespectful move.  They dropped Randle because his agent hates us and dlo for cap space that Mitch put us in (would still be on the books right now), which we used to sign Lebron James."
"Ok so maybe they go 8-9 instead? Big deal. You're trading your superstar, your best player. You want some *real* return out of a deal like that. If Davis is worth a dollar, the Lakers are effectively offering a quarter, a few dimes, and a couple nickels for a total of 75 cents. It's an offer big on quantity, low on quality.  Are any of Ball, Ingram, or Kuzma future superstars? It's very debatable.  The draft picks don't carry much value seeing as a Lebron James-led team has not missed the playoffs since the 2004-2005 season. Those aren't lottery picks; they're likely late rounders.  Assuming Solomon Hill's contract? If the Pelicans get a bunch of young guys in return for Davis, that contract won't be as big of a deal anymore, especially with it expiring next season. For instance,   Davis ($25.4M) for Ball ($7.5M), Ingram ($5.8M), Kuzma ($1.7M), Hart ($1.7M), and Zubac ($1.5M). That's $7.2M in ""found"" money. If both Davis and Hill ($12.5M) come off the books, the Pelicans will be so far under the salary cap floor of $91.7M, they'll have to offer random people on the street contracts."
"Your Lakers starting line up: Lebron James PF, Lebron James SF, Lebron James PG, Lebron James SG and Anthony Davis C"
"Why did the Clippers trade Harris? They didn’t want to pay him a near max contract. The Celtics didn’t just trade IT to slightly upgrade, they also got a player who more closely aligned with their young core. I do feel real bad for IT having to go play with LeBron James...."
Yes but for how long. You don’t give up a young prospect for a 34 year old unless it’s someone like lebron james.
"Need to add that ""Produced by LeBron James and Rich Paul"" credit at the end lol"
Lebron “kamala harris” james
"But you’re talking like Ingram is a talent that is cobble of carrying a team.   And it’s weird because when LeBron left *and* Rondo was out for a bit Ingram saw his TS% rise. That shouldn’t happen, and it indicates that he’s a poor shooter.  He’s also not a good enough shooter or distributor while acting as the primary ball-handler to warrant any kind of praise for his work on that end of the floor.   This team lost to the Cavs without LeBron James. A team that is actively trying to lose. Same with the Knicks. They also only won 3 quality games. It wasn’t an easy stretch of games but it also wasn’t the hardest either.   So being the primary ball handler really doesn’t amount for much if the player in question isn’t excelling in that role, making players around him better, and most importantly: winning games.  Kuz is the better player, not because he’s god. He’s not that great either. He’s a good player, who could potentially become an all-star if he can expand his range a little more; and if you look at both of their ability to hit a jump shot in the flow of a game, between the two, Kuzma looks like he can do that.  They’re both fine players. Kuz is just better right now, and the skill set’s Ingram would have to develop are skill sets that he doesn’t really seem to excell at right now."
LeBron James has never had a usage rate in the 40% range. Don't ask vague questions and expect specific answers.

"Dude, are you serious? When did anybody say anything about Cleveland being the biggest contender? First of all, Cavs couldn't afford Melo, Lebron, and Love. Also, why in the world does Melo want to go to Cleveland over any of those cities? He clearly does not care about winning and he returned back to the city that gave him the most possible money.  &amp;#x200B;  Lebron saw the potential in Cleveland because they already had Kyrie Irving, plus they just got the #1 overall pick and he knew that they could trade the #1 pick for Kevin Love. On top of that, he was given all the control in the world in Cleveland and basically builds the rosters himself ontop of it being his hometown.  "" When James was considering coming back to Cleveland, the team was eager to do whatever it could to make sure he was happy. Part of that was ensuring the team was one that he could win a championship with. The Cavaliers jettisoned top draft pick Andrew Wiggins in a trade that brought them back Kevin Love, a clear sign to LeBron that they were going to try to win ... and win now.  When James expressed concern about the team's depth early on, the Cavaliers went out and got J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert and Timofey Mozgov. It was all done to make the team better, yes, but it also was done to make sure the team's superstar is happy. "" ([https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/lebron-built-the-cavaliers-roster-and-now-is-complaining-about-it-012617](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/lebron-built-the-cavaliers-roster-and-now-is-complaining-about-it-012617))"

"LBJ didn’t commit because that’s not what he does. He keeps all the leverage and sign 1+1s with player options. LBJ not committing to CLE DOESN’T mean he didn’t still try to get Kyrie traded.

Go read her report about it, unless you think she completely fabricated a conversation she had with Kyrie (which he never refuted a single word of lol).   Irving called the details of his trade request ""distorted."" ""I didn't feel the need to say anything because I knew the truth, and so did they,"" he told MacMullan. ""So it didn't matter what others said.""  ""They didn't want me there,"" he added.

Those conversations stalled, then Griffin stepped down. Attempts at landing Paul George in a three-way deal with Indiana and Denver that would have sent Kevin Love to the Nuggets fell through (as did attempts to trade for Jimmy Butler). Irving ultimately made his request to be moved, though he wasn't pleased with how his request was perceived.’’  Lmfao David Griffin was LBJ MAN!

Didn't Tobi talk trash in his rookie year or something. LeBron destroyed him on ever team he ended up on.   https://cavsnation.com/tobias-harris-pissed-off-lebron-james-and-the-king-has-been-destroying-him-ever-since/amp/
"I loved this interview.  Strangely enough, I really hated Kobe Bryant when he was a younger player. When I became a basketball fan, I grew up in Michigan and then Chicago, so I logically rooted for the Bad Boys then the Bulls. By the time I moved to Los Angeles, I actually started becoming more interested in old school basketball. So while I admired all the former Laker greats--Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, and countless others--along with their Celtic rivals and many others from the past eras, the new Lakers really rubbed me the wrong way. Part of it was living with so many Laker fans. Certainly there are a lot of passionate, long-time fans within Laker nation, but it also so many ignorant bandwagon fans who probably thought Showtime at the Forum was a cinema at a Roman amphitheater.  Think ""lifelong"" Warrior fans who have been rooting for the team since 2015 but much more obnoxious and vocal.  Kobe was by far the player I least liked. So many of his mannerisms which he copied from Jordan rubbed me the wrong way, and unlike Jordan, who had to struggle with carrying a previously pathetic franchise through a historically stacked Eastern conference with no help before he achieved success, he forced his way onto a traditional powerhouse team on draft day, one that had a pretty talented roster that featured arguably the greatest young big of all-time and three other all-stars (including himself) by the time he earned regular minutes his sophomore year. This allowed him to achieve championship success at a much younger age than Jordan despite not being as talented, yet he pissed all that away for the opportunity to prove himself as the main man.  While I still have my criticisms of Kobe as a player, he certainly proved himself as one of the game's greats, and even before he retired, I came to appreciate his place in the game. In retrospect, I have realized a lot of my distaste for him was based on ridiculous comments made by his fanboys. In the meantime, while he may not be as physically gifted as a Michael Jordan, LeBron James, or even a Tracy McGrady (as he readily acknowledged), I respect that he has a work ethic and a competitive drive like few others in the history of the game, matched only by his Airness and perhaps the likes of Larry Bird and Jerry West. While I criticized his shot selection as evidence of poor basketball IQ, particularly early in his career, he has demonstrated his acumen many times over throughout his career and in his analysis shows afterwards. And while I detested his mimickery of many of Jordan's mannerisms, as I thought no one deserved to title of Heir Apparent, Kobe included, I cam to realize in the final year of his career that part of that reflected the development of a young Kobe Bryant, a player driven by a tireless work ethic who actively sought the advice of a veteran Michael Jordan.  It has been refreshing to hear more from Kobe, to get more insight into his career but also what he is like away from the court when he can tone down his competitive drive. In a way, he has now become part of the ""old school"" of players who I revere, one whose legacy speaks for itself, independent of the ridiculous takes of blathering contemporary idiots. Perhaps in another 10 years or so, many of the current veterans, some of whom I dislike for various reasons, will be players who I perceive more favorably for similar reasons."
"Do not care.   Hes very talented but the league literally officiates him differently than every other player, including their cash cow lebron James (or steph curry), and everyone knows it. No shit you'll look great when defenders know they will be called for any contact whatsoever, even when you're the one who creates it. People are afraid to guard him legitimately knowing this and thus he has complete freedom in airspace. He's not the only star who could light up the stat sheet with this much usage and no one allowed to breathe near him, there are a number of guys who could. Hes not the most athletic, nor is he the most skilled in terms of footwork, nor is he the most efficient shooter. He gets to the line at an absurd rate based on bullshit. Sorry not sorry.  Its bullshit that I cant support and refuse to acknowledge as a lifelong fan. Also not harden's fault, the league enables him."
"I tell ya what, AD is a fucking fool if he doesn't try and do everything in his power to get the Pelicans to send him to Los Angeles to play with Lebron James."
"You make good points, but consider this; LeBron James"
I love what IT brought to Boston. He’ll always be one of my favorite players to wear a Celtics jersey...but how would have staying in Boston last year grant him a huge contract? Were Lebron James and the Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers not considered a contender? It’s not like Ainge shipped him to Atlanta.
"Or it says that everyone around him is straight trash. Or maybe it’s inbetween?   The truth of the matter is laker fans are acting like every single member of their young core is a future all-star: when realistically, it looks like Kuz is the only one who might be. And by the time he “hits” LeBron is gone. And then who do you have with Kuz? An older Zo? A 37-38 year old Bron?  Getting AD now sets you up to win a championship in 2020. *Not* doing that sets you up to get one...when exactly? One more superstar doesn’t put the Lakers above a host of teams:  * Warriors  * Nuggets  * Bucks  * 76ers  * OKC  * Boston  * Raptors (w/Kawhi obviously)   And that’s not including teams with more chemistry, better shooting, deeper benches, and better coaching, but I have to assume if you’re able to land a second superstar some of that gets fixed.  But who do you ad?   KD isn’t leaving Steph to play alongside LeBron when he wants to be annointed better than LeBron objectively.   AD isn’t a FA next year.  Kyrie coming to you makes you what? About as good as the Cavs were?  Kawhi coming would probably be the best bet, but that’s a huge gamble seeing as we’ve already seen one LA guy stay in a team that took a chance on him. Not to mention a team that has a chance to get to the finals. (And also not to mention that the Clippers might be a stronger play for him anyway).  Then you’ve got Klay, which dramatically helps shooting but doesn’t uptic you necessarily past the teams at the top, although it would knock down GS a little.   The point is, you have LeBron James. And if you don’t trade some of these assets and their salaries for a second superstar to fit those salaries then you have effectively wasted that signing. "
"the moment lebron james signed with the lakers, LA was no longer a dev team. it's win or bust mentality now!  AD incoming soon"
"&gt;Love the faith the Laker faithful has in these young guys who are currently in 10th in the west and just got blown out by a pacers team that had no Oladipo.  By that token, Lebron James sucks as well since he also just got blown out."
A Cavs team that had Lebron fucking James and was coming off 3 straight Finals appearances...
"Either way the point remains that CP's proven to be a good enough and efficient enough scorer without the benefit of Lebron James as a teammate to be the point guard on that title team.   That doesn't even mention CP and Kyrie averaged the same amount of TO's in 2016 while CP had more than twice the assists while being more of the primary ballhandler than Kyrie was.   I don't know for sure wether Cavs actually do win the title with CP, but saying CP arguing good enough of a scorer doesn't fly when he put up comprable PPG on equal or better efficiency without opposing defenses having to gameplan for Lebron as his teamate.  "
"One example, the day LeBron came back he tweeted:   ""LeBron James Injury Is “More Complex."" A return between February 7th vs. Boston Celtics and February 10th vs. Philadelphia 76ers is a good bet.""  https://mobile.twitter.com/ScoopB/status/1091081207931129856   "
"I thought it was clear just from how quickly he jumped into working on all these shows and other projects as soon as he moved. I think them going good was largely a case of them overachieving, mixed with the fact that they have LeBron James"
"his quotes this morning were even better  &gt;LeBron James on if trade rumors has affected the team: ""Umm.. I don't know. I mean, obviously we have a lot of guys that have been in trade talks the last couple of weeks that's never been in that position before, so you have to ask those guys and how they're dealing with it...""You can't really ask me. I've never really been a part of that, but I've been a part of teammates, but I know it has to be tough on a lot of our guys, especially our young guys. You know, right now they've just never really been a part of it...""and you know they're hearing it every single day and I know that the worst thing that you can do right now is be on social media and I know all young guys love being on social media, so that definitely can't help.""  translation: ""not my problem lmao, sounds like some *personal* shit"""
"Want to know some other facts? In all but two playoff appearances in the 21st century, the Pacers have been eliminated by LeBron James. It's not that hard to understand for anyone who can understand facts and logic. "
"well i think this is almost a unique instance here. on the one hand, he’s lebron james; on the other, he is getting older and in an ultra competitive west.   really i mean that if i were a betting man and the odds on both these were the same, i’d buy both or neither"
Another NBA star named Anthony Davis had officially requested a trade as he no longer wishes to play for his team (New Orleans Pelicans). The Lakers have been aggressively offering trade packages to acquire Anthony Davis. Brandon Ingram (the subject of this gif) is one of the pieces being offered.  The chant/joke has another layer in that LeBron James is often criticized for overstepping his role as a player to try and force the management to make trades that he wants them to make. You'll sometimes hear them use the pejorative term *LeGM* in a mocking tone. How much clout he actually has with regards to management is up for debate.
Who's the ex-Laker legend that's gonna hug LeBron before he reaches the locker room? I bet my money it's James Worthy

"&gt;I genuinely think I would've been happier as a Laker fan if we had never tried to sign Lebron James.  You'd enjoy missing the playoffs and being one of the worst teams in the West with a bunch of overrated young players? This is why I didn't want Lebron going to the Lakers, Laker fans aren't even grateful that they have the best player in the world. You'd be the 13-14th seed without Lebron btw "
"We’re going to talk about Kevin Love now? You know they’re great friends and Love has had very positive things to say about his time with James.    Who said LeBron’s locker rooms are toxic? And I’m not asking for KD’s quote on the toxic media where he specifically said it’s not LeBron’s fault. As for what’s going on with the Lakers, they tried to do what they should puts them in the best position to win. And that was trading for a top ~5 player. Management wanted that too. Not just LeBron. They are trying to compete "
"all im saying is if thats James Harden, Steph Curry, Lebron, Westbrook etc thats a four point play"
With LeBron fucking James managing his load*
LeBron James is the GM and coach
Fuck them kids - Lebron James
"If y'all want to read it:   On Day 8 of Kevin Durant’s media silence, the superstar small forward demonstrated an impressive burst of speed, right off the completion of an intensive workout. KD cruised across the practice floor as two Warriors public-relations officials beseeched him to turn back. Reporters had gathered with intent to ask questions of a man who’d gone underground concurrent with loud rumors of a New York Knicks future. The Warriors know how this looks and want KD answering questions rather than dragging this out. Instead, Durant shook his head as the PR officials flanked him. He easily split the double team, dodging through the doors of the glass-walled weight room. His pursuers lost him somewhere between kettlebells and a hex bar. KD had left the building.  The only other time this season where Durant has made himself scarce was after the famous Nov. 12 spat with Draymond Green. Since then, tensions have cooled. The issue is that such tensions likely had little to do with Durant’s future, which, as Draymond indicated back then, was probably already a fait accompli. And that was all before the Knicks used a 7-foot-3 Latvian as their battering ram for cracking open a giant-sized pocket of salary-cap space. The Knicks might have a poor free agency track record, but nobody in the know says they did this blithely. To reference the season that just ended, this looks more like a timing route than a Hail Mary.  Let us be frank, with the caveat that the choice lives inside the head of one guy who can and does change his mind: Insiders around the league think Kevin Durant is leaving the Warriors for the Knicks. Most people within the Warriors either think Durant is leaving or profess not to know one way or the other. His teammates recognize this reality, can handle it and merely want one outcome: Win a championship, absent too much drama. The main concern, at the moment, is whether he’ll commit in the short term to what he may have already left in the long term.  With Durant, the open book nobody can read, it’s hard to know what exactly happens next. Last playoffs, when it looked like the season was slipping away early in both Western Conference finals elimination games, KD looked disconnected from the action, floating on defense and getting shoved out of the way for rebounds. Eventually, he woke up at end of Game 7 and closed the door on the Rockets. After that, he dominated another Finals. His vicissitudes don’t map neatly onto ready-made “clutch” or “choker” narratives. He’s often an assassin in the tensest of moments, and other times fades from view, inexplicably.  Some teammates believe that his biggest successes are indivisible from what currently ails. Or moreover, the reception of such successes. Sources say that Durant believed his besting of LeBron James in the 2017 Finals would get him hailed as the game’s top player, a mantle he’s craved for some time. While LeBron averaged a 33.6 point-per-game triple-double in that Finals, Durant was superior defensively and hit the series’ biggest shot right in the King’s face.  Instead, there was no grand reordering of rankings, and only so much credit to be had for a dominant playoff run. KD, who was “tired of being second” way back in 2013, was still stuck there reputationally, even in ultimate victory. He was still behind LeBron in the eyes of pundits, basketball Twitter, and perhaps most importantly, at Nike, who’s employed Durant longer than any team. Then, the next Finals unfolded in much the same way, with much the same result, all while Warriors fans cheered loudest for the smaller MVP’s baskets.  Whatever KD caught might be going around. The league is currently replete with superstar angst, guys with one foot in decent situations and another foot in the possibilities of some distant city. Even when guaranteed more money with the home team, grass in other pastures looks greener than the promised cash. It’s all prologue to what is, now, on its face, an incongruous situation of a team clicking as its free-agent superstar broods. The Warriors are rolling, having won 12 of their last 13. The return of DeMarcus Cousins has brought good cheer to many, yet Durant appears to outwardly sulk. Beyond the exasperated on-court gesticulations and media avoidance, he’s made a habit of drifting far from the huddle during timeouts, electing to stand alone by the stanchion.  It’s quite the power huddle he’s standing apart from. With Cousins, the Warriors have effectively amassed an All-Star team as their starting lineup. While Cousins likely cannot be retained, this team’s future would remain bright for as long as Durant commits to it. At bottom, the Warriors would open up Chase Center with a core that can win titles for years to come. This is not the 2014 Miami Heat, who were reliant on a deteriorating Dwyane Wade. When your stars can shoot, they tend to age better.  Sources say teammates would understand if KD left what looks like perfection. It’s just a harder sell to the public writ large. What’s the PR-friendly reason for leaving a favorite that appears primed to reign for ages? KD’s catch-22, or catch-35 if you will: He’ll likely be criticized for ring avoidance by the same people who ripped him for ring chasing. None of this would be a problem if Durant tuned out criticism, but few are better known for bathing their own wounds in salt.  In speaking to Warriors’ brass, you can detect a calm about the situation that belies its stakes. This is because there’s not much the Warriors can do right now. There’s a comfort in that. It’s a silver lining in a time of stress for multiple teams, as others cobble together trade ideas under significant time pressure and publicity. Given contract constraints, the Warriors can’t trade Durant even if they wanted to. Both parties know each other well enough by now. If KD wants to leave, there isn’t some magical cinematic pitch that will reverse that choice. The only option is to wait on his decision and prepare for the worst.  The Warriors have already made their choice. They want KD. They’d love if he decided to stay for longer, but can appreciate what he gave up to this point. If it all goes down as Draymond predicted back in November, it still will have been a hell of a ride. If this is the final Durant season for the Warriors, they just wish it to be more of a last hurrah than a painful divorce. In that, just as he does with his upcoming free agency, KD holds all the cards."
"I agree with you. AD has shown he isn't a James Harden. He couldn't will his team into a playoff spot. And LeBron is getting older and he's also gotten slower this season. Without at least a few shooters, they would still have a hard time next year."
So what if it’s Lebron James it’s 34 year old Lebron James who’s making Magic literally bend over for him and saying “yes master I am ready willing to trade everyone and our future for the small chance of winning next year”

"Oh, I read your first sentence and I thought you were referring to the coach killer prema donna known as Lebron James. "

With LeBron Fucking James on their roster
Supposed to be a scorer?  A player who averages under 14 shots a game is supposed to be a scorer?  Player: FGA/pergame Steph Curry: 19.8 Klay Thompson: 18.4 Lebron James: 19.4 Kemba Walker: 19.7 James Harden: 24.1 Russell Westbrook: 19.6 Kevin Durant: 19.0 Devin Booker: 19.0  Jayson Tatum 13.3 (16.1pts) Brandon Ingram 13.7 (17.2pts)  But yeah he's a SCORER who can't average 20 points 
Lebron James had a game with -20
"Your team is about to trade away all of your assets for a chance at being a 7/8 seed at best and wasting Lebron James, but go off "
There's a [Planet Money episode](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/07/11/628137929/episode-427-lebron-james-is-still-underpaid) that addresses how absolutely absurd the NBA is in terms of business practices and economics.  
Your team has LeBron James and still won’t make the playoffs 
"Publicly saying you are willing to trade your entire team for one player is not good for team morale? Insinuating that all of your young impressionable players are worth 1/8th of Anthony Davis, is not a great way to inspire a winning attitude? Appearing as if you care about the wants and needs of only LeBron James makes egotistical NBA players like Lance Stephenson get frustrated and do dumb shit like this? "
"They want value for AD, the mystique/promise around Lebron is immense.... But you're point about James' reaction is valid. "
"""When you fall, stay down""-LeBron James. "
"It just seems like such a toxic situation and it sucks to be players like BI, Lonzo, Kuz who need to develop to become better players and they have this shitstorm. Imagine if you have been trying to carry your team to make playoffs then hear shit like “Magic wants to trade 5 for 1” Like wtf I’d be pissed.  Plus I completely forgot but during the super bowl there was an ad for a show called the million dollar mile which actually looks dope but Lebron James is the host. If he’s on the injury list and doing set shoots I’d be pissed as a teammate."
Lebron looking up if James Jones and Marion can un-retire
"Lebron doesn't have good team building knowledge. He's going to be a bad GM/owner when the day comes.  He also messed up in 2010. Bulls could have had a team with Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, Lebron James, Chris Bosh, Joakim Noah, with Taj Gibson, James Johnson, and Jimmy Butler off the bench. "
Lebron James is trying to chase Michael B Jordan and not Micheal J Jordan
"We can argue about this all day long, but acting like there's some unanimous consensus Kawhi is better is just very weird and untrue. Like surely you don't think you're stating a fact, right? There are people that consider AD a top 3 player. You don't have to agree but saying there's no argument Kawhi is better is just obnoxious.

"As expected, LeBron James has brought his toxic ""leadership"" to a growing franchise. He completely burned himself out last season and can no longer compensate for his terrible attitude with great play. The Lakers young cores growth is going to be stunted by his selfishness and delusion that he's still a championship contender. The only thing that can put him in check is to get rid of Walton (unfortunately) and bring in someone who LeBron actually respects (the selection pool for that has to be in the single digits). Good luck LA!"

"&gt; LeBron has a business interest in Klutch.   I hope he doesn't. If he does, or suddenly gets one out of nowhere, he'll be in trouble. It's not just unethical, it'd be illegal.

Of course, he can join Klutch after retiring, or become a shareholder.  &gt;Will he be an official player agent? nope. will he be recruiting guys and making calls? for sure.  Will he? I have my doubts. Pick up the phone once and call some kid ""hey sign with my agency"" while being retired? That simply wont' work for any meaningful amount of time.   &gt; I think that will help them sign players, guys that have idolized LBJ their whole life? yes.  Nah. Just not how things work. There's a reason why, say, the Jorge Mendes cited in the thread tittle wasn't some famous former player, why top agents across all sports aren't famous former players. People think it's just about the hype and intangible stuff like ""clout""; it isn't. That doesn't last. Ask David Falk, Jordan's agent.   If LeBron James shows himself to be a good sports agent, sure. How likely is that though? And how likely is that he's willing to put the work?  The idea that he can ride his playing career to be a successful sports agent is delusional. Sort of thing teens believe.  "
"Footwork, Derozan, Durant.   One of the most impressive things is Steph Curry’s off ball movement. The way he floats and always gets into passing lanes for his shot is just fucking magic. Honorable mention to JJ Redick.   Lebron’s court awareness, he knows damn near every angle necessary to get himself where he likes to score.    James Harden mastery of the pick n roll. He’s up there with Nash, Lebron, but it’s damn amazing how one of the most simple plays in basketball he’s made an entire championship offense lol.   "
"Lebron is flat out the better player. he's ahead of bird in almost every statistical category and has longevity and peak too. Bird also actually had some pretty bad playoff series' as well that he doesn't get flak for because he's still a champion and clutch  Granted, I didn't watch Bird but looking at per game metrics and advanced metrics, there isn't an argument for Bird at all.    https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1_select=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Larry+Bird&amp;player_id2_select=Larry+Bird&amp;player_id2=birdla01&amp;idx=players"
lmao -24 i'm guessing nobody understood the reference (brandon jennings said this when asked how the bucks were gonna do against the lebron james heat in the first round of the playoffs. jennings simply replied 'bucks in 6')   guess your flair didn't help
"IDK if Lebron is the better passer... Bird was just as magical as James, but with less spacing than in today's NBA (aka tougher passing lanes)  Defense is Lebron and its not close, though."
Pelicans should do this for the remainder of the soft games. But take the marquee games as fines - No AD vs James Harden for you! No AD vs LeBron for none of you!
"&gt; It's deeply insulting to say that the Pelicans are only staying alive as a franchise because of AD.  Didn't say that.   &gt; I don't see the Cleveland Cavaliers folding because they don't have LeBron James anymore - keep in mind that they didn't get anything for him.  Dan Gilbert isn't likely to sell the team and Cleveland has had inept sports teams for decades; they're used to it.  &gt; The Charlotte Hornets are doing just fine without a marketable superstar.  I don't even know what to say to this. They have a prime free agent target coming up this year that's going to get a max (that he deserves).  Phoenix is a beloved franchise with a lot of support from the city. The owner threatened to move them earlier this year if he didn't get funding and the city basically immediately responded.  New Orleans definitely isn't a basketball town, and Pelicans ownership are football people that just happened to inherit the team. They've no personal investment in the sport or franchise beyond however significant they view the inheritance.  &gt; I don't think anyone wants to see that, especially the people going to Pelicans games for the rest of the season.  I think New Orleans fans would rather know that their team has a future than see AD play 25 games that don't mean anything.  &gt; Teams are forced to make sub-optimal choices like this all the time.  **Where? When?**  Show me the precedent for this. Show me where the league has forced a team to risk compromising their future.  And again, the 'for the fans' angle doesn't work. It's in the NOLA fans' best interests that AD is guaranteed healthy in July.   They want to lose, and, more importantly, they need to convert him into (young) value."
"I've understood that Pat Riley and Lebron James didn't really have a great relationship after he left, though. I think James left the fans in good terms, but not that much the team."
"You act like it's a bad thing when players want to leave to win. As if the goal is to keep players in a city where they don't want to live and play. As if the goal is to restrict players' freedom.  There are already mechanisms in place to give players incentives to stay where they are drafted. Further, revenue sharing and the luxury tax take money from big markets and gives it to small markets.   Also, for your plan to have a tangible impact in terms of helping prop up small market teams, they would have to be the only ones taking full advantage of the system. They would not be. Small market teams tend to spend the least on scouting, player development and their front office in general. Big market teams tend to be the ones who have the money to spend on things like that. Under your system, big market teams would develop their own talent and still be a huge magnet to free agents. Only under your system, the big market teams would be able to spend more.  I think the system we have is already too restrictive when it comes to player movement. AD spent seven years at a trash organization with no direction, and under the salary cap system, there is no way he could be paid a fair market value, but even to maximize his earning potential, he would have to stay put with the trash ass Pelicans. He is forced to choose between maximizing his income and winning/happiness. That's already more than enough restriction.   I think players should be eligible for free agency at the end of year 5. MAYBE year 6. The Supermax hasn't proven to be effective at keeping players in place, so I think it should only be open to All NBA players with perhaps another criteria thrown in to keep it rare, and it should have nothing to do with re-signing with the team that drafted them. Lebron James has no chance at a Supermax, while KAT could sign one. That's not right. "
Lebron James DNP - OLD
"You dont  have to even do that. Not every great pkayer today is Lebron James in the muscle department. The argument for 2nd best player in the world is between a seven foot stick and a 6'3"" guy who can barely dunk. You can just say, imagine if a player as smart, skilled, and mobile at 6'10""...with toughness and a shot wet as silk...with passing that honestly might outclass Lebron James....what if he played today. That's Larry Bird. And he'd be in the Congo for best player in the world. "
"&gt; Question is, was this at the direction of LeBron James?   I doubt Paul doesn't wipe his ass unless he has LeBron's permission. "
"When LeBron James is involved, there is no limit to what can be accomplished."
"Somehow, LeBron James is on the worst team in California and in danger of missing the playoffs. Courtesy of your Sacramento Kings."
"That defense is hot garbage. Coaches would run you out on a rail if your help was consistently that lazy.  You can literally run your 4 offensive guys above the three point line and by rule all 4 help defenders have to be above the freethrow line. Any time there is a packed paint it's because the offense isn't spacing, by choice. Hard doubling wasn't illegal (unless they don't have the ball), it's the soft doubles/hedges that are illegal. Look how many times there is a help defender nearby that doesn't move off his man at all. Today you'd have him slide down to dig when Jordan goes into a move and have the weak side slide over for help. I didn't say today's rules let you have more hand contact. They don't. But look at all the contact Jordan faces, people look scared to contest his shots. Jordan had a rep for going to the line every time you breathed on him, maybe they're just playing scared.  https://youtu.be/AcRsvXpC5gM?t=39  Completely illegal defense in the 90's. I literally just grabbed the first hit on youtube and it's only a few plays in. If you can't see how different these defenses are, by rule, I don't know what to tell you. The Spurs will constantly go in and out of what is illegal defense in the 90s because that's the base way to play a superstar like Lebron James now. If you wanted Jordan to go 1v1 versus a defender you think he can beat, you clear out and let him do that. If you want James to go 1v1 versus a defender you think he can beat, tough luck they can have a second defender on the strong side anyway.  The actual level of defense isn't important, look at how they're coached. It's a massive change. The reason everyone tries to go to defensive personnel that are long and can switch everything isn't as much an adjustment to offensive changes as it is an adjustment to the defensive rule changes that allow you to much more easily play in space rather than get tied down to your man."
"Lebron James will be known as a villain more than a hero by the time be retires. Why? He left Cleveland (the first time) to chase rings, and essentially gave the city a middle finger by announcing it on national tv.  He came back to Cleveland with an air of superiority and essentially manipulated the front office to make Lebron friendly moves.  He left Cleveland again, but because of his influence on the FO, they've been in shambles.  He is constantly using his status to undermine his teams staff. He shows little regard for his teammates by using them as bargaining chips to get stars to join him.  Lebron is an amazing player, but also incredibly selfish."
Not when you factor in the playoff Lebron + Rondo buff and the playoff James Harden debuff
"just name a guy, however long it took.   Blake Griffin was the beneficiary of a bullshit trade. Anddddd that's it.   Lebron carried a skeleton, same with dwight   OF the stars who went #1. No one got help. They either were too good to get a decent draft pick to pair (not that is a guarantee) or too bad no one wanted to join esp. if they a small market.   Derrick Rose had a dece team. But no one joined him for some reason. Same with Kyrie. Took 3 first overalls, and king james to return to home to get him help.   Why isnt anyone jumping at a chance to play with KAT or John Wall?  Why didn't no UFA go play with john wall. Why was Iverson the only cat?  Chris Webber seemeed to never get help wherever he went. Yao made it past the first round what once?"
"*Anthony Davis: Josef Stalin*  Can't read (his contract)  *John Wall: Robert Mugabe*  Ruined the economy of a capitol (team) for the foreseeable future  *Brook Lopez/Robin Lopez: Saddam Hussein*  Because they all have body doubles  *LeBron James: Ho Chi Minh*  For, against long odds, defeating a superpower (2016)  *Kelly Olynyk: Idi Amin*  The latter liked to cut off dissidents' arms and sew them where their legs used to be; the former also likes to try to tear off arms.  *Stephen Curry: Pol Pot*  The latter committed genocide; who knows how many the former has killed shooting for charity?  *Enes Kanter: not Recep Tayyip Erdoğan*"
See I don't get how he was undeniably better than Curry in 2015. Or Durant and Kawhi in 2017 based on performance in that year specifically.  He is the default best player in a overall sense because he is Lebron James.
"Leaning back on lavar as a proxy to criticize lonzo - completely irrelevant of course to his actual ability. Give it a rest.  I don't like win shares as a stat as it's not a particularly good one and has been shown up a lot in the modern NBA era (same goes with PER), and even then Lonzo is quite a way ahead of DSJ in that stat.  BPM has Lonzo substantially ahead as does RPM. Both factor in on/off as part of their formulas. Both have Lonzo making a positive impact on the court, albeit marginal. DSJ is nowhere near doing that in any stat and the eye test backs it up. Dumb comparison and you shouldn't have made it.  The idea you have that he's useless without the ball in his hands shows you up big time in not actually watching him on a regular basis - he's not a ball dominant player at all (the opposite is true actually) and actually leads the Lakers in screen assists as a point guard, clearly demonstrating his importance off ball to the team.  Read this write-up for a better expressed version of this viewpoint: https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2018/12/10/18129849/lonzo-ball-positive-impact-la-lakers-subtle-stats-analysis-lebron-james-luke-walton-tyson-chandler  No one is saying Lonzo is not frustrating as hell to watch at times. He could be so, so much better than he is with just minor improvements to his scoring arsenal. The objection I have is people calling him trash when they never actually watch him enough to make a reasoned judgement.   "
"It's deeply insulting to say that the Pelicans are only staying alive as a franchise because of AD. A team is not a single player. I don't see the Cleveland Cavaliers folding because they don't have LeBron James anymore - keep in mind that they didn't get anything for him. The Charlotte Hornets are doing just fine without a marketable superstar. The Pheonix Suns have been a mess for years in a small market and they're not going anywhere anytime soon. The Pelicans themselves survived the CP3 saga years before AD was on the map. Grow up. The Pelicans are going to survive whether they get anything for AD or not. But the NBA sure as shit doesn't want to see a team not playing their best player for months just because they don't want to lose potential trade value. I don't think anyone wants to see that, especially the people going to Pelicans games for the rest of the season.   If the Pels want to wait for a better deal, they take the risk of injury. Teams are forced to make sub-optimal choices like this all the time. They don't get to have their cake and eat it too while fans get left in the lurch."
"The league is protecting its superstars. If lebron wasn't on the team there would be no lakers buzz and it would just the young team-building mob like last year. As for ""multi-billionaire dollar businesseses"", these operations are dependent on the superstars in this league including Kyrie, Embiid, James etc. The league has every right to step in to protect its league where owners in small markets stand to gain shitload of profit in future sales (just check the new valuations of teams in the past few years)."
"I'll just quote from Rich Paul's Wiki. Fuck it.  &lt; Paul used to live in a one-bedroom apartment above his father's store, R &amp; J Confectionary, on 125th and Arlington in Glenville, a neighborhood on the east side of Cleveland. He went to Benedictine, a Roman Catholic high school across the town. His father died of cancer in 1999.  &gt; After graduating high school, Paul was buying throwback jerseys from Atlanta and selling them out of his trunk in Cleveland. In 2002, he met LeBron James at the Akron-Canton Airport, where James was impressed by Paul's authentic Warren Moon throwback jersey. The two exchanged contact information, and soon Paul had sold James a Magic Johnson Lakers jersey and a Joe Namath Rams uniform.  &gt;In 2003, after the NBA draft, LeBron hired Paul to be a part of his small inner circle. He would later start working under Leon Rose, who had negotiated LeBron's extension with the Cavaliers in 2006, at Creative Artists Agency. In 2012, Paul left Rose and CAA to start his own agency, Klutch Sports Group, and took LeBron with him.  LeBron in a stroke of genius created his own talent agency. As I said, Lebron is essentially Rich Paul."

"Use the same mind control technique they used on Davis on the Pelicans FO. Cause in case you guys didn’t know, AD doesn’t really want to go to LA, he was just coerced by masterminds Rich Paul and LeBron James "
"Adam silver, anthony davis, rich paul and LeBron james have showed how pathetic and petty they are, as much as I hate the warriors I fucking love them beating bron's bitch ass year after year."
"how can you possibly predict that especially with the amount of potential and flashes they've shown, the reason he was comfortable offering it was because he's got LeBron James on his team and had a chance to get Anthony Davis to pair with him of course he's going to put them on the block"
“I am the East” - LeBron James
"Stats are aids. Eye test means 100x more.  Ben Simmons is overrated.  No team will ""beat"" the warriors unfortunately. They will just fall apart because of internal strife.  LeBron going to LA is him admitting that he doesn't have it in the tank to catch up to Jordan.  Kobe is worth including in the goat discussion. But Kareem, olajuwon don't get included enough.  We should be more impressed with wilt.  Everyone is defending James harden incorrectly. They aren't fouling him hard enough."
Imagine leaving Williams for Lebron James
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2310617-lebron-james-gets-warm-reception-in-1st-game-back-in-miami  &gt; There were some boos mixed in with the cheers during pregame introductions, but for the most part, Heat fans showed their former player some love. After all, James did lead the Heat to four consecutive NBA Finals appearances and two championships."
"They would see that if Lebron James isn't safe then their ass could get traded to if they go to the Lakers before they win a championship. Also, considering going to the Knicks is different than actually going to the Knicks. The last all star to go to the Knicks through FA was like Stoudemire. For all we know the upcoming free agents could be using it as leverage to get the most amount of money for their next contract. "
Do some research on Skip. His career is much more extensive than LeBron James.
Game-tying/go-ahead field goals with under 10 seconds left in the postseason:  Michael Jordan: 7/15 (47%) Kobe Bryant: 5/22 (23%) LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)
Rich Paul called the league office complaining about this possibility BEFORE the trade deadline. Important to remember and factor that in. Lebron &amp; Rich tried REALLY hard to force the trade to the Lakers and guess what. They failed. And in doing so they forced Davis onto the court for the last 27 games. If he gets seriously hurt now Rich Paul cost his client Anthony Davis a ton of money so he could try to team him up with his his #1 BFF LeBron James.  Think about how that works.
Perhaps the answer is one of your counter-examples.  Do Miami fans hate LeBron James?   I don't think Utah fans hate Karl Malone or Sonic fans hate Gary Payton for trying to chase that ring.  
Vince Carter and the Raptors  Kevin Durant and OKC  LeBron James and the Cavs 
Definitely a better coach than LeBron. A better GM than James though? Nah.
"For 'who's having the ball in his hands the longest' only, Fansided or their stat guys actually have that collected. The most recent one is for the 2015-16 season. Westbrook was 4th league wide with 23.4%. LeBron James had 14.2%. Kevin Durant 9.5%. Obviously, no stat for Michael Jordan.  https://fansided.com/stats/true-usage/"
"Man this ""entitled"" shit is ridiculous.  We felt *excited* when we learned he wanted to be traded to us.  We felt upset when we met the Pelican front office's expectations of giving them our absolute best offer, only for their ownership to step in and veto the trade, thus stopping us from getting AD, and having a negative effect on our front office.  We felt attacked on /r/NBA seeing 29 other fanbases calling all our players trash, and acting like we're delusional for thinking we might get another star to pair with LeBron even though several stars have expressly stated that they'd like to play with LeBron James in Los Angeles.  I don't see how it's ""entitled"" thinking to hope your team could trade good assets for a good player. Hopeful, yes, but not ""entitled""."
"~~Kevin Durant's~~ LeBron James' rings are COMPLETELY worthless. He gets no credit. None. What's more, he should be ashamed, to this day, of joining the ~~Warriors~~ Heat. It showed a lack of dignity and integrity. Not just as a player, but as a person.  - 99% of fans 10 years ago when LeBron joined Miami. "
It's been almost 5 years since the last time anybody could doubt either Lebron James or the Warriors. I'm at a point where I wait until it happens and so are a lot of the talking heads.
"Bradley Beal  KAT   Davin Booker  James Harden (underrated one)  People are saying LeBron but Idk, if the Lakers keep fucking it up trades and teambuilding maybe, but It would take more serious fights for him to do such a thing, and I don't think he's asking for a trade on 2020-21, it would gut the team he's going too much, he would rather just go for that team on 2021-22 (player option)."
"About the 2008 Olympic Team  &gt; There was speculation about how Bryant would mesh with other players. ""The talk was always gonna be between LeBron and Kobe?"" Jason Kidd, the team's lone 30-something-year-old, says. ""Can they get along? Can the two alpha dogs coexist?""  &gt; Bryant was a bit polarizing at first. ""In some ways, he was a little bit of a loner,"" Colangelo says. ""People didn't really have a good read on him. People looked at him in a particular way and just kinda put him in a box.""  &gt; What helped bridge the gap between Bryant and his teammates was proximity. ""In that time, we were all...in the same hotel, generally the same schedules,"" Bryant says. ""That's when I got to know guys a little bit more."" Bryant woke up early to practice. And other players soon followed suit, waking up early with Bryant, adjusting to his schedule.  &gt; Wade was the first player to join. ""He met me in the gym at five, and then LeBron started showing up at five, and then they all started showing up at five. And then next thing you know, most of the guys were in the gym at five getting some work in,"" Bryant says.  &gt; When it came time to play in Beijing, Bryant set the tone for Team USA early. In one of the early games against Spain, he traced Rudy Fernandez's route to behind the three-point line and noticed Pau Gasol planted in his path, setting a screen. Gasol had recently been traded to the Lakers, and he and Bryant had reached the NBA Finals that season. While this was just a preliminary-round game, Bryant delivered a message nonetheless. He sent it with his shoulder, sending Gasol sprawling onto the court.  &gt; ""He knows me, man,"" Bryant says. ""I don't play, and for us, it was important to send that message, too. We had just come off losing to the Celtics, and I wanted to send Pau a message as well in, 'This is what you have to be willing to do in order to win titles.' So, it was kind of a dual message, one for our team and USA and winning this game, winning this medal, but also for Pau in understanding this is the line that you have to cross in order to be a champion.""  &gt; For LeBron James, the sequence became one of his all-time favorite exhibits of Bryant's competitiveness.  &gt; ""It was one of the first plays of the game,"" James told Cleveland.com in 2015. ""I was like, 'This guy's all about winning and whoever he's playing for or who he's playing with at that point in time.' He really forgot Pau was his teammate. Like, he really forgot that he was about to see him in like three weeks in L.A. I swear. It was crazy.""  &gt; ""I think for LeBron, he benefited from Kobe, and I think vice versa,"" Kidd says. ""I think you can look at Kobe and everybody got better, everybody had great years that following year. 'Melo, Chris Paul, those guys got better seeing Kobe in that light, and LeBron.""   The #KobeSystem is real."
"I don't think I've seen a worse take on this sub, just because the NFL treats their players like complete dogshit in comparison doesn't mean the NBA players have way more control. AD was drafted in 2012, he had no say in where he'd spend the next 7 years of his career and wasted them in an incompetent franchise. Lebron James the arguable GOAT had his talent wasted on an even more incompetent franchise; front offices and shit GMs need to be held more accountable.  "
he avging 27/8/7 he is also lebron james
yes he and lebron james have the highest bbiq but what im trying to say is that having bbiq doesnt mean it automatically translates into being a good coach. sometimes managing egos and making everyone happy with their minutes and having people buy in is more important then just having great bbIQ.   I think he is a mastermind and actually my favorite player when it comes to assisting. 
"Lebron ""Mourinho"" James."
Kemba said he wants to stay in Charlotte. That's cool. None of that means he wasn't set to be traded to the Cavs if LeBron had stayed in Cleveland.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2801168-nba-trade-rumors-cavs-would-have-traded-for-kemba-walker-if-lebron-james-stayed.am  Charlotte is clearly a team with no championship hopes and after they re-sign Walker this offseason they'll have a few more seasons with first MAYBE second round exits and then Kemba will be traded to a different team because Charlotte will want to rebuild and Kemba will want a chance to actually win a championship during his career. 
"Question is, was this at the direction of LeBron James? And if so, did LeBron collude with the NBA to get Anthony Davis traded?"
Lebron James
"Yea, he said ""not scared of."" That indicates he thinks LeBron is legit scared of playing the warriors, which I think is pretty accurate, and not scared of teams in general because he is LeBron fricken james.  Just cuz Lebon isn't scared doesn't mean his team is favored or will win.  I guarantee you he wasn't scared of almost any team he played since leaving Cleveland the first time...maybe the spurs (he clearly respects pop a lot) and warriors and that is it.  "
"AD has been with the Pelicans for 7 years. He's been to the playoffs **twice**. During this time the Pelicans have a win percentage of \~.450. Unless AD is retarded, at some point he must have realized that there was a very real possibility that he'd waste his entire career with a shitty organization. So, why would it take LeBron James and Rich Paul to convince him not to re-sign with NO?"
"Did you just start watching basketball this morning?  LeBron, just last season at age 33 (he is right on the cusp of exiting his already insane prime), hoisted 10 corpses wearing Cavs uniforms up onto on his back through the entire Eastern Conference, getting taken to 7 games twice (Pacers and Celtics).      LeBron James literally just wins your team like 10 extra basketball games when he pours red wine on his cereal in the morning."

"Lol. The Lakers have no offensive problems when they Lebron James. Hell, they have Rondo too. The Lakers problems are all defense. If you noticed last night, mid-way through the 2nd quarter, the Lakers went on that run to get back in the game because Lebron was playing center. Javale/Tyson were out. Suddenly, the Celtics couldn't get wide open 3s putting the Lakers bigs in the pick and roll."
LeBron James 
"I think you and I are looking at this from two different angles but from the same spot.   What we both think:  1. A Lebron led Lakers 2019 team, in the Western Conference, has the POSSIBILITY, to upset any team besides the Warriors.  2. A Lebron led Lakers 2019 team, in the Western Conference, is VERY VERY VERY VERY unlikely to make it past the 1st round.    The same way where Lebron beat the Celtics in game 7 last year, we now just say: Yeah, but its Lebron James, of course he got to the finals."
"They’re only 3 games back of the 7th seed, have LeBron James and we’re the 4th seed before LeBron went out "
"Wall had a legitimate case for being a top 10-15 player in 2016-2017, as well as being maybe the best Eastern player in the playoffs in 2017 not named LeBron James(in terms of performance). If he wasn't a superstar that year, he was damn close."
"Absolutely no one is saying that its going to be a cakewalk.   The only thing that people are saying is that its fucking Lebron James, and you shouldn't count Lebron upsetting any team other than the Warriors."
"Because he's the head coach of both Lebron James and the Los Angeles Lakers.   I don't think he's a bad coach. I think he's a very decent coach, who would be perfectly good for a team in the small market who's fighting for a playoff spot. But you get nitpicked for absolutely everything when it becomes Championships or Bust. "
“Lebron James has been listed as OUT tonight due to sleep paralysis”
I was JUST standing next to Lebron James in the hallway while he was wearing panties and rubbing bbq sauce all over his body. He joked his team the Los Angeles Lakers were having a sleepover and they were gonna have Chick Fil A nuggets to dip on his body. This business is insane...the team chemistry changed that fast.
"&gt;Politifact: Mostly True  &gt;Explanation: While James only appeared in 8 straight finals, he was on the Cavaliers, who had back-to-back MVP LeBron James on their roster, so James effectively owned the east despite losing in the second round  "
"Never once said anyone stopped Lebron buddy. You are putting words in my mouth. The point still remains despite your efforts. Lebron was scared of Kevin Durant and refused to guard him.   And we circle back to this lmao. I'm telling you, you Lebron fans have a mental illness. KD did exactly what Lebron did. But it's not Lebron and it hurts Lebron so therefore None of KDs rings count. If that's what you think then lebrons rings in Miami don't count. The fact that you idiots crucify KD so much when your father has done the same exact thing multiple times is just unreal to me and always has been unreal to me.   KD is already validated. Nobody has said that. Just blind   ass Lebron dick suckers who can't view anything without Lebron glasses on. I'm telling you something is wrong with you people.   Sit back and watch everything unfold and Kevin Durant will have more rings than Lebron James when it is all said and done. Can't wait to hear the excuses when that happens. "
"Because of the ability for an individual to impact the game greatly, usually teams with superstars are the top of the league. For example, Lebron James went from the Cavs to the Heat back to the Cavs, and each team he was on was one of the best in the east. It wasn't the Cavs or Heat that really did anything to change their position, it was mostly because talent moved around.   The Warriors happened to build and retain talent so they've been dominate for a while, but kevin Durant choosing to join them made them basically untouchable.   So I'd say it's much more dependent on the superstars and where they decide to go"
"Except, we lit you guys up when LeBron James went down on Christmas day. It just depends on which Lakers squad shows up for the post-season and whether we come in with injuries. "
"As someone who's relativity new to NBA, I have a few questions.  1. Which team is/was the best of all time in a single season?  2. Who's the better shooter out of Klay Thompson and Steph Curry? They both look amazing whenever I watch them  3. Did Lebron James not play a match recently because he was unhappy that he wasn't playing with the players he wanted to play with? (No idea if this is true, just read it in a few YouTube comments on a highlight video"
It’s almost comforting to know even Lebron James has insecurities. 
is VORP based on the roster of the specific team a player is on or an average league player? I refuse to believe James Harden is actually astronomically more valuable than Steph Curry or AD or Jokic or Giannis. Also where tf is LeBron
"🤦‍♂️  John Wall, when asked on the matter of LeBron James, #2 GOAT, current king of NBA, and brand ambassador  *""yea, I don't know the guy, he's just another player""* "
nah LeBron james &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
LeBron James has just walked into the Western conference wearing nothing but a towel. 
You do realize you are saying that Dončić is trash cuz trashy mavs team isn't in playoffs despite only beind 2 games behind a team with Lebron James while being literally our offence.
Or which coach will get fired next for losing to LeBron? Link is a pretty fun read analyzing just that. Still will be weird without him though.  [https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/11/17345170/lebron-james-history-coach-fired-dwane-casey](https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/11/17345170/lebron-james-history-coach-fired-dwane-casey)
"here is a quote from John Wall, speaking about LeBron James:   ""He's had a big impact, he's kind of just been a mentor to me and talking to me and me just getting opportunity to pick his brain about certain things.""  I'll take the literal words out of his mouth over your word"
"I don't agree that they did a poor job.  They're a small market club and they tried their best.   They brought in Jrue, and then gave him a max.  They took a swing on Cousins.  They tried bringing in younger complimentary guys like Mirotic and Randle.  What more do you want them to do?  Kevin Durant or Lebron James aren't signing with New Orleans.  And the team is never going to be bad enough to tank with Davis and Holiday - so they're not finding another superstar in the draft unless they get really lucky."
LeBron James is not wrong... because he now plays for a western conference team and not a team in the eastern conference. 
"Idk, have you seen what the Warriors have done to a good LeBron James team over the last 4 years?"
"""It's a beautiful night here in Milwaukee as the Bucks get set to take on the Denver Nuggets in Game 2 of the 2019 NBA Finals! It looked like everything went Milwaukee's way in game one, but here's the question - If the Bucks can win game 2 at home, how would it effect LeBron James' legacy? Would no change in his statistics or Finals record get him closer to the title of GOAT?"""
Lebron “Managing Loads” James
"I'm gonna bring this conspiracy theory up until someone agrees with me: Bron was never injured.   Wasn't there a post recently that showed all of LeBron's playoff runs combine for three additional seasons? The dude has seen serious miles without the traditional season breaks most players get.   If I'm LeBron, I know I'm not winning the title this year. But I can't totally mail it in, that would fuck my legacy up. I still need to put in a good showing, but if I'm thinking about winning another ring then I gotta get some goddamn rest this season. No point in burning through an early-30s year with reckless abandon when the chip is out of contention. A couple week break wouldn't wreck the season in terms of playoff position. Would you give it all and get a 4th seed, or play it smart and still make the playoffs anyway?   Honestly the 8th seed might be the best scenario for him. If the Warriors finish #1, he'll either beat The Warriors and have a legit shot to win another championship, or he'll lose like everyone else without having to spend multiple playoff series being LeBron ""Playoff LeBron"" James.   Did we see him get injured? We saw him land without player contact and gingerly grab his leg. Was that an injury? Maybe. How would we know the difference?  I'm convinced at least. Is it a rationalization that makes LeBron my dad still the all-powerful NBA god who will never get hurt or have anything bad happen to him? No. Why would you say that???"
"Yeah, your right, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry play in the East. Sorry, I forgot. "
"Knicks will definitely offer. They'll have a top 6 pick, there isn't much of a chance they get out of the bottom 2 after the Suns and Bulls got better at the deadline, add in DSJ and/or Knox. Value wise that is close to the Lakers offer. They would have about a 28% chance of it being top 2 which is Zion or Barrett, a 68% chance it is top 4 which is Morant or Reddish, and a guarantee they could get Little or Culver, it's a good draft to have that high of pick even with the new odds. That is close or better than the Lakers package.  And yeah opinions can change but with Kawhi it has always been where there is smoke there is fire. That was the case last year with his injury and trade demands. He has a very leaky and vocal camp, it's not unreasonable to think the top reporters would have a good idea what his intentions are. Here is another [article](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2784708-lakers-trade-rumors-kawhi-leonard-prefers-clippers-to-joining-lebron-james). It adds another reporters take that echos Shams and also adds a quote from Woj that he could look to avoid LA all together because of LeBron. Those aren't definite but when people with that many NBA connections are all saying the same thing there has to be an inkling of truth to it."
Wine Drunk is a show where NBA legends Lebron James and Gregg Popovich drink two bottles of expensive wine and discuss current events both inside the league and out. Make it happen Netflix.

"This narrative annoys me too, and I'm not even a Raptor fan. The entire list of teams *not* owned by Lebron James over the last decade is, what, two?"

"Unbelievable how uniformed you are: https://www.complex.com/sports/2016/10/lebron-james-motivation-beat-celtics-made-him-sign-miami-heat  &gt;	""I understood at that point in time that in order for me to compete for a championship and get to that next level, I had to figure out and get with some guys that could be on the same level as Paul, Ray, [Rajon] Rondo, KG, and those guys. I just didn't feel like ... to do it here, I was out calling guys in the summer time, trying to get guys to come here and guys just continued to decline offers from us.""  &gt;	""And then at that time we didn't even have any money to go get anybody. I knew personally that D Wade was a free agent, I knew Bosh was a free agent, I knew Amare [Stoudemire] was a free agent, I knew Carlos Boozer was a free agent, so I knew I had to try and get some guys to try and get Boston, man. That was my whole mindset.""  It literally couldn't be more clear."
&gt; The Celtics “winning culture” is ridiculously overrated. 1 title and 3 Finals appearances since the Challenger exploded. The Cavs are more decorated &gt;   Amazing. Say one nice thing about the pre- or post- Lebron James Cleveland Cavaliers.
"Dallas Mavericks point forward Luka Doncic talked about the differences between NBA and European basketball, his name being mentioned among “great players” by Lebron James, his disappointment with being snubbed from the All-Star Game, his new teammate Kristaps Porzingis and the dream of winning a ring.  Here’s what Doncic said in an interview with Spanish network Movistar+:On NBA/Europe:  “Here [in the NBA] its easier to score compared to Europe, of course. In Europe, the court is smaller and here there is the three seconds rule. I think it’s easier to score here.”"
I wonder how much of what happens in the world is related to Lebron James. It has to be close to 85%.  I like how he apparently tried to trade away his entire team and now he has to play with them the rest of the season. That sounds like fun.
"People view the triple-double as a useless statistic since, they argue, it's just a random benchmark. The thing is: they're right. How different is a 20/10/10 season from a 20/9.5/9.5 season? Not very, it's just 41 rebounds/assists over an 82 game season.  So I think the best way to look at Westbrook's statistical achievements is to lower the bar by about 20% and see how many other players have managed to leap over it. If it's a lot of players, then it's arguable that Westbrook is being overrated because ""triple-double"" sounds good. If he stands mostly alone, then he's rightly viewed as one of the most impressive players ever.  How many players have had 20/10/10 seasons? 2 players (Robertson, Westbrook) and 3 seasons between them.  Let's reduce rebs/assists by 10%. How many players have had 20/9/9 seasons? Still only 2 players, but now it's 6 total seasons (4 for Robertson). Wow, so far Westbrook's achievements are holding up.  How about 20/8/8 (20% reduction)? Now the list starts to expand. We get 6 players total and 12 seasons. Joining Westbrook and Robertson are: Michael Jordan (1 season), Wilt Chamberlain (1 season), James Harden (1 season), and LeBron James (2 seasons). Magic Johnson is also technically on this list, but he only played 37 games that season.  Let's do one more: 15/8/8. Even by dropping the points requirement by a full 25% we only add a single player and season: Ben Simmons' rookie year.  So, to conclude, even by dropping the statistical requirements by 20% (and 25% for points) we see that only 6 other players have managed to achieve anything close to what Westbrook is doing and 5/6 are all-time greats while the 6th is a 6'10"" PG whose career is just getting started.  tl;dr Westbrook is pretty fucking great."
"It's shitty.  Rockets fans feel the need to defend Harden from many of the asinine takes you see on this sub and elsewhere.  Then people bitch about fans defending their star player while turning a blind eye to the shallow digs on Harden in every post about him.   It's like this with other star players too, but I'm not sure anyone is as polarizing as James Harden other than Lebron."
LeBron James is 12-0 against the Atlanta Hawks in three playoff series. 
"&gt; but we as Hawks fans can speak better than any other fanbase on counting LeBron James out, for any reason.  Us Pacer fans would like a word.   "
"LeBron looked fucking gassed by the mid-fourth because of those minutes. He was also playing the five, right? So he was ""running"" full court each time? That game was so frustrating to watch. Too many times in the late fourth the Lakers broke from set too early and put up a rushed shot. Each time they did it LeBron had the most frustrated look on his face as he took five seconds to start running back on D. By the end of the fourth James had the body language of Paul Rudd picking up the plate in Wet Hot American Summer."
Zion's floor is blake griffin and his ceiling could be lebron james
i'd take LeBron James and 4 Los Angeles Lakers players to beat the Hawks in a one game before the all star break   
I’d take LeBron James and 4 redditors to beat the kings in a one game playoff qualifier 
No matter who I pick I’m dead. So let me die taking a charge from Lebron James
TRADE LEBRON JAMES FOR A BURRITO! 
"Definitely agree this team is garbage cause magic and pelinka made it garbage.   What did we get out of Russell, Randle, and Zubac? 16 mil cap space.  1 1st round pick (27th) Muscala Thats it.   Everyone spoke of how the lakers needed shooting before the season and it shows when the lakers have a bottom 10 offense with LeBron James."
Next on First Take: is LeBron James an alcoholic? 
I never understand the “you must be fun at parties” line  Do you go to parties and bring up Lebron James’ defence???   Is that what you consider to be fun at a party?  Such a shit response and only ever used when someone has nothing to say 
Just because Lebron made him and Bosh go stand in the corner doesn’t mean Love wasn’t a superstar. He averaged 26/12/4 the year before he teamed up with James. Only 6 players in the history of the NBA have ever done that and they’re all in the hall of fame.   He also had seasons of 26/13 and 20/15 in Minnesota. He was a beast.
"Also Rondo. Rondo ain't meme, but he can be stubborn hard ass who can completely check out. [Also an open Lebron hater in the past.](https://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/lebron-is-a-bitch-tshirt-rondo.jpg)  Chandler isn't a meme, but he was a freebie that James Jones gave to his boy Lebron. Lakers FO basically signed a meme crew in Javale/Lance/Rondo/Beasley that could blow up a locker room at any time."
"Lebron James is actually only 6' 7"" without shoes  https://www.nba.com/media/bulls/lottery_vitals_03.pdf  It hilarious how they try to say he is pushing 6'9"" LOL"
"well isn't that expected? it is the Hawks, and he is LeBron James."
"Nah, it's not.  &gt; LeBron James says his surreal streak of eight consecutive NBA Finals appearances means a lot to him, but he also knows it could very well come to an end this season.  &gt; I’m going to be as patient as I can be. I know I got a young squad, but these guys are willing to learn and I’m willing to learn with them.”  Like I said in my first post - Lebron knew since day 1 this was a throwaway year because he knew they were never going to win the Finals."
The Jazz don't have that LeBron James guy though lol.....
They have LeBron James now dude
"You're right about the east, but he also did it against the greatest western conference team of all time. Granted he had Kyrie to help him, but we as Hawks fans can speak better than any other fanbase on counting LeBron James out, for any reason. "
"You are again engaging in fantasy.  There is no way in the world to prove that another Super Star like James Harden, KD, or Steph could not have lead the Lakers to a 21-17 record.  I deal with reality.  And reality is Lebron either misses the playoffs entirely or gets destroyed in the 1st round. Either disqualifies him from being the best in the world."
"Harry Giles yelled, “There you go!” Buddy Hield gave a look of pleasant surprise. De'Aaron Fox belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Peja Stojakovic hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all ain't making the playoffs."""
"This is the funniest, stupidest argument to me lmao. Are you actually arguing that if Lebron scored fewer points, grabbed fewer rebounds, and dished out fewer assists, that it would help his team win? Do you believe that Lebron James having the ball less in the playoffs would help his team succeed?  If during the Boston or the Pacers series last year, Lebron had the ball less, would they have done better?"
Lebron and Andre Igoudala  JJ Redick and Ethan Hawke  Patty Mills and The Weeknd (didn't come up with this one)  James Harden and the Hotep from Dear White People AKA Trevor King (only some will get this)  Tobias Harris and J. Cole (got this one from Jalen Rose)  Steph Curry and Logic   Kyrie Irving and Idris Elba  Steven Adams and the guy who plays Aquaman
Who's better? Please don't tell me that James Harden is better than LeBron James.

This is the latest into a season that a LeBron James team has been without him for 18 games since his 12th year in 2014-15.

"He's talking about James Harden's finals loss, it was against Lebron"
"Tbf that phrase you said initially applies to every superstar in this league. If you have a superstar in his prime you can't wait to develop kids, you need talent to win right now, unless those kids are fucking amazing and contribute right out of the gate which pretty rarely happens.  James Jones proved to be a great vet in the Heat and I'm sure LeBron recommended him to the FO, he's one of those guys that's essential on the locker room and for the minimum you'll happily take that guy on your team to make your star happy. I guess this is the biggest move ""LeGM"" made in his GM career so far.  I agree with you there, he definitely has more to say than most players in this league, being the best player generally does that. If a franchise doesn't consult or ask for input to their star then they're doing everything wrong.   TT is a case of Rich Paul making a good job as an agent, league already investigated it and found out that Bron has nothing on Klutch. Obviously they're friends but if Rich was simply LeBron's friend he wouldn't have any players in the league apart from him and he has Ben Simmons, AD, Wall, Bledsoe, Morris twins, etc .  I mean, every player wants their team to be better, I don't think that's a reason to call him a GM. Do people call Kobe a GM for calling out the Lakers FO multiple times and requesting a trade for lack of talent around him? "
"LOL you’re the biggest lebron fanboy i’ve ever seen and that’s saying something. god forbid people slander lebron james, as if his dick doesn’t get sucked here enough. he’s not the goat and never will be. get over it "
"Griffin realized in order to win with LeBron would be to pull strings and find ways to get other great players.  LeBron literally took James Jones with him to the Cavs and there was no objection, although he’s just a locker-room glue guy and hardly playable at all. Then the strings to get Love after a high pick (Wiggins) etc.   LeBron has more of a say than most people in this league, and he can also use his “partner” Rich to set up some crazy things such as getting TT paid etc. to have the team together and whatnot.   LeGM is a joke, but at the same time he has a long history of doing similar things throughout his tenure, even with the heat. He acts shocked or as a very likable teammate even when he knows he’s slightly pressuring front offices for better players or coaches. "
"He would have to really ingratiate himself to a current ownership group and then they would sell it to him for below market value.  Same concept actually helped Jordan get into ownership - the previous Hornets owner, Bob Johnson, was the founder of BET.  When he sold, he wanted the NBA to still have a majority African-American owner.  Jordan still paid hundreds of millions, but my point is, ownership groups don't HAVE to sell to the highest bidder.  An owner could choose to sell to Lebron James someday for one billion even if the market value is, say, $1.2B because he values having Lebron as an owner in the league.\*  &amp;#x200B;  \*Admittedly, this scenario would've been more likely if Lebron had a great relationship with Dan Gilbert.  "
"Anthony Davis and LeBron James had dinner several times last year. LeBron James and Kevin Love had dinner this year  My question for you is, why did LeBron agree to give gut 76ers a meeting, if he was sure it was the Lakers? Why did it take the second or third day of free agency for the contract to be signed unlike countless other players who sign instantly at midnight?"
~~Details~~ Generalization by LeBron James
LEBRON JAMES only makes a 2-3 game difference for a team. Alright that's my cue to stop wasting time in this conversation. 
"It's a post on the internet, not a college paper. Either read it or don't.  Bledsoe held out until September 25 and Thompson held out until October 21 during their restricted free agency offseasons. Paul ended up getting them the deals they wanted so yes, he did his job. However, and most prominently in the Thompson deal, Tristan obviously shared the same agent as LeBron and the Cavs were constantly having to re-sign James to one-year deals, which was a smart move on his part to keep the Cavs from backing away from improving but you are also forcing the team to do as you wish or else you will leave. That's where the Tristan Thompson contract comes in. ""It'd be a shame if my client were to leave you again after this season if you don't take care of Thompson."" And so the Cavs are *forced* to sign a deal that was a bad contract before the ink had dried. This is not how you build good relationships but it's good for your client.  In Bledsoe's case, he just waited them out and the Suns eventually acquiesced. I felt it was a bit dirty, in that the tardiness of the entire process pulls more eyes toward this stalemate and is an attempt to get public sentiment on your side, and when you pull stunts like Paul did with these two players then I would imagine it's like salting the Earth for short-term gains and ignoring the long-term. There are only 30 franchises, after all, and they all talk to one another. You're going to have to deal with them in the future, and at some point you'll need to work in concert. Why kill all good rapport for just one client? It's not like Rich Paul is the only agent to pull this (David Falk, the '90s version of Paul, did this as well) but I'd say he's the only one to do this multiple times within a year or two. The AD situation was seen coming as soon as Davis changed agents. All of this was calculated, premeditated, and, apparently, quite unappreciated."
Here is the deleted list  Michael Jordan  Lebron James  Kobe Bryant  Larry BIRD  Kareem  Magic Johnson  Wilt Chamberlain  Bill Russell  Hakeem  Shaq  
"I hate this argument. Lebron has declined physically.  He can obviously do it with effort but it requires a lot more now because he’s 34.  I know bud, it hurts to see dad get old. I cant imagine a league without a Lebron James. I’ll be really emotional. It’ll be like when Kobe retired but 10x worse"
LeBron James and Magic Johnson hate the jive of these new kids 
"I guarantee you weren't alive back then.   Magic was still considered better at that time. Magic also had to leave the game in his prime due to HIV. And people would still talk about Kareem and Bird too. It wasn't until that second run of chips that MJ elevated to GOAT status.  That being said, it's some serious cognitive dissonance to try and shit on James Harden for not being Michael Jordan. You say MJ is the GOAT, then turn around and act like Harden is some scrub for not being MJ. Any other player you compare loses that comparison too, do they suck too? LeBron James and Steph Curry, are they trash too? Or does this only apply to Harden? "
Is that the only playoff series you've seen in your life? Even LeBron fucking James has an 8pt NBA Finals loss to his credit. 
"Introducing, number 123, LeBron James IV!!!"
"Also, if Kyrie keeps up those numbers for the season, he would join LeBron James (2013) and Larry Bird (1987) as the only players to average that volume on 50/40/90 efficiency"
"That's a No from me dawg.  We are witnessing the decline of Lebron James right before our eyes. His impact no longer matches his production. He is producing like normal, but that impact can no longer carry average teams to wins.  Stay woke people!"
"They brought in Lebron James. That’s a pretty good start. If you’re counting them out this summer, you’re crazy. They could sign another FA, trade for Davis, or both.  And by the way, they were playing pretty damn well when they were all healthy, let’s not forget about that."
"But that begs the question: why do his teams always slump and have this outward impression of disfunction at the halfway mark of every season? I think it has a lot to do with LeBron and his leadership style. Everyone always talks about how LeBron’s teammates are nowhere near Jordan &amp; Kareem’s (just look in this posts comments for proof), and it appears that James is very conscious of this and by the halfway mark of the season is disappointed/underwhelmed/whatever you want to call it by the quality of his team and pushes for his perceived “bad teammates” to be traded (see this years AD debacle for the young core, the Cavs “we need a point guard saga”, and im sure there are other strange trade rumors from years past i cant think of off the top). This is all to say: LeBron really pays a lot of attention to sports media derived narratives surrounding him. But then, the trade deadline happens. All the talking heads condemn Lebron’s FO and resign them to the fate of a lottery team/first round exit, and they become the written off underdogs. Thats where you see the late season turn around where LeBron actually assumes a true leadership role. Much of the volatility comes from LeBron himself, but he is also the real reason why his teams end up on a hot streak leading into the playoffs. Its the same every year, and i feel like i coulve written OP’s post almost word for word this past August. Long story short: Yes Lebron is to blame for midseason struggles, and yes he will be the reason they thrn themselves around and make the playoffs  /endrant   Feel free to tune in again next winter"
"&gt;  So how many teams built like the Lakers can actually still stay afloat with injuries to a player as impactful as LeBron.   This is why no one cares about Lakers/Lebron fans' injury excuses.  Because you have to add an additional qualifier (""built like the  Lakers"") so don't have to include actual good teams like Indiana or Toronto that don't go to complete shit when their best player is injured (or ""resting."")  Because we had to sit here all off-season and listen to delusional  LeBron/Lakers fans talking about how this team would be different from ""those trash Cavs teams that LeBron carried.""  Talking as if this was a legitimate team, downvoting anyone who'd suggest they weren't immediate threats to the Warriors and guaranteed home-court in the first round.  In the end, LeBron James has played in 3 more games than Victor Oladipo and 4 fewer games than Kawhi Leonard.  And yet the Lakers *with* LeBron so often end up looking like a clearly worse team than either of those teams without their best players.  Because the Lakers just ain't that good."
Yeah but it's LeBron James mah dude
I'm not convinced the Kings or Clippers will win more games from here on out than Lebron James. 
"Thunder couldn't handle Joe Ingles and Donovan Mitchell, I'm not keen on counting out Lebron James. "
Same with Lebron James
lebron def. had a say in those signings. all of them have shown in the past to not back down from james and rather but heads with him. he seems to love this and make him hard(his allstar teams are full of guys that openly dont wanna play with him btw)  the meme-team is certainly lebrons idea.

"Half a disappointing season and a trade for a bench player really solidified all that? Holy shit, y’all really blow stuff out of proportion. This season isn’t even over yet. They signed Lebron James. They got Zo, Kuz and Josh Hart in the same draft. They need to fill out this bench much better but for short notice this team isn’t absolutely terrible.   I just feel like Luke Walton is not the coach for this team. All is not lost, y’all just jump in at weak points. Lakers will win a few games and like you said, the circle jerk will go round. "

"Lebron believes the players deserve more power and agency. He has pushed that platform hard and campaigned for players to have the kind of power he has in regards to free agency and movement. When it comes to his own personal power, Lebron believes the most powerful players should be involved in constructing their own legacy, and his passive aggressive signals to his team’s front office have been legendary.

"Karl Malone's 37 included 3 seasons of college ball and real ""development"" years his first two in the league, plus he got to bang down in the post where strength and skill can overcome ability as you age.  Lebron James is passing guys in their 40s for minutes played and there's no more low post to go bang in for him, it's the ""no position"" era meaning he's going to be far less able to hide lack of mobility with vet-tricks and a power block game.  It's not just age it's miles also and Lebron James is going to be the youngest to 50,000 minutes, and if he were to somehow keep playing for 5 years he'd pass about Kareem in total minutes played.  Not going to happen when you can't sit on the block.  "

"I've seen some shit following LeBron, but Lakers fan base takes the cake. You know something, professional athletes aren't perfect. Shit, nobody is. LeBron James isn't perfect, but he doesn't deserve the utter disrespect from LA fans I've seen on their joke of a sub. Check it out, Bron hasn't played defense in several years, last year's Cavs were a train wreck on defense, but even at their worst, Cavs fans recognized the greatness of what Bron did, night in and night out and forgave a few miscues and exhausted rotations from the guy who's been to 8 straight Finals. Anyone with half a brain could see the Lakers blowing shot after shot, layups on a platter and wide open threes after perfect passes by LeBron all night. 28-12-16 and their sub can't stop talking about Kobe and how he wouldn't have blown that game. Even the worst LeBron haters around the league can give him respect for what he does on the basketball court, except LA, the land of toxic takes and extreme hyperbole. Frankly their fan base can suck my nuts, they don't deserve LeBron. "

No. What's the counter move to using the Warriors to catapult yourself to a free title? Carrying a LeBron James led Lakers team to a title after he couldn't. That's the ultimate reversal. 
Lebron james needs pat riley as a coach.

"This is one of the main reasons I'm big on trae, aside from the absurd passing skill. You can practice your shot. You can practice your handles. You can practice whatever skill you need to work on. But you can't practice or be taught the cajones to look Lebron James in the eye and say ""easy fucking money."" Kid has killer instinct."
"Maybe it's because he doesn't have an ISO game, he's not MJ or Kobe. That's not his game. If you play with LeBron, 9 times out of 10, someone else will be taking the shot and everyone will blame him for missing, when LeBron James probably had a better shot but passed it up because he's not that good of a shooter."
"What the fuck does that mean, ~~Kobe Bryant~~ LeBron James?"
I equate it to us just not being able to get through Lebron James led teams after he left Cleveland the first time. It just feels like he has our number every damn time. 
"Honestly, I don't think I even considered a Lebron James team not making the playoffs as a serious possibility. It just sucks that the Lakers team is so terrible that basketball fans may be robbed of playoffs Lebron James."
im talking shit to you and your shit team.   YOUR TEAM SUCKS WITH LEBRON JAMES    **COMPLETE FAILURES**
"&gt; I understood at that point in time that in order for me to compete for a championship and get to that next level, I had to figure out and get with some guys that could be on the same level as ~~Paul~~ Gordon, ~~Ray~~ Jayson, [~~Rajon~~ Jaylen] ~~Rondo~~ Brown, ~~KG~~ Big Al, and those guys. I just didn't feel like ... to do it here, I was out calling guys in the summer time, trying to get guys to come here and guys just continued to decline offers from us.  &gt; And then at that time we didn't even have any money to go get anybody. I knew personally that ~~D Wade~~ J Buckets was a free agent, I knew ~~Bosh~~ Harris was a free agent, I knew ~~Amare~~ JJ [~~Stoudemire~~Redick] was a free agent, so I knew I had to try and get some guys to try and get Boston, man. That was my whole mindset.  ~~LeBron James~~ Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid"
I honestly didn't mind LeBron leaving but if the Lakers can't build a fucking playoff team around LeBron James then they can get fucked and I wish them nothing but failure moving forward. 
"This was one of the most frustrating LeBron James games I've ever watched. Plenty of times he had Trae Young or another smaller guard on him on defense, and he kept passing it up.  I get wanting to get your team going, but it's halfway through the 4th quarter and it's clear nobody's having a good shooting night. TAKE THAT SHIT INSIDE. How the hell are you gonna let Trae Young guard you and not punish him for it. Jfc."

"What's crazy is that there's not an insignificant amount of Laker fans that would say LeBron.   Amongst current players though, it's hard to say because the Lakers just haven't been super relevant for the last few years. Maybe James Harden because he's getting a lot of Kobe comparisons lately and LA-HOU have had some chippy games this year."

"[Some explanations here](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2018/06/hoops-rumors-glossary-over-38-rule.html)  &gt;Finally, it’s worth noting that LeBron James and Chris Paul reportedly played major roles during the last CBA negotiations in having this rule changed from the Over-36 rule to the Over-38 rule. It’s probably no coincidence that both James and Paul head into the 2018 offseason at age 33 with the opportunity to sign five-year deals that would have been considered Over-36 contracts — the new Over-38 rule won’t interfere with those deals.

"lebron james actually got me into the nba that year.  his rookie year was phenomenal and all that was based on the foundation of so many people raving about his amazing posture in the league around pros.  he looked like he belonged and then some.  look at his debut vs. the kings.  lebron was beyond remarkable.  first sweep vs spurs finals, he had no right to be there at his age..."

"Since it doesn't take much digging, I only looked at the very first article in a google search for ""racist sports fan incidents in US"". The following happened same year as Adam Jones: Lebron James LA home had a racial slur spray painted on it. Kevin Sumlin (ex Texas A&amp;M coach now) received racist hate mail. Someone hung a dummy of Vontaze Burfict from a noose at Heinze Field in Pittsburgh. There are some others in there, these were the high profile fan incidents so that's why I only list them. All are acts of cowards, in my opinion, but do not make the city or the entire fanbase the same. Lebron plays in LA, so in some way of his thinking, he knows that one or more fans being absolute racist douchebags doesn't mean the city or state (or entire New England region) is."
"I fucking hate the Lakers, but I don't have much of a problem with this--fucking *LeBron James* plays for LAL, who are better than their record due to LBJ missing so much time."
This just in: LeBron James announces that he'll be taking his talents to South Africa Beach come 2020. 
"You how fucking dumb can you be? If anything ""29 teams are on my list"" is a fucking good thing because the celtics can outbid any team and the narrative before of he doesn't want to play for the celtics is offically dead. That's literally all people had left to sasy against boston was that he doesnt want to play there. Well looks like he does now. Fuckin choke on it. Have fun missing the playoffs for the 6th year in a row with lebron james on your team"
ok.. then James Harden is much better than LeBron at driving because he is a better passer while driving and better at drawing fouls.
"Yeah, think about it. He’s a 6’5 bearded motherfucker who’s slow as shit but weighs almost the same as Lebron. How the fuck would we expect a player like him to become fucking James Harden? He’s incredibly smart at using his talents (strength, agility, intellect) instead of running fast and jumping high. That’s why I root for James Harden: we’ll never see anyone else play like him. Also because I’m from Houston"
thisssss  i didn't really follow NBA but i was in highschool in 2004  lebron james was the sports story of 2003-04 and as a kid who wasnt into sports the fact i knew about him while being obsessed with halo 2 and socom 2 is wild lol  zion doesnt compare. not even close.
LeBron James? I'm the only Zion Williamson  -Zion
The last player to get as much hype as Zion was LeBron James.
"Bjelica won EuroLeague MVP before coming over to the states and he was 27 when he came over, right in his prime. He promptly became the 8th man in the Timberwolves rotation for a team that won 29 games.  He went from winning EuroLeague MVP in 14-15 to averaging 5.1 points per game off the bench for a shitty NBA team in 15-16.  Point being, it's never a given. There's no such thing as a ""dead give away."" Being the best player in Europe doesn't mean you're going to step in and be an elite NBA player, or even a good one. Bjelica is a prime example. He's having the best year of his NBA career right now averaging 9.9 points and 5.8 rebounds per game, which is solid but obviously not incredible, and it took him four years to get to that point.  Luka is very likely to succeed, as were LeBron James, Tim Duncan, KAT, Ewing, etc. and so many other ""sure thing"" top picks. But it's never a guarantee."
"I honestly think he will stick a round as long as he needs to possibly play with or against LeBron James Jr. Seems like he wants to do it. If his son makes it into the NBA, that is."

"You conveniently omit that Kyrie found out the cavs were shopping him, and that precipitated his trade request.   &gt; For many, the swap from the Cavaliers to the Celtics last August was vexing. Irving was a champion on a contending franchise with a transcendent star, LeBron James. Who walks away from that?  &gt; What they didn't know was Cleveland had explored trading Kyrie in June, long before he asked out, a fact conveniently omitted when word of his demand leaked. Irving made the decision to remain silent while the details of his request were, in his word, ""distorted.""  &gt; ""I didn't feel the need to say anything because I knew the truth, and so did they,"" he says. ""So it didn't matter what others said.""  &gt; Still, for a split second, Irving winces, as though someone has pricked him with a pin.  &gt; ""They didn't want me there,"" he says.  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21941260/nba-playing-lebron-winning-nba-title-kyrie-irving-decided-move-question-why"
no it wouldn't because he'd have LeBron James on his team
"This isn't quite accurate. Kyrie was traded somewhere he never requested.

Same with Wolves and KAT, and Spurs and Kawhi (lol although in retrospect a Kyrie for Kawhi swap might have been a good idea).   https://www.forbes.com/sites/mitchlawrence/2017/07/22/kyrie-irvings-4-team-wish-list-whos-got-the-best-shot/#319895597404  Boston offered up their best player at the time in Thomas and an unprotected 2018 pick (ended up being 8th).  While Thomas ended up not helping the Cavs, it still seemed likely their best offer at the time. I think the reasoning was that if Thomas could return to form after the hip injury he could help them ""win now""."

LeBron James.  Prime LeBron would easily average 45 a game in today's NBA

3 1st overalls in 4 years... lebron james...
"""LeBron James behind Steph""  ""#WASSUP LEBRON""  Lmao"
"I dunno. Giannis isn't just worse numbers, and his argument isn't just that he deserves an MVP/nobody wants Harden to have another.   1. He's the basis for the Bucks entire system, which has produced the best team in the league, beating other contenders consistently, and putting up #2 offense/top 10 defense. It's not just that he's ON that team, it's that he's their best player by a huge margin and that their offense &amp; defensive schemes depend on him.   2. It does actually matter that Giannis is doing everything on the court with crazy rebounding, 6 assists per game and very very good defense.   3. Voters don't behave like r/nba and Giannis being the favorite has less to do with bias against Harden than bias against worse teams. The #1 seed wins the MVP race like 90% of the time  I dunno, personally I would vote for Giannis not because I hate Harden's playstyle (I do) but because I think that making a solid team amazing is so fucking valuable.  The team is perfectly built around him, but that's the thing, he's the type of player that you can build perfectly around. If adding Brook Lopez means your team suddenly can become a top 2 offense, it means you're building around either Giannis or LeBron James.   also, I think voters should be consistent. If Kobe loses to Nash, Harden loses to Giannis. At least that way we can have fair races where we know what to expect and we know how to value an MVP award. "
watch lebron james after allstar break...
&gt;Look at where the team was when he took over and where it is now  A sub .500 team at the All-Star Break that just lost to the Atlanta Hawks even though they have LeBron James on the roster?
"It wasn't the best trade but it's worked out for both teams. We got Kuzma and two max slots out of it.  I'm not really sure what the rest of this argument is. In his three years he's taken the Lakers from the basement to a promising future. We have cap space, all are future picks, young good players and LeBron James. You might not think Magic has been a top executive, but he definitely hasn't been bad."
Let's just say it takes a special kind of team to add Lebron James and still end up below. 500 
LeBron James
That young Lakers core is barely .500 with Lebron James on the team. That’s how garbage Time those players are.  
Like I said you can remind me when the Celts are on top at the end of the year otherwise they are a failure.  I won't give a shit enough to contact you though i really don't give a shit about the celts as much as you seem to about the Lakers.  We will be fine we have Lebron James (and maybe Kyrie too!)
Old ass Lebron James and no one else? That’s not a good team. 
"It helps a lot that at least one of Curry or Klay has been in every dunk contest since 2012. A not insignificant reason for the decline of the Dunk contest is that Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, Russel Westbrook, and a few other very noteworthy names never competed in it.   It also helps that it's a skill that ages more slowly than the athleticism required for competing dunk contest, so all three could enter if they chose for more years. Even if he finally wanted to, Lebron couldn't reasonably enter the dunk contest when he turns 40 like Dirk "
"Bro we lost Lebron for 18 games the Lakers won more games without him than the Cavs or Heat ever did without him.  And it wasn't just one guy it was losing key players like Rondo and Lonzo (our playmakers and true PGs).  It wasn't just losing one guy and when it was one guy it was Lebron James he isn't just ""a guy"".  C'mon do you even understand basketball?"
BREAKING NEWS: LeBron James called Ray Allen during halftime.
"As a Lebron James fan, seeing him at number 10 feels disrespectful. But I would agree. Except I’d move him to 9 and Blake Griffin down to 10. Griffin is playing his best basketball but it’s still nothing close to Lebron Ball... that being said, the fact that there’s 8 players more deserving of MVP this season is impressive."

Lebron james
Just like the lakers were going to sign big free agents this past summer?  There's nothing to be delusional about regarding the Celtics.  They're 4th in the east and their injured free agent signing is finally starting to string together solid performances.  Lakers on the other hand got rejected and their free agent aspirations and are going to miss the playoffs AGAIN but this time with Lebron James on their roster. How do you not at least grab a 5th or 6th seed with Lebron James on your roster. Is your front office that inept? Or are your players just that bad?

"Really? Because it’s not new. And not a narrative. It’s pretty self-evident.     If you’re playing single coverage against a guy who demands doubles, you’re going to get scored on more often.    If basketball games were decided by a single possession, then this would not be a viable strategy.   But, as I’m sure you’re aware, basketball games are 48 minutes long, and if you’ve determined that allowing LeBron James to score rather than drive and kick to deadly shooters will result in less points per possession for the other team, well, then you do that,     You can get semantic with it and ask that I use a term other than “artificially inflating”, but if you disagree with the core concept, I’m not sure you’ve been paying attention to the last 4 finals.      For what it’s worth, I’d say the same about KD’s final numbers. Cavs focused their attention on Curry, freeing up Durant to feast on single coverage when there are few contexts where that should be a part of your game plan.   I welcome a counter argument.   But I was so long-winded here that it might be hard to repeat your performance of cherry-picking a quote to make me sound like a hater "
"I’m jealous of people who were alive to watch Jordan and now can watch LeBron and can give an informed take on who they think is better, I personally can’t even picture in my head a player better than LeBron James at basketball but by all accounts Jordan was insane and I’m sad I didn’t get to see him and therefore can’t really weigh in on that conversation as well as people who got to see both.

Lebron James shoots with the wrong hand too. I'm going to guess he does it because Lebron does it. 
"How many playoff appearances? How many winning seasons? People like to shit on the sixers for the process but at the very least they came out of it in less time then the Lakers ongoing rebuild with way better results. Even all that tanking the Lakers did is for not as they are trying to sign guys based on the fact that they are the Lakers; not that they are championship contenders, not that they have good culture. Heck take a look at the mavericks in theory the Lakers should have 10 times their talent after all that tanking and they have Lebron fucking James and all that has translated into is 2 more wins at the all star break?!? Those pieces are real valuable, right?"

"&gt;Or maybe people discredit Rich Paul, b/c his success is almost 100% been made on the back of Lebron James.  This is just so false and it's exactly what he's talking about. Apparently no one can be successful unless they have zero friends and don't talk to anyone."
Somebody at the top secret Biorobotics company is going to be fired for not accounting for this in the Lebron James v1.0™ source code.
"Or maybe people discredit Rich Paul, b/c his success is almost 100% been made on the back of Lebron James. Just throwing out 'they don't like Rich b/c he's African American' when there's no actual proof of that is a monumental stretch. "
Have you ever heard of this guy named Lebron James? It was known what he would be while he was still a junior in high school. Not even a huge Lebron fan but he was a sure thing no doubt. I get the point you’re making that’s it’s very very rare but you said no one ever and that’s just not true 
"Wow it's almost like you read the article  &gt;Were Johnson and LeBron so eager to expedite the rebuilding process in L.A. that they ordered the pre-emptive strike without thinking through the potential ramifications?  &gt;A people-pleaser at heart, maybe Davis just couldn’t say no to manipulating mentors like James and his father. For all of his preternatural talents, Davis is not an alpha dog. He wasn’t at Kentucky, where Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was the unquestioned leader of the Cats, and he hasn’t been so far in the NBA. This is why Davis embraced DeMarcus Cousins as a teammate, despite his on- and off-court baggage. Cousins commanded attention and relieved the burden from Davis. And that certainly will be the case in L.A., where everyone and everything is sucked into the vortex of LeBron."
"Lebron Literally went to 8 straight finals. Ask Boston, Indiana, Toronto and Atlanta how Clutch he was. Lebron beat a 73 win team and because of that Green went and recruited the second best player in the league to help stop him. James has put fear in the hearts of many NBA players. Just because he's not jacking up 35 shots a game like Kobe doesn't mean he's not clutch."
"""Had to give you a career to destroy it""  - Lebron James"
LeBron James isn't on the Kings?
"I know the team isn't stellar, but the idea of getting the top seed in the West and being rewarded with LeBron James isn't really a great one. "
"I mean let's be real his story is basically ""Happened to be friends with LeBron James."" And that's it. If he wasn't good friends with one of the best to ever do it he would still be selling jerseys out of his car. "
"NOW CHECKING IN, NUMBER 8...  “Hey who’s that guy?”  LEBRON JAMES JR  “Oh”"
...where he'd be playing with LeBron James? 
"I remember him saying his son chose a number other than 23 or 6 to avoid being like his dad, but...he named him Lebron James Jr., that's tough."
"Lions are King of the Jungle, Lebron is called King James. "
"Are you suggesting Lebron James is dumber than an orange? I know he’s an idiot, but he’s not that dumb.  "
"I never truly trust pictures like this because there's [different complications of stats like this all over the place](http://www.espn.com/blog/marc-stein/post/_/id/4396/clutch-shots-are-tough-just-ask-lebron-james). So I don't exactly know what to trust when it comes to stuff like that.   What I do know is that Lebron is clutch. Kobe is clutch. In today's NBA when you can't touch the shooter, I would take Kobe on the game winning **shot**. That being said I trust Lebron to make the correct basketball play but if he's going to take a jumpshot I would be nervous after he ball left his hands. "
"&gt; The plot was so ill-conceived it boggles the mind. It reeked of desperation and short-sightedness. Then again, we are talking about an amateur front-office executive (Magic Johnson), who has relinquished the reins of the once-proud Lakers franchise to a agent (Paul) and the superstar (LeBron James) he represents.  &gt; Forget trying to find the logic or strategy behind the move. There isn’t any. Were Johnson and LeBron so eager to expedite the rebuilding process in L.A. that they ordered the pre-emptive strike without thinking through the potential ramifications?  &gt; Are they really that naïve or arrogant or dumb to think the Pelicans would rush into such an important decision because of a thinly-veiled leverage tactic? Did anyone actually believe it was going to work?  Say what you want about how salty the writer is, but he makes a good point, if AD/Rich Paul/Lakers had did everything they did after the season was over, would there really be this much hostility?  "
"Lebron DOESN'T own Paul's agency.  There are express provisions in the CBA preventing players from having a stake in an agency and Lebron complies with that.  The NBA even did an investigation into Klutch to see if Lebron had an ownership stake and concluded that he did not: [https://www.si.com/nba/2017/07/31/lebron-james-klutch-sports-group-ownership-investigation](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/07/31/lebron-james-klutch-sports-group-ownership-investigation)  Does Lebron have influence within Klutch?  It's pretty obvious he does.  But what he isn't is an owner of Klutch.  He isn't entitled to any of the profits made by Klutch (which is the textbook definition of ownership).    Can Klutch sell that their players are more likely to land on Lebron teams because Lebron will take notice of them?  Sure.  But plenty of agents play that game.  It's why Aaron Mintz wanted Paul George on the Lakers; Julius Randle and D'Angelo Russell were also his clients.  It's NOT a coincidence that after Russell was traded and it was obvious that the Lakers were jerking Julius Randle around, Paul George didn't even take a meeting with the Lakers, after saying he was going to them in free agency."
"He is a Portuguese football sports agent (you can look up his world renown clients, including CR7)  So my example that I'll give you is Wolverhampton in the Premier League. Portugal's top league has 3 main teams (Porto, Sporting, Benfica) that are well known for being a hub of young talent that is eventually sold off to the top clubs in the top European leagues.  For those who aren't just quite ready to be sold to those top clubs, Mendes will find a club like Wolverhampton (who was in the 2nd division of English football before this season) and plant a manager of his choosing there (For this club, its Nuno who was actually his first client ever back in the 90s).  He will then begin to systematically transfer these young prospects to that team, where they gained promotion to the EPL (HUGE TV MONEY AND GLOBAL EXPOSURE). At the moment, Wolves have 8 Portuguese players who play significant roles for the club.  And that all is basically his side hustle, since he is CR7's agent and that is enough to hold you over for a few life times already. He basically has the influence of 3 Lebron James since he in the world's biggest sport."
this guy just put blake griffin higher than lebron james kyrie irving and kawhi leonard
"Can you explain why?  On the previous thread about Davis leaving the arena all the comments were about how terribly Paul fucked up and how he forced his client into a position where he looked terrible just to help his other client Lebron James. I don't understand how Dell Demps being fired, something that's been a foregone conclusion for the last year, is a win for Rich Paul? By all reports, Ownership were the ones who specifically didn't want to deal with the lakers, and they're still there...so nothing changes in that regard? They can't trade AD until the summer, which is what they were going to do anyway.   I'm genuinely not knowledgable about what makes a good agent vs a bad agent. Why does this headline mean he got some kind of win?"
LeBron also took one of the worst teams to the NBA Finals by himself early in his career James Harden has never done anything like that nor will he ever.
&gt;	i'm going to side with that fact pippen has never said lebron james was the GOAT.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ8LeYax7Zc  Skip to 1:48
"I love this.    I'm so sick of the GOAT conversation!   I don't think that you can compare athletes from different times and different generations.  It just doesn't work.  Yes, you can use stats, but the games and the players are all different.  Was Roger Bannister the GOAT of running because he was the first to run a sub-4-minute mile?  No.  Things change.  And at some point, stats become meaningless.  LeBron James IS bigger than the GOAT debate. He is not only a husband and a dad, he is a leader and a good example for young people to follow.  If anyone is the epitome of ""The American Dream"" it is LeBron.  Talent, hard work, a good moral compass -- these are things that make him a complete human being and not just a basketball GOAT."
i'm going to side with that fact pippen has never said lebron james was the GOAT.
"You’re right that you’ve watched wayyy more Lakers games than I have, and by adding more context to the situation and explaining all the other injuries, you’re making it even more difficult to understand why you’re blaming LeBron? If you miss the playoffs this year, it will be due to the numerous injuries you’ve had.   And I would never do such a thing that you mentioned in your last paragraph, because as you can see by my flair, I do not like LeBron James very much, he’s repeatedly tortured my team. "
"&gt;	“Statistically, LeBron James is a better basketball player and here’s why: He fills the stats up across the board night in and night out,” Pippen explained.  He also said this. "
"&gt; Best Individual Series - Playoffs: LeBron James vs Golden State, 2016  Just a reminder to everyone that no one has ever lead both teams in all 5 statistical categories for a playoff series, regardless of length or round... except for LeBron James in a 7-game finals series against a 73 win team"
"&gt;Westbrook blew the record vs narrative discussion wide open  he did that by breaking a 50 year record that, previous to his MVP season, no one thought would be broken again. james harden numbers are insane, but we've seen jordan and kobe put up those numbers before in the modern era.  &gt;People don't take a LeBron-less East seriously  why wouldn't they? the east is far better this season than any season lebron played in the east. bucks/raptors/philly/celtics are all great teams. put those teams in a 7 game series with any team in the west not named GSW, and i don't think anybody would be surprised if they won."

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?  "
I’m a Sixers fan but your argument didn’t make any sense. That comment is literally copied and pasted on every thread about Harden. If losing in the playoffs is so horrible then literally every player in the league that’s not on the Warriors or named Lebron James should adjust their play style too. 
Lebron James. Dudes pretty good
"Weird. Harden is having a historic season putting up 37 points per game - something that hasn’t been seen in a very long time. On 62 TS% (I know right? It’s *nuts*). He’s also the only other player in league history other than Wilt to put up as many consecutive 30 point games. Guys like Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Hakeem Olajuwon, etc. haven’t even done that. Shit’s intense man.  But yeah, that guy with the deepest team in the league averaging 27 a game is the better player."
"The LeBron 12's are Velcro only, so LeBron James is the GOAT Velcro player"
"I feel so bad for kids like LeBron James Jr. He will never get to his dads level, but people expect so much of him. The poor kid might not even make the NBA."
"Haha it’s hilarious to me that people think sports journalism doesn’t exist to pick apart the little flaws that the best players have, or that people won’t hate if he plays more/well. Thats especially true for the truly great players (ever heard of some guy named LeBron James).  They create polarizing debate around the most exciting/best players to attract interest and make money. If they don’t make money they don’t get to keep being journalists. I’m not saying I like it, but they are giving people what people are showing them will pay off financially. So if you like truly in depth analysis, you’re in the minority, which is clear because that content is seen less and less these days because people read/click/listen to the paparazzi type shit."
"So you're going to post about 1 game each year and ignore the countless other series wins and amazing performances that got him to the WCF twice and makes him average 29/7/6.  No team except an epic Lebron James performance (a series that was really won because of Kyrie being clutch) has even gotten close to beating the Warriors.   He's had some bad performances but so has every star, most of the time they have a fellow star picking up the slack.   At least Harden has been able to put his team in a position to challenge the Warriors with the best second star of post surgery Dwight Howard and aging Chris Paul. No other player in the league can say that. So don't just look at 5% of games look at the whole picture. "
"He had more exposure in the playoffs for sure, especially when you go up against LeBron fucking James like 3 times. He was a young upcoming player going against the best and doing well enough, he was hyped a lot. He only has more exposure in the regular season now because he plays with Russell Westbrook. If it wasn't for him and previously Kevin Durant, OKC would never be on national TV."
"So Paul George wasn't overrated that one year he played like this for only the first 2 months of the season and was an MVP candidate for the Pacers? Then he regressed as he always did to his 21 points and great defense. He became a true superstar this year, that is the difference between this year's Paul George and the past. He has not only been more consistent, he has upped his game in general.   Btw OKC is the 28th biggest market in the NBA, Indiana 24th. Paul George was widely known, especially for his battles with LeBron James in the playoffs which all were nationally televised. If you play that many times vs. LeBron in the playoffs and play well, you will be hyped and known everywhere. Stop acting like no one followed PG before he came to OKC."

"Player empowerment in the sense that it is being pushed by Lebron James is a means for Lebron to benefit himself under the guise of empowering players.  First, he benefits during the remainder of his playing career by being able to unabashedly tamper and bring players to play with him.  Second, he benefits as the proprietor of a sports agency, where he will be able to use his place as the mouthpiece for player empowerment as a means to sign players and to maximize the money he makes as their agents.  Lebron is going to be an amazing politician in 20 years. A possible president. He's probably a psychopath."
"It’s getting attention for a lot of reasons. The first being Zion is a special athlete. The hype/expectations around him is some of the most I’ve seen since Lebron James. The second is the fact that College basketball player are not paid for their play, despite selling jerseys with the players names on them and ticket sales. Therefore, the attention is from people saying he should stop playing college in order to avoid any chance of injury until he can go pro and get paid for what he’s worth "

He wasn’t like Kwame Brown or LeBron James coming out of high school and probably would’ve gone top 20 at best. For gods sake I’m pretty sure Brown, James, and Dwight Howard are the only 3 players to go #1 overall out of high school so don’t act like it happened all the time! First round, yea, #1 overall???? I don’t see it. And again his contract would’ve been shit so don’t act like he would’ve come straight into the league on a $40-50mil contract without having Duke pave that path for him, it’s complete bullshit."
Kyrie’s problem is an over inflated ego. He thought he could take Kobe 1 on 1 back in the day when he was a kid and Kobe was in his prime. He thought he should get the credit in Cleveland while a guy named LeBron James was on the team. He thought he was gonna go to a new team and win a championship and show everyone he’s a GOAT. But it’s just not gonna happen. He’s a damn good player but he’s never gonna win an MVP or a championship as the main guy. He’s probably a future hall of famer but he’s not a generational talent or even a real superstar. 
True but Imagine of LeBron James had a devasting injury his Freshmen year of college. Theres a whole school trying to build a higher class community in Akron that wouldnt even exist. That would have affected alotta people
" Perkins has an interesting case:  12 Man Squad:  PG: Russell Westbrook/Rajon Rondo,  SG: James Harden/Ray Allen/Dwayne Wade.  SF: Lebron James/Kevin Durant/Paul Pierce.  PF: Kevin Garnett/Kevin Love,  C: Anthony Davis/Serge Ibaka  Other players he’s played with: Jrue Holiday, Derrick Rose, Kyrie Irving, Brian Scalabrine.  "
"VORP is a BPM multiplier, it's a cumulative measure of value. So the exact minutes played is not necessarily relevant, e.g. someone who plays 5 minutes but has a VORP of -3 is expected to do as much damage to a team's performance as someone who plays 48 minutes with a VORP of -3. You can argue opportunity costs or whatever, but that's not particularly relevant to the Suns who aren't exactly stacked with plus players that can replace those minus players.  Also if you're considering VORP as both a valid as well as accurate stat, Miami Lebron absolutely massacres Booker. In his 2 seasons as a positive player (99 games), Booker has amassed a VORP of 2.0. This is in contrast to Miami Lebron who recorded a VORP of 9.8, or pre-Miami Lebron who recorded a VORP of 11.6. This means that in a single season, Lebron has added value to his team on par with 5 Devin Bookers. A lineup consisting of 5 Devin Bookers and replacements players is considered equal to a single Lebron James and replacement players. That's hilarious. This probably highlights the inaccuracy of VORP decently but it's also worth noting in terms of how you're choosing to view the statistic."
"Rachel: “And now we look back at the Lakers game... LeBron James has entered the chat. KG reportedly remarked ‘y’all look so different’, while the Bucks are reportedly looking to close out their potential first round playoff series in 6.”"
[LeBron James has entered the chat]
"LeBron James Jr. is actually a few months older than Jayson Tatum, in case you didn’t know "
"1. He's a freakish athlete.  He's 6'7"" tall....weights 280 (all muscle) and he can jump outta the gym. 2. He's a lock down defender.  When he comes out to guard at the 3 point line...there is no driving on him...shuffles his feet like he's 5'7"". 3. He's got basketball IQ.  He rarely forces things.    In conclusion...he's like mixing Charles Barkley, Karl Malone (shoulders) and Lebron James into 1 player.  "
"Yeah, Dwight played in an era of really no dominant big men.  Carmelo lost out to LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Dirk, Tim Duncan.  Dwight only had one serious contender, Yao Ming, and his peak was limited.  "
Lebron James asks JR Smith “why don’t you learn how to read a f*cking clock”  “What’s wrong with your coach” Durant’s asks JR later. “You made a great rebound”
are you serious? you're acting like lebron james' injury didn't seriously alter out season?
"The fact that you bring up these kinds of advanced analytical numbers and not even see how almost identical they are between Kobe and MJ and then reverting back to contextless overall FG% base stat as well as talking about a ridiculous exaggeration such as hoisting from 28 feet displays your bias and ignorance.  Kobe and MJs TSS and EFG are nearly identical. The reason why Kobes overall FG% is lower is because he took more 3's. From 2 point range he is a career 48% while MJ from 2 is at 51%. If you wanted to eliminate the 3 point shot completely (even though Kobe was by far a better range shooter) and look at just the 2 point attempts for a more similar comparison, MJ is hardly better.   Have you actually watched these 2 play? There is a clear style difference and difference in game. MJ was a lot more athletic and got to the rim more than Kobe. There are no numbers that quantify that that you could point to as they werent recorded. At the same time Kobe took many more 3's, took difficult 3's, and had such a reputation that you could observe it by how defenses played him on the perimeter compared to MJ.   Theres also the fact that MJ was an absolutely horrendous 3 point shooter in the first half of his career with multiple seasons he shot well under 30% from 3. His overall 3 point percentage is balanced out because of the years in the league that they moved in the 3 point line and MJs percentage increased as a result.  Lebron James has a better 3 point percentage than both MJ and Kobe, or would you tell me hes a better shooter than them both?"
This is not dirty. He was tied up with Lebron James and was trying to free himself. Was not actively trying to hurt anybody.
"Ok, so this one is actually really good. I’d add McGrady and Horford and take out Dumars, Arenas, and Mahorn to get it to 12.  PG: Iverson / Kidd  SG: MJ / Wade / McGrady  SF: LeBron James / Grant Hill / Stackhouse  PF: Dirk / Bosh  C: Ben Wallace / Horford  "
"Ok, just for fun, here’s Jerry Stackhouse:   Michael Jordan  Lebron James  Allen Iverson  Grant Hill  Joe Dumars  Rick Mahorn  Dirk Nowitzki  Jason Kidd  Dwyane Wade  Chris Bosh  Ben Wallace  Gilbert Arenas  "
"yeah, i am saying everyone else's interpretation is irrational. if you watch the clip, he releases his arm pretty quickly once he realizes what's going on imo. and for his left hand on lebron's arm, yes, he's cheating, but that shit literally happens on 90% of rebounds in the NBA and we both know that. all i'm saying is sure, there's an argument to be made about whether or not this type of play is dangerous, but this shit literally happens every game, and i definitely don't see this type of post made for other players who have done the same thing. people are paying attention to it because 1. cp3 has a reputation for being a dirty player, 2. it's lebron james that he's committing the foul on. If it was let's say PJ tucker committing the foul, i doubt there'd be anywhere near this much attention, and a good number of people would be praising him for ""playing hard"" or something along those lines. similarly, if it was, let's say Henry Ellenson's arm that was gettin pulled, no one would give a shit, with all due respect to henry ellenson."
LeBron James and his buddies.
LeBron James
The dude is an attention whore. He will do anything to have a camera on him. He made comments about Lebron James son and brought up how Kyrie didn't have a mother while growing up.
"Played basketball...if you can't figure out when to stop the commitment to a rebound when you are clearly beat then I dunno whats wrong with. Also it looks like CP3 has no idea the arm hes pulling down is Lebron James. At no point does he look at him, which is also the case many times when going for a rebound. I think what is seen here is a dirty act by CP3 on a random player on the lakers in his mind."
"and shit, also, do we really want to see 3 years of (relatively) wasted college ball when a kid could be playing against the best of the best?   Is anyone upset LeBron James didn't play in college? Did we miss out on the best years of Kobe because he ""chased money"" in the nba instead of going to college? "
"LeBron?    PG: Kyrie Irving / Rajon Rondo (I think Lonzo could have a shot at being better, but I'm not predicting the future) SG: Dwyane Wade/Ray Allen SF: LeBron James / Richard Jefferson PF: Chris Bosh / Kevin Love C: Shaquille O'Neal / Ben Wallace"
"They don't have to be better than the opposing teams players they just have to be capable of outplaying them. For example KD is ""worse"" then a prime LeBron James but head-to-head he's still more than capable of holding his own or even outplay him. Similarly with Cousins. He's never gonna be able to contain Shaq but the spacing he provides gives us so much more room on offense that it renders Shaq's ability to protect the paint irrelevant. I will admit thought that the bench is atrocious offensively. "
"&gt; there’s been a lot of criticism of his leadership from people on this sub and the media  People on this sub.... Is this even worth addressing? Of course the media is going to run with anything Lebron James related, LBJ stories are probably the ones that get the most interaction from readers/viewers."
"I really like this idea! I’ll try a LeBron all-time team off the top of my head.  PG: Kyrie Irving, Rajon Rondo SG: Dwayne Wade, Ray Allen SF: LeBron James, Shane Battier PF: Kevin Love, Antawn Jamison C: Shaq, Chris Bosh  Bench: Derrick Rose, Isaiah Thomas?  Coach: Spo  I know I am forgetting some good players. Really struggled to find a second SF."
I have a simple way of explaining it. There are two players in NBA history who have won 4 regular season MVP's and 3 Finals MVP's. Those two players are Michael Jordan and LeBron James
"honestly I respect chris paul for treating his buddy lebron james just like everyone else, it really shows his competitive fire."
Neither does chris paul. Do you honestly believe that chris paul intentionally tried to injure his best friend lebron james?  Thats idiotic
Looks like we went for the ball and got hooked up with James’ arm. He literally couldn’t see Lebron behind him and couldn’t pull his arm out of there in mid air. But since it’s CP3 it’s a dirty bitch ass move.
"But LeBron James good, Chris Paul bad"
"&gt;  &gt; The only reason the NCAA has ballooned to making so much money as it has is because of players like Zion, Blake Griffin, Cousins, Wall, Booker, Wiggins, Towns, etc. The list goes on and on.  This is borderline insane.   You know we're well in living memory of the NBA drafting players directly from high-school and that the NCAA wasn't affected at all, right? I mean, Dwight Howard or LeBron James never went to college. Garnett, Kobe and so on.  Most NCAA fanhood couldn't care less about that. People follow it because of the teams, not the dozen of one-and-dones.  "
"I'm starting to think that we perpetuate the idea of the student athlete as it is in order to validate the cost of tuition for everyone else.  You say Zion doesn't need to be paid additionally bc he is receiving a free education. But then you look at LeBron James and Kwame Brown, #1 overall picks who began making millions for the same job at the same age Zion is now. Would you say a degree from Duke is equal to guaranteed millions in the NBA, guaranteed whether your career goes Bron or Kwame...   College is too expensive. An education/ a degree is a great accomplishment and I wish everyone had the means to increase their knowledge base but let's be honest about what a college degree guarantees in terms of cold hard cash. You don't need to go to college to perform well in most jobs and going to college doesn't qualify you to do the job you went to college to get. But college is a good expensive way to get people in debt, a way to aim our young people towards the established way of doing things, keep people in line. College is like church for people too smart to fall for the church scam. If you don't go to church, you have to piece together your own code of ethics from what is around you. If you don't go to college, you have to actually pay attention to the world around you in order to learn and you have to rely on your own competence and determination to make enough money to survive.  We treat college like some kind of savior. Maybe I'm crazy but I think we're making Zion go to college so people continue to believe that this is normal for an 18yo, just immediately plunge into crushing debt"
"It's been said before but the cooler your name the greater the chances of you succeeding in this league.  Which of the current star players doesn't have cool name?  Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, etc. etc.  Even Paul ""two first names"" George has a name that just rolls off the tongue and makes a cool abbreviation."
"Since when does winning MVP mean you are the best player in the world? James harden was the best player in the world last year? No.... magic played on stacked teams, he shouldnt of gotten the MVP some of those years over jordan. Just look at the stats. Jordan somehow didn't win the MVP after dropping 37 a fucking game. He averaged 33 8 and 8 with 3 steals and didn't win. Don't get me wrong magics stats were good, but a 20 and 10 double double is not more impressive than what mike was doing on a nightly basis. Mike was playing on dog shit teams, getting doubled even tripled and still willing the bulls to the playoffs. The lakers were probably a playoff team without magic. The bulls in the 80s would of won 15 games without mike. Mike was also not only the best scorer in the NBA, but also the best on ball defender. How he didn't win the MVP every single year 87-93 is beyond me. Same reason Lebron didn't win it every year.   I'm not getting into the whole Kobe and Lebron because I spent so much time on magic and mike and I gotta get bCk to work. But you would not of taken Kobe over Lebron in 09 if you were A. At the rec playing pick up ball or B. Starting a NBA team from scratch. Also Kobe won the MVP in 07. Lebron then won it 4 of the next 5 years. And it should of been 5 of 5. Rose stole one. "
There’s no argument for Magic Johnson over Lebron James. Period.
"34 year old Lebron James, looking a big heavy footed on the court right now...still faster than almost everyone else."
"""we got an [expletive] squad"" -Lebron James 2018"
"Yea, but you could also say teams like the Warriors and Nuggets also hadn’t hit their stride yet either. The Lakers were only a few games up from missing the playoffs, but also only a few games out of the first seed at one point.   You could make a pretty solid case that if Rondo, Lonzo, Lebron, and Kuzma didn’t get injured, they would’ve won 6+ games that they didn’t. Being without one of your best defensive players (Lonzo), AND your backup PG, AND Lebron freaking James is a tall order, and the injuries have been pretty spaced out such that the full lineup hasn’t played together very much.   Even 6 wins would put them right with the Blazers with the 4th seed. They aren’t a team like the Warriors or Raptors who are built to win even if missing their best player, but I think if Lebron had just stayed healthy they were a 50 win team. "
"Wilt averaged 50 PPG one season, was criticized in the papers for being a ball hog, then led the league in assists the next season. Wilt has faster a 40 dash than Russell freaking Westbrook and could've been an Olympic athlete while being the most physically dominating player in the league. Wilt is a better basketball player than Lebron James"
"&gt; Don’t you think maybe part of the reason the NBA has that rule is for the benefit of the NCAA so that they get players to make them (schools) money for at least a year before they go into the NBA?  I don't think the NBA considers the well being of the NCAA over their own when making their business decisions. If they did they'd be a fucking terrible business lol.  The NCAA straight up did not have a hand in this rule. It doesn't benefit them, it just creates this whole shitstorm that the FBI is investigating with paid players.    This rule was made between the NBAPA &amp; the NBA under the 2005 CBA because shitty 18 year old prospects were coming into the league taking veterans' jobs. There were too many Kwame Browns coming out and not enough LeBron James'."
If Lebron James misses the playoffs this year he is no longer the best player in the league. 
"and this is the problem. Lebron James is not better than Kobe Bryant, and his finals record will tell you that.   He’s an all time great player, he’s SUPPOSED to make it out of the east when he’s **not playing agInst any top 20 players**.  That’s why when he made it to the big stage he couldnt get it done.   Kobe on the other hand is 5-2, a winning record, playing against all time greats.   Stop it, youre just enthralled by Lebron’s athleticism and individual stats. the dude is not a better basketball player than Kobe. he is not a greater basketball player than kobe"
Lebron James Sucks
"Before he got injured he was doing exactly that on a team that won 35 last year. There's still time, like I said let's wait before crowning someone else because that dude is LeBron James. If regular season was all that mattered James Harden would be the best player in the world right now."

"He has a long career of doing the exact opposite. You only remember the negative times and arguments because that's what they talk about on tv.  Lebron James 2017:   &gt;[""I think what people don't understand, people that never played the game of basketball and never played team sports, is that in order to succeed, it has to be a team effort. I know I get a lot of the headlines - win, lose or draw, whatever the case may be - but in order to be successful, it's a team game. I learned that from since I first started picking up a basketball to play organized basketball at age 9.   &gt;So, you get all the doubters and people - who have never stepped in an arena, who's never played basketball, who's never put on a tank-top and shorts, who've never played anything organized - always want to try and kill my teammates. It's unfair to them. But I'll always stay true to the game of basketball because the game of basketball always stays true to me.

"LeBron James, long recognized as the greatest basketball players on earth, faces his toughest challenge yet. As the players gather for All-Star break, a strange mist fills the air. Suddenly, LeBron and all his colleagues realize something is wrong. As they all begin to feel different, a loud noise rings through the arena. At half court, stands the largest opponent any of these superstars have ever faced, Scott Foster.*"
"And I get that... at least I get that that *should* be the case.  But the Red Sox aren’t hated nearly as viciously in /baseball, unless it’s Yankees fans- but we obviously welcome that.  And the Patriots aren’t even hated as viciously in /nfl, probably because most have just come to terms with greatness.  And that’s the part I don’t understand. Why does /nba hate the Celtics *the most*? They hate us more than the Warriors utter dominance. They hate us more than James Harden’s total disregard for sportsmanship. They’ll cum themselves over another LeBron appearance in the finals while simultaneously throwing a fit that the patriots have cheated their way into the super bowl.  It’s not just celebrating our losses, either. It’s /nba’s total disregard for anything the team does that can’t be summed up by “lost on the last possession to a playoff contender” and “HE GONE”  Hate the Red Sox and the Patriots for their greatness and achievements all you want. But to act like the Celtics (1 title in 32 years) are the worst of the worst of the worst is nothing but hivemind bullshit that’s been brewed by young, feeble minds."
Damn you misplaced the James and misspelled lebron there. It goes Lebron James 
"Did you hear the story about when Reggie Bullock was in high school, Ingram’s dad would open up the local gym for him and then Reggie and Ingram would play together?  Do you know who else was at that gym? Lebron James.   Essentially all of Lebron’s accomplishments can be traced back to Brandon Ingram’s greatness."
"he doesn’t do it any more any any other superstar. giannis and lebron literally push off and armbar players multiple times a game. pg pushes off all the time (harden has his fair share too). i’m not saying harden doesn’t commit offensive fouls, i’m just saying he isn’t officiated differently on offense compared to any other superstar, unless you REALLY think the refs somehow have an agenda to prop up james harden of all people "

And if not for current rules prohibiting him....he would already be in the NBA and a millionaire. Instead, he's risking those millions every night he goes out and plays a college game. And sure enough, he just got injured when his shoe exploded. Thankfully it's just a sprain...but it absolutely could have been worse. So this is bringing attention to the whole NCAA not paying players and stuff thing. "

LEBRON MOTHERFUCKIN JAMES PEOPLE
"But at the very least a year in college would've warned us about Kwame Brown. How he wasn't a dependable scorer, how he folded under pressure against similar-sized defenders in the paint. I'm not saying kids fresh out of High School can't handle the NBA; Kevin Garnett and LeBron James are proof of the opposite. But I do believe they would've dominated in their one year of college to re-ensure their teams they were the ones. And outside of D-League, College is as close as you get to the pressure of the pro game."
LeBron james
"He’s like the love child of Kevin Durant, Lebron James and Kevin Garnett."

LeBron James: still good at basketball 
Yeah and everyone was saying Rob and magic had this. I said from the beginning it was a mistake to even try to get LeBron. Fuck LeBron James

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate MJ and Lebron.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate them? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better. You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?  "

It’s an NBA rule though so saying the NBA and G League have coaches to prepare them is a moot point. If it wasn’t for this NBA rule then we wouldn’t be talking about this. More kids would declare for the draft to avoid going to school and inevitably some would not get drafted because they’re not LeBron James or Kobe Bryant or even Zion.

"It's obvious that a 34 year old veteran with more mileage on his body than anyone in the sport, coming off an injury, in the middle of a throw-away season is attempting to conserve energy on the defensive end because of the load he carries offensively. And even so, his defensive rating is better than people like Kevin Durant and Marcus Smart, who are incessantly praised for their defense.  LeBron James is not the most elite defender in the game and nobody is claiming that. Yet, people will have you think he's the worst. My comment is not in reference to constructive critique, but all the LeBuM TrOlL narratives being spewed here daily, by foolish ""haters"". "
0/10 from 3. Ouch. Cold night and he still nets 28 pts. I’m curious if the MVP voters will see beyond the volume because Harden avgs 24 shots a game and avg 10 makes while his counterpart in the race Giannis avgs 17 shots a game and also avg 10 makes.  Just to give you an idea Harden is shooting 44% from the field. This number is nowhere near the Top 30 as Lebron is currently 30th with 51%. Giannis currently sits at 58%  Obviously Giannis and James play a different style but what makes the debate for MVP so fascinating this season is how on one hand you have a volume shooter with minimal defense but gaudy scoring numbers. On the other hand you have an all around player (minus his 26% 3pt) who is leading the best team in basketball. This could be the closest MVP race we’ve seen in quite some time.   Here are the stat lines as of today’s date   Harden: 36.3/5.2/6.2  Rockets record 35-25  Giannis: 27.2/12.7/6.0  Bucks record: 46-14  It’s interesting that national media barely talks about Giannis when the numbers are this close. If you take away the volume for Harden he avg roughly the same ppg as Giannis.   On Defense Harden gives up a FG percentage of 46% while Giannis gives up only 40% point differential is intriguing as well Hardens differential is -0.6 while Giannis is a -6.7.   Formulate your own opinion but I think the numbers have Giannis just barely ahead of Harden for MVP at this moment.

I would stay off all social media if I was a pro anything.  I’m not even a LeBron fan. Last time I had a favorite player was Reggie Miller lol. I just can’t help but watch how people are turning on James so hard that I feel awful for him. People love to watch people who are better then them in every way fall...guess that’s human nature.

"It didn't happen. It was Lue that told LeBron at halftime to stop playing soft    &gt;With 2 minutes and 27 seconds left in the first half of Game 7 and the Cavaliers trailing the Warriors by three points, Tyronn Lue called timeout. ""Bron, you've got to be better than this,"" the Cavs coach implored.   &gt;""What do you mean?"" James asked, incredulous. He had just scored 41 points with 16 rebounds in Game 5 and added another 41 with 11 assists in Game 6, evening a series that was essentially over. He'd sent his teammates impassioned late-night group texts, showed them the commencement address Steve Jobs delivered at Stanford and convinced them during a post-practice bus ride across the Bay Bridge that the championship was their destiny. It's already written, he shouted from the back. ""What more do you want me to do?"" he pressed Lue. ""Stop being so passive!"" the coach barked. ""Stop turning the ball over! And guard Draymond!"" James's numbers looked fine--12 points, seven rebounds, five assists--but he had unleashed a few sloppy passes and Draymond Green, his primary assignment, was 5 for 5 from three-point range. ""Bron was mad, pissed off at me, and then we went into the locker room at halftime and I told him the same thing in front of all the guys,"" Lue recalls. ""He was mad again, pissed off again.""   &gt;After Lue finished, he saw James approach assistant coach Damon Jones in the locker room and overheard their exchange. ""It's messed up that T Lue is questioning me right now,"" James said. The Cavaliers trailed by seven. The season was slipping. ""Everything I read all year is that you want to be coached, want to be held accountable, and trust T Lue,"" Jones replied. ""Why not trust him now?"" James was still rankled. He moved on to James Jones, his long-time teammate, who has ridden shotgun to the past six Finals. ""I can't believe this,"" LeBron said. ""Well,"" Jones responded, ""is he telling the truth?""   &gt;Lue, ducking in and out of a back office, kept an eye on LeBron. ""He stormed out of the locker room,"" Lue says. The coach laughs as he tells the story. ""I didn't really think he was playing that bad,"" Lue admits. ""But I used to work for Doc Rivers in Boston, and he told me, 'I never want to go into a Game 7 when the best player is on the other team.' We had the best player. We needed him to be his best. I know he might have been tired, but f--- that. We had to ride him. And he had to take us home."" "

"Okay, not a lebron Stan but they’re in a 2-3 zone and the pick and roll action was on the opposite wing. So a good defensive team would have communicated it, seeing as bron would likely cover the roll, Bullock rotates to the wing and lebron taps the corner man and has the help.  Worst case, they need two passes to hit the most open man (corner) or have to throw a cross court bullet to him— which is either a turnover or gives James enough time to close out.  Lebron really doesn’t give a whole lot of defensive effort, but this play looks like a team issue and that comes from coaching. "

"When I was younger, maybe junior high, I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. So when there i am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece and who walks in but Lebron James.  I was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him, as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Lbj, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Bron put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it."
"""Listen, I can't do this"" - LeBron James"
"Jabbar maybe be an extremely nice person, but there is no way he is the GOAT.   First of all, he got 5 of his rings playing alongside Magic Johnson.  Secondly, the records he has are not averages, they are absolute numbers, and this is attributed to the fact that he played for 19 seasons. It is an argument about longevity, not greatness.  Thirdly, accolades do not mean anything without taking into account the difficulty of the job at hand.  For example, take Bill Russell: extremely gifted athlete, played for one of the most stacked teams ever, in an era where the athleticism and the difficulty of the game was around the 1/10 of what it is today.  If Wilt Chamberlain was on that Celtics roster, instead of Russell, what would the outcome be? Most probably the Celtics would have even more championships in that era.  Since most of creditors weren't alive in the 80s, let me tell you this: Kareem was never in the GOAT conversation in the 80s, because until Magic came to the Lakers, Kareem had only one ring. Julius Edging was considered a better player than Kareem  had the Sixers have Magic Johnson, Julius would have at least five rings in the 80s.  In that era, the GOAT conversation was between Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson and Julius Erving, and later Michael Jordan was added to them.  In 2018, we also have LeBron James as another GOAT condender.   Kareem is not one of them though. If Magic wasn't born, Kareem wouldn't have these rings and Larry Bird would probably have 7 or 8, completely dominating the 80s.  The best ever NBA players are these, in the following order:  1. Michael Jordan. 2. Magic Johnson. 3. Larry Bird. 4. LeBron James.  That's the Mount Rushmore of NBA.   The rest are below them, sorry."

There’s this guy named LeBron James. You may have heard of him. 
"Last year Lebron James was badly swept by the Warriors.  Last year the Rockets pushed the Warriors to 7 games and nearly won the damn series.  Lebron went through the East, Rockets are in the West. Lebron wasn't even the best player last year, but people acted liking making it through the East meant he got to keep his spot. It was never like that."
"LeBron's extended injury this year interrupted his typical Jan-Feb team meltdown / drama segment of the season where at some point you start having dark thoughts of hating your own team and the total lack of effort they show, before going on a huge run and blasting through the playoffs making you wonder what the hell you were thinking doubting LeBron James.   The only question is is he too far behind schedule for the late season surge?"
"It’s just the Lebron Haters have a self fulfilling prophecy right now - they frontrun on his failures and take every media narrative as fact.   Reality is, the lakers young core is inconsistent, Rondo turns the ball over too much and can’t shoot to start with Lebron, and Lebron has been relegated to being the starting PG, in addition to him catching onto the new trend of players who have to create the offense and rest/ don’t play defense ( this started with James Harden). Lonzo’s injury takes away from their playmaking, defense and organizational structure on court. Lastly trading Zubac and never trusting Beasley hurts them a lot. It’s a collapse on several different levels.   It may just be better for LBJ to lose, so he can get an offseason of rest "
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit think LeBron James is black."
lebron james cause he loves space jam
"Lebron James, blud. We went out and got Lebron James, fam. Lebron, blud! And he won't play any defense, blud! Why, fam? Why mans can't close out, blud! "
"He signed LeBron James and drafted Ball, Kuzma, and Hart while his predecessor signed Deng and Mozgov"
"Blows my mind that everybody is writing the Lakers out of the playoffs like they've got no chance.  4 games out of the 7th seed with like 22 left to play- y'all really have that much faith in the Spurs, TWolves, Clippers and Kings? Lebron James is still Lebron James.  Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see them crash and burn- but it's not like them making the 8 seed is gonna take some miracle.  "
"It didn't even remotely come down to the referees. CHANDLER FUCKING PARSONS PLAYED 19 MINUTES.  Chandler Mother Fucking Parsons, who has only played in 5 games this season and is averaging 5/2 on 29% shooting, played 20 minutes against LeBron Fucking James and his team still won by double digits."
The Los Angeles Clippers who traded their best player at the deadline is going to make the playoffs over the LeBron James Lakers. Oh how the turntables
Yeah because LeBron James has a mindset of not wanting to win.
"there really wasn't time, and no opportunity presented itself  but you seem to know more than lebron james"
"Feel however you want, but to me, it’s just so weird that Lebron Fucking James needs to brag about accomplishments on social media. Like dude, pretty much everyone agrees you’re either the 1st or 2nd Goat, it’s just unnecessary. Let others do the bragging for you."
"Some of you guys are unreal...  I know it's ""fuck LeBron time"" now but come on, this is pretty amazing achievement that's worth a little celebration.  What do you think those guys are doing after a defeat? Lock themselves in a room and cry their hearts out? James celebrates his achievement, Kuzma bangs some IG chicks, Ingram plays fortnite, Rondo does what Rondo does after a defeat etc...  Move on. This is worth celebrating, it's not an easy feat to do.  Note: ""He never gets any blame when his team loses"" my ass."

Christ... yeah because Lebron James isnt dedicated to basketball
"My opinion: James Harden was the MVP and played at a similar level, If you wanted to put someone above Lebron he needs to be there. He and Giannis have been the two best players followed by those two and then Jokic and Paul George. "
"LeBron would be the 3rd best warrior, he's the 2nd best James, and Giannis dunks him like he dunks everything"
Let's dispel this fiction once and for all that LeBron James doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing; he's undergoing a systematic effort to draft Zion and make the Lakers great again.
This is getting ridiculous lmao I hate lebron but this is lebron we are talking about. Not Kent bazemore or Zach Randolph. LeBron james

People act like the current cavs are simply the 2017-18 roster minus LeBron. The truth is it is a completely different team and are missing a lot more than just James.   Plus they are in tank (trying to lose) mode.
"I remember in 2k14 where there was a LeBron James career mode where you could leave Miami and join the Knicks. The storyline for that season was that LeBron missed a good portion of it with injuries and barely got the Knicks into the 8th seed. From there, he won the NBA title.   Just sayin it ain’t crazy if 2k already predicted it"
"I’m sorry. We are not worthy of the greatness that is LeBron James. Without him we would just be the Lakers.   Seriously dude, we can’t criticize our own player in our own sub anymore lmao "
"Can't come up with any argument, can you? I'm not gonna make random statements and then pretend I know everything. Like I said, let's see LeBron James carry this team to the NBA finals and prove that he can take any group of players to the biggest stage, just like his fans said he could. If he can, I'll admit that I was wrong."
At this exact moment in time I'm not sure there's a difference between LeBron James and Andrew Wiggins.
State clearly that you think any other play was better than Lebron James in 2018 playoffs. 
"I get what you are saying but this season is too early to tell.  Our hopes rely pretty much on this summer and we'll know then if it was worth it or not. But when you get an opportunity to sign LeBron fucking James you take it even with the circus that comes along with it.   We still have the cap space to make good signings with all the 1 year deals expiring, it just depends on if anyone will actually come here at this point. "

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

Simmons is not more of a post up threat than LeBron James. Don’t do this. Thompson is fine matched up against him and that would be an ideal matchup for Draymond in a playoff series.
The only thing BI has over Tatum is ppg average and per 36 there’s only like a .5 ppg difference.   Tatum is the better rebounder and defender and a better three point and FT shooter.   All advanced stats say Tatum is better. Tatum had a winning record last year in the playoffs with horford and a bunch of Lottery picks. Ingram can’t get above .500 in the regular season with lebron James.  You take all these into account plus the fact that Tatum has had a full year less of nba training and it really shouldn’t be that hard to tell why GMs would pick Tatum &gt;BI every time.  But OMG he had 28 ppg over his last 5 games where he’s 1-5 why would anyone want Tatum after that lol.

"Alright so going back 17 years, 3 examples of “projects”... not what I would call all the time lol. 2 of which were 18 years old (which, in my opinion, any 18 year old draft pick will understandably need a few years to be a quality nba player unless you’re LeBron James- in my opinion that doesn’t make you a project)  So Ingram was a project because he had to put weight on then?  It was obvious he had nba talent and length- I wouldn’t call him a project just because at 19 years old he was skinny. I guess I would define a project more as the raw athletic types who need a lot of work on their basketball skills."
"I did the math years ago back on RealGM and have long since lost the link. However, if you compare LeBron James athletic freakiness to the average NBA player and made a similarly extreme WNBA player relative to the rest of the WNBA, you would end up with an undersized point guard with below-average speed. Imagine if Raymond Felton was the size of Isaiah Thomas. That is what the ""LeBron James of women's basketball"" would be athletically in the NBA.  There is tons of overlap in the potential athletic abilities between men and women in general, but much less so when you get to the extremes that make up professional sports"
"What's up y'all, it's your boy Mr Krabs the Based Robot coming at you live with them fiery takes, and today I want to share a little bit about myself with you all. Some of you might know who I am, most of you probably don't, but for those who do and to those who don't, around this community people know me for two things: a.) I'm a Dallas Mavericks fan who believes the name in the front stands above the name in the back and b.) I can, at times, be a bit of a Wade hater. Now, I know a lot of you have wondered, or are probably wondering, how can a Dallas Mavericks fan also be a self-declared Wade hater? While it was easy to get to this point, explaining how I got here can be quite complex. So let me begin by taking y'all back to where it all first started.  In the summer of 2006, our Dallas Mavericks faced a devastating loss to a Miami Heat team that played with a truly never-before-seen level of efficiency. Didn't they fucking shoot like 90 free throws for three quarters, or something like that, in one of the games? Anyways, yes we got beaten, yes we underperformed, yes we were tired and probably dehydrated for like at least a game, but nevertheless, we remained resilient. Avery Johnson said it best in his post-game conference soon after our finals' loss: our team doesn't balk, our team doesn't walk out the door, our team doesn't quit on the game and leave to the locker room while there are still 15 seconds remaining in the game — even if we're ten points down, twenty points down, our team does not quit when faced against adversity. So all in all, you can say I (and probably the majority of Mavs fans) were feeling pretty confident as we moved into the offseason and closer to free agency. I mean, I know I was quite confident, I talked a lot of shit here back then about how we were going to keep Dirk, after all, he did say earlier in the season that he couldn't see himself playing anywhere else but Dallas. May 9, 2007, was the first moment of uncertainty for many of us Mavs fans, that was the day that trucks were spotted for Dirk's trip to Australia. On July 8, 2010, ""The Decision"" special dropped on ESPN. Throughout that night, I kept basketball out of my life, if you needed me, you could call me but I stayed busy making money — you know what was on my mind, all I thought about were hundreds, I stayed busy (bzz) working on myself.  Now, I gathered myself and picked myself up, and I was ready to support Wade in Miami, I was all up in r/mavericks talking about how I didn't want to hear it, how time had passed and we should move on. That was up until the rumors started coming out that he talked shit to Mark Cuban, that he didn't even communicate without fake coughing to Dirk and/or Kidd, that he called a rumored verbally-committed Pau Gasol and warned him not to sign with us. Those were the seeds that planted in me a deep hatred for Wade the player (because, to be honest, I'm cool with Wade the person). This sent me on a five-year journey of hating Wade, I said to myself, the self-titled ""Flash"" will rue the day he left Miami. Now, I know some of y'all will say ""but Wade is a Hall of Famer"", and to those of you who say that, I say to you this: have you ever had your heart broken by another man? I know there are people here who can relate to me, who've had their rival celebrate in a less than unsavory way, didn't even tell any of his teammates, trashed their front office, etc... And I'm not going to name any names here, but at least OKC got a fucking ""thank you"" from Kevin Durant — we got a fucking ""team I formerly shot free throws against"" and ghosted for like four months.   By the way, I'm at that part in ""Blackhat"" where that Asian chick saves Chris Hemsworth — BAGAWD CHRIS YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT. This lady just pulled out that fucking med kit and got to work. I mean that's real efficiency right there.   Anyways, the next five years had a lot of ups and downs. 2010 was a really rough time for anybody here that knows LeBron James joining Wade in Miami is probably the clearest example we've had in modern NBA history of the league fixing things up for a star player. I thought about quitting the game. I thought about all the work I had done in this subreddit in past years, the countless hours I had put here, making counter-arguments, consistently shutting down Wade fans — but I told myself, this shit is chess, it ain't checkers. I remained persistent, I worked on my game, I studied Michael Jordan, his three more rings, his five more MVPs, his five more Finals MVPs, nine more scoring titles, and DPOY award — learned that he basically has an entire hall of fame career above Dwyane Wade. On April 11, 2019, all of my hard work will finally pay off. Wade is no longer consensus ""NBA Player in the World"". I feel like the Bucks' win is a signal that it's ok for me to move on now. I look back at 2016, seeing how close I came to leaving it all behind... I see myself reflected in Dwyane Wade last night, I was about to quit on the game while there were still 15 seconds left in it, but I didn't walk away into the locker room — I stayed on the court.

Lebron.  Better than Jordan.  James.
"Is this the new anti-Ingram talking point for the people who want to insist he sucks no matter what, even when the stats totally expose that as bullshit? James Harden puts up most of his numbers in ISO as well, as do many great players. Being able to just throw the guy the ball and asking him to just go get a bucket is a great skill for a guy to have, not something negative. Ingram also gets a lot of points off of cuts, and he's been a great facilitator for others as well. He's also a very good defender  The Lakers keep losing because they've only got 4 good players right now: LeBron, Ingram, Kuzma and Bullock. They're getting next to nothing from both the point guard and center positions, and their bench is flat out awful right now. The Lakers were playing great against the team with the league's best record last night while Ingram was going off with all of his scoring. It's total bullshit to try to put any of the Lakers struggles on him"

Except you used that as an argument to claim him as dominant. But in that series a) he wasn't his team's leading scorer b)Lebron James avg 28 ppg on 57% fg 52% 3pt. So he was not dominant in that series.
This is the second thread I’ve seen you insinuating Lebron is at fault. Did James Harden also miss 18 games that season? Pay closer attention

Lebron James wasn't the best player on the court tonight...
"Every other player on earth is 50% .  The players who play with Lebron are less that 50%, so my point still stands.  You don't call for the ball from Lebron James. He gives it to you, when he gives it to you."
What do you think will bring in the money and views a Lebron James game or Denver vs Utah ? 
"Your flair makes you delusional lol. I'm not refuting him being top 5 or an mvp candidate.  Dominance in literally every other category? Um, LeBron James is still the best passer/playmaker in the game. Sit down nephew.  Giannis has a super high ceiling and his time will come. I'm just saying he's not the best player in the league. He hasn't even had a dominant playoff run yet. Sit down."

"Duncan's single season playoff peak is just as great as Jordan LeBron Kareem look at the win shares the VORP and carrying a team to a title with no all stars. Kawhi wasn't even as good as James Worthy in 2013 or 2014.   As far as longevity, all nba first team for Duncan in 2013 and scoring 30+ out playing the leagues best player in finals elimination games (game 6 2013 finals). Kareem's longevity doesn't even come close to that, he was not even his teams best player for half the Lakers titles. Tim Duncan was clearly the best player 4 titles and arguably 5th. Put 1997-2005 Tim Duncan in the 1970s and he would average near Kareem numbers, that era was inferior to Duncan's era in athleticism and competition in teams. "
LeBron James is still a top 5 player.

"It's not. Every time Harden puts up a 50+ game we gets dozens of posts about his greatness and anyone who comments against them is slammed.  We've seen LeBron point out in a game how he can't get near Harden or Paul w/out them drawing a foul. We've seen Steph mock a traveling call put on him for doing a Harden stepback. We saw PG13 give Harden a stepback at the AS game to mock James' style. Not to mention ex-players (Kobe, Pippen). But anyone on here that doesn't go along with some post comparing Harden to MJ or Wilt gets slammed.  The worst part is I respect his talent and he kept HOU in the race w/o Paul and that's amazing. But you can respect the wins w/o respecting the style."
"LeBron ""Christian Bale"" James"
"Except KD is a slightly different context. If he does settle down, he’ll have experienced both: 1.) achieving life accomplishments and 2.) the love of a family. Whereas the male coworkers i talked about will only experience 2.) and not 1.)   The dissatisfaction of something you had high hopes not turning out to be all you thought it would be is different than the dissatisfaction of having to give up something that you really wanted.  And dont get me wrong, i didnt mean to imply that men as a group **have absolutely no desire to start a family**. Of course there are men who want to open their hearts to a bigger family. But its just different for like a LeBron James/Kevin Durant/etc *who already has an extremely rich life experience* and starting a family is *the only thing he doesnt have* versus a normal guy who starting a family is the only meaningful life experience he does have. Like if a guy who wanted to travel the world, party, bang a lot of women, start a small business, make a lot of money to enjoy a nice quality of life, become extremely good at some side hobby/passion like guitar or dancing or woodcarving, etc didnt get to do any of that, and then he started a family, you wouldnt feel like that all that life experience that he wanted but never got wouldnt weigh down heavily on his overall happiness?"

Explain to me how a 21 year old averaging 17 points per game on a team with Lebron James and playing solid defense is overrated? Literally everyone and their mother agrees we aren't making the playoffs this season.  The only decent point you've made is that the Bucks are going to be good and I will agree with your prediction that they make the finals eventually.

If a black guy won it would you call him Lebron James 2.0?

“FICKLE” ~~Daniel Bryan~~ LeBron James
Melo was meant to be the one with the most longevity alongside James. Bosh had a freak medical issue. Wade is out here doing his best making wild buzzer-beating 3's but will retire. It's all on LeBron.
"What OP did was basically the equivalent of LeBron James dying before his first NBA game and saying ""Why aren't the Cavs better this year? They got the #1 pick in the draft!""  How can you possibly knock the Celtics for being bad during an era where 2 of their franchise players died?"
"now, while i realize that if lebron is on the floor he is probably controlling the ball a lot. But is it also possible that the matchup kept James out of the play and essentially had the other guys play a more team oriented brand of basketball&gt;"
Brb putting myself as Lebron James
Just like Wiggins was called the next LeBron James   Just media generating hype
"Perfectly good argument. I am okay with Bird being there. His 86-87 season had him at 7.6 APG and 9.2 RPG, though with 28.1 PPG which he would be able to keep up with in a star-studded team. But he did have 19.4 PPG 90-91 with similar stats.  Still, the usual SF Bird at PF would also encounter LeBron James in a dilemma, if we're gonna have an SF at PF then you also have LeBron with 9.1 APG in the 2017-18 season with 27.5 PPG and 8.6 RPG.   So maybe it is better in the end to get an actual PF there like Dirk who has lower scoring tendency, but for a PF, a higher rebounding tendency and is more natural as one of the two big men to have in the post."

"So here’s a reworked suggested best possible working cohesive team of all time. If you’ve got a team that could beat them feel free to add your reasoning.  PG: 06/07 Steve Nash - ideal game: 10+ pts, 10+ ast, 2+ 3pt SG: 15/16 Stephen Curry - ideal game: 20+ pts, 5+ ast, 3+ 3pt SF: 89/90 Michael Jordan - ideal game: 20+ pts. 5+ast, 5+ rebs PF: 02/03 Dirk Nowitzki - ideal game: 15+ pts, 10+ rebs, 1+ 3pt C: 61/62 Wilt Chamberlain - ideal game: 25+ pts, 15+ rebs, 3+ blk  For PG - Steve Nash over Stockton because Nash was the most precise PG shooter you’ll ever see. Deadly at FTs, 3pts, while still being a killer assister. Was not as willing of a scorer like Magic or Big O, and can let you build the team around someone else.  For SG - Steph Curry, because it feels safe posting a combo guard who is a killer shooter out there. In my view even a better pick than The Logo Jerry West whose true 3pt shooting prowess will sadly never be known. In my view his peak season was more efficient than Kobe’s 05/06, but we’ll have yet to see if James Harden can surpass him as an even more killer of a scorer this season. As a primarily more of a PG he’s not a selfish player, and obviously notches above Klay Thompson either way.  For SF - Michael Jordan, I mean you gotta get him in there and build the team around him. At SF, like he played for Wizards, because it feels better to build the team around the SF with a supporting SG rather than an SF whose role is not as specified in general. But obviously the Chicago Mike. 89/90 MJ was a better assister/rebounder, but he was draining them threes a season later. A pick over LeBron James, Durant, Bird, Baylor because of fucking course you wouldn’t miss a chance to build around the GOAT winger rather than just the generational best players.  For PF - Dirk Nowitzki, when it comes to pure PFs I’d take him over Duncan, Barkley, Hayes, Rodman and Garnett, simply because having your PF draining those threes while still having similar stats to all of them is priceless. Now compared to other PF-eligible players like LeBron, Moses Malone, Bird and Durant, the conversation gets tougher, but those would be too much scoring and star power for this team to ideally smoothly work.  For C - Gimme Wilt, with Kareem in the closest second place of this entire team. Don’t know which would work better in real life, both killer scorers, rebounders, with Wilt was great assister later in the career, but honestly I’m okay with either of the two. For personal reasons I wish to be on team Kareem, but I gotta be objective. Honorable mentions to Moses Malone and Bill Russell, but they obviously ain’t topping those two. Can’t see either of them playing as PFs so I guess you’d have to choose between them.  Bench: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, John Stockton, LeBron James, Moses Malone, Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant, James Harden.  Feel free to completely shatter any of my theories if you’ve got points to disagree with. "
Says the guy with a Lebron James flag. Very unbiased. Very cool. 
"I wish I could be one of them for a day, I would call him out in front of media. “I don’t care who you are, what you’ve done, none of your credentials matter on the court. The only thing that matters between these lines when we play, is who you are in the 48+ minutes of the game. Who we expect you to be is the best player in the world, giving us 100% every night. If you really here to play basketball and win, and not be me Hollywood, then show us on the court.”  I know he was injured, but I’ve been saying it since game 1. Lebron James is not the same man on the court as he has been the last few seasons. People are just now noticing it, but I’ve saying it since day one. "
"Poor Luke was basically given an impossible job. ""hey we're going to hire you to grow alongside a team of young guys. You're a young coach, they're young players, you'll learn together and hopefully turn into something great... but also we're going to turn over damn near the entire roster every single season, and then we'll bring on LeBron James and ask you to deal with managing a superstar's ego, and oh yeah you know all that patience we said we'd have? Just kidding! You need to win NOW. Good luck figuring out your brand new roster with no shooters, a ton of injuries, and trade drama all season. We know you came from a stable team with shooters, but we do things a bit differently around here y'know? Have FUN!"""
Shut up! Haven't you got the message? This is hate LeBron James month. Everything is his fault!
"Tanking with LeBron James on your team is such a fucking bad look. Honestly, lol. It would be a fucking embarrassment to the organization and the league.  "
"Yes, but the lesson that Kyrie should have learned from that is you need your teammates. LeBron James can't do it alone and neither can Kyrie Irving. Kyrie should have learned the importance of building a team, working together for one goal, and playing off each other which benefits the team. You'd think that's something a champion would understand more than most.  Instead he points fingers at his teammates, makes vague comments about staying or leaving, all while he said he wants to be ""the guy"" of his team."
Your team is going to win two more games than last season and miss the playoffs after adding LeBron James. 
You also got LeBron fucking James
I guess he thinks LeBron James is a team.
"This is so true. There was one night I was in the mountains, in the middle of the woods, that I thought could have been the end of me.  I made it through. And when I came back to the city, everything was just so different. The things this society values, up there, it doesn't mean anything.  It's like, would you rather be LeBron James with three NBA rings but has no heart or hunger to play basketball with the same intensity and intention to win as say, Westbrook or Harden?"
"&gt; Of the 82 games how many star players rest?   Paul George, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, Lebron James, Karl Anthony-Towns, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook.    Amonst ALLLLLL of those players there's less than 10 games missed due to rest."
"Discussion: Here's my suggestion for the most effective fantasy starting five, that would have the best winning record against any other team ever. Feel free to disagree and lead others into a consensus and agreement on most elements.  PG: John Stockton  SG: Jerry West  SF: Michael Jordan  PF: LeBron James  C: Wilt Chamberlain  I will not post much of an explanation, I'd rather like to see a discussion. MJ and Wilt are the clear centerpieces here with LeBron as the support. However, the PF position is the most questionable for me, perhaps a Duncan would work better here, Bird, or, shit, maybe even Kareem, not to leave him out."

"Point is it was Riley picking those surrounding pieces, not James. LeBron has had basically full control of the roster he's playing on since leaving Miami. In Cleveland it was LeBron who insisted on keeping JR Smith and Tristan Thompson around, which wound up being a massive drag on the team"
"People are shitting on LeBron because he’s criticizing his own teammates while also requiring them to push him to just to cover an open man.  Currently, his defense is worse than Harden’s. Currently, Harden is putting up better offensive performances and carrying his team more. So people are arguing that James Harden is, currently, the better James"
Nah not at all. I'm just saying Michael Jordan said Kobe Bryant is better than LeBron James at basketball.
Absolutely. James Harden has also passed Lebron James in the all time rankings as well
"Marcus Smart yelled, “There you go!” Brad Stevens gave a look of pleasant surprise. Gordon Hayward belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Jayson Tatum hit the locker room door, ex-Eastern Conference star LeBron James hugged him &amp; said, “I'll trade you too for Anthony Davis”"
"I don't know if it means he just didn't want to shoot against Beverly or that when Beverly was on Bron that resulted in other opportunities, but check out the [full list of Lakers possessions where LeBron was on the court](https://stats.nba.com/game/0021800958/matchups/?OFF_PLAYER_ID=2544&amp;DEF_PLAYER_ID=&amp;sort=TEAM_PTS&amp;dir=1).  Pat Beverly on LeBron is actually one of the most effective *team* matchups for the Lakers, with LAL averaging 1.17 pts/pos, even though Bron himself was 0/2 with 2 assists on those 23 possessions. Again, I'm not saying this means Beverly was doing a bad job - I didn't even watch the game. It just stands out to me that when he was guarding LeBron the Lakers did pretty well.  Actually, I just nerded out with some spreadsheet math. Of all matchups with at least 5 possessions of data, James/Beverly was #12/33 for LAL with that 1.17 team ORTG. Bron's best matchup was Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, at #5/33 for 1.6 team ORTG. LAL #1/33 was Bullock/Gallinari, at 1.89 team ORTG on 9 possessions. LeBron's worst matchup (for the team) was JaMychal Green, #27/33 for a 0.82 team ORTG. LAL's worst was KCP/Harrell, with 0.4 team ORTG on 5 possessions.  Note that this is individual matchups in team possessions, so 5 matchups are recorded per possession. There are 500 total offensive matchups recorded for the Lakers in this game.  "
"Yea honestly the thing is that LeBron fans will swear ""LeGM"" isn't real, and its not like he's some emperor palpatine type figure looming over the team. There's no way in hell you're not consulting LeBron James about your signings and decisions considering he's your teams best player, and in Miami/Cleveland both teams thought finding the right guys will keep him there."
"He wins it over rose in 11 and probably curry in 15.   Also, you don’t have to be the winner to still be mvp level. Harden is a perfect example and so is Durant.   Also not theoretically winning it over lebron James, Curry, and Durant doesn’t necessarily mean this season is not mvp level "
Honestly can't name a single good player with 2 first names. LeBron James? Bum. Michael Jordan? Trash.
He said professional nba coaches not amateur LeBron James scapegoat 
JJ Barea was stopping LeBron James.
It's really only close because of the narratives.. James Harden would be the runaway favorite if his name was LeBron James 
"lmao he's *following me across reddit into different threads* and you want to get pedantic about it? Alright I'll take you to school.  What started the whole thing was my proposal that the Celtics offer Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Robert Williams, and four 1st round picks for Anthony Davis. His response:  &gt; It is a laughably bad trade offer from a team drunk fan  So that's the first place he's wrong. It was reported that the Pelicans were looking to get four 1st round picks from the Lakers during their trade rumors at the deadline [[source]](https://lonzowire.usatoday.com/2019/02/04/la-lakers-rumors-news-new-orleans-pelicans-four-first-round-picks-lakers-anthony-davis-lebron-james/). This deal offers those four first round picks, plus three former first round picks, two of which are on a rookie deal with high upside. You can argue Hayward will never regain form and be worth his contract, but outside of that you can't consider it a ""laughably bad deal"" when according to sources it's fulfilling exactly what the Pelicans were asking for.  So, I shrug off the mean-spirited and straight up wrong sentiment in the spirit of generating actual basketball discussion with:  &gt;What's a better offer you think the Pels will get?  To which I get the hostile response:  &gt;You are treating hayward like a positive asset. Full stop.  &gt;Any offer without hayward is a better offer. The pelicans are not taking back a broken player thats overpaid for 3 more years in their trade of the franchise's best ever player.  This is an obvious strawman/misrepresentation of my argument. The offer was four first round picks, and three players. He's representing it as the offer is Gordon Hayward for AD straight up.  Again, malicious and ignorant response, but I keep trying to generate discussion:  &gt; Hayward is worth a minimum contract, yes or no?  For which he deflects with:  &gt;Hayward is not on a minimum contract until 2021. Yes or no?  This obviously has nothing to do with anything we're talking about, and at this point I'm sure I'm being trolled. I recognize that and move on. From there, him and his buddy start tagging me and responding to all my comments in the thread (and this one) with shit talking / trolling / baiting.  Hope that clears things up for you, though I'm almost certain you're either an alt of his or you're trolling me as well. If so, well done."
LeBron James best coach and GM
"And he is doing it against one of the top teams in the league while LeBron plays last quarters just like any other quarter against the Suns, Hawks, Grizzlies etc.  and he is not the one to blame because he has 27/7/7.   James Harden didn’t have Chris Paul and Clint Capela for a stretch and Rockets was out of playoff picture. He averaged fucking 40 for a month and had multiple 50+ games to keep them in the race. At one point even Eric Gordon was injured for a few games and everyone joked he was gonna get 60 and he actually did it while his best 3 teammates were out lol.   Harden could score 30 in a loss and say I didn’t have any help, but sorry LeBron, you are not even the best “James” in the league anymore. Not because you don’t score 40, it’s because you don’t shoot more than 20 shots just to get an ‘efficient loss’ lmao. "
Huh? I'm just saying James Harden put his team on his back this year shits impressive. Lebron got injured half way through the season. But I guess context doesn't matter around here. 
"What if you came back 3-0 against the Lakers with LeBron as the coach and Kevin Love as GM. Delly is of course, the defensive coordinator and your star player is Bronnie James"
"&gt; The raptors have been a lot more accommodating to kawhi than the spurs were,    ? Spurs changed from 2013/14 beautiful ball movement to kawhi isos after isos just to accommodate him.  &gt; and have no doubt made an effort to make him feel more like the face of the franchise than Pop and the spurs ever did.    Even before Kawhi actually became good, Pop has already started pushing for him to be the face of the franchise. Its part of the reason he even won finals MVP that year, not just because he defended lebron james.   &amp;#x200B;  I get that people feel that kawhi is expressing more emotions and feel more fun now, but imo that is just the media at work. I look at kawhi now and kawhi on the spurs, they behave exactly the same way, just that previously, the media didnt portray him when he was smiling or complaining or shouting and-1, and now they do it. He has always done that. "
The curse of LeBron James happened. For all his greatness he is very toxic. He wanted Eric Spoelstra fired from the heat but Riley didn't  putt up with his BS. One of the reasons I feel he left Miami was because he knew he couldn't have his way with Riley there. Embarrassing and disrespectful what he did to David Blatt in Cleveland even though he got a title out of it. The whole Fiasco with AD was pathetic he is as much responsible for that as is the whole Laker's front office. At this point in his career as he is fading away who would want to play with him and his immature diva like behavior? 
"yeah, because he was in the EAST. look at him now lmfao. first year in the west and he’s not even making the playoffs LOL. missing the finals isn’t a stain on your resume. people don’t make the finals every season of their career. a stain on your resume is being lebron fucking james and being outscored by jason fucking terry in the nba finals when you’re the best player in the league, losing to a team you were the overwhelming favorites against. did jordan ever get outscored in the finals by a role player? no. lmao"
"&gt; Lebron leaving in free agency had nothing to do with Pat Riley.  Oh I think you're *very* wrong about that. I've even heard Windhorst say as much. After the Heat lost to the Spurs in 2014, Riley gave [this press conference,](https://youtu.be/AvQIOqixCmk?t=41) in which he challenged LeBron by saying:  &gt; ""This stuff is hard. And you've gotta stay together, if you've got the guts, and you don't find the first door and run out of it.""  Supposedly that really pissed LeBron off. So much so that [this is how he dictated that Riley's pitch meeting for him to stay went a couple weeks later:](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/19233570/why-miami-heat-president-pat-riley-leave-nba)  &gt; The day of the meeting, a hotel bellhop followed them with a luggage cart carrying the presentation and the two trophies. Riley brought wine from a Napa vineyard named Promise. It was the same label Maverick Carter had presented Riley with when they did the deal four years earlier. Riley respects Carter, and when he walked into the suite and saw James with agent Rich Paul and friend Randy Mims but no Maverick, part of him knew the meeting wasn't sincere. He told Elisburg to keep the trophies and easel in the hall. James and his associates were watching a World Cup game, which they kept glancing at during the presentation. At one point, Riley asked if they'd mute the TV. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt; Riley flew home worried and got a text telling him to be ready for a call. About 15 minutes later, his phone rang and Paul was on the other end. The agent handed the phone to LeBron, who started by saying, ""I want to thank you for four years ..."" &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt; ""I was silent,"" Riley says. ""I didn't say anything. My mind began to just go. And it was over. I was very angry when LeBron left. It was personal for me. It just was. I had a very good friend who talked me off the ledge and kept me from going out there and saying something like Dan Gilbert. I'm glad I didn't do it.""  Whatever Riley said though, clearly stuck with LeBron, as he was still making reference to it three years later, in revealing that [Riley's comments to him were his ""secret motivation"" to win a title in Cleveland.](https://twitter.com/TheUndefeated/status/744817068411760640)"
"The 2019 salary cap was just under $102M.   James Harden is going to earn $30M this year. He was already on the books.  Which leaves $72M in space.  Assuming everyone on the roster is moved. And you sign LeBron, and CP3, and keep James Harden. That leaves 9 roster spots whose cap holds have to be counted.  The minimum salary for the NBA is just under $900k. Multiply that by 9 and you're at $8.1M.  Which now leaves $66M in salary left.  CP3 and LeBron were both eligible for the $35M contract. Which is more than the $66M available.   If CP3 took the full discount, it would carry over the full length of his contract because of the 5% raise cap. Essentially costing him $4M a year for 4 years. So $16M in total.  If LeBron took the discount he would be signing the 2+1 deal that he'd been signing for a while. Costing him $8M in total. If he signs the 4 year contract it would cost him $16M as well.  If they split the discount, CP3 would lose $8M and LeBron would lose $4M or $8M.  And that's if they were able to move everyone on the roster without taking any salary back. And there was only one team willing  with cap space that year that could accommodate. The Chicago Bulls. And they could only take on 2 of the 3 salaries that Houston would have needed to move.   And in none of these instance is Capela signing a qualifying offer. They would have to let him walk."
It’s not easy missing the playoffs with LeBron fucking James. It takes a special team
Lebron James and his dad Nate Thurmond
Don't forget about 'Not Lebron James'
"Honestly though what's keeping them from saying anything to him? I've never really understood that this season. The writing's on the wall; they're going to be traded eventually. Everyone in the world is watching and knows the situation. There's nothing keeping a Brandon Ingram or Kyle Kuzma from calling him out in the lockerroom. They've got guaranteed contracts and if they do that, they're just going to get traded to a better situation than what they're in now this offseason.   I honestly can't wait for the team to get blown up so we can start to hear how some of these guys really feel about this. If I'm under 25, I see no benefit in playing with LeBron James."
They definitely didn't expect missing the playoffs though when they have Lebron Fucking James on the roster. You have to fuck up real bad for that to happen.

Luke’s incompetence is getting him fired not LeBron James
"Before Lebron went down with his injury were the Lakers not third in the West? They were doing much better than the Rockets. Did you forget that much?   I’ve checked your post history, you have a clear bias against Lebron James. You need to be able to see both sides.   His team and himself have missed a lot of games. Who is playing the best basketball is a completely different question than who is the actual best player in the league.   Figure it out. James Harden was never the best player in the NBA. You let the narrative fool you. "
"Coming to LA was stupid.   “Hi, I’m Lebron James. People think I deserve GOAT status because I’ve been running shit in against the JV conference for my entire career. Let me go to a young squad in the Varsity conference to get crushed for my last years of relevancy.” "
"Can we stop referring to Lebron as the best player in the world?  He is still a top 5 player, but until he starts playing defense on a consistent basis I can't put him up there with guys like Giannis, and Harden based on what those dudes are doing for their teams this year.   I never thought I would say it, but Harden is unquestionably better on defense than Lebron James is at this point in their careers, and to me there's no argument who is better offensively right now.

LeBron james went to the finals so many times he wants to try something new
"No they just read the headline and came here to make some cliche, karma-farming comments. I was about to point out the same thing till I saw your comment.   Whenever Lebron was guarding by Beverly they were doubling off of Rondo and had another guy camped out near the lane. Rondo played 39 min, Bron played 42 min. Aside from a handful of those minutes they were playing together the whole game. They doubled off of Rondo the entire time he was in. Let’s estimate that to be at about 35 min, give or take a few min. That’s about 35 minutes of being doubled teamed, essentially triple teamed. It’s not like Lebron is gonna go and score 1 on 3 just because Beverly is the main defender. Instead after accepting the double he would pass to the open man.   I’m also a Lebron fan and he has definitely warranted the most criticism, most of it being legit too, of his entire career this season. No denying that but let’s not act like Patrick Beverly, who is obviously one of the best perimeter defenders in the league, just single handedly shut down Lebron James. At this stage of Lebrons career Beverley is certainly quick enough to stay in front of him on any of Lebrons face-up drive attempts but if you put Beverly on Lebron without any help all he has to do is post up to go for 50 lmao. Some of y’all in here talking like Beverley would really stop him in a straight 1-1 matchup. "
"I think the expectations that they'd be a 50 win team were unrealistic, but they definitely should have won more games and made the playoffs. They were a 35 win team last year that added LeBron Freaking James, and will be lucky to win 38 games this year."
The lakers aren’t tanking with Lebron James on their team lol  They have been tanking for almost 5 years now 
"going from ""he's getting in whether you like it or not"" to ""he has a chance"" and ""he can build on is resume"" is changing your argument. I was never arguing against those last two claims.  A ton of prominent basketball writers disagree with you.

You KNOW its bad when the Denver Nuggets are 2 games back from 1st place and LeBron James might not even be in the playoffs...this is weird
"Bruh, you guys are going to miss the playoffs with Lebron James. Don't talk shit when your franchise is pretty trash right now"
I'd be salty too if my team had Lebron James and didn't make the playoffs. 
"James Harden?   You think James Harden is better at basketball than LeBron James?  LeBron James hasn’t had a bad playoff series since when? I can’t say the same about Harden.   Regular season gets all you guys loving the narrative, but I don’t know which James Harden I’m getting during the post-season. He forgets how to shoot the 3 ball. He’s lucky the league gifts him all those free throws to make his averages look nice. "
"Strong disagree, you're drastically underselling Bron's international popularity and how much of a difference social media has made in propagating the sport.

"He is the best player in the league..  His second best player is Kyle Kumza.. take that in for a second. What’s Giannis, Harden, Durant or Curry going to do with that roster? Especially considering how much time they’ve missed. Never had a real time to gel in a tough Western Conference  Every second post on this sub is about Lebron James. That’s why he’s the best player, because people like you can’t stop talking about him. "
"The Lakers had a great young core in Kuzma, Ingram, Ball, Hart, Zubac that would by itself have gotten better with or without James. If the Pels had made the trade it would have been a good team for years to come, even while Lebron+AD+pupu platter of washed vets would have still fucked this season up."
"This is such a ridiculous stat though. He only had 2 FGAs. And Beverley fouled him once. All 23 possessions means is that he got switched on to LeBron at some point during 23 possessions, not that LeBron actually had the ball or when he shot.  ""Matchup possessions are attributed to the player vs. player matchup that occurred for the longest number of seconds on the possession""  It also doesn't count double teams. He scored on Beverley and Harrell in the post in the 4th quarter, for example, and it doesn't show up here.  Beverley was clearly guarding him on this play: https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0021800958&amp;GameEventID=540&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;title=James%202%27%20Layup%20(22%20PTS)%20(Rondo%2010%20AST)&amp;sct=plot  Beverley also came to help here: https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0021800958&amp;GameEventID=624&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;title=James%201%27%20Driving%20Layup%20(27%20PTS)&amp;sct=plot  So, yeah... not going to go much further than that, but this tracking stat is clearly fairly flawed.  Beverley is a fantastic defender, but acting like he ""shut down"" LeBron by linking something like this basically tells me someone did not actually watch the game."
Because he’s LeBron James and tbh he has deserved some of the criticism thrown his way
  1. Lebron James  2. James Harden    3. Steph Curry  4. Kevin Durant  4. Giannis   5. Kawhi Leonard  6. Anthony Davis  7. Paul George  8. Joel Embiid  9. Damian Lillard 
"In a vacuum, they should tank. But in reality, they absolute can't. Tanking is effective, but it's embarrassing for a team with Lebron James to totally admit defeat. There is too much pressure around the Lakers for them to fully throw in the wool "
"Wow, all the hate on Lebron is focused on this season.   Do you really think all the hate is just saying ""Lebron James is currently having a bad season""? People are mostly using his recent failures to invalidate all of his accomplishments from earlier. I've already seen a post saying Harden, Curry and Steph could've all taken the Cavs to the finals last year when that EXACT opinion would've been downvoted to oblivion a year ago. Some people are blaming his season just on being in the West, whereas anyone who has watched Lebron play a minute before this year knows that isn't the reason his team lost to the fucking Suns. "
"Lmao, how did we reach a stage where fucking Ty Lue is demanding big money to have to deal with LeBron James and Magic Johnson?!"
"Oh come on. Are we really going to act like this? Why does Serbia play the US close at the Olympics? Why do 16 seeds led by seniors compete with 1 seeds led by ridiculously more talented freshmen? This Lakers team is bad and has suffered injuries. The Spurs are also bad. The Clippers are too. The Rockets and Nuggets have had worse injuries. This is all true. The difference is that those 4 teams have all had so much time to gel with each other. Do you remember what the Rockets looked like when Carmelo was playing with them? He wasn't even that bad. But he messed with their chemistry so much that some people on this sub legit thought they would miss the playoffs. There was a post recently about how IT is fucking with the Nuggets chemistry. Fucking IT. A similar thing may have happened with him on the Cavs last year. Now if IT and Melo can do this shit as spark plug role players to top seeds, imagine what adding LeBron will do to a teams chemistry. This isn't even new; it has happened every time LeBron has changed teams. This time, though, there are two main differences, and neither of them is the West. The one that everyone is focusing on is that LeBron doesn't have any star power, which is true. Having 2 all-stars helps you turn a slow start into a 50 win season. But it doesn't turn a guy who can lead his team to 60 wins into a guy who can lead his team to 35. So what's the second thing? A basketball team that makes sense. The Cavs made a little bit of sense last year, and because of it, we got 50 wins. I maintain that that team is actually better than these Lakers. It looks bad now, because that is what happens when you take away the piece that connects everything and then also trade everyone else away. I think that the 2014-2018 teams were the best fit teams LeBron has ever played on. These Lakers, though, not only do not fit with LeBron, but they do not fit with literally fucking anyone. This is what happens when you sign by top overall to fill out your roster in 2k, except instead of the end of the bench, these guys are playing rotation and even starter minutes. This team is an embarrassment. You wonder why the Lakers aren't winning but those teams are? The Rockets are built FOR JAMES HARDEN. The Nuggets are built to play together and have been practicing for years. The Spurs are built to be probably the best greater than the sum of their parts team that the league has seen since 2004. The Warriors? They win because they built around Curry (eventually), then added a cheat code. Not the other way around. The Spurs have been doing the same shit since 97. The Heat kinda built around LeBron, but they had so much starpower they could overcome it regardless. The Mavs built around Dirk a million times before succeeding. The Lakers put players who would best utilize Kobe's talents when they won in 09 and 10.

"Fine, it would be worse to watch the Lakers trot out Lebron James, AD, Deron Williams, Joel Anthony and Solomon Hill for 82 games with no picks."
if lebron doesn't cooperate then delonte brings in Gloria James to practices
"Here's what the Shelburne article from today had to say:   [http://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/26137383/lebron-first-season-los-angeles-become-disaster](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26137383/lebron-first-season-los-angeles-become-disaster)  &gt;He talked with Johnson about finding playmakers and guys known for their toughness, which effectively resulted in a roster lacking in shooting and floor spacing. The Lakers went out and got players who fit that description -- who were willing to play on one-year deals.   &gt;   &gt;Johnson said the Lakers didn't want to make the team like the Cleveland Cavaliers all over again for James. But sure enough, James found himself back in a ball-dominant role; though he didn't have the shooters surrounding him to space the floor and open driving lanes to capitalize on his pinpoint passing, like he did in Miami and Cleveland.   &gt;   &gt;Magic was right. It wasn't like Cleveland all over again: Los Angeles is ranked 22nd in offensive efficiency this season with the roster he put together.   &gt;   &gt;But it all could have worked if James hadn't gotten hurt on Christmas Day and missed 18 of the next 19 games. James was just starting to find his footing with this new cast in Los Angeles. The team was starting to get healthy and find enough consistency to develop an identity.   &gt;   &gt;Of course, James did get hurt. And pretty much everything since then has been a disaster."

"Ok u can include the whole season if you want.  Again, there is a bigger picture at play here.  This season was about the young guys developing and clearingnthe books for next summer.  We all knew that in july when the roster formed.    &gt; he can no longer control the game on his own like he used to.  This is ignoring the context of the situation.  Lebron has been coasting in games for years.  He has a switch.  He didnt use it much this year.  But to say its over for his days of controlling games is a very 'prisoner of the moment' hot take.  A lot of people said that last january and had walk that back after the playoff run.  Yes this was a ugly season.  This isnt the last youre gonna hear from lebron james.  "
"This is how people respond that haven't watched more than 10 games of the Lakers this season (or any season for that matter).   Luke Walton was not brought by Magic. LeBron James is not being held accountable by Luke, which is why he can do whatever he wants, which in turn send a disgusting picture to everyone else. Why would they bother if the best player in the world wont? Same goes for the vets.   Also, before you reply some bullshit again, these same problems existed last year, we just were not a no.#1 focus of the media. With or without 1 year deals and LeBron. So, poor coaching and no accountability is what literally thwarts any kind of progress with the Lakers. "
"Right, but here we are correlating ""2-5"" to ""LeBron James said playoff mode"" instead of beating a dead horse on the real reason of the Lakers have a really shitty roster."
"&gt; as long as No. 23 is taking the court, this is going to be one of 10 best teams in the NBA. And the second we start to think it’s not, No. 23 will convince us otherwise.

"Look buddy I want LeBron to do well in LA just as much as you, but the fact that you guys have fully embraced GM LeBron James means that this isn’t Magic’s team anymore.  It’s LeBron’s, get on board or gtfo.  You’ll have one solid playoff run during his 4 year contract.  That’s IF they can actually get AD to the Lakers which isn’t happening in the off-season, he’ll get traded to Boston or somewhere like that. "
"Last time your best player missed significant time was in 2015 and you missed the playoffs too.   This is such bullshit. Every year we hear about some unlucky team getting fucked by injuries but of course now that it's the Lakers, we got to hear about ""EVERY TEAM GETS INJURIES"".  Sure. Like losing Andre Roberson is comparable to losing LeBron James."
Philly belongs to Embiid like Miami belonged to Wade. It doesn't matter when you're Lebron James.
"Kobe Bryant is one of the most competitive people on Earth. Most of the basketball community have agreed that Lebron James is higher on the all time great list than Kobe then Lebron joins the lakers. Come on, Kobe definitely enjoys this shit."
That's fine.  MJ was better at the game of basketball than Lebron James.  Call other players the goat if you want.  I know that my statement is true because I actually watched both
"Did anyone actually watch the game? They were double teaming him with a third helper close by just about every time. When he didn’t have the ball bev was fronting James with another helper (usually trez) on the other side.  I didn’t count, but nearly every time lebron made the right pass out of the double team. The clippers strategy was to bait rondo into shooting (which he foolishly did) and make other players beat you. It obviously worked, but bullock and kuzma got many great looks out of lebron post ups but just couldn’t convert.  I’m a lebron fan but even I can see his defense has been shit. His effort in transition has been shit and his attitude has been shit. He deserves his criticism for choosing this shit team and underperforming.  But let’s not cherry pick stats out of context. I feel like I’m taking crazy pills."
Ok now let’s pretend Lebron James isn’t the best player in the league and losing him for 18 games when he’s taking a third of cap space isn’t crazy.
"While I agree due to Lebron’s age and mileage, I also hate the current mindset that guys need to be shit down if you aren’t making the playoffs.   Lots of fans saved up money to buy tickets to a game, for their son or daughter to see Lebron James for the first time, and maybe the only time in his career. If he isn’t gonna deliver a championship, he at least could suit up for 25-30 minutes a night. "

"Dudes just trolling at this point. No one can be that dumb and say LeBron isn't a top 10, let alone a top 5 great. Sure person opinions can place James at 6 or 8 etc but he is definitely a top 10 in a lot of people's eyes. Mine? He's a top 5. "
"I think if LeBron retired and came back (a few years later as a Laker) you'd be spot on. Not trying to say you're wrong and I'm right, just seems like fans won't forget LeBron in a Lakers jersey. Don't forget, the Lakers have one of the best franchises in history. And to have one of the greats join and fail. Well that won't to over so easily. Picture if Jordan went to the Lakers and not the Wizards. No one at the time gave two fucks about the Wizards and honestly, does anyone (besides their current fans) care about the Wizards?   FYI, I'm not basing the Wizards but it's not like the Wizards are well known for having good teams like the Lakers. I feel like the two (Jordan and James) situations aren't comparable for different reasons. No one expected Jordan to take the Wizards to the finals. People are expecting James to take the Lakers. "

"&gt;a little more efficient  a 21.1 percent difference is not a little. it is an incredibly significant amount. steph hit 1 more shot on TWELVE more attempts.   and while the cavs definitely key in on steph, they're clearly not only caring about shutting him down considering how much he shot the ball.   also, steph was primarily guarded by jr smith in the finals. kd was primarily guarded by lebron james. one is a better defender than the other"

"Do you mean because LeBron is on the team that they won’t run sets?If so check this out.   &gt;I want to first dispel the narrative that the Lakers can’t run plays because they have LeBron James on their team. LeBron has played 15 full seasons in the NBA in four different stints with teams. For the first seven seasons with Cleveland, he ran plays. For the next four seasons with Miami, he ran plays. That’s 73% of LeBron’s tenure in the NBA going into this season. It’s the four most recent Cleveland seasons that have bred the idea that LeBron can’t, or won’t, run set plays. Cleveland did, but did have a high percentage of their offense that was primarily based around forcing a switch and then attacking those mismatches with Kyrie, LeBron, or Love, with shooters all around. It was a very legitimate strategy, and one that is very similar to how the Rockets play (and they also mix sets in). They had the personnel to do that. These Lakers do not.  https://www.bball-index.com/luke-walton-lame-duck/"

To be fair Lebron is totally a diva.  Curry is nice and humble till he bombs a couple 3's in a row then he's shimmying down the court.  As far as I know James Harden does in fact have a beard.  So really he's not that far off.

"Coaching LeBron James is hard.  There is enormous pressure and scrutiny. You can lose your job if you lose, as Luke Walton knows now. You can lose it even if you don’t. Ask David Blatt.  The mental grind of skippering LeBron’s teams in Cleveland for three seasons wore down Tyronn Lue, to the point where his physical health failed him. He also won a championship ring and went to three NBA Finals doing the job.  Lue and Walton are friends, and for years over the summer, they would play craps together in Las Vegas. And last summer when LeBron left the Cavaliers, where Lue was coach, to join the Lakers, where Walton was coach, the two coaches dined in Las Vegas to go over what it’s like to coach him.  Whether or not Lue told Walton everything that night, or Walton took it all to heart, we’ll probably never know. But Walton didn’t do with James in Los Angeles maybe the one thing Lue did in Cleveland that endeared him to LeBron for life.  Lue demanded the Cavs’ other top players defer to James and, to a larger degree, he set up Cleveland’s whole system to run through him. Walton never did.    Walton is out as Lakers coach after one season working with LeBron. The decision was mutual — between the team and Walton — according to a Friday afternoon news release. The Lakers, from top to bottom, are a mess (Magic Johnson quit the other day, you may have heard), and Walton is taking the fall for a poor season by the team on the court (injuries and a mismatched roster be damned) more so than anything specific to LeBron.  Lue, meanwhile, has for weeks been mentioned as a strong front-runner to replace Walton. As of Friday afternoon, he had not been contacted by the Lakers. And maybe Lue doesn’t end up getting the job — Monty Williams, a former Pelicans head coach and current 76ers assistant, is also among the contenders — but he is healthy now, working out twice daily with his diet under control and 35 pounds gone from his frame.  Walton never commanded the respect or garnered the same support from LeBron that Lue received in Cleveland. Lue would still have it the moment he walked through the Lakers’ doors in El Segundo.  There are some stark differences in how the two coaches managed their superstar.  When Lue was promoted from lead assistant to head coach in the wake of the Cavs’ firing of Blatt in January of 2016, the first thing Lue did was demand that All-Stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love put their brands aside and defer to LeBron on the court. Cleveland’s offense, of course, ran through LeBron before Blatt was fired, but Lue put it in writing.  Walton never made the same demands of Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma or Brandon Ingram. The offense in Los Angeles was set up totally different, too. Walton told The Athletic that he prioritized pace above all else — get the ball to anyone, if not LeBron then Ball, Ingram, Rajon Rondo or Kuzma, and sprint up the floor. If it doesn’t find its way into James’ hands, so be it.  Part of that, inarguably, was due to the Lakers’ roster. It lacked spot-up shooters and the specialists LeBron had in Cleveland (not to mention two other All-Stars). Also, LeBron’s scoring (27.5 points per game), assists (8.0), and usage rate (30.9 percent, about as high as it ever was with the Cavs) suggest that the Lakers didn’t exactly ignore him.  But there wasn’t the same edict of LeBron running the offense that was established in Cleveland, which is an amazing statement given that the Cavs were often chided for not really running a true “system” on offense. The system there — Lue’s system — was to run everything through LeBron.  “We had our system coming into training camp, and it was similar to the last few years,” former Lakers center Ivica Zubac told The Athletic. Zubac was traded to the Clippers in February.  “We all knew LeBron was the guy, but no, that’s not how it was,” Zubac said of the lack of orders to play through James. “Luke wants to play fast and he said it right after camp started. I think we played the right way until LeBron got hurt, and then we just didn’t have enough to win.”  Yes, LeBron’s serious groin injury suffered on Dec. 25 wrecked the Lakers’ season. They were 20-14 when he got hurt. They totally unraveled after that.  But the way the Lakers were playing offensively when LeBron returned (after a 17-game absence) bummed him out and caused him to lose faith in Walton, sources said. James’ feelings manifested on defense, where he was moving less than maybe he ever had in his first 15 seasons — to the point where he either looked disinterested or hurt.  He was discouraged, but it took him time to realize that the Lakers, Walton and his teammates in Los Angeles didn’t embrace him and his game the way he was embraced in either Miami or Cleveland. And he reciprocated with his relative disinterest on defense.   Luke Walton’s offensive system was much different than what LeBron James had in Cleveland. (Brian Spurlock / USA TODAY Sports) Which leads to another place where Lue earned LeBron’s respect in Cleveland: He challenged him, immediately.  The same day Lue made his demands of Irving and Love, he said the Cavs — LeBron first — were not in good shape. James didn’t love the comment, but he pushed to improve his conditioning.  In March of 2016, LeBron’s behavior was getting a little loopy. He gave an interview to Bleacher Report in which he said he hoped to finish his career playing with Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul (none of them were on the Cavs, of course), and he also clowned around at halftime with Wade during a game in which the Heat were pounding Cleveland by about 20 points.  Lue and then-Cleveland general manager David Griffin reprimanded LeBron, telling him to cut it out. His feelings were hurt — James unfollowed the Cavs that night on social media — but his game quickly took MVP form, carrying the franchise to its only title that June.  There were any number of grievances Walton could’ve aired against LeBron, from his poor defense to showing up at his first game after being injured sipping wine to his failure to connect with the younger Lakers. According to ESPN’s Dave McMenamin, during a team meeting in Memphis, some of those teammates even called out James for his poor body language.  There are no known instances of Lakers management holding LeBron accountable, which is something he craves. After the All-Star Game, The Athletic reported that Johnson was preparing to say something to James about trying harder in the second half of the season. LeBron, in turn, said he was activating his playoff mode early, but it was a failure to launch.  To be clear, LeBron never undermined Walton the way he did Blatt in Cleveland. James explicitly didn’t trust Blatt, a rookie coach, and even usurped powers (such as whether or not the Cavs participated in pregame introductions) that normally belonged to the coach.  LeBron didn’t do that to Walton. The two came from the same NBA draft class of 2003. James’ praise of Walton as a coach was sporadic and lukewarm, but they didn’t clash. Walton just didn’t reach LeBron the way Lue did.  About a month ago, I asked Walton if he found what Lue told him about coaching LeBron to be true.  “Yeah, he’s great to coach,” Walton said.  It’s no longer his job to do so. If Lue is hired, he’ll probably follow his own advice when it comes to LeBron."

"It's kind of hard to have a half-court offense when you have absolutely no spacing you goof. The Lakers had the worst percentage on wide open 3-pointers this season.  Did you watch the Lakers this year? Did you see how no one was scared of their ability to beat them from deep so they doubled with impunity? How the Lakers played 4-on-5 anytime Rondo was on the floor( Which was a lot of the time).  This shit isn't hard, man. You're going to run into trouble in the half-court, even with players like LeBron James, if you don't have spacing. Teams can double and pack the paint freely."
"What your saying is less accurate than the title.. yes it’s a public school but LeBron and his foundation had a very direct hand in its foundation. He didn’t just donate.  Literally the first search result:  “*In 2011, head of the foundation and professional basketball player LeBron James was researching the high school dropout rate of his hometown Akron and decided upon review to create the “I PROMISE” initiative, focused on supporting the youth in his childhood community.  In November 2017, the Foundation expressed to the Akron school board their desire to create a school that aims to assist disadvantaged children with their studies. The plans were approved later that month and subsequent development of the school was initiated.*”"
no bc kevin durant lebron James and giannis exist
Last season it worked out properly a lot more than it did this season. This season we rarely saw that brand of basketball get changed because LeBron James inherently changes your offense.
Those are pretty amazing results. I'm interested to see where they end up in year 2 and if the growth continues. If they could just become average students that would be incredible. Next step is seeing if this scales up. That would be hilarious if a LeBron James school found the way to fix low performing schools.
"Kevin Durant surrendered the chance to possibly claim more MVPs and scoring titles in order to be better positioned for championships. He swapped out nearly a decade of goodwill from rabid supporters in exchange for a deluge of venom. And he gave up the aw-shucks charm of relatively quiet anonymity for round-the-clock, nitpicking scrutiny. But ask him if being a member of the Golden State Warriors has been all that he thought it would, and Durant responds without hesitation.  “Of course,” Durant said in a recent conversation with The Athletic.  Durant’s alliance with the Warriors has been mutually beneficial, and neither side should be upset if these playoffs turn out to be the end of their dynastic run together. The two championship rings and Finals MVPs are what was expected when Durant posted a picture of himself, arms folded, in that sleeveless T-shirt, and declared on The Players’ Tribune that the rest of the NBA would be playing for second place until further notice. That success has come with some stress — some from the outside, some self-inflicted — but this experience has been rewarding nonetheless.  “I came here knowing for a fact, that every media member, every fan was going to call me every name in the book for however long I was here and I was going to take the brunt of everything. I knew coming here,” Durant said. “But I wanted to be a part of this so bad, I didn’t give a fuck. Same with LeBron. He took all of that heat, no matter what.”  In three seasons in Oakland, Durant has learned to move better without the ball and developed the kind of ball-handling needed to consistently make plays for others and get any shot, from anywhere he wants. His shot remains a lethal weapon, but he can be more discretionary surrounded by more offensive threats.  Oklahoma City ran a perfunctory, facile offense that only popped because of the explosiveness and unpredictability of Durant and Russell Westbrook. The Warriors have been a graduate school education for Durant, forcing him to improve not only as a player but also as a teammate capable of sharing and ceding the spotlight as the situation warrants.  “I enjoy the way they played basketball. I never played with shooters like that. That moved. That were versatile players. I wanted to be a part of that,” Durant said. “My game was talking to me. Not that other shit. The spirit of the game was talking to me. Not the spotlight or the fame that comes from being the best player. Not the legacy. I swear on my life, that don’t mean nothing to me. How I build myself up in this NBA life, it doesn’t mean anything to me. I just want to play great basketball every second I’m on the court, and that was a perfect opportunity for me to do so.”  What Durant doesn’t possess are the kind of mind-blowing, get-on-my-back performances that players on teams with inferior individual talents ride into the record books and MVP conversations. His former Thunder teammate and reigning MVP James Harden just completed the greatest offensive season since Michael Jordan was demolishing scoreboards three decades ago.  Harden is about to finish no worse than second in MVP voting for the fourth consecutive season. Though he hasn’t finished higher than seventh since joining the Warriors — and is unlikely to finish much higher this season — Durant said he isn’t envious of the recognition other players are receiving. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Paul George could bump him from first-team all-NBA, an honor that, surprisingly, he has claimed only once since his MVP year in 2014.  “I watched James and I see what he’s doing and I admire what he’s doing and I appreciate what he’s doing,” Durant said. “Before, I would’ve been, ‘Fuck, I wish that was me.’ But now, I can appreciate the game even more because I’m so secure with my game. I don’t have to go out there and shoot every time for people to recognize me. I’m cool with it, you know what I’m saying?”  The Warriors are again favorites to win it all, with the addition of a playoff-starved DeMarcus Cousins tipping the odds even more in their favor. Becoming the first team since Bill Russell’s Celtics to win at least four in five years is the motivation, since the Warriors have proven most all other points. But this season has been a challenge unlike any other for an organization that has been blamed for ruining competitive balance.  Boredom and maintaining good health aren’t the only obstacles impeding the opportunity to make history. With Durant, Cousins and Klay Thompson set to become free agents this summer, and Draymond Green facing the same situation next year, the sense that this is the last dance for this dominance has resonated throughout the league, providing hope that the Larry O’Brien trophy won’t just set up permanent residency in the Bay Area.  This summer, Durant is set to make another seismic decision that could alter the landscape of the league for years to come.  From majority owner Joe Lacob on down, the Warriors haven’t let Durant’s future, and the constant rumblings surrounding it, disrupt what they’ve set out to accomplish. The competition has improved this postseason, and the rest of the league has caught up to a style of play that sent shockwaves throughout the league once Steve Kerr took over as head coach. But the Warriors still have the edge in talent, with a starting lineup of five all-stars, including two MVPs. After winning his first title, Durant recognized that it didn’t automatically fulfill him, mend any fractured relationships in his personal life or remove any worry; winning merely validated his dedication to the craft. That realization has resulted in some dourness and complicated his relationships with a team, a franchise, that has made joy so much a part of the equation. He’s had fun but is still searching.  This season has provided some displeasing moments — the Draymond Green public spat against the Warriors’ first-round playoff opponent that needed to be hashed out, privately over a bottle of wine; and rumors about Durant heading to the New York Knicks that reached a crescendo after a cap-clearing deal at the trade deadline. Having to address those situations has been annoying and caused him to lash out in response.  Given the scorn he endured for leaving Oklahoma City, and the perception among some bitter fans that he wasn’t fully committed in his final season with the Thunder, Durant is sensitive to any suggestion that he isn’t all-in for right now. His game is talking, commitment resonating with each slashing dunk or pull-up, foul-line jumper. But everyone seems to be listening to everything else.  If he could control the narrative, Durant would want the focus to be on how much he has evolved as a player with the Warriors, how he has become more efficient and engaged as a playmaker and defender. His versatility and dynamic skill set are unique for a player his size. And with LeBron James unable to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to the playoffs, a few more have reluctantly conceded that he is now the best player in the game. A rare superstar without a legion of diehard Stans, Durant knows what he believes but won’t waste his energy trying to make the argument for others.  “Comparison is a need for joy,” Durant said. “It takes a long time for you to realize that as an NBA player, especially when you’ve been pumped up, as soon as you come into it, you’re promoted a star. You always want to compare yourself to the next guy or the guy that did it before, the MJs, the Kobes, the LeBrons, to rookies. I want to compare myself to my teammates. When you compare yourself at all times to see what guys are doing, you’re taking away from the focus of trying to make yourself the greatest that you can be.”  Wherever Durant decides to play next season, that team will get a player who is undeniably better than when he arrived in Golden State. The Warriors remain optimistic that the appeal of becoming something historically great and moving into a sleek, new arena in San Francisco will persuade him to stay. They don’t need to make much of a recruiting pitch because they’ve provided the results and winning culture that he sought.  Although his accomplishments have been discounted by some because the Warriors remain Stephen Curry’s team, Durant understands that leaving the Warriors’ best potential rival, the Thunder, removed the lone impediment to Golden State’s dreams of domination. Durant’s decision to add some duper to an organically built super team topped what James did by teaming up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami. It also denied James the opportunity to make more than one ring in Cleveland part of his legacy.  Having has spent much of his career in pursuit of James, using his success as a barometer for what he needs to accomplish, Durant now has a chance to tie him in championships and capture the three-peat that would put him in select company alongside Russell and Jordan. He’s in that position because he’s endured the storm, all for chasing what had eluded him in previous places.  “I’m from Washington, D.C. I went to Oklahoma City for eight years. Out of nowhere, I went to the Bay for three years,” Durant said. “I’ve been roaming my whole life. I never had no stable environment. Ever. Ever. Since I woke up. I sacrificed a lot of shit to be here and to change my game up to be with these guys. And it was worth it.”"
"https://people.com/sports/lebron-james-i-promise-school-students-improve/  ""Coming into the school, reading comprehension scores for third- and fourth-grade students were in the lowest percentile, the Times reported. Today, third graders have advanced to the ninth percentile, while fourth graders rose to the 16th. In math, third graders were in the first percentile and have since jumped to 18th. Fourth graders went to the 30th percentile after being in the second.""  I think they are measuring growth by what percentile they were in the previous year vs the current year. Even though their current percentiles are low it's amazing what's happening after just one year and they must be really onto something if these growth trends continue."
"Probably because curry was healthy or at least close enough to fully healthy.  He had played over a full series prior with max minutes running all over the court.  Just a pathetic excuse.  Sure the warriors had things not go perfectly but nothing even close to Kyrie and Love being out for a full series.  The Cavs in 2015 had no chance to fight back,  the warriors in 2016 were still largely intact with all major players on the court for almost every game.  Everything else is just overblown and an excuse.  Bogut played like 10 minutes per game in 2016 and was benched per coaches decision like 3 games in 2015 before you try to over exaggerate his importance because like I said it’s not even remotely close to Kyrie and loves importance.  Lebron had Kyrie but was still far far and away the best player so to say he was bailed out and compare it to Durant joining the warriors after they lost is laughable.    Curry did not torch us in 2015.  He had a couple bad games and didn’t really pop off or stand out very often hence why he didn’t even win FMVP.  He just cruised by a Cavs team that had like 7 playable players including James Jones and delly.  he benefitted from facing a team absolutely decimated by injury and totally fatigued by the end.  Delly had to be fucking hospitalized after one of the games due to fatigue lol. The fairest matchup was won by the Cavs.  The Cavs would have won healthy in 2015 and they would still be winning if daddy Durant didn’t come along.  Curry just wasn’t enough."
"Eh, I'd rather be a hero to a smaller city. Give me Cleveland and the LeBron James treatment, SLC and the Stockton worship, etc. I'm not much of a partier and nothing you do will ever be enough for the fans in NY or LA, so I'll take a quieter city where everyone loves me and I can just hang out."
"No, it’s just because there’s only one thing to win in the NBA and a well structured team of five non-stars will often lose to a team with one superstar. It might become less of a big deal with the 3 pt shot becoming a big equalizer but generating open looks is still what a superstar does.   You can’t win without a superstar. Spurs wouldn’t even have one ring without Duncan. The Mavericks had everyone else step up to surround a crazy Dirk run.   It also matters if you’re in the East or West, if you’re a free agency destination, if you’re even lucky enough that players remain healthy. I wouldn’t say the Pelicans have failed. In a “healthy” season they swept the Blazers and me the Warriors.   People say the Cavs FO sucks but if KD doesn’t join the Warriors they have a very good chance of two rings. People have poor memories and think that this GSW side was all-time *before* KD. They struggled with injuries and Klay’s dropoff.   Basketball is a team sport but not that much of a team sport. You get a LeBron James or a Tim Duncan and you’re set. Until then you collect assets until the league pushes you out. There’s no other way (barring a sudden Kawhi Leonard)."
"It's a past his prime LeBron James who either doesn't, or can't play defense any more."
"Yeah KD couldnt win by himself, he's a bum, says that LeBron James guy, also that Kobe chucker, and that big fat oaf named Shaq, that idiot Michael Jordan couldn't win without Scottie either, teams should be glad they haven't had the misfortune of having any of these bums."
I have news for you. Not one player in the league comes close to running the shots like lebron James.
"[This analysis](https://www.nba.com/article/2018/06/02/finals-film-study-lebron-james-stephen-curry) supports your argument /u/namastex.  On the Cavs final possession in regulation was the first double team.  Help defense though, especially when Curry was guarding James, was happening each play, by multiple defenders."
"It's totally nuts, but completely accurate anyways.  [Here's a Bref comparison to the top five](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1_select=LeBron+James&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;player_id2_select=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=antetgi01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id3_select=James+Harden&amp;y3=2019&amp;player_id3=hardeja01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id4_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y4=2019&amp;player_id4=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id5_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id5_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y5=2019&amp;player_id5=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id6_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id6_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y6=2019&amp;player_id6=westbru01&amp;idx=players)  I think the main thing is Westbrook is by FAR the worst shooter of that group of six.  TS% of .64, .64, .63, .61, .59 for the top five and .50 for Westy.  He's only shooting 43% overall.  I'm not saying this makes him bad, but it does mean he's not in the god-tier.  Everyone in the top five is putting up more points AND much better efficiency than Russell.  Add to the fact that I don't think his rebounding is as impressive as it looks (most DRBs in general are 'replaceable' by other players and especially in his case) and it's pretty solid.  An interesting point to note is that he's noticeably declined since his insane MVP year.  Actually quite a lot I think.  His usage was 41% that year (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) with a TS of 55%...  which is hard to even process.  With Paul George joining the team he's now only using 30% of possessions, but rather than getting more efficient he's declined to 50% TS%.  Crazy but true."
"You have to be an idiot to think that Lue can coach. His entire system was run iso plays with LeBron and let him drive, shoot, or kick to shooters. He was fired after James left for a reason. He's a figurehead and nothing more."

"For starters, I imagine the AAU/club teams have money behind them.  Then it doesn't hurt that you live with Lebron James.  If they're living with him (vs staying in Cleveland, or living in LA while he signed elsewhere) I imagine they'll pick up a thing here and there."
lebron stans turning every negative about james into a positive
How has he done good work? His young core blows and he just missed rthe playoffs with lebron fucking james
"To simplify this, anyone that has Lebron fucking James on their team and is bitching about it, is entitled.   Blame everyone but Lebron. Literally everyone else, if the team was healthy and certain trades cough Zubac cough didn’t happen, you guys would potentially be in the playoffs and legit threats. After a decade. Due solely because of Lebron. And I fucking hate Lebron."

Plus their bench cant be too bad if they have Lonzo and Ingram. Lonzo defense and game planning was great and Ingram was doing good Post All-Star Break. I aint a hater or a dreamer, but this doesnt seem too bad of a plan."
**Breaking News** LA Lakers hire LeBron James as a Player-Coach.
"That's poor wording by NYT, multiple other news sources point out they have students in the bottom ten. Here's one among many:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wkyc.com/amp/article%3fsection=news&amp;subsection=education&amp;headline=lebron-james-i-promise-school-touts-improved-test-scores-narrowing-of-achievement-gap&amp;contentId=95-fafb5af0-b7a1-4179-a28f-27125bc70826"

"There is truth to this idea that Walton is bad at that aspect of the game, some of the Lakers sets look off. However, lacking a great offensive system does not have to be the death of a coach. His defenses out performed expectations so while he may not have fully grasped offense, he likely did have a handle on one side of the floor. He also had this team playing well prior to the injury. A team that was terribly constructed beyond Lebron James. You can harp on player development being his only quality, but he was having real, in the court success beyond that.   Part of the issues with how the Lakers played has always been the lack of shooters. They’ve never had good shooting on this team and that can hold back any coach. He was overcoming that prior to the injury. His rotations were questionable at times, but I struggle to necessarily buy that as a reason to fire him. No fan base likes the rotations of a coach. No one ever understands why they play certain guys or why they take guys out. That’s how it works."
"Everything that leaves us, becomes better.  Watch the Kings be in the playoffs next year, and us missing on an #8 seed with LeBron James."
If Lebron James called me the greatest I would believe it

If I'm the Lakers I try to trade Lebron James and the circus that surrounds him for Anthony Davis then sign Kyrie Irving and build around that.
"LeBron James looked at himself in the mirror and was like, “Man, I definitely feel blessed to be here, with this meme team, with this shambled organization.”"
"Woj: ""Lebron James has requested a trade to the New Orleans Pelicans"""
"Monday:  *Pelinka has announced that he has fired himself. The Lakers are looking to fill a GM role, with LeBron James and Rich Paul being named as the front-runners for the position.*"
"I mean there is no real subjective way to rank players, but this is how I look at it. Stats can do a poor job of showing the full picture because of the difference in eras and other things, so I think MVPs, Rings, and Finals MVPs are the best way to rank the absolute GOAT players.   MVPs I see as the most important of the three because it is the most individual. So Kareem with 6, then MJ and Russell with 5, and then Chamberlain and James with 4. That is a good start. I have a hard time ranking Chamberlain and Russell in the top 3 all-time just because of how different the league was when they played. So that leaves MJ, LeBron, and Kareem.   MJ has 6 rings, 5 MVPs, and 6 Finals MVPs for a total of 17 ""points"".   LeBron has 3 rings, 4 MVPs, and 3 Finals MVPs for a total of 10 ""points"".  Kareem has 6 rings, 6 MVPs, and 2 Finals MVPs for a total of 14 ""points"".  So I would rank the top 3 all-time as...  1. MJ (17)  2. Kareem (14)  3. LeBron (10)  This is a pretty fair look at the GREATNESS of these players, and I say greatness like that because I think that is different than who is the BOAT, Best Of All Time. This is a pretty arbitrary way of looking at it but its all for fun so screw it."
"According to Forbes' Kurt Badenhausen, superstars LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant — the top three total earners in the league this season — will all make more money in endorsements than they will from salaries and bonuses in 2019."
Sorry I don’t overrate Lebron James this season.
"At one point in a scrimmage, sources said, James turned to coach Luke Walton and screamed, ""I don't (bleeping) need your orange slices. I can win vitamin C sufficiency without it."" James left teammates and coaches largely speechless. He dominated the gym in every way. Lebron is back."
"I don't know why he's seen as a bad coach either. David Griffin has said that other coaches around the league would joke about Ty Lue embarrassing them with his in-game adjustments and playcalls  &amp;#x200B;     &gt;DG: There's a really big disconnect between front offices and coaches. Ty Lue never got any love and respect from the front offices, and yet if you ask coaches -- and I know this because I've seen this conversation take place among many coaches sitting together in Las Vegas -- if you ask coaches which head coach makes the best in-game offensive adjustments , Ty Lue's name comes up very, very quickly. But the front offices aren't revealing any of that because they're not in the war room every day with their coaches trying to draw plays to stop teams.   &gt;   &gt;I remember vivdly, Dwane Casey looking down at Ty Lue in a second round game, coming out of a timeout and almost going zone half of the time because he's like ""you're not going to embarrass ME with one of those quick hitters after a timeout."" Ty's so good at it he's in coaches heads, but he gets no love whatsoever from the front office and I found that to be really, really interesting. And I think just as Steve Kerr is somewhat hamstrung by the greatness of his roster, Ty Lue was hamstrung by the greatness of Lebron James. I think the thing I'm most excited to see in the NBA is after this season, these questions about head coaches -- will Ty Lue start to get some of the respect he deserves?

"Because the lakers sucked, he got hurt, everyone got hurt, poorly coached, no shooters, no bench. Zero people alive would of taken the lakers to the playoffs under the same circumstances. Not sure how you can really even deny that.   They can win all the titles they want. Still will never be better than LeBron James at basketball."
“Trade me to the clips.” Demands LeBron James.
So far under his tenure there has been   * signing LeBron by the Lakers brand history alone  * signing a bunch of one year deals to form the meme team   * alienating the young Lakers by offering them all for AD and having the trade fall through.   * missing out on Paul George.   * turning away Brook Lopez who wanted to return for a low cost  * turning away Boogie Cousins would wanted to sign a one year deal.   * forming a team that missed the playoffs with LeBron James on the roster.
"That LeBron James is stratosphere’s above KD as a basketball player and the only reason KD even has rings is because Steph had to call him crying to come help him take out Lebron. KD turning the ball ofer 9 times, shooting like 7 shots, taking a backseat to his teammate. It’s all cool when KD does it."
"From a 2012 article after the anti-flop rule was introduced:  &gt;When guarding LeBron James, undersized players may not get the benefit of the doubt anymore.  &gt;MIAMI -- It's one of the most memorable images of the 2011 NBA Finals.  &gt;LeBron James, all 6-foot-8 and 270 pounds of him, couldn't take advantage of J.J. Barea in the post. James tried backing down Barea, who weighed about 100 pounds less than James soaking wet. But Barea fell upon contact and got the charge call after some, let's just say, artful exaggeration.  &gt;And James shied away from doing that again for the rest of the Finals, offering his detractors a convenient illustration of James' perceived lack of so-called killer instinct and appreciation for the post. The Heat lost that series and Barea was heralded as some sort of James kryptonite, if only for a few possessions, primarily because the diminutive former Mavericks guard was a very convincing actor. By most accounts, Barea flopped and got away with it.  There you go. Stop getting your basketball opinions from facebook."
"From the same post:   &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;Did anyone actually watch the game? They were double teaming him with a third helper close by just about every time. When he didn’t have the ball bev was fronting James with another helper (usually trez) on the other side.  \&gt;I didn’t count, but nearly every time lebron made the right pass out of the double team. The clippers strategy was to bait rondo into shooting (which he foolishly did) and make other players beat you. It obviously worked, but bullock and kuzma got many great looks out of lebron post ups but just couldn’t convert."

"People don’t understand James harden is in a system that works for him and therefore his stats are inflated because he runs the offense, mind you the game today has changed... less defense, the 3 is used more, etc. if wade was in his prime Right now he avg. around the same points as harden - easily 30pts plus, not assist tho. Wade was a 2 way player, Harden is an offensive machine/genius. My answer is no. DWADE ‘06 FINALS PERFORMANCE IS STILL THE GREATEST IN MY EYES. And if you’re into stats....PER says so. HARDEN IS ALREADY A TOP 10sg of all time. WADE is the 3 best sg of all time. Lmk when beard gets 1 chip.

"&gt; Staring at this photo long enough made me realize all of the clues that have been dropped all season long:  https://i.imgur.com/dgeOLoi.jpg  Wade's final season - he was drafted 5th, behind Carme7o, Dark0, CBosh, and LBJ. The whole Banana boat is there to witness his retirement. Is it just a sending off of Wade? Or is it something more?  Dirk saves announcing his retirement till the final home, knowing it would overshadow Wade and Melo. Dirk is the ONLY sure fire hall of famer non-Spur/Non-Warrior to beat Lebron, Bosh, Me7o, or Wade in the finals.  The look from wade in this photo isn't one of derision, deference, or depression, it's the look of a man who is staring into the eyes of another man who has made the Decision of a generation.  Soon after the realization that Dirk is retiring, Ervin ""Magic"" Johnson puts the pieces together. He sees the writing on the wall. All of his brilliant work, maneuvering, and countless behind the scenes conversations have added up to this moment - Lebron James is retiring.  I know what you're thinking as you read this Stephan A - and let me just say, check with the sources, the sources that are closest to you.  These situations aren't the fabric of r/nba's collective imagination. These are the weaving of the tapestry of fate. Magic leaves unexpectedly, Dark0 has been out of the league for years. Dirk finally hangs it up. The Banana boat can finally shoot Space Jam 2 all together now that they don't have any post season obligations (For those of you that say, what about CP3 I'll simply refer to the fact that he retires every WCF anyway).  ""But LBJ is under contract!?!?! he would never retire?!?!"" - So was Michael Jeffrey Jordan, LBJ's greatest rival for GOAT. LBJ MUST follow in his footsteps.  Wade and Dirk both wanted to avoid the ""Kobe"" like entire season farewell tour. They both embraced their cities in their own way. And a #smalltownkid with #bigdreams from #justasmalltowninOhio has now gone from #believeland to #hollywood.  Mark my words, later today Skip Bayless will have put all the pieces together, and figured out that Magic left because he knew LBJ is retiring, Wade stares into the eyes of LBJ longingly wishing they could play for 10 more years together on the Heatles.  *Edit: Other clues throughout the season-  *Kyrie making up with LBJ (as a way of providing closure)  *Kawhi laughing during his presser because he was the only person in the NBA LBJ knew could keep the secret  *Kristaps Unicorn tweeting ""The truth will come out""  *Paul Pierce has gotten more bitter than ever knowing his most hated opponent will soon not only outshine him on the court, but also as a media member."

"How are you going to skip the fact James Harden and Jokic virtually missed no games? Lebron missed 2 months of basketball. You can't list any team outside of the Warriors who could make it in the playoffs out West after their best player goes down that long.   &amp;#x200B;  If Lillard was out 18 games the Blazers would be outside looking in. No Donovan Mitchell, Jazz are gone. No Russell, Paul George couldn't do. And imagine if Paul George also missed the amount of games Ingram did.      Lonzo and Ingram are prospects. They're young. Before the end of the year there is no track record. To label either as injury prone before this season is disingeuine and ridicilous. If anyone says this roster was so bad they couldn't make the playoffs with LeBron healthy has other biases at work."
No but LeBron James does.

Of course it isn't reliable there is only one Lebron James. Only one team can get him. The whole point of tanking is to get the best possible chance to land that level of talent. You can't win the lottery if you never bet. If tanking didn't have the potential to greatly benefit a team than teams in the league wouldn't do it.
"Just off the top of my head with a few minutes of thinking about it.., 1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kareem Abdul Jabbar 4. Magic Johnson 5. Larry Bird 6. Hakeem Olajuwuan  7. Wilt 8. Kobe Bryant 9. Tim Duncan 10. Bill Russell    Not quite satisfied with my list and im having some trouble remembering all the greats but this will do for now."

OP is a moron. Especially since his very first point is how KD played in the finals *last year*. LeBron James had arguably the greatest playoff run in NBA history last year.
What's with these shit posts? When did LeBron James die?
"Um.........I would like to quote this post from 4 days ago  ""What if we've missed all the clues all along""  ""Soon after the realization that Dirk is retiring, Ervin ""Magic"" Johnson puts the pieces together. He sees the writing on the wall.

[Watch this encounter happen again](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18589897/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-throws-gauntlet-charles-barkley-hater)
Denver's best player played 80 of the 82 games. Jamal Murray played 75. Chris Paul and Capela together only missed 7 more games than they had last year. Not to mention James Harden had to break Wilt Chamberlin numbers while playing 75 of 82 games.      Lebron played 55 games.  Lonzo played 47 games.    Ingram played 52 games.   Rondo played 46 games.      Kuzma gave the team 70 games. However the core and LeBron played maybe only 23-27 games together. If the team should be criticized for anything it should be how injury prone and/or their medical staff. Their personnel seemed equip to fulfil their original goal of reaching the playoffs. Any narrative that doesn't begin and end with talking about their injuries is noise.
Al Jefferson is younger than LeBron James   Although it may have seemed even more unbelievable a couple years ago
There is a reason James Jones stuck around LeBron for all those years. It certainly wasn't because he crawled up his ass.
"I know this thread is about a month old, but just to throw my two cents in there.  Tim Duncan is by far the greatest power forward a long time in my opinion, as far as LeBron James, and a lot of my friends don't like when I say this, but I still have Larry Bird above LeBron James, it's close, but to me it certainly helps when you are clearly the best player at your position ever.  Long story short you can certainly make that case"
I only have one question.  What is LeBron James hiding?
2/3 examples you listed the home team won.  The one where the home team didn't win was because Lebron Fucking James.
"Something I'm not hearing enough about is his mindset.  He has stated that he is a perfectionist competitor and doesn't like to do things that he isn't the best at. This is evident by his play style - he isn't a jack of all trades and the things he does well, he does at an elite level - so we should put some stock into it.  He is working on his jumper. Everyone knows he needs one, and I think the team has a plan. I'm sure the team will want him to start shooting before he thinks he is ready, given his perfectionist attitude. A few people have suggested that he start chucking in garbage time - I bet the team has suggested this and I bet Simmons hasn't embraced the idea. The team has been patient.  Next season will be his third year, and I expect that he will start to shoot wide open threes at least some of the time next year. I think 40-60 3PA is realistic.   I hate to harp on it but this was always going to be an issue when they acquired Jimmy Butler, who isn't a good enough 3 point shooter to fit with Simmons and Embiid. They need to be surrounded by 3 knock down shooters. This will mitigate a large part of the Simmons range problem. It is possible to build that team, and this should definitely be done if the 76ers want to maximize Simmons.  Later, Simmons can and in my opinion, will have a jumpshot. LeBron James has been surrounded by shooters for the better part of his successful career. Do the same for Simmons and he will be successful."
I know right. LeBron James is still alive and well.
Am I saying something crazy? LeBron James just put up 34/9/9 on 62 TS last year.   The year before 33/8/9 on 65 TS  The year before 26/9/7 on 58.5 TS  Stop it Harden can’t touch playoff Bron
This is so dumb there’s no way harden is more efficient in the playoffs than LeBron James idc what the stats say
Lebron James...
"*A century from now, the Magic have won 100 rings in a row, the league is suffering. LeBron Lue Jr, the coach of the Cleveland Lakers, stands in the Cleveland front office talking to his sons and nephews, LeBronto James, Tyronto Lue, TyRaptor James, Le3-1 Lue, and Kevin Love who is now 130 years old and still waiting for the original LeBron's return.*  LeBron Lue: I remember granddaddy LeBron talking about a talisman, he was part of the 76ers during the Dynasty of the Endless Tank. They thought they could end the tank with him, and they did, but they didn't know his true value, and played him. Then he was traded, but no one remembers where to. At this time, Orlando started their run, and I think, and old Kev agrees - don't you Kev?  Kevin Love: [groans] I'm here LeBron, come home.  LeBron Lue: OK ignore him nephews. What I'm saying is, Orlando have the talisman. We need to get him back. His name, is Markelle. If we get him, we can end this Orlando dynasty. We can bring it home to Cleveland.  Tyronto Lue: OK Daddy! We'll get Markelle for you!"
"He gets no credit because he was just a puppet to the real head coach, LeBron James."
"If harden or giannis carries their team to a ring, they would be the best. Kd/curry won’t be till they’re on different teams, and let’s not forget Lebron James who can likely come back as good as he was before injury, making him still the best player lol. I think kawhi is in the conversation too if the raptors win it all.          In reality the warriors will win it all again and no one will be the unanimous best player until after 19-20 season."
Raptors fans using playoff success to talk shit about Lebron James lol
Except the LeBron James cameo.
"It's really unfortunate. Players should be judged based on their individual performance. I hate when people say ""LeBron James"" is 3-6 in the finals. No, those Cavs/Heat teams were 3-6 in the finals"
The success stories of Kawhi Leonard and LeBron James is clouding the fact that most players who can't shoot coming into the league generally don't develop one.
Except guy's like Lebron James and Chris Paul are two of the most intelligent players to ever play and Lebron is arguably the most athletic player ever and Chris Paul was very athletic as well. Being athletic isn't a barrier to being an intelligent player. It's more that athletic and unintelligent players have more leeway than unathletic and unitelligent players so we see the former in the NBA more often compared to the later.
Michael Jordan and LeBron James have entered the chat
LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION
No one mentioned Ohio native LeBron James coming back and help Cleveland get it's first sports championship in over 50 years after defeating a 73-9 team in Game 7 as the underdog.
" Imagine having a losing season with Lebron James, miss the playoffs, GM quits, and your coach fired for the 4th time in 6 years? That'd sure suck to be a fan of that team."
LeBron James  MaBron Fumes   Markelle Fultz
"Eh, his ""choke"" against Warriors is so overblown. He had one bad game 6.   - Michael Jordan shot 5-19 in G6 of the 96 Finals.   - Kobe Bryant shot 6-24 in G7 of the 2010 Finals.   - Larry Bird shot 6-18 in G6 of the 84 Finals.   - LeBron James even shot 9-24(37.5%) in G7 of the 2016 Finals.   Durant had an all time bad shooting game at the worst possible time, but he still played phenomenal defense and rebounded well and created for teammates. And in the other 3 losses, he scored extremely well. 29 points on 72 TS% in , 40 points on 55 TS% in G5, and 27 points on 65 TS% in G7. But yes, let's act like a bad performance in 1 of the 4 losses is the reason they lost the series. Completely ignoring the fact that if it doesn't coincide with Klay Thompson having literally the best game of his entire playoff career, the Thunder blow out the Warriors and Durant's performance is forgotten just like Jordan, Kobe, Bird, and LeBron's."

Paying a rookie head coach with Lebron James on your roster.  Bold move Cotton
"Lebron James 2016  When he cried after they won Game 7, I went from feeling like crap to feeling really joyous for Cleveland. It was similar to what we experienced after winning in 2015. Two franchises that hadn’t won in **decades** going back to back in the Finals was just really good for basketball.   Of course KD, basketball wise, ruined that potential rivalry from expanding further. I hate to say it, as a Warriors fan, but it really messed things up from that narrative standpoint."
"Woj: “LeBron James has requested the Los Angeles Lakers for a trade immediately, as in, he is already planning ahead for his retirement down the road and is looking for a new trade to work beyond playing basketball, all while asking around for advice.”"
DJ “LEBRON JAMES” AUGUSTIN
Lebron James.
*-LeBron James wants to know your location-*
"Which he is. His game is very like Brons IF you take out all of James' shooting ability.   In summary, Ben is not like LeBron at all."
"To be fair, Lebron James won't be scoring points in any playoff games this year."
"Kevin Durant, lebron James, James harden, Giannis Attetokumpo, I gave you 4"
"Durant/James Harden, Lebron, Curry, Kawhi, Giannis, in that order."
"Guy who never made the playoffs  Another guy who’s in his 3rd year and never made the playoffs  One random game in Klay’s career when he’s also consistently played well in the playoffs.  Some random Lebron James cameo/reference.  Youre doing all this mental gymnastics my man to make excuses for an all star scoring 0 points in a playoff game his team lost to a lower seed. Same player also has a notorious history of poor playoff performances  (that youre also trying to make excuses for).  But alas, i will move along"
"The part that makes this move feel even weaker though is that he could have won in OKC, they were up 3-1 against the 73 win Warriors, he’s had a strong supporting cast every year (apart from his first few seasons). Heck, Russell Westbrook and James Harden both went on to become league MVPs, and Ibaka was extremely good too.   People try to equate this with Lebron’s move, but Lebron played with Mo Williams, Anthony Parker, Antawn Jamison and big Z, it really was questionable whether the Cavs could field a winning team. KD’s legacy would’ve been so much better if he stuck it out beat the Warriors the next year, or even beat the Cavs in the finals."
"He's just too small to be considered the best. Kerr appeared on ""[The Lowe Post Podcast](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play?id=19635616)"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP [Kevin Durant](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/345) \- not [Stephen Curry](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/148) \- as the second-best player in the world behind [LeBron James](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/72). Third place in Kerr's mind goes to [Kawhi Leonard](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/4200) for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."" Now add giannis to the list as he is also a tall 2 way player"
"lol i ain't even salty, im amused by how people compare the two, and the fact that your whole minutes spill was bullshit. It don't matter if he averaged 20 minutes for a month, he still averaged more minutes than Giannis at the end of the day. If anything Giannis's stats would be even better if he played the same minutes as AD. Giannis has virtually every advanced metric on his side too. Plus if you actually watched the two play, you would realize how different they are. Giannis primarily operates in the perimeter while AD is more post focused. Plus AD is no where near the playmaker that Giannis is. Really the only thing AD does better than Giannis is shoot and maybe defense(that one is very arguable though because its hard to quantify good overall defense). Litteraly everything else Giannis is superior, playmaking, finishing in the paint, efficiency, most importantly DURABILITY, etc. AD can't give you the same production as Giannis, he is still a superstar but Giannis is in another tier.   I have watched every bucks game this season, and from my observation, He is on a level of overall impact that only LeBron James and Kevin Durant can match. Keep sleeping though, I have always been ahead of the curve on Giannis. I know i am gonna get downvoted for my opinion but hey, I remember how I was getting downvoted last year for saying Giannis is better than Paul George and Anthony Davis. I was be proven right then, and I will be proven right in the future. Yall keep sleeping  😴😴😴"

Just found this link by searching.  https://www.si.com/nba/2018/09/10/top-100-nba-players-2019-lebron-james-stephen-curry-dirk-nowitzki
"I've posted this rant many times before in this sub. I'll just copy and paste it again. Kevin Durant was the best prospect I've ever seen, I would take him first overall in any draft class. Granted, I didn't pay attention when LeBron was around, so I don't have a good view of him, but of the players I've seen Durant was the best.  &gt;Oden was a great college player yes but he was nowhere near as good in college as other big prospects like Blake Griffin, Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, Deandre Ayton, Karl Anthony Towns, and now Zion Williamson. Yes he was a great prospect. He was not Kevin Durant.    &gt;There was a large vocal minority of people who were completely baffled that Durant wasn't going first overall. Read [this mock draft](http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=nbamockdraft/070627) by Bill Simmons. It was absolutely not crazy to consider Kevin Durant. Granted I am nowhere close to as scathing as Simmons is in his criticism of Oden, but my point is that it's not revisionist for me to say I'd take KD over Oden. Oden was absolutely not a perfect prospect. Durant was. Odens counting stats were definitely not bad, he averaged 16/10/1/1/3, on 59% TS and his shot blocking was definitely solid. His 63% from the line wasn't great but for a big it was solid. He played 29 mpg. All of this was great, his rim protection was excellent and he was easily the best player on the Ohio State team that made it to the championship game. He lost to an incredible Florida team that had 3 top 10 picks (Al Horford, Corey Brewer, Joakim Noah). He won the defensive player of the year award. He was a 2nd team all American.   &gt;There is no doubt I would have taken Oden second. He was a very good big man prospect, and he was definitely one of the better prospects of those draft classes, but he wasn't Durant.   &gt;Durant averaged 26/11/1/2/2 on 59% TS including 40% from 3 (6 attempts per game) and 82% from the line. All on 36 mpg. He was the first ever freshman to win the Naismith and he won just about every other college basketball award you can think of. His only blemish was losing in the 2nd round to a USC team, even though he scored 30 points that game. Calling him the best player in college basketball isn't doing him justice, he had one of the best college seasons in NCAA history.   &gt;We are talking a 6'10"" pure forward with a 7'5"" wingspan (bigger than Oden I might add), 9'2"" standing reach, who averaged 26 points per game on incredible efficiency, had the speed and fluidity of LeBron James, who could handle the ball like a guard, shots 40% from 3, 82% from the line, and had just won every award you can possibly imagine. All while he was a 19 year old freshmen in college. Durant was, plain and simple, the best prospect we have seen since LeBron. Oden was also amazing, he was not Kevin Durant."

[Woj] Lakers GM LeBron James reportedly considering renaming franchise to the Los Angeles Cavaliers.
"""Hey, good game man,"" Lebron James murmured to Kevin Love as the Cleveland Cavaliers star player swung his wet towel over his smooth, bulging shoulder.  ""You too Lebron. Take it easy,"" Kevin replied with a sigh as he closed the locker room door. ""Oh, and, try not to give Joseph too much shit, alright? He's talking with coach right now so it's just gonna be you two in here.""  Lebron sat down on the bench and rubbed his temples with frustration. He had just scored 51 points, nearly half of his team's overall points, only to lose the playoff game when Joseph Earl Smith decided to forget the score and run the clock down. Why did J.R. do that? Why did he have to be on the same team as that clown?  Lebron sighed loudly as he began thinking of things to say to him. Should he be angry? Disappointed? How can he make sure J.R. doesn't pull this shit again for the next game? Suddenly, the door flew open as J.R. Smith ran in. ""Lebron! I've been looking for you everywhere man. Look. About the mistake."" Lebron shook his head. ""Joseph, what you did... it really cost us. You can't be-""  ""LEBRON! Remember what you told me that night? February 23rd?"" J.R. bawled as he extended his arm to Lebron's cheek. Lebron stared at his bare feet.  He didn't want to think about the past. It was the playoffs, after all. He can't afford to lose sight of victory; Steph Curry's grinning face would haunt him for another year. ""Joseph, I-"" ""No Lebron. I know what you're thinking. Don't say you won't look through the past.""  J.R. Smith gazed up into Lebron James' big brown watery eyes and grabbed his moist hands. ""Lebron, the jersey I told coach to give you... Number 23. I gave it to you because it was on February 23rd when you gave me hope again. I valued victory over everything - my family, my friends... you. I gave more shits towards Basketball than sending my kids to school. But you stood by my side, and promised to show me the strength in our love by throwing the most meaningful game in your life to prove to me that victory wasn't everything.""  Lebron stepped back and threw J.R.'s hands away angrily. ""You... I should have never promised you anything. I hate you! Leave me alone"" he yelled as he threw his cell phone across the room, with a hand-drawn picture of J.R. Smith and Lebron slipping out of the case.  ""Lebron, I did this for US. You promised me to throw, so I did it for you."" J.R. moved closer to Lebron. They looked into each others eyes for what felt like a millenium to them both. Lebron's beard pressed closer and closer on J.R.'s chin and he wiped a single tear from his face.  ""I love you, Joseph."" ""I love you too, Lebron.""  The crisp locker room air slowly turned warm and steamy as their muscular arms, tattoed with pictures of masculinity, intertwined as they pressed their lips together for the first time in July."
As good as people think Zion will be..there is still a chance that he will turn out to be a bust.  AD is a known top 3-ish player today.  Not a possible top 3 player someday (who might also end up being bad).  You make that trade 10 times out of 10 if you're all in on winning now.  You only pass on that trade if you're betting on the long term and if you're thinking long term then why is Lebron James on your team?
unpopular opinion:  Lebron James deserves heavy criticism for selling Sprite to his community.  He would never drink that poison and slings it to a community already plagued with diabetes.
"Rob Pelinka walks up to his own office, LeBron James is standing out the door, hands folded in front of him and gives him a stern nod, not breaking eye contact until Rob acknowledges understanding with a smile and slight wave. He opens the door and Ty Lue is sitting at his desk. ""Now then Mr. Pelinka, are you ready to begin my interview?"" Rob briefly looks back over his shoulder to see LeBron leaning into the doorframe, slowly nodding with a look of encouragement. Rob adjusts his tie and walks back towards the desk, wondering at what point he lost control of his life."
"I hate the ""talk about..."" so much, especially because it's not even a question, it's just plain obvious that they're fishing for a quote.

Point to me using this doll where LeBron James hurt you
"Why would he want that mess, let's call the situation for what it is, a mess. The job requires tailoring to a 34 year old (will be 35 next season) LeBron James. And if you fail, your repuatation is on the line. Look at Phil Jackson as president in NY and how his name took a hit. I don't think anyone with a historic repuation like Pat or Jerry West is taking the job."

Why haven't they fired Pelinka yet? The GM is LeBron James.
"this is from bball reference &gt;Offensive Win Shares are credited to players based on Dean Oliver's points produced and offensive possessions. The formulas are quite detailed, so I would point you to Oliver's book Basketball on Paper for complete details. The process for crediting Offensive Win Shares is outlined below (using LeBron James of the 2008-09 Cleveland Cavaliers as an example):  &gt;Calculate points produced for each player. In 2008-09, James had an estimated 2345.9 points produced.  &gt;Calculate offensive possessions for each player. James had an estimated 1928.1 offensive possessions in 2008-09.  &gt;Calculate marginal offense for each player. Marginal offense is equal to (points produced) - 0.92 * (league points per possession) * (offensive possessions). For James this is 2345.9 - 0.92 * 1.083 * 1928.1 = 424.8. Note that this formula may produce a negative result for some players.  &gt;Calculate marginal points per win. Marginal points per win reduces to 0.32 * (league points per game) * ((team pace) / (league pace)). For the 2008-09 Cavaliers this is 0.32 * 100.0 * (88.7 / 91.7) = 30.95.  &gt;Credit Offensive Win Shares to the players. Offensive Win Shares are credited using the following formula: (marginal offense) / (marginal points per win). James gets credit for 424.8 / 30.95 = 13.73 Offensive Win Shares."
"Lakers GM Lebron James will be hiring Ty Lue, league sources tell ESPN."
"The game of basketball isnt played with numbers, its played posession by possession execution by execution.  Say something like why didnt Kyrie ever score more than LBJ in those 3 wins and you paint a completely inaccurate contextless picture of what happened. Kyrie and LBJ scored the same amount of points in game 5 okay therefore Kyrie is not more valuable but LBJ was yes sure. LBJ scored one more point than Kyrie in game 7 even though he shot worse, was passive, offense was stagnant in the fourth quarter, and Kyrie broke that stagnation with the game winning basket, but nope LBJs offense clearly more valuable because he scored one more point.   Sorry LBJ doesnt put teammates in rhythm, they lose their rhythm. JR is a streaky shooter who shoots better on contested shots somehow and shot 40/35 during that series. Tristan Thompson doesnt need a rhythm, hes a role player with a defined role who doesnt need the ball to be successful. And then you look at Kevin Love who averaged 8 points a game on 36/26 shooting. Yea definitely LeBron put him into a rhythm. The reality is that all LBJ wants to do is play hero ball and iso ball, and theres no room for Kevin Love doing what he does best to fit next to LBJ, that is the exact opposite of giving KLove a rhythm.  Outside of Irving and James no one even attempted over 10 FGA that series. Doesnt look like rhythm to me.  Even if he was getting his teammates into rhythm, they werent the deciding factor this series. As I said earlier LbJ was getting his rebounds and assists in games 1-4 but he was down 3-1 anyways losing badly. It was not until LBJ turned on his offense did they have a chance to win, and I wouldn't think it right to give the FMVP to the guy who only turned on over halfway in the series."
"&gt;Are you just taking the Lakers record and adding a few wins, or did you also subtract wins from their opponents.  How can I help you understand? (Being Genuine here, you seem to be under the impression I'm presenting you biased statistics when I'm just giving you the raw data).  The Lakers played San Antonio 3 times BEFORE LeBron got injured. And they LOST ALL THREE TIMES. You can't break a tie when you have already lost your first 3 games and only have 1 left to play. This happened in LeBron's first 34 games as a Laker (All BEFORE his INJURY). There's nothing his injury would change about that.  This is a fact. The Lakers lost that tie breaker against SA BEFORE LeBron's injury even happened.  &gt; I think it’s pretty likely in their last 27 games that they could have beaten at least one of those teams to break the tie  And again.... LeBron played 34 games BEFORE he got injured. In those 34 games, he had a 58% win percentage. If you take that exact win percentage and apply it to an 82 game season, it only gets him 48 wins.  &gt; or did you also subtract wins from their opponents.  Why would I subtract wins from a team that beat the Lakers with a healthy LeBron James in the lineup? They earned those wins.  I'm IGNORING ANY GAMES THE LAKERS PLAYED WITHOUT LEBRON.   &gt;Using our brains to look at the situation in front of us is enough for most people to figure out that LeBron missing 27 games had a pretty major negative effect on the team.   And using your brain shows that other teams also lost players due to injuries... which also had negative effects on their team. Even BEFORE LeBron went down, LA WASN'T a playoff team, and when he came back, they were even worse...   &gt; LeBron missing 27 games   You say this a lot and fail to understand the fact that the lakers didn't go 0-27 with him injured. They won some of those games. You can't just add 27 games to their win total as if they'd magically transform into a team that was winning MORE than 58% of its games before he got injured. And you can't ignore the fact that they were playing far worse AFTER he came back from his injury (despite him putting up similar or better stats across the board ie: he nearly averaged a triple double in Feb).   I'm not sure why people are having a hard time believing this. I'm not making any of this shit up. This actually happened....  LeBron James was 28-27 this year. He played 55 games and won  50.9% of them. That barely puts him at 41-41 if you transpose that over an 82 season.   EVERYONE should understand that it's just as likely LeBron wins 2-3 extra games as it is he loses an extra 2-3 games... Giving a team a 6 game cushion to me seems fair and reasonable. You just can't ASSUME he/LA plays better than he/they have all season... that's just flat out dumb and bias. Given that 6 game window... it Puts LA anywhere between 38 and 44 wins.    . I'm just applying LeBron James' ACTUAL record over an 82 game schedule.... It's not complex math, There's no ""subtracting wins from anyone"" because he was there for those games, he either loss or won."
Why do they keep spelling LeBron James as T-Y L-U-E?
"If the best you can say about a coach is that ""he's done some good things,"" then he's probably not the right guy.  Especially if the Lakers job with LeBron James is as prestigious as I think it still is."
"I hate it when people just use these box score stats as if they mean anything.  His rebounds and assists didn't decide this series. In the first 4 games when he was down 3-1 he was getting plenty of rebounds and assists.  He was playing atrocious defense for most of the series so his blocks and steals are nothing to be amazed at either. He had a good block in the fourth quarter of Game 7 against an injured Igoudala great, but that doesn't paint the overall picture of his abysmal defense in the entire series.  At the end of the day, the main determining factor in this series was just putting the ball in the basket. LeBron was not nearly as aggressive as he should have been in the first 4 games, but was still grabbing those rebounds and assists that really had no impact. He had a great game 5 and game 6 along with Kyrie, but he actually didn't play enough to have won game 7 (9/24 shooting on 5 turnovers), Steph Curry and Klay Thompson just played a lot worse than him. It was Kyrie who was every bit a consistent offensive force as LeBron James and was every bit as important, with his ridiculous performance in game 5, in catapulting their early lead in game 6, and made all the big buckets and the biggest clutch shot in NBA history in game 7.   The FMVP should have belonged to Kyrie Irving, the way his offense came in games 5-7 were slightly more valuable than LeBron James' offensive contributions. All the extra box score stats LBJ had had little impact on the outcome of the series."
Jason Whitlock said LeBron James is rich and shouldn't be bothered by racism .
"&gt; One of the worst basketball situations? Worse than Phoenix? Memphis? Or literally any of the other non-contenting teams?  sorry for being unclear. I meant of all the teams floated as a ""possible lebron landing spot.""  Of course theyre not worse than Phoenix, Memphis, or any of the other cities who really shouldnt even have a team.  [Here's an article from before FA last year](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22453452/destination-lebron-where-king-james-land-free-agency-summer)  He shouldve joined the Rockets, Clippers, Sixers, or Spurs. Any of those teams gives him a far better chance at winning a title than he does with the Lakers, but he got pulled in by the allure of the franchise/Magic Johnson, and is going to end up regretting it  LeBron will likely finish his career in an irrelevant march towards the all-time scoring record. With this in mind, I also think staying in Cleveland would be a better basketball legacy decision, as he wouldve been celebrated far more than he will now, as he death marches towards the record on an irrelevant/dysfunctional lakers team"
"Lol why? He's NOT a good coach. Neither is Erik Spoelstra,    &amp;#x200B;  Ty- 128-77 with Lebron James.   Ty without Lebron, 0-6, and fired.   &amp;#x200B;  Coach Spoelstra  passed the first round only ONCE WITHOUT  Lebron that dates back to the 2008-2009 seasons.   Record with Lebron on his roster 224-78,  59-28  in the playoffs   Record after Lebron 209-201.   &amp;#x200B;  So Why Ty Lue? So he can potentially look great while Lebron does all the work like he did in Cleveland? and Miami?"
"&gt;I couldn't find Lebron's record in the CBS sports database, for some reason they list 300 players and not LeBron James so I used the next closest stat I had available.  Probably because he didn't play 60 games. Think you have to play 60 to be in the league leaders and stuff like that.   &gt;Thank you for finding his actual per 100 stat for comparison, as the 2nd best passer in the group it helps his fans claim as best.  No, he's the best. He had 12.1 last year as I already said. You don't just become a worse passer after a season, that's just not how passing works."

"You know what i meant but you had to be a little shit and try find loopholes in my logic lmao.  Let me put it in other words for you  Lebron James - 8 straight finals, just last year dragged Jr Smith and Tristan Thompson as starters to the finals.  James Harden - 9 points in an elimination game without the opponents best player.  But yes a season where Lebron unluckily gets injured missing 27 games on a team where 3 the best players  missed an average of 27 games  between them should totally be what you base Lebrons talent on."
"Yeah, the dude who replaced LeBron James in the Cavs starting lineup"
Im ready for the inevitable trade deadline bullshit where its another Lebron James firesale
Misspelled Lebron James
"Is that you Ty Lue? Are you here gilding everyone? You know what, if I was about to coach the Lakers with LeBron James then I'd come straight to Reddit to celebrate too"
"Ty Lue, Lebron James, maybe Irving, and everyone getting gilded.  Fucking love this subreddit"

"[http://www.espn.com/blog/cleveland-cavaliers/post/\_/id/1068/emotions-run-high-after-irvings-knee-setback](http://www.espn.com/blog/cleveland-cavaliers/post/_/id/1068/emotions-run-high-after-irvings-knee-setback)  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Of course on the other side, the Cavs want Irving to play as long as  he's not seriously hurt. As Irving was limping through the start of the  conference finals against the Hawks, it was easy to identify some mild  friction. As Irving was preparing to get a second opinion, there was a  sense he was being challenged to play through it.  ""It's a  combination of pain management and what the physical symptoms are,"" Cavs  coach David Blatt said at the time. ""It's just a matter of is he  healthy enough to play? Does he feel healthy enough to play? That's  all.""  [LeBron James](http://espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james) talked of the responsibility of playing through some pain when you're a star player.  #   ""Everyone's pain tolerance is different, but my  responsibility is much higher than a lot of guys,"" James said. ""Not only  on this team, but a lot of guys in professional sports, and I take it  very seriously.""  Blatt and James seemed to be trying to offer  perspective and nuance, but perhaps it didn't come off that way. It came  off as a suggestion that it was up to Irving and whether he could  tolerate playing with the pain. A manhood test.  This might not  have been well received. When Irving was declared out for Game 2 of the  conference finals the next day, Blatt took a completely different  stance. Instead of saying it was a matter of Irving's pain management,  this time he said it was the Cavs' doctors who had made the call to shut  Irving down. The Cavs seemed to take strides to make it clear it wasn't  up to him.  There is no easy or clearly right answer here. Irving  is just 23 and he's got a long career ahead of him. The Cavs have $80  million committed to him over the next five years. It is in everyone's  interest to play the long game and be cautious.  Knees are not to  be messed with -- they are the No. 1 cause of ruined careers -- and  Irving is dealing with some pretty significant issues, that much is  clear.  To many, this wouldn't even be a discussion, Irving  would've remained shut down. And the idea of playing him 44 minutes on  the bad knee, as Blatt did in Game 1, was an unacceptable amount of  strain even if he wasn't playing so very well and looking so much  healthier.  But this is also the Finals. There are no guarantees  that Irving, James and the rest of the Cavs will ever have this  opportunity again. It doesn't feel that way; it's a reasonably young  core and their future is bright. Of course, there are so many examples  of such assumptions going off course. What James articulated about stars  having a higher expectation is how many people feel. This could be a  once in-a-lifetime chance, and perhaps that should be computed into the  pain management.  Irving, who would prefer not to discuss his  injuries as in-depth as he's been forced into over the past month, has  no doubt spent a lot of time weighing all these factors. Only he truly  knows how his knee feels. Only he knows the rigors of the rehab he's  gone through again and again just so he can keep trying to get out there  and give the team whatever he has.  Of the past six games the Cavs  have played, he's been unable to finish three because of re-aggravating  the knee tendinitis, and two other games he didn't play at all. This is  a fight he's waging, and he cannot seem to turn the corner. In addition  to the pain, he's got conflicting motivations tugging at him, and both  can make meaningful cases.  It's a rotten position to be in, just pure bad luck and horrid timing. And above all that, it hurts."
Apparently only Ty Lue can coach LeBron James
"Javale McGee yelled, “There you go!” Kyle Kuzma gave a look of pleasant surprise. Lance Stephenson belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Luke Walton hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
ZION Williamson is set to be **Number 1 NBA draft pick 2019** . He is the most hyped NBA player out of college/high-school since LeBron James.
"Lakers GM Lebron James is meeting with coaching candidate Ty Lue today, league sources tell ESPN"
"To be fair, it isn't 3/27. Thats not how math works lol. The lakers didn't go 0-27 without Lebron, they already won some of those games.  &amp;#x200B;  The Lakers actually went 14-13 in games without Lebron James, which is pretty good and actually a better win percentage than what they ended up with for the season.  &amp;#x200B;  So your point would really be ""If the lakers went 17-10 instead of 14-13 they would have gotten to 40 games"".   And just for reference, they only went 23-32 in the games Lebron played this season."
"Very unlikely, since John Adams, James Monroe, Lebron Jefferson all belong to the founding fathers there are probably quite a few of these games"
"Okay Lebron James and Chris Paul positioned the warriors to get KD, better?"
LeBron James
"the league bailed lebron so bad that year, but nobody is allowed to talk, because its lebron james"
"You said his opinion that the Lakers would have won 3/27 with LeBron James, a top 3 player of all time, was a baseless opinion.  I'm gonna be honest, that's a fucking stupid thing to say. It's clearly not a baseless opinion. LeBron = good."
Lebron James and James Jones
Steph is the LeBron stopper in the finals:  &gt;LeBron James is 6-26 (19%) when guarded by Steph Curry in the NBA Finals over the past 4 seasons.

LeBron and James Jones?
Harden and Giannis would have been enough to end the LeBron James nightmares
have u seen lebron james play?
"Same, sucks he had to run into Lebron James. It’s like Spider-Man getting hate for not defeating Thanos, yeah he’s dope as fuck but it’s Thanos."
"Westbrook, CP3, Damian lillard, jokic, luka doncic(arguably), trae young, draymond green, James harden, lebron, KD, Stephen Curry, D.lo, de’aaron fox, Mike Conley, kyrie, Kemba walker and Kyle Lowry are easily more proven, reliable, trustworthy, mature, and strong willed. You are plain wack if you say Ben Simmons is a better PASSER than all of these guys. And judging by your replies, you’re probably a troll."
I agree he deserves some criticism but he is no Lebron James and if his teammates aren’t knocking down the wide open shots he creates for them then Westbrook is as easy to beat as anyone.
This is missing the best take yet. After the Spurs beat the Heat in game 1 of the finals where the air conditioning went out Chuck blamed the big ole women for sucking all the air out of the arena and almost killing LeBron James.
"lol, you fucking idiot  if you dont make your teammates better when you dont have the ball, you need to be lebron james when you have it  this is why Steph is underrated and Russ is overrated. Making your teammates better != assists. It's why the Sixers have 4 all-stars yet barely won 50 games  I promise you, ben simmons will never be the best player on a championship team"
Should the Raptors try to get LeBron James?
"Delly when he had to put the team on his back in 2015 without Kyrie or Love, pretty wild what he was able to get 2 wins with Lebron James****"
\[Wojnarowski\] New Pelicans Exec. VP of Basketball Operations David Griffin and Redden and new Pelicans star forward LeBron James worked together in Cleveland.
"""Welcome to LeBron James' world.""  Ah yes, the world in which LeBron complains to the league about Draymond blindly grazing his balls as he stepped over him."
"The east as a whole is just a really fucking weak conference outside of the top 4 or so teams. Teams like the Pacers and Pistons (sorry guys) wouldn't even be sniffing a playoff spot in the West. For crying out loud Lebron fucking James couldn't make the playoffs in the West(yea I know they got injured and such but still). In the east, a matchup between the 1 and 5 seeds is a blowout, whereas in the west, it's 2 relatively evenly matched teams. So yes it's very likely the Pels win 12 more games in a conference where the top 14 teams are trying for a playoff spot."

"Well you go with young players or vets. Of course anything could be Lakers 2.0 if you just get players that are bad fits. You can move young players for quality vets.  Rondo, McGee, and Lance can all still be quality players in the league, but they're a bad fit around Lebron James. Lebron is all about hitting the open shooter and operating in the space provided. They gave him bad shooters and little space. KD and Kyrie, of course, like that extra space too, but would benefit from each other more than Lebron benefited from anyone on the Lakers roster last year.   Our young assets can easily be flipped for decent quality vets and also still have room to grow should we stick with them. The Lakers this year needed a young guy to pop in order to be good, the Knicks, in this scenario, just need them to be okay. And the only young guy we have right now that is almost indispensable is Mitch, the rest aren't great enough to be untradable, but good enough to still be traded (with the exception of Frank, who has low stock right now, but even he would be a nice defensive piece on a team with offense covered). We have the assets and ability to make moves should we land the big fish.  The situations aren't really comparable. To LA or Boston."
58% TS% for his playoff career.  same as... LeBron James
"That cavs team was straight cheeks. I know they made a few other moves besides Lebron leaving, but the Cavs now are literally the second worst team in the league. And I guarantee you if Lebron hadn't decided to leave they'd still be right up there with the Bucks and Raptors in the Eastern Conference. Whenever Lebron James has had a team as good as the Rockets are around Harden, he's won a chip (except 2011, which is probs the biggest fuckup of his career). Lebron's biggest problem is that, outside of the Heat runs and the 2016 Cavs when shit was firing on all cylinders, Lebron's teams have always been a little below average compared to other superstars' supporting casts. I firmly believe that if you switched Jordan and Lebron in their respective eras and teams, Lebron get 6 rings and Jordan 3 (he'd definitely have won in 2011 but I don't know if Jordan could win 2016, that series is probably one of the best all around series of basketball by any player in the last 30 years)."
1. James Harden 2. LeBron James 3. Kevin Durant 4. Steph Curry 5. Jokic
"I’m saying any kid’s parent should be and usually is more influential to that kid than lebron james is to that kid, not to lebron’s kids. The people we say have “influence” on a national or global scale don’t have the kind of life changing influence on the average person that their parents do."
The Lebron James Effect
"I met Lebron James at a restaurant once - we’d accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that). Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says “I’m so sorry, but we’d like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we’ll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you’d like while you’re in town.” My sister and cousin were both like “Yeah that’s cool.” and I kind of played the asshole a bit. “I’m sorry, I just don’t understand. We’ve been here for 15 minutes - we’ve just ordered. Can’t we finish our meal here?” Then out of nowhere Lebron James shows up next to the manager and says “Paul, these guys can finish. We’ll be at the bar. I got some time.” And I (being a big Lebron fan) said “Oh wow, uh… I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.” James was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, Lebron James and I made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents. Also, LeBron James said that that Jayson Tatum fellow boomed him, and then he kept repeating , ""He’s so good"""
JJ Barea contained prime LeBron james in the fucking finals. Its all on Ben to be more aggressive. Its his second year
"There are some potential breadcrumbs to follow here. Durant called rookie Shai Gilgeous-Alexander the young player who had impressed him most back in the middle of December on The Bill Simmons Podcast. After the Clippers and Warriors’ final regular season meeting, he said rookie Landry Shamet was an “amazing young player” who will be “a force in this league for a while.” According to Sam Amick of The Athletic, Ballmer turned up his aspirational charm at a Nike event earlier in the season that featured several people with close ties to Durant in attendance.  As for the Clippers’ side of the courtship, why wouldn’t they pursue him? Who wouldn’t want a player of Durant’s caliber? He has propelled Golden State from historically great to perhaps the most dominant team ever, and even though Steph Curry will always be the face of the Warriors, Durant has proven he’s just as valuable during their playoff runs.  If Durant has any modicum of interest in the Clippers, Game 2’s historic 31-point comeback was a helluva sales pitch.  The Clippers can’t offer Durant a cast of Hall of Fame teammates. If he’s willing to play with another star, such as Leonard or Irving, perhaps they could offer him such a running mate. The Clippers also don’t have the sustained track record that Golden State’s ownership and front office has built up over these past five years — though, after the past two years of front office reshaping and reputation rebuilding, the Clippers are rocketing up the organizational rankings.  But the Clippers can offer Durant something he has never fully had in Oklahoma City or Golden State: His own team. His own offense. No pre-existing co-star that divides the fan base. A chance to build a legacy from scratch. The Clippers make the conference finals, the Finals or win a title? Durant gets a majority of the credit and immediately becomes a legend in Los Angeles. He gets to compete with LeBron James — whom he has publicly measured himself against throughout his career — in his own city, on his own turf.  It’s not like the Clippers are that far away. They just won 48 games without an All-Star or All-NBA player. They traded half their rotation midseason, including their best player, and became even better. They’re well-stocked with young talent, draft picks and cap flexibility. They have an elite coach in Doc Rivers, a good front office and the richest — and most passionate — owner in American professional sports. Two of their rookies, Gilgeous-Alexander and Shamet, just connected on the biggest play of their lives to upset the Warriors. Perhaps one of them evolves into a future All-Star."
"I might be missing your point. I'm not big on trolling, to be honest. It seems like your point is that any single parent is more influential than LeBron James, who is also a parent. And I'm being earnest here, is that not your point?"
"Okay that's fair. And to be honest, I don't love Randle's fit with LeBron James anyway."
Then watch the spurs heat finals 2014 again. LeBron James shoots 34%(13/38) when guarded by Leonard. He shoots 20%(6/30) when contested by Leonard.
"My argument is that Ben Simmons is the best player from both his draft class and the one after, the first all-star from those classes, received all-nba votes, received all-defense votes, put up rookie numbers that hadn’t been seen since Magic, yet he’s still continuously scrutinized in a way no other 2nd/3rd year player is because he’s not fucking LeBron James or MVP Giannis yet.  To do what he’s done in two years is fucking insane. He’s worth every single penny of the max contract we’re going to give him."
"A lot of people say 09 Wade was the closest thing to MJ we ever had.   The only reason he didn’t win MVP was because his team wasn’t strong, and it overlapped with Lebron James."
"Let’s review.  First round (4-0 vs NOP): Jrue Holiday only plays 55 minutes as he struggles with injuries. [Anthony Davis’ supporting cast was just weak.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2kgow0U4AAdI2c?format=jpg)  Second round (4-2 vs MEM): Mike Conley misses a game and struggles with hazy vision throughout the series as a result of a facial injury he sustained at the end of the previous series against Portland.  WCF (4-1 vs HOU): The Rockets missed their starting PG (sensing a trend?) Patrick Beverly for the entire series. James Harden wasn’t nearly the facilitator he is today. They had geriatric Jason Terry at PG, who just got predictably obliterated.  Finals (4-2 vs CLE): The Cavs had already lost Kevin Love in the ECF, then lost Kyrie in Game 1 in the midst of nearly stealing the game. LeBron was left with Knicks rejects JR and Shumpert, Matthew Dellavedova, Timofey Mozgov, and Tristan Thompson. [Just look at this shit lmao.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2kgowzVAAI-oWE?format=jpg) Yet they still got taken to 6 and would undeniably have lost had the Cavs been at full strength.  Basically, I don’t respect what the Warriors have accomplished. In 2015, they got bailed out by injuries all post season just to play the most injured team in NBA finals history. Then they blew the first 3-1 lead in Finals history and had to add the 2nd best player in the world to ridiculously stack the deck. Without KD and without the Cavs’ injuries, they probably never win a single ring."
"I’d say Kevin Durant has the most offensive *talent* and skill, but the way James Harden plays (all 3s and FTS) is more effective than KD who relies on the midrange more often.   So in terms of talent, maybe KD &gt; LeBron &gt; Steph &gt; Harden &gt;&gt; Jokic but Steph and Harden are built to thrive in this era."
Rich Paul laughing his ass off from the lap of LeBron James.
"I don't think LeBron right know is above Steph KD and Harden. I think I would probably say:  1) KD 1) Steph 1) Harden 4) LeBron 5) Jokic  I don't think you can really rank Steph KD and James, rather than just put them in the top 3 category."
"And 11 FTA per game in the regular season, which is 4 more per game than the next guard. In fact, the next Highest FTA/g is Joel Embiid, and he averages nearly 1 less than him.   His overall FTA puts him 34th on the single season list, behind only 3 different players after 1994 (Shaq, Dwight Howard, and himself from 2016-2017). This is also in the 2010s, where the FTA has been at a historical low (the only non 2010 year in the bottom 10 are the 2000-2003 seasons, in which the defensive rules were changed).   He’s also #32 on the all time list of FTA, and the only players above him are retired or named LeBron or Dwight.   By the way, his 25 shots per game over the last two games are pretty much the same as his regular season average of 24.5. His FTA/g has dropped by 7, which I believe is no more than a statistical anomaly and will soon be near the 8-10 that he usually averages in the playoffs.   The reason Harden got a little rep for being a playoff choker a few years ago was that he tried the same shit he did in the regular season, and refs don’t call as many fouls. It’s not fair to say “he only attempted 8 over the past two games”, as he just won’t get those stupid calls and doesn’t go for them.   If we could get Playoff James Harden in the regular season, I’d gladly stand behind the man.  But we don’t, we get the 11 FTA monster who is known for his flops."
"You should also see him talking about burying the hatchet with San Antonio women. He says and i quote ""All them Big Ol Women sucked the air out of the arena. Almost killed LeBron James."""
"This list has Michael Jeffery Jordan 7th, Wilton Norman Chamberlain 10th and LeBron Raymone James outside of the top-14."
"This is such a stupid concern. Lakers should prioritize making sure Lebron gets along with his coach. News flash, your franchise player tends to have a lot of fucking control over the front office on every team, and he's Lebron fucking James"
Lebron’s 2013 season is one of the best individual sport performances I have ever witnessed as a fan. Harden is very very good we get that. But he’s not near Steph or KD.. let alone Lebron fucking james lmao
"He hasn't made one since February 18th, 2018. He has attempted 4 'ankle breaker stand and delivers' since then and missed all of them.   He needs to ball instead of look nice.   Love Harden but don't like what he has turned in to regarding his ""MVP"" attitude. Play ball, don't act like you the greatest baller on the planet cuz you ain't. Not even top 5 for real.  LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry...  Paul George? Russell Westbrook? Joel Embiid? Karl Anthony Towns? Devin Booker? Kyrie Irving?  Who would we truly take James Harden over...?"
Imagine thinking Allen Iverson and Pistol Pete are better offensive players than LeBron James
I think Lebron is more known for his overall performance. Not just his offensive talent. He was a rim protector. Shot blocker. Playmaker. Scorer. A defensive beast. Could guard 1-5. Has the highest BBIQ. Elevated his teammates in ways no other superstar can do.   But if you wanna compare Harden to James. Sure.
"Who the hell is saying James Harden is the best player in basketball? What is this a lot of people? I’ve not heard anyone say that, let alone a lot of people.  Giannis, KD, Steph, and Bron still get all the attention for best player. Who is putting Harden in this convo? Even if he was better than Lebron, which he’s not, he is not better than Giannis, KD, or Steph."
Lebron James Harden is the best player in the league
"Okay let me explain why what you said is objectively wrong.  For one, there’s no brainwashing that occurs to attract white people to basketball, in the same way that more European or Caucasian-dominated sports like hockey or soccer don’t “brainwash” black people to enjoy them. This is why I’m calling you racist; you’re implying that basketball is a black person thing, and that you whiteys have to be brainwashed to enjoy it because it’s inherently a bad thing, which is false.  This by itself wouldn’t be too egregious, but then you were a patronising cunt about how black athletes don’t contribute to society, and that’s when it was really clear that you were talking out of your ass because you dislike people that are different to you. People like LeBron James, black basketball players, or hell, rappers like Kendrick or Nipsey, give an unbelievable amount to their communities. Instead of sitting in the Bay Area and contributing to gentrification in their expensive penthouses, they fund schools in poorer parts of their cities, visit children in hospitals, pay for their surgeries. If anything, they’re better role models for younger people than people that don’t give back to others.  Just because you dislike them due to their skin colour/occupation, doesn’t mean that basketball players are bad people or that their culture means less than yours, you miserable prick."
They gotta name it the LeBron James award in memory of so many dominant playoffs runs that went unrewarded
"* Tatum preforms very well in the playoffs last year * Tatum gets massively overrated coming into this season, ESPN predicts he's a [top 25 player](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24667483/nbarank-2018-19-21-30-best-players-season), CBS predicts he's  the [33rd best player](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/top-100-nba-players-for-2018-19-lebron-james-headlines-rankings-front-loaded-with-west-superstars/) this season, over established players with multiple seasons way better than anything that Tatum has put together, this rubs people the wrong way (see this thread [about this frustration](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9umd7j/are_we_overrating_the_celtics_young_talent/)) * Tatum's name comes up in trade talks about Kawhi in the offseason and AD during the season, fans talk about trading Tatum the way you'd talk about trading someone like young Lebron * Celtics struggle all year, don't live up to expectation. There is nobody in sports that gets treated worse than players and teams that don't match expectations. Brad Stevens, Hayward, Irving start taking lots of shit * Tatum has a string of poor performances, post ASB has pretty bad stats * Bloodthirsty fans see an opportunity to tear down a player who they thought was put on a pedestal without earning it, Tatum gets shat on  Really has been quite the saga for the young lad. I don't think you can talk about the past few months without talking about what led up to it, they're closely linked. The more you get talked up by sports media the thirstier fans here will get for you to fail, the more you get built up the more brutally fans here will tear you down."
So Harden is better than Lebron James is what you are trying to say
"Let me further explain what I mean. The WNBA players are the best female basketball talent in the world there is no argument there. They clean up the Olympics every time no sweat.  They are fundamentally very sound in how they play and for someone like me who loves basketball I understand how good they are at the game.  The problem is this is the sports entertainment industry, the entertainment part of the equation is where the money is and even though they can pass and defend with great fundamentals it just isn't exciting because they lack the explosiveness that captures the imagination of the consumer.  There is no Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade or Giannis in the WNBA, those men defy what we believe is possible and that's why the NBA has global recognition.   The highlight reels from week to week of the NBA are way better than the highlight reels of an entire decade of WNBA play.  Most people don't want full games they catch up on the highlights that's just how we consume content now.  It's no fault of the players it's just that the market doesn't want their product.  Also like I said before their target demographic (females) do not support the teams, do not buy jerseys, do not tweet or follow the players on social media.  Now I do not have a problem with anyones sexuality but like 85% of the WNBA is lesbian, which makes marketing hard especially in your Bible belt of America.   There are just too many factors working against the league and most of it is the foundation upon which it is built.  In my opinion they should close up shop and move on."
"""Hold me Magic!""  - LeBron James"
“I’m King of the World!”  - LeBron James
"What? Westbrook, Kyrie, James Harden, LeBron, Curry etc... They dont need KD. LeBron has honestly been carrying ESPN headlines the whole year."
Are you trying to claim that Russell Westbrook is a better passer than LeBron James?
Now someone please try to convince me again that choosing Westbrook over LeBron James because LA is a shit show was the better move.
"Because he's Lebron  James and the stars aligned perfectly, Could it happen sure but in most of the cases it doesn't."
&gt;	LeBron James did the same thing vs the Warriors in 2016. Why can't we?  Because it's LeBron.
Probably because one team had LeBron James and other teams do not.
"Well, I'm afraid you don't know the whole story.  https://www.si.com/tech-media/2017/10/22/nba-media-roundtable-russell-westbrook-lebron-james-interview-protest  Westbrook was regarded as a prickly interviewee before the Barry Trammel stuff ever happened.  He has consistently been unprofessional with various members of the media, who, frankly, are just doing their jobs.  As far as his reaction to Trammel, do you think WB is the first player to ever be asked a question that may sow discord in the locker room?  Of course not.  But, as far as I know, he is the first player to throw a public months/year long tantrum about a particular reporter.  I'm not a WB hater, I don't think I've ever said anything negative about him, but his approach to the media is just a bad look."
Ok - and what 99% of those games have been with this guy named lebron james who is pretty good
Kemba Walker - 12M  James Harden - 30.4M  Kawhi Leonard - 23.1M  LeBron James - 35.6M  Anthony Davis - 25.4M  Brook Lopez - 3.4M  Pascal Siakam - 1.5M  This team would honestly destroy the warriors
This is a really good one that Disney released a few years back.  [Lebron James: Becoming King ] (https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2iq7db)
"It's the playoffs. Teams game plan to shut down the opposing teams best player so it's no surprise his TS% isn't high. Kobe Bryants career playoff TS% .480, and Lebron James is at .528  The playoffs are a whole different animal"
"I'll admit that it's challenging to rank the top 3 right now, because Lebron finally missed the playoffs, but I still have him as the best in the league. I have Curry 2nd, KD 3rd, Giannis 4th, and James Harden 5th. Kawhi comes in a close 6th, with AD rounding out my top 7. Then there's a pretty big gap"
I think when people say “George Paul” it is meant to mock Paul George. Similar effect to calling lebron “Queen James” instead of “King James” . How you get now why people say George Paul- No OT
"Tbh I’ll get downvoted for this but if he was on last years Cavs team he’d be great.   He can defer to Lebron for playmaking duties ( he has done so with James Harden back in the day). He won’t really need to shoot 3’s because he can give the ball to JR, Love, and Lebron. Lebron gets another slasher and guy who can score in the paint. Paint is also less crowded because TT or Nance Can catch lobs.   On defense both TT and Nance Can guard PNR so this should play to WB’s defensive  gambling strengths.  That cavs team could also go small with Jeff Green and Korver letting love play the 5 and now the paint is open for both LBJ and WB to dismantle your interior defense."
"In no particular order  Bruno Caboclo, Alex Caruso, Meyers Leonard, Lebron James, Zion Williamson, Zhou Qi, Kevin Durant, James Harden"
OKC should just trade Westbrook for LeBron James
LeBron and Snyder would have probably butted heads long time ago with the kind of effort James puts in defense now
/u/colincowherd • 1m • [LAL] LeBron James  😏
"Lmao if this dumpster fire of a Lakers FO can land anyone to play next to 35 year old Lebron James and Alex Caruso, with a horrible supporting cast, and then continue to make the WCF, I will buy a Lakers Lebron James jersey. You can remind me if you'd like."
Yeah we've definitely been desperate in the past but I genuinely don't believe that our FO would do something that stupid when you have LeBron James on the roster.
"Cap space for another max, Lebron James, decent young players, room for growth in the front office. Things could be a lot worse for the Lakers."
PG really chose Westbrick over Lebron fucking James in his home town lol
"This is why r/NBA sucks. His only crime was losing to LeBron James, the guy that beat LITERALLY EVERY OTHER TEAM in the east every year for the past 7 years or whatever.   Is he a Pop/Phil Jackson kinda dude? No. Is he Jason Kidd? Also no."
"Who would be the better player, LeBron James’ body with CJ McCollum’s skill or LeBron James’ body with Russell Westbrook’s skill?"
He’d also be playing with Lebron James instead of Westbrook
lebron james? haven’t heard that name in ages
There's only a slight difference between a team losing to Lebron James and a team losing to Terry Rozier.
"the Warriors are a 0.500 team without Curry in the Kerr era. he is easily the best and most valuable player in Golden State, and multiple stats have been posted here over the years proving his value to the Warriors. he is by and large in the same ballpark as LeBron James when talking about value.  ""gravity"" is a meme now, but it's no joke the kind of defensive attention Curry commands for his offensive scoring. he's also a back-to-back MVP as well as the league's first UMVP.  any team with Curry would absolutely be better than a team with Lillard. Lillard may have Dame Time and some games where he shoots from the logo, but understand that these games are highlights for Dame. Curry shoots 45% from three for his *career.*  as another example of attacking defenses, Lillard was smothered completely by the Pelicans' double team in 2018. Curry faced similar double and triple teams in the Finals and scored only slightly less than KD despite commanding most of the Cavs' defensive attention."
"Pg 1. Damian Lillard  2. Kyrie Irving 3. Stephen Curry 4. Russell Westbrook 5. Kemba Walker  Sg 1. James Harden 2. Victor Oladipo 3. Bradley Beal 4. Luka Donicic 5. Klay Thompson   Sf 1.

Tobias Harris   C 1. Joel emiid  2. Anthony Davis  3. Nikola Jokic 4. Karl Anthony towns  5. Rudy Gobert  I know all you steph curry stans are probably going crazy right now but think of it this way, if you took curry off the warriors, away from Draymond and klay who cover up his defensive issues, and put him on any of the other teams with those point guards ahead of them, would the new team hes on do better with him than say lillard, no. Would the celtics be doing better with him instead of kyrie, probably not since he isn't as good in the pick in roll. But for sure if you put lillard or kyrie on the warriors you would have a team that may never lose a game because they dont need the jump shot to be on so they can play good.   When I was making this list, I kept thinking, who do I want to have the ball at the end of the game to win it. So that's one of the reasons why klay is number 5 while others think he should be higher. Hes offensively limited as a scorer and creator. He is a defensive jj Reddick with a post game. The dude cant run a pick and roll, he cant go in iso and make a cross over and pull up, he doesn't have a step back, he cant create space for himself, that's why he and steph are running around screens on the sideline.   Let me know what you guys think and dont be ignorant. Thanks"
"Yea but have your national park gotten all the free agents that the liberty bell has gotten us.

It's definitely not.  Don't think LeBron fucking James needs Reddit gold lmao

Pacers legend Lance Stephenson molesting LeBron James with his mouth
"I saw LeBron James at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.  He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”  I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Anthony Davis’s in his hands without paying.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

"You guys should cherish him man not many people are so loyal. Truly an all time great, made the mavs relevant. If you're under a certain age and havent seen Dirk in his prime he was just unbelievable. I could watch that little fadeaway jump shot forever.   And the year he won the title--ive never seen the nba fan base so united.  Part of it was lebron was a villain but part of it we all wanted Dirk to get his ring. That team is probably one of the most likeable championship teams in recent memory to me. Just a bunch of guys and Dirk against Bosh, wade and James and somehow they pulled it off.   Im not that emotionally invested in sports but Dirk retiring really makes me sad man, even as a celtics fan. Hes just so loveable and nice and played the game the right way and was loyal and always positive never a bad moment. I'll miss him dearly."

"I've done some investigating, and from carefully examining the usernames in this thread, I've concluded that you are actually LeBron James.  Bron, please go ice that groin. Redditing in that hyperbolic chamber seems risky"
"This is similar to with Davis and New Orleans. Their bad rosters and decisions prior to their final seasons burned all the good will even though they did have talented rosters when their star players chose to leave. I think the Pelicans even more talented. They both traded away first round picks losing out on chances at controlled young ascending talent. Both had bad FA signings (the Cavs were really hedging their bets on signing Ray Allen or Michael Redd), and when their franchise players decided to leave had no significant cap space or ascending young stud players on the roster.  James’ final Cavs team was not bad. They were ok. They were not good enough to win a Finals and definitely not good enough in combination with management to remain even with ultimate optimism. You are drafting late, have no ascending young players, no cap space. Just like now the Pelicans are a great team when healthy with Davis. Where can they improve with cap space or draft picks though? They’ve not shown any penchant for developing players out of nowhere in Davis’s time there so why would he give them faith? Sorry, I wanted to see him forever a Pelican, it’s just an unbiased way of looking at it. That’s the same thing LeBron saw."

Lol I feel like in a smaller city like San Antonio there’s a limited amount of those top 1 percent girls who only date basketball players and rappers and stuff. I’m sure teammates in sanantonio recycle the same girls. In Toronto partly cause of drake and the perceived opportunity to become a someone there are a lot of girls...like a lot. I’m talking true 11s out of 10s.  And another reason that might be slept on is all of drakes parties and stuff. I used to work as a bouncer and now I’m still in the service industry and I’ve worked multiple of drakes parties in both fields.There’s always a couple raptors there and ppl like Tristan Thompson and LeBron James occasionally with other rappers/celebrities and ppl in the mix. I feel like someone like Danny green might appreciate being able to be involved in the things that go down in toronto cuz of drake. He holds a lot of ovo parties in the city.  I’m not saying all of this is definitely true in Danny greens case I’m just being hopeful that homie stays and naming potential benefits that someone like him would be afforded in Toronto that he wouldn’t be in San Antonio.  And yes I know all of these benefits would be greater in la and nyc.
"Prime Dwight was a maniac. But he was never LeBron James or Stephen Curry, even at his absolute best."
"&gt;and we all know it  Clearly Kyrie feels otherwise.

Then LeBron comes back and suddenly Kyrie went from *the guy* in Cleveland to being asked to describe how LeBron is a father figure to him. I'd be pissed off too and probably go somewhere that actually made me happy even if it meant I was leaving a good situation."
"I've posted this rant many times before in this sub. I'll just copy and paste it again. Kevin Durant was the best prospect I've ever seen, I would take him first overall in any draft class. Granted, I didn't pay attention when LeBron was around, so I don't have a good view of him, but of the players I've seen Durant was the best.   &gt;Oden was a great college player yes but he was nowhere near as good in college as other big prospects like Blake Griffin, Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, Deandre Ayton, Karl Anthony Towns, and now Zion Williamson. Yes he was a great prospect. He was not Kevin Durant. &gt;There was a large vocal minority of people who were completely baffled that Durant wasn't going first overall. Read [this mock draft](http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=nbamockdraft/070627) by Bill Simmons. It was absolutely not crazy to consider Kevin Durant. Granted I am nowhere close to as scathing as Simmons is in his criticism of Oden, but my point is that it's not revisionist for me to say I'd take KD over Oden.   &gt;Oden was absolutely not a perfect prospect. Durant was. Odens counting stats were definitely not bad, he averaged 16/10/1/1/3, on 59% TS and his shot blocking was definitely solid. His 63% from the line wasn't great but for a big it was solid. He played 29 mpg. All of this was great, his rim protection was excellent and he was easily the best player on the Ohio State team that made it to the championship game. He lost to an incredible Florida team that had 3 top 10 picks (Al Horford, Corey Brewer, Joakim Noah). He won the defensive player of the year award. He was a 2nd team all American.   &gt;There is no doubt I would have taken Oden second. He was a very good big man prospect, and he was definitely one of the better prospects of those draft classes, but he wasn't Durant.   &gt;Durant averaged 26/11/1/2/2 on 59% TS including 40% from 3 (6 attempts per game) and 82% from the line. All on 36 mpg. He was the first ever freshman to win the Naismith and he won just about every other college basketball award you can think of. His only blemish was losing in the 2nd round to a USC team, even though he scored 30 points that game. Calling him the best player in college basketball isn't doing him justice, he had one of the best college seasons in NCAA history.   &gt;We are talking a 6'10"" pure forward with a 7'5"" wingspan (bigger than Oden I might add), 9'2"" standing reach, who averaged 26 points per game on incredible efficiency, had the speed and fluidity of LeBron James, who could handle the ball like a guard, shots 40% from 3, 82% from the line, and had just won every award you can possibly imagine. All while he was a 19 year old freshmen in college. Durant was, plain and simple, the best prospect we have seen since LeBron. Oden was also amazing, he was not Kevin Durant."

He was a very good big man prospect, and he was definitely one of the better prospects of those draft classes, but he wasn't Durant.   &gt;Durant averaged 26/11/1/2/2 on 59% TS including 40% from 3 (6 attempts per game) and 82% from the line. All on 36 mpg. He was the first ever freshman to win the Naismith and he won just about every other college basketball award you can think of. His only blemish was losing in the 2nd round to a USC team, even though he scored 30 points that game. Calling him the best player in college basketball isn't doing him justice, he had one of the best college seasons in NCAA history.   &gt;We are talking a 6'10"" pure forward with a 7'5"" wingspan (bigger than Oden I might add), 9'2"" standing reach, who averaged 26 points per game on incredible efficiency, had the speed and fluidity of LeBron James, who could handle the ball like a guard, shots 40% from 3, 82% from the line, and had just won every award you can possibly imagine. All while he was a 19 year old freshmen in college. Durant was, plain and simple, the best prospect we have seen since LeBron. Oden was also amazing, he was not Kevin Durant."
"Scrubs got eliminated in 5 by a shit Miami team that got humiliated by a meh underdog Dallas team the year before that. Shopping Harden wasn't nearly enough that team needed a total rebuild! I mean honestly, who loses to LeBron James? Good teams don't do that. Definitely not super talented squads with great coaches like Pop or Kerr that play great team basketball that's for sure."

"LeBron James, for all the diva-like tendencies he's been displaying the last few years, is still a superstar who can complete a dunk while getting his nose broken mid-jump, and play the rest of the season like nothing serious happened.  Some superstars still have spines."

This is the part of the playoffs where one-man-offense teams get exposed as not being able to adapt and/or not having LeBron James.
Uhh Lebron James last year ??
"Invoking the 20 year gap between Shaq and Lebron as evidence that they didn't get players I think is a little misguided because not stated is that gap is a function of the players' greatness in comparison to all other free agents. Both are arguably top 10 players of all time. How many times in a generation are spawned top 10 players? In Lebron's generation, there is one - Lebron. In Shaq's generation, there is one - Shaq. Literally nobody can compare to those two in the years they were active, except maybe Kobe, who was already Laker. The Lakers signed significant free agents in between the two: Ron Artest, Derek Fisher, Rick Fox, Lou Williams, just none as significant as the two best players in each of the past 2 generations.    In all honesty I agree with OP about nobody signing free agents. Small market teams complain, but there isn't much advantage in big market teams cause players just don't move (until recently), that is *except* the Lakers. The Lakers always get their man, whether in FA or through strongarming their way there à la Kareem and [Wilt](https://www.theringer.com/2018/7/9/17547692/wilt-chamberlain-lakers-trade-50-year-anniversary-lebron-james). That's 4 of the 10 best players ever electing to play in Los Angeles at some point in Lakers history."
The scariest thing us Knicks fans have to remember about this is that James Dolan uses this band's performances as a way to entice free agents.  It's been reported that he used coming to the garden and watching this band play in his pitch for LeBron in 2010.  I can't imagine a less effective way to attract free agents.

"And then James learned if you don't flop, they will choke on their whistle in the playoffs. All of the current greats realize down line. You can be a tough guy and try to just take the fouls but eventually the refs will get ridiculous. The art of flopping is never planned, it's always the last resort of a player realizing there is such things as referees that don't want to see you win. That's what happened to Kobe, that's what happened to Lebron, that's what happened to Durant and over the last five years that's what happened to Harden."

So you’re saying I’ve scored as many points as Lebron James in this years Playoffs? Nice.

"Steph Curry, Lebron James, and Kevin Durant. All  are too soft and don't have that killer instinct other greats had."
"At least for this year, Damian Lillard has been amazing in the playoffs so far. And for player who has gotten worse in the playoffs, I have to say Kyle Lowry. Kyle Lowry in Game 1 against Magic had 0 points.  Him and DeMar DeRozan used to choke big time against Lebron. But overall, I agree that Kawhi, KD and LBJ reaches a new level during post season. Sad to see Steph Curry and James Harden not do the same. Good to see new faces like Dame rising to new level."
"Kevin Durant, not LeBron James, is the most unstoppable player since Jordan.  This LeBron James praise is hilarious. KD is and will always be better in the playoffs than LeBron James, who is not even in the playoffs. KD is on a team with 3 other All-Stars, yet they still are in trouble without him in the playoffs. In OKC, he led the team to WCF four times. There is a reason why his efficiency jumped joining the Warriors - he has better shooters around him. LeBron had a playoff run last year, which is overrated - he beat a 5th-seeded Pacers squad in merely 7 games, known playoff chokers and a team without its two veteran All-Stars in 7. His team? Kevin Love and a bunch of savvy playoff veterans. He had an okay playoff run in the East. KD is better. Show some respect."
I was under the impression that he's saying he was playing like James Harden or LeBron James? Idk lol
lebron james
"&gt; But running into Lebron James every year trumps any competition the bulls faced. Thats like The Bulls running into a Micheal Jordan-led Sonics in their first 4 finals.  Honestly, I enjoy this discussion, but isn't there a flaw with your reasoning. If we're discussing better dynasty and using level of competition as an argument, you can't fault the Bulls for never facing a Lebron-level player because the Bulls had the Lebron-level player who was even better. And the Utah Jazz that the Bulls faced weren't slouches either. They have arguably the best pure PG of all time in Stockton and the top 2/3 PF of all time."
"The fine be steeper to really disincentivize flopping -- $5K is farking pocket change to NBA players.  But that's incredible . . . 3 years!?

"&gt; Warriors never played the Blazers in the first round.  2017    Ur right. The warriors had better competition but often faced teams they were favoured over or teams with injured players. But running into Lebron James every year trumps any competition the bulls faced. Thats like The Bulls running into a Micheal Jordan-led Sonics in their first 4 finals.    TBH I believe the warriors best playoff run was the 2016 run, even though they didnt win. The 2016 Spurs or Thunder win the Ship any other year."
"What's fucking hilarious is that you assume I'm a Rockets fan when I've been a Spurs fan since I was 8.

As for this bit  &gt;And if an organization is going to focus their film analysis efforts on trying to prove that refs screwed them rather than actual gameplanning or scouting, they're going to lose,   If you;re too daft to understand that...  &gt;[Amick] Since the tallies from the NBA’s 48 minute report are now officially a thing,   THE NBA HEAD OFFICE ARE THE ONES DOING THE FILM ANALYSIS ON THESE REPORTS... than you my friend are the one...  &gt;acting like the most worthless little shit   Clearly the NBA sees this as a NEGATIVE seeing as how they are OFFICIALLY acknowledging and addressing this shit...   My god dude. Take a breath my friend, acknowledging that bad officiating hurts the league isn't rocket science. &lt;har har... It's fucking common sense. We should all be striving to get better officiated games and evenly called matches... if you think you need a competitive advantage of getting calls go your way, you deserve an *asterisk next to those w's.

When Lebron James Jr and LaMelo Ball go head to head in a playoff series lol
It's really wild to see what he evolved into after having basically a whole career in Philly.  I would never have guessed that this is the player he would eventually be.  Pretty great mindset he must have to be able to be a role player that can specialize in defense and making plays without the ball. In Phlly I always thought of him as this hyper-athletic poor mans Lebron James.
"Idk I feel like with Lebron's mentality, he's churning out an All Star kid one way or another. Dude spends millions of dollars on his body to preserve his athletic ability. I feel like a part of him is determined to make this happen...like it's actively on his list of priorities.  I dunno any other NBA father-son duos where the father was a Lebron James caliber player who made sure their kid was destined for greatness."

" Credit to u/what_what_7 for this comment:  5x Champion  2x Finals MVP  1x MVP  18x All-star  15x All-NBA  12x All-Defense  3rd all time in scoring at 33,643  Before Lebron James surpassed him up to 26K, he was the youngest player to ever score: 24K, 25K, 26K, 27K, 28K, 29K, 30K, 31K, 32K, 33K points.  Time's scored: 80: 1 60: 6 50: 26 40: 134 30: 496  The only player in NBA history to ever have at least 30,000 points, 6,000 rebounds, and 6,000 assists (will likely soon share this with Lebron).  Taking away the scoring seasons of Wilt and Barry, Kobe currently holds the 2nd greatest PPG season ever at 35.4 on 45% shooting. Comparatively, Jordan has the number 1 at 37.1 PPG on 48.2%  His inefficiency could be pointed to many things, but it's mostly his shot selection. Kobe took the most difficult shots of any other player throughout his career, and his shootings numbers show that. Despite that, he still shot above 45% in 12 of his 20 seasons. Of those 8 seasons he shot under 45%, 4 were in the midst of and after numerous injuries in the very twilight of his career, and 2 were in his first years. That means for only two years, in 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 did Kobe have inefficient years. In the former two of those seasons, Kobe played 66 and 64 games, and in the latter year, his team had a whopping 34-win record, which means teams could get away with focusing on Kobe much more than they otherwise could had he a better supporting cast.  A bit redundant, but his most inefficient years came in, ordered from lowest FG% to highest: 2015-2016, 2014-2015, 1996-1997, 2013-2014, 1997-1998. So two of his worst years in FG% came in his first two years, and the other 3 in his injury plagued last.  All in all, you are going to tell me that Kobe Bryant, with all of these accolades and others, isn't a top-10 all time player? What constitutes greatness, if it isn't all-time great scoring, spectacular defense, multiple world championships - all 5 of which wouldn't be in the Laker's trophy case had he not been there - and one of the most clutch and killer instincts ever seen?  The records, accolades, and numbers speak for themselves."

"&gt;	Vardon reported that front-office officials for the Cavs disputed the claim that Altman told James the Irving trade was not going to happen. They also said that Altman asked James if he would sign a long-term deal with Cleveland if Irving were not traded and that James refused.  &gt;	James preferred to sign one- or two-year deals with the Cavs that maintained his offseason flexibility, not to mention leverage with the organization, but the price was an atmosphere of uncertainty about how long the franchise’s cornerstone would stick around.

"At some point it became obvious that the media was publishing as many Lakers organization hit pieces as they could pump out with little concern for editorial integrity or factuality.  Some of the narratives were bizarre and super exaggerated to me.  The lakers traded Zubac because he 1)can’t space the floor, 2) they have other players that can do the same thing he does and 3)he is going to take up cap space. While Zubac has “some” value in general as an asset, he was not that useful to their roster construction or to their playstyle (Lebron+floor spacers). Yet the media took great glee in telling everyone that magic got “fleeced”.  The lakers aren’t getting a 1st rd pick for Zubac. 2nd round pick probably. So in effect the Lakers traded a 2nd round asset for Muscala. That’s what teams in a playoff chase do. They trade 2nd round picks for the chance to take a flier on a veteran player who fits their playstyle and who may help them in the playoff chase.  Was Ivica Zubac going to turn into a quality playoff rotation piece for a top tier team? Not an honorary starter that plays 14 minutes a game for an 8 seed. I mean a real center you can run out onto the court in the Heat of a playoff series. Enes Kanter proves you can get guys of that level and production every year on the waiver wire.  In addition, He’s going to get paid soon. The lakers don’t want to pay him $12 mil to be an energy guy. They want to pay Lebron, another max player, and eventually all their high draft picks if they turn into useful players.  The lakers can’t pay the guy and leave space open for paying another potential max contract. Yet everybody in the media was cackling and saying “fleeced”.  Was Lebron James going to win the nba finals surrounded by washed vets and low ceiling young guys?  No, it was lucky that he had them in 4-5 seed range considering how stacked the west is. He got injured and the team is not that good otherwise so it was not a massive shock that they missed the playoffs.   Imagine the Jazz going 20 games without Donovan Mitchell. At that point their offense craters into 1950’s black and white footage of dudes dribbling hand over ball and throwing up running hook-shots. The Pelicans swept a 3 seed last year and once they lost Anthony Davis this year they cratered into a lottery joke. There were no articles or 2 hour long form podcasts that delved into the “mess” that the front office has become in New Orleans.  This smells mostly like opportunistic criticism after things don’t work out well. I’m just not sure if this is lakers hate or opportunistic angling by some in the media to get their front office mole into the job.   It really seems like there a lot of nephews in this community who get their perspective of the nba landscape from the Boston sports guy and illiterate talking heads promoted from the cold pizza crew."
"""My name isn't James. It literally is Jimmy."" - Lebron Jimmy"
"Im a big time Larry Bird fan and I study his career at length. Within their eras and against their peers, a very credible argument can be made for Larry Bird being better than LeBron James due to Bird's complete offensive game. However, LeBron showcases his game against much better athletes and in a much more competitive version of the NBA (population increases, international game...). Also, prime LeBron was a good to great 1-1 defender even when guarding players at different positions. I could still see a case for Bird because of his leadership, clutch, and selflessness, but I'm siding with LeBron."

Lebron James would never
"This is a professional gesture on Nance's behalf, and serves as a declaration of neutrality (which future FO's will appreciate). There's a bit of PR trickery going on with his denial - he misrepresents the reporting, and then denies that same misrepresentation:  &gt; Rob Pelinka supposedly promising me I’d stay in LA  From the [original reporting](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bbul14/the_athletic_rob_pelinka_told_larry_nance_jr_to/), this was not a promise made without any qualifications:  -  &gt; When Kuzma went to Charlotte for All-Star Weekend to participate in the NBA’s Rising Stars Challenge, he sought an audience with Pelinka. Kuzma and his people came away from their chat feeling reassured, a source close to the situation told The Athletic. Pelinka told the second-year forward that he was key to the Lakers’ future and that, unless it was a trade for one of the game’s three best players, he wasn’t trading him.  &gt; A year earlier, Larry Nance Jr. approached Pelinka with a similar question.  &gt; Nance Jr. and his fiancée, his college girlfriend, were interested in buying a house. He wanted to get a sense of whether the Lakers planned on keeping him around, and **Pelinka told him that the Lakers would only trade him if it meant landing one of the game’s three best players.** He told him to buy the house, multiple sources confirmed.  &gt; Before Nance could get that far, however, he received a call on the morning of Feb. 8, 2018. He and Jordan Clarkson had been traded to Cleveland in a salary dump that cleared cap space for the Lakers to be able to offer two max slots in the summer  -  According to that report, Nance was told that he'd only be traded if meant the Lakers would get a top 3 player. Was Nance traded directly for a top 3 player? No - (unless you were crazy high on an injured Isaiah Thomas). The [trade](https://www.dailynews.com/2018/02/08/lakers-trade-jordan-clarkson-larry-nance-to-cleveland-for-isiah-thomas-channing-frye-and-pick/), however, did free up the cap space for the Lakers' ""two max free agent"" off-season plan, which netted them LeBron James (surely a top 3 player) and the opportunity to chase another big name... which instead became the Lakers meme team.  -  So did Pelinka lie? Depends on how you interpret his ""promise"" to Nance. The pro-Pelinka viewpoint is that no, that trade was instrumental in convincing LeBron to come over and have free-agent flexibility to build around him, so Pelinka was true to his word - and he traded Nance to a beneficial situation (I don't know if any team other than the Cavs would have given Nance that 4 yr 45mil contract). The anti-Pelinka viewpoint would be that he lied - Nance was not traded for a top 3 player, and him telling him to buy a house was a dick move (as is having essentially the same exact interaction with Kuzma a year later - hollow words from a GM that promises the same thing to any young core player).  -  I am a bit curious why Nance is responding now, with somewhat of an artful response, nearly 3 weeks after the report came out. My guess is that his agents, [Mark Bartelstein](https://hoopshype.com/reps/mark-bartelstein/) and [Kieran Piller](https://hoopshype.com/reps/kieran-piller/) of Priority Sports, are extending a peace offering to Pelinka (Kuzma is also one of their clients so maybe the Lakers view them as Oram's source), perhaps to boost the value of their other potential free agents this offseason that the Lakers might be interested in:  -  * Alexis Ajinca * Justin Anderson * Wade Baldwin * Sterling Brown * Jose Calderon * DeMarre Carroll * Troy Daniels * Sam Dekker * Jared Dudley * Wayne Ellington (lot of Laker trade deadline speculation) * Tim Frazier * Taj Gibson * RJ Hunter * Enes Kanter * Jake Layman * Tyler Lydon * Salah Mejri * Kyle O'Quinn * Zaza Pachulia * Jabrari Parker (rumored KCP for Parker deal that fell through) * Bobby Portis * Jason Smith * Nik Stauskas * Garrett Temple"
"When Giannis was drafted, he was raw and had a low % shot at becoming anything at an NBA level.  After his 3rd year, the most common comment that I read about him was that he was Nicolas Batum light.  After last year, people thought he could become MVP someday.  The next year, he is going to be MVP.  Yeah, he wasn't the chosen one who played academy ball and was groomed to play basketball. He was some skinny kid in a gym in Athens that has busted his ass to get to this level. Now your hot take is ""he isn't Lebron James"". This dude wasn't supposed to be fucking Harrison Barnes, and was more likely to go back to selling sunglasses on a beach in Greece.  Perspective."
It also isn’t outlandish to say kyries efficiency and playoff runs would be worse if he didn’t play with LeBron fucking James lol
I dont see your point mate. If you said James and Basketball in a sentence it’s probably a good guess to assume they are talking LeBron
Did he actually mean to call him James as in Lebron James? Or was it just a slip up
Does the best player win every year? No. LeBron James is perfect fucking proof. He’s lost way more than he’s won.

But i can only name 2 players who averaged 40ppg in a month multiple times,  &amp; I can only name 5 players who scored 60 points multiple times 🤷‍♂️ ."
"They still do, that roster isn't even bad as people think it was. Kuzma and Ingram are really solid players. Sure, they're not good enough to be a contender, but they're good enough to make the playoffs. And the fact is, compare them to the clippers roster and the clippers got 11 more wins. It's not like they just missed the playoffs, they weren't even close. Is that clippers roster really better by 11 wins if you have the best player on the planet? No, because they don't. LeBron James is just chasing stats, he's been doing it for the past 2 seasons."
Isn’t it? It’s referencing a quote from basketball player Lebron James when a player on the other team dunked on him and he said the same line several times in sequence.
Rodney Hood knows the blueprint to get to the finals. He carried bums like Lebron James last year

"I am certain the Rockets got screwed on 4-5 calls in this game but the rules are always being constantly interpreted by the Refs, not really by the book. Harden pushes off with the forearm which I agree is only called if its super egregious and changes the balance of the defensive player but its a foul by the book, and although I'd love to see it called a little bit I'm not ready to say every step back push off is an offensive foul. curry does it too. He does however get called for it sometimes. I used to think the same when watching lebron james, how much contact he always initiated and why he didn't draw more offensive fouls when he drove to the basket but it all comes back to there are the rules and then there are the interpretations of the rules which seems to change quite regularly. Even the L2M reports are interpretation of the rules, I'm not convinced there is a committee that actually adjudicates every single call by the letter of the law. Things get called in the regular season that would never get called in the postseason and they would never show up on a L2M report. Business wise, postseason has more eyeballs, less diehard fans, more casuals. I expect the NBA is carefully crafting what styels they want to succeed in the postseason and Refball is being punished. People want to see made shots, not free throws."
"I mean if he just spammed ""Lebron James"" just to get gold i dont see how its stupid to ban him"
"LeBron James - 11 letters, Kevin Durant - 11 letters. Coincidence? I think not."
LeBron James destroyed the Raptors so they could get LeBron James 2.0 aka Kawhi Leonard.
Wait what? He got banned for writing Lebron James?
You have to write his full name aka Lebron James. User called InstaBuyout did it earlier and got banned by the NBA mods because of it lul
"Back then it was mostly from Lebron James flairs that have since disappeared. It was a competitive rivalry thing, which is fine. There wasn't a general hate until after the KD signing."

The department in charge of running TNT games have a job of getting the most people to tune in for each game.   You have Lebron James on the Lakers, James Harden is in the 3rd biggest city, KD and Steph are on the same team -- these games are the priority. They can't go to their shareholders and say ""Well we had less people tune in this past month, but we needed people to see how good Jokic is"". It's just how things work in the entertainment industry.   Be happy we live in an era where we can access games anywhere and we have easily accessible mediums like reddit and twitter for basketball fans to communicate and learn more about the game."
KD is a better scorer than Lebron and a better defender. The only thing James has on Durant is playmaking

"I think we need some reading comprehension here. They didn’t miss the same 15 games. They all each missed 15 games. We lost our top four players to injuries this year - how many teams could lose their top four and still make it?   Here are our injuries:   Rajon Rondo: missed 36 games  Lonzo ball: missed 35 games  Brandon Ingram: missed 30 games  LeBron James: missed 27 games  Tyson Chandler: missed 24 games  Josh Hart: missed 15 games  Lance Stephenson: missed 14 games  Kyle Kuzma: missed 12 games (though he prolly should’ve missed more after his injury)   Javale McGee: missed 7 games (though he had to play limited minutes after recovering from pneumonia while being an asthmatic)  So we lost both our starting and backup guards for almost half a season. We lost our starting and backup center for almost a chunk of the season. We lost our forwards for a quarter of the season. And you’re gonna tell me that injuries were overblown? Gtfo.   The clippers were deep. They have a solid 8-10 man rotation. The kings were right there, but they also suffered injuries. Major props to clippers, but they had enough depth to remain competitive. I mean, they have two legit sixth man of the year candidates on their bench. They are insanely deep."

"Longtime LeBron fan and Warriors hater here, but nothing is more disgusting than james harden punching people driving forward (foul) travelling 7 steps backwards ( another foul), kinking his feet 7 feet into the defender going up and purposely falling down while crying to the refs (another foul) and still complaining about refs after being the most favored player in the history of the NBA.. ffs.

Lebron James gets a smaller percentage of foul calls on his drives to the basket than some non-all star players. He also gets the short end of the stick from refs.
No I woke up today and seen James Harden crying and I was where’s Lebron he’s usually the one crying so I cane to r/nba aka r/Lebron to chime in on thoughts.
"I wasn't saying you were picking on Jokic, I'm trying to say the narrative that he's out of shape is a misnomer. Malone has to find an extra minute or two a night for him. He's averaging the 5th most minutes in the playoffs and outside of that fourth quarter has been sensational. Jokic is never going to have the physique of Lebron James. Playing 43+ minutes is probably not going to work that often, even down the road."
MJ is considered the goat by most and james is not close according to most as well. Just because a very minor part of basketball fans think lebron is the goat doesnt warrant posts like these.
Lol ya cuz i see James Harden hella crying.  I’m used to Lebron crying where is he?????
"Retired.  Kobe, retired.  Lebron James, active.  Lebron not in the playoffs, yikes."
"&gt; When he got the ball with the game on the line he was not going to miss. This isn't a blind statement from a Pierce stan, it's a wide-known fact for anybody who's actually watched the NBA a few years back.   LOL yeah it’s a league wide fact that Paul pierce never missed with the game on the line. The delusion is strong in this one.   [According to this, he was actually below average. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.libertyballers.com/platform/amp/2012/2/29/2832299/lebron-james-kobe-bryant-dwyane-wade-clutch-nba-playoffs-4th-quarter)"
"Define “winners mentality”, I love it when people dive deep into a players psyche and analyze their mentality /s. That team won 66 games, he was MVP, and swept their first two rounds. In a 6 game series (with one of them a James buzzer-bearer), he averaged 39/8/8/1/1 through it on 50% from the field. He literally had to have huge numbers for them to win. They were predicated on defense and LeBron was the offense. It was a close 6 game series too."
"Only because they were being told they were by the commentators. Mark Jackson hates the Warriors and Jeff van Gundy dickrides Houston sports.  They kept it up in the Finals, too. LeBron James threw Jordan Bell to the ground like it was fucking judo and they just ignored that on the replay to talk about... some other random shit.  Some people apparently go on the assumption that what the commentators say is going to be correct, and... no."
"Notorious flopper I'd just a bullshit narrative, much like how he ""doesn't play defense"". He flops occasionally, much like LeBron James, and almost every other big name in the sport has exaggerated contact sometimes. Clearly you have to to get these blind ass refs go call anything."
Well I wouldnt foul if Im Lebron James though. That would be stupid. Trust your teammates to foul for you while yelling to foul the ballhandler.
LeBron James and Russel Westbrook.
Thanks to cavs team with players like jr. Lebron / horford [though](https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2017/5/18/15658116/al-horford-vs-lebron-james-playoff-history-nba-cavaliers-hawks-celtics).  Giannis is westbrook ++
"They cried a lot about a bunch of different stuff. And other players whined too. I always heard MJ just pushes off and travels all the time.  You have to ask because you clearly weren't around at the time. That should tell you how the narrative just changes afterwards.  Heck it changes even now. A decade ago Dirk Nowitzki and LeBron James were ""losers"" and ""chokers"" that would ""never win"". And now they are both, rightfully, legends.   Truth is if you win you will have your flaws erased and you will be worshiped as a hero. Lose and you will always be mocked and ridiculed. Hence why KD went to GSW to get rings."

I'm going to guess that you're talking about the LeBron bandwagoners joining the Lakers fanbase, but I don't get the point that you're trying to make. The Lakers have always had one of the biggest fanbases in the NBA, even before LeBron James signed with the Lakers, and even when the Lakers were tanking during all those years. Yes, a lot of LeBron fans became Lakers fans, but the Lakers fanbase has always been huge regardless if LeBron James signed with the Lakers or not lol"
Um.... Lebron James.

If that's the case then you have to mention LeBron James. What he did last year was insane.
I don’t feel for JR because I think that game could have gone down as the best performance in the nba finals from Lebron James if JR had made the right choice.  Now there’s this dark ugly cloud of JR’s mistake and no one even thinks about how amazing Lebron played.

This question is basically whether or not you like LeBron James
"People speak in way too black and white terms on the MJ vs. LeBron debate. If it’s who has the better career, than yeah it’s probably MJ with 3 more rings, 3 more finals MVPs and one more MVP, and no big playoff failures like LeBron had in 2010 or 11. But in terms of just who is the overall player, I don’t know how anyone could just say definitively that Michael Jordan was a better basketball player than LeBron James."

"Allen Iverson (y'all nephews would have tore him apart if he played today but he was special), Vince carter,(sg or sf? Im going to slot him here), LeBron James (checks flair, yup I said it) Tim Duncan and Hakeem Olajuwon ( I still think he Dosent get the credit he deserves, he was an absolute monster)"
what a dumpster fire of a comment lol. you sound like one of those Lakers fans who was weirdly and silently happy that the Lakers were awful this year because it vindicated your bizarre hatred of LeBron James lol
The combination of this username and the first sentence alone was enough to make me massively eyeroll in real life. It’s a perfectly valid opinion to think LeBron James isn’t the best player in the NBA. Asserting it as an incontrovertible fact and speaking in hyperbole is just silly. Why do people on this sub feel the need to inject the “it’s not even close” sentiment into everything?

"Lebron absolutely has the versatility of Magic. It's his biggest asset. Can play just about any position at a high level just like Magic.  Lebron doesn't have the longevity of Kareem? Lebron is going into his 17th season and he just put up 27.4/8.5/8.3 on 51% and 33.9% shooting as the 1st and really good scoring option on his team. Kareem put up 22/7.9/3.2 on 60% shooting when centers were purely guys who played near the basket on a team where Kareem played 2nd fiddle to Magic at that point. Both played at elite levels from when they entered the league to their 16th season so to say he doesn't have his longevity is pretty factually wrong.  As for Bird, you can't even argue Bird on Lebron, James is a light years better basketball player than Bird, but yes it is accurate to say that James doesn't shooting as well as Bird did, it's not like Bird's efficiency over his career is THAT untouchable for Lebron. LBJ has shot at a rate of 50.4% and 34.3% and Bird a 49.6% and 37.4%. So for something that is Bird's best attribute it's not like he makes LBJ look like a scrub.  The point I'm trying to make here is that while some players in history can be rated a 10/10 in certain categories, Lebron is atleast an 8/10 in most metrics except for defense and free throw shooting. Hence why I have him at 2nd just barely behind Jordan."
1. Kevin Durant  1.(tied until proven otherwise next season) Lebron James  2. Kawaii Leonard  3. James Harden  4. Steph Curry  5. Giannis  dont @ me
You missed the playoffs with LeBron James.
Kawhi has taken over ownership of Toronto. Previous owner: LeBron James
Yes but nowhere near as good as LeBron James Harden or Carmelo Anthony Davis
They arent comparable. The 2 seasons the warriors had before kd joined them had better records than any miami heat season WITH lebron James.
"To get the obvious ones out of the way, I'm adding:  Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Allen Iverson, and Kevin Garnett.  Now that that's out of the way, it's actually really difficult to know who to add in over who for the final 16. But to take a shot at it, I got -  \-Tracy McGrady  \-Chris Paul  \-Amar'e Stoudemire  \-Yao Ming  \-Dwight Howard  \-Carmelo Anthony  \-Dominique Wilkins  \-Gary Payton  \-Grant Hill  \-Jason Kidd  \-Steve Nash  \-Alonso Mourning  \-Dennis Rodman  \-Ray Allen  \-Paul Pierce  \-Dikembe Mutumbo  Unpopular opinion here but when the dust is settled, I think a lot of people would put Westbrook in Top 75 (top 100 more likely). He's Top 100 for me but I have a hard time taking anyone out of the Top 75 for Westbrook currently.."

"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-james-harden-mvp/  He not only put up absurd stats, but he was able to make his teammates better. His ability to bring the best out of his teammates, while leading the Rockets to the top 12th offense all time in terms of offensive rating (https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tsl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=team_totals&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;year_min=&amp;year_max=&amp;franch_id=&amp;c1stat=&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=&amp;c2stat=&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=&amp;c3stat=&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=&amp;c4stat=&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=&amp;order_by=off_rtg) definitely made him competitive in the MVP race.  Westbrook had the triple double (32/10/10) and almost no one around him, but harden had similar stats, while leading his team to a 3 seed with, as it seemed, really poor teammates. You could argue that his teammates played better than they should have because of harden.  As for Kawhi and Lebron, it’s all about the narrative. Harden’s narrative was simply more influential in voting over Kawhi, and Lebron. There’s more to it than stats.   I’m biased: I do think Kawhi should have won that MVP in 2017. But Harden absolutely had a case for MVP competing with all three of those guys."

And you clamp up on all his passing lanes? And you can hit 3’s? You fucking win. Every single team that does this against him has a real chance of beating him. You can outplay him MENTALLY. Spurs, Mavericks, Spurs v2, GSW... all beat him using these tactics. They literally let him punch himself out. And you gonna say I’m dumb, I haven’t watched. Or looked at the stats?? As if that’s gonna help you understand the series without watching it.  TL:DR: sorry I’m not bronsexual bro"
 Lakers meeting with Lue was “intense” and “at one point LeBron James was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned
"When he’s going he is a lebron james light. Only difference is that he has the greatest scorer, shooter, and catch an shoot guy in his team. A couple of good lob catchers also doesn’t hurt as well"
"I didn't get to read each comments but it my opinion, it was Lebron James and the Miami Heat started this super team. I know the GSW are the fave to win the championship but with Cousins out, I think other team like the Celtics, Rockets or even the Raps will have a chance."

Lebron was #1 in the kia MVP race in December before he got injured and he finished 2nd in MVP last year.  Lets not act like Lebron has had some huge dropoff.  He got injured; he then came back and played while still recovering from injury.  Lebron James is without a doubt at worst still the 2nd best player in the NBA IMO and what he did last year in the playoffs was maybe the greatest playoff run I've ever seen up there with any of Prime Shaq and Prime Jordan playoff runs.
"There would likely be players taken off that list.  There are guys who have come since who are better than the guys on that original 50.    The league put relatively young players on that list. Shaq, for instance, only in the league a short time (though he's only proven that position to be fully justified).    Hell... I think AD has been in the league longer or as long as K. Malone and Barkley and a few other guys who were put on that list.    That list would have to be completely revamped. I think there are a variety of guys who voters would be unlikely to include now (Sam Jones, Jerry Lucas, Dave Bing, Dolph Shayes, Bill Sharman, Lenny Wilkens), and there are a host of guys whose values may not be appreciated as much now as they were then (Nate Archbald, James Worthy, NAte Thurmond, Hal Greer, Paul Arizin).   Not to say any of those guys are not deserving, just that the voters at the time played against a lot of those guys, where as many of the current voters would have known them only by reputation.  &amp;#x200B;  I mean... Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Muller were all snubbed.  Mourning.  Shawn Kemp.  Reggie Lewis. Drazen.    &amp;#x200B;  Since then, we've seen some obvious inductees. Duncan. Kobe. LeBron. KG. Dirk. Wade.  Curry. KD.    &amp;#x200B;  We got others, like Grant Hill, Penny, T-Mac, Jason Kidd. Vince Carter.  AD.  Klay. Ben Wallace.  Blake. Chris Paul. Westbrook.  PG. Harden. Dwight Howard.  Gasol. Yao. LMA. ReRozen.  Leonard. Webber.  Nash. Amare. Michael Finely.    &amp;#x200B;  Some of these guys may not spark most fans, but even a guy like Finely would have take about 25% of that list of 50 greats to school if they played in the same era.  And this is only naming a few guys."
Kinda skewing against active players even though a few made the list.  I arbitrarily cut off at players drafted in 2007 or earlier.  In no particular order:  1.  Kobe Bryant 2.  Tim Duncan 3.

"Almost all of the stats you mentioned don't matter.   &gt;Kyrie got to play second option to LeBron James for many seasons and still couldn't score more efficiently than Lillard  Kyrie's TS% with LeBron (2015-2017) was 57.1%  Lillard's during that same time span was 56.9%  &gt;Being a much better teammate makes a huge difference. Look at the Celtics, they have all the talent in the world but can't put it together... Why is that? Maybe because Kyrie is a selfish, self entitled genius that only cares about getting his..  The Celtics can't put it together because they are going up against a much better team than them."
"It actually is abnormal. With 72 Finals to date, there are 144 teams that have made it to the Finals (easiest data to pull).  The Warriors (counting their time in Philly) have been there 10 times. But before their current run, the last time was 1975.  All of Cleveland's trips to the Finals have been since LeBron James joined the league.  The Nuggets have never made the Finals.  The Raptors have never made the Finals.  The Bucks made in 1971 and 74, winning once."
"The rational opinion is he's not shooting the ball well in this series. Nothing more, nothing less.   He's played 127 games since leaving Cleveland and has a .600 TS% with 49/40/88 splits and 24.1 Pts / 6.1 Ast in just 32.6 MPG. That's the sample size you need to look at to come to whatever conclusion you want to come to as far as how good he can be without LeBron James."
"I'm not even going to take the time to post them on here, because arguing with you isn't worth my time. But go compare the advanced stats of Dame vs. Kyrie on basketball-reference.  Lillard has a lower usage, a higher VORP, higher BPM, a higher combined OBPM &amp; BDPM, a MUCH higher Win Share, a lower turnover % , slightly lower AST % a higher a Total Rebound %, a higher FT%, a higher TS%, 2000 more minutes played, a lower PER, more games played in less seasons.  So let's see thats: Lillard: 9 Kyrie: 3  Lillard has been the undisputed number one option on his team for 6 seasons vs. Kyrie being undisputed number one option for like 4 seasons? Kyrie got to play second option to LeBron James for many seasons and still couldn't score more efficiently than Lillard, who had the defenses full attention.  Being a much better teammate makes a huge difference. Look at the Celtics, they have all the talent in the world but can't put it together... Why is that? Maybe because Kyrie is a selfish, self entitled genius that only cares about getting his.."

"&gt; LeBron, remember, will be on the Lakers’ roster for at least the next two seasons. Getting the best out of James, in seasons in which he will turn 35 and 36, should be priority No. 1 for Lakers officials before they resume what has been a more complicated quest than they ever imagined to build the proper supporting cast around him.  &gt; In my previous life as a sideline reporter for ESPN Radio at the N.B.A. finals, I had the opportunity to observe countless Cavaliers huddles during timeouts over three consecutive postseasons. That blessed gig gave me the chance to watch the way James and Lue interact in game situations from very close range.  &gt; So I can confidently say, as much as any outsider can, that Lue will coach LeBron as firmly as anyone can. I’ve actually seen it happen.  Having watched my fair share of Cleveland basketball over the course of our rivalry, I've always thought Lue was an incredible coach.  The immediate relationship with Lebron with a timeline in place is a super underrated piece of this move, and I think that Lakers fans are going to wind up pretty happy with the pick a year from now."
&gt;	The sight of Monty Williams landing in Phoenix as the Suns’ new head coach has left many with the impression that Williams chose a job with the Robert Sarver-owned Suns — who have been mired in their own non-playoff misery for the past nine seasons — over the opportunity to coach LeBron James in L.A. Another popular takeaway: The Lakers’ looming hiring of Tyronn Lue means they’re settling for their fallback choice to replace Luke Walton. The reality is that neither of those perceptions are accurate.
&gt;Kyrie has proven that he performs in playoffs.   Next to Lebron fucking James. He has never proven shit as the leader of his own team
I mean he is only 6 years old and he’s already better than LeBron James!
"Dame Lillard, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Harden; there are a lot of great players that are being eliminated/getting their legacies tarnished due to this Warriors dynasty."

The last time the Lakers hired a LeBron James coach it did not go well... Looking at you Mike Brown
Seriously look how long it took for fucking Lebron James to win a ring.
"Hey. There’s only so much he can do from the ego standpoint. Takes a special coach to manage the high end egos and attitudes AND win. Phil Jackson had it. Steve Kerr seems like he’s capable. Popovich can. Pat Riley could. That’s probably it.   Maybe the problem IS Kyrie. He wanted out of Cleveland because he was tired of playing in LeBron James’ shadow. He got a chance to be “the man” in Boston and that still hasn’t done it. Kyrie doesn’t want to lead. Unless he’s changed his tune about playing second fiddle, he’ll be miserable in that role as well. Kyrie needs to grow the fuck up."
Because you have LeBron James at #6... this must be your first year watching basketball
"Except for:  1. Reports that Kawhi doesnt want to play with Lebron 2. Reports that Klay and GSW are on the same page for staying forever 3. Kyrie doesnt want to play with Lebron. He may be a lot of things but he would likely stick to his position and not be on a team with James 4. Seems logical that if Butler is happy right now that he stays where he is with a great young players than going to play with the most self-centered player out there whom is 35 5. Kemba, Middleton and Beal are stars but they are not superstars and Lakers is not an organisation which wants to give its max spots to those type players which even with Lebron in their squad are capped for Conference Finals.  Lakers are in very difficult spot. 90% of their squad likely wont be there next season and other players see that. Top guys dont want to live in the shadow of Lebron and those below them like Butler - Kriss are in perfect place where they are valued. If they go to L.A it would be mostly negative energy coming towards them - why they dont help Lebron to win or how they should thank Lebron for winning. If my theory is correct, except for his close pears, the only players whom would voluntery go to Lakers would be the mercantile type"

"Thing is, Kyrie is an amazing player.. but he's not a leader. He wants to be the man. He wants to be the leader.. sadly, he just isn't a leader. If Kyrie would just go out and play and not be so emotional, he would be an amazing asset to any team. Kyrie, however, is not a LeBron James style of player. He is the type of guy who needs to embrace a Chris Paul or Steph Curry type of role and let the talent around him do their thing. Instead they have Hayward playing that role. Celtics have so much offensive fire power, but Kyrie throws it away at times. Idk if it is all his fault, or the coach's decision, but something has to change. This Celtic team easily has a top 5 starting 5 in the league and probably a top 3 bench. They just need a real leader."

"Well, that's not all that interesting to me. The Warriors' defensive gameplan to avoid the Curry switch on Harden is the exact same thing that they did on LeBron all those years - first pre-switch behind the action, then do the [high tag](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Dh48r_goPrwJ:https://bballbreakdown.com/2017/05/30/the-new-way-stephen-curry-defends-lebron-james/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us) if that failsI've seen all the adjustments and counter-counters already, there's nothing new about all of that off the ball action. I already know the Rockets gameplan is to switch Curry onto Harden, and the Warriors are doing what they can to prevent that, it's just a matter of seeing if it works or not. The Rockets being slightly smaller without Ariza is not that compelling of an interesting wrinkle to me, either. There's really no counter-punches either team has at this point, it's just who executes the gameplan better."
No James Jones? He went to the finals 7 consecutive years with LeBron
&gt; Don't you think LeBron James would have done that too if he was in the same situation?  Maybe. Depends on how much LeBron would be willing to buy into Golden States's system like KD has.
&gt; Won the past 2 FMVP  Don't you think LeBron James would have done that too if he was in the same situation? Context is important.
There was a time when people were arguing Curry was a better basketball player than LeBron James.   Oh my how he's fallen.
&gt; God knows how this team defeated the warriors and won the championship while making it to 4 consecutive finals.  I must be god then because I can tell you that the secret to their success was Lebron Raymone James Sr.
"Ty lue was a horrible developmental coach. This is by far the worst move for LA. His style of team is a run.and gun team with switch defence but does nothing to solidify this in practice look at the consistant decline of the 2015 cavs and the new aquisituons, kyries comments, ITs comments, 2019 opening games. If youve read about the end of game 4 u know it was not ty but the shooting coach that called out and fired up the team. I am 100% a lebron fan but he should be trying to get a real coach who will tear strips off him when hes doing silly stuff so that he can be greater and the team mates around him shine like they did pretty much every year before 16. Ty is just a coach that has an impressive record because he had a player named lebron james"
Jokic is the next LeBron James
"""Brad Stevens may actually be more valuable than LeBron James""  lmaoo"
"His trade request should have gotten a lot more criticism than it did.  Fresh off a championship (where he hit a franchise-altering shot), he requests a mid-summer trade because... LeBron James is a bigger star than him? And he threatens to sit out with knee surgery if he doesn't get traded?  We can laugh about how inept the Cavs Front Office is, but that whole line of logic made zero sense at the time and makes less now."
I get what your saying and I have been for the most part but I feel like people idolize him in Utah. He took FOREVER to develop and then just abandoned us without even being nice enough to tell management till hours after it got leaked. He never had that dawg in him and I honestly liked George Hill better his last year than Hayward. People didn't give a shit about him until he was a free agent and then all of a sudden he's LeBron James jr

Dude was playing along side Lebron Fucking James. He done goofed big time.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Yeah I think LeBron James might have something to do with that

LeBron James is not walking through that door...
"When does LeBron see a hard double? Or Giannis? Those guys have defenses collapse on them on the drive which is why they acquire shooters, but they never see the at the top of the half court traps that Steph and James Harden get (see the Rockets versus Nets game at the Rockets this season).  &amp;#x200B;  And those guys operate with the ball more at the top of the key, whilst KD gets the ball in the low post. That's a different kind of double team you send because you can see the floor easier in the post."

"It's just about era. Barkley was one of the greatest offensive machines ever made, but played in the wrong timeline to have the history. Sure, Wade will go down as 'better' than Harden because of his rings but in my opinion Harden's (excluding OKC since he didn't have a lead role) teams have never been as good as something like being on the same team with LeBron James/Chris Bosh, and hasn't gotten the option to play in a timeline without 73-9 GSW + KD"
"the timeline where LeBron James beating  steph curry in 7 games being the peak moment of his career is still mind boggling to me.  &amp;#x200B;  imagine telling that to someone in 2013. ""Lebron is good now but wait til he beats STEPH CURRY, KLAY THOMPSON, and DRAYMOND GREEN."""

"My favorite part about that game was the end, where the Warriors didn't win. Quite the contrary, the Warriors lost that game and didn't win it. Specifically, Steph Curry, the unanimous MVP did not win the game. Nor did Draymond Green. Nor did Klay Thompson. Nor did Kevin Durant, who wasn't on the team yet, but fuck him anyway.  In fact, none of the Warriors won that game, because the Warriors lost. At the end of the game, it was not the Warriors who won, but rather the Cleveland Cavaliers, led by Lebron James, who won the game due in no small part to the fact that he was not a member of the Warriors, but rather the leader of the victorious Cleveland Cavaliers.  Who did the Cavs beat to win that game, you might ask? The Golden State Warriors, who blew a 3-1 series lead and ended their season without winning the title."

Well when you get arguably the greatest player of all time and LeBron James together you.... Ha

"He played good, he didn’t play great. If LeBron James was in the same situation, he would be getting crucified. James Harden for the last two seasons has been called the greatest offensive player of all time, and yet when the other teams loses their best player by far, he doesn’t close it out. Game 5 was tied, tied at 72 and the go into the fourth. Harden should have had at least 15 in that quarter to close them out.   And tonight he should have one of those monster 40-50 point games that were so prevalent and talked about. The main guy guarding you all year for this matchup is out and you don’t go all MVP mode? There was blood in the water and he didn’t go for the kill. Look at Steph, two points behind Harden on the night and didn’t score in the first half. That’s what James Harden should have done both halves.   LeBron James has 51 last year, that’s what I expected from Harden to kill GSW. I expected him to do the same thing he did 7 times in the regular season and RISE to the occasion."

I asked for two things this season. 1. For LeBron to miss the playoffs and 2. For James Harden and Chris Paul to not win the championship.  Both have been granted. I need nothing else.

[Woj] BREAKING: LeBron James traded to the Golden State Warriors for ca$h considerations
"90% of the league isn’t pushed as top 5 (even top 3 my goodness) players in the game.   He’s good. He’s top 10. He’s a Hall of Famer.   But when people put him in the same category of Kawhi, KD, Lebron! My goodness people have said this man is better than Lebron James! Get him and apologists all the way TF outta here."
They don't but he's been the most successful out of every other player in the league outside of LeBron James. The Warriors have been practically unstoppable.  You don't think if this retarded video game dynasty mode team weren't around he could make the finals?
Wait I'm sorry did you just say you *didn't* want lebron james?
"James Harden is not a top five player in the league. He can’t be, not with the horrible playoff performance he has. He’s an all time offensive threat and definitely had an amazing regular season, but he is not better than LeBron, Curry, Kahwi, KD, or Giannis"
"Curry from the turnbuckle... AND HE SLAMS DOWN ON HARDEN. HES CLIMBING THE LADDER TO GRAB THE BELT AND... OHHH MY GOD IS THAT LEBRON JAMES?! HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND TOOK CURRY DOWN WITH A CHAIR! LOOKS LIKE THE REFS ARE TALKIN ABOUT A POSSIBLE FLAGRANT HERE... BUT HERE COMES DRAYMOND GREEN, AND WHAT DOES HE HAVE IN HIS HAND...?! IS THAT...? YES, IT IS! ITS A MACHETE! OH LORD HAVE MERCY, HE JUST CHOPPED LEBRON'S HEAD OFF! NOW HE'S DICING UP HARDEN'S BATTERED BODY! THE REFS ARE THERE AND... NO WAY! THEY'VE GOUGED THEIR OWN EYES OUT AND ARE REFUSING TO LOOK AT THE CARNAGE! PLAY ON, THEY SAY!"

what do you think Lebron James is doing right now? Taking his family out to some fancy dinner?
"He’s not wrong, nor is it a new thing.  Durant is awful at boxing out—almost never even tries to do it, at least since he’s been in GS.  So sometimes he gets bodied by guys like PJ who aggressively go for inside position.    That of course doesn’t mean he’s a net negative.  Efficient volume scoring is still the most valuable thing you can bring to the table, and Durant does a lot more on offense and defense.    Guys can have a weakness that has to be adjusted for and still be the best guy on the floor (see Lebron James, James Harden, etc.)"
[LeBron James] I don't want to be here
"Here's a list of career playoff BPM for a few players:  Steph curry: 7.0  Lebron James: 11.1  Michael Jordan:10.1  Magic Johnson:  7.4  Nikola Jokic: 12.0  Anthony Davis: 3.9  Obviously, the sample size for AD and Jokic is too small to make a definitive comparison. But I can say, from the games we have seen of Jokic he is playing like an all time great, whereas AD has not been close to that.  Jokic might have a better supporting cast, but he also makes them better with his elite playmaking."
"Yeah lol Legendary player, you guys have the best Laker of all time in LeBron James 🤣🤣"
"Despite having a great front office the Celtics locker room is all types of cancer and the only allstar player has his foot out the door.  Meanwhile lakers have a committed lebron James, cap space and great young players. If they sign kawhi and/or trade for AD they’ll be back on top and they won’t even need a front office for it"
"Who’s better right now, Andre Iguodala or JJ Redick? Crazy to think one of them would be the second best player as old as Lebron James."
\[Clutch Sports\] Lebron James parted ways with Lakers.
How does ESPN genuinely not know what city LeBron James is in at all times?
Because we're talking about their future not how the team performed last year. Only players on contract for next year are the young players and LeBron James. They can sign whatever roleplayers they want this year. The man who famously wanted to sign playmakers instead of shooters resigned.   And lets not act like Portland hasn't made mistakes like signing Evan Turner of all people to a 70 million dollar contract. No management is perfect.
[Lebron James] Woj asks to be traded to the Lakers
"You hold yourself up as one of the most prestigious franchises in the sport. Yet you refuse to give a coach that whether you or anyone on this forum likes it or not, is held in a high regard around the league among coaches and players. Whether you like it or not, was the coach who won that title.  It’s your organizations chosen candidate, yet you aren’t willing to budge on taking a potential hit to ownerships purse if things don’t work well, yet every other team is willing to in any situation regardless. Every other team would likely offer him more years and more money in the same situation.  The reports about Kidd aren’t to attract clicks, it’s about the fact that you’re actively undermining your chosen potential coach. It’s about the fact you’re trying to hire someone who was opposed to taking over a HC spot when the situation happened to him, while shoving someone like Kidd behind him. Would you want to be offered a leadership role somewhere while a colleague holds a knife in your back waiting for the right time to strike?  It’s just awful optics dude. You have Lebron James on your team in his prime, yet are unwilling to take some of the extra money you make off the top that for all anyone knows goes to Jeanie &amp; friends vino expense fund. For what, to just cause your team more problems by not securing your top head coach? So there can be a grasp at controlling and infecting more of the organization with dysfunction that seemingly falls from the top now?  The Lakers are supposed to be one of the top flight teams in this league, yet they’re acting like a poverty franchise... go ahead and defend saving ownership some pennies though, it’s not like they’re one of the most valuable franchises in the league... oh wait."

Obviously I'm not talking about the current Lakers team. Can you name any player on this team that is worthwhile other than the young players and LeBron James? While the Celtics have players like Marcus Morris and Al Horford and even Gordon Hayward. It's not even close in terms of roster construction. Nothing to do with the young core.
"And yet, LeBron James, young talent, and cap space to sign another star. I'm not a fan of many things with this team but hardly a dumpster fire."
[Let's go!!!](http://lomotif.com/video/#item=lebron-james-pre-game)
Come on now.  The Clippers were a team of no-stars that just traded away most of their starters and the Lakers just signed LEBRON JAMES.  Of course their ratings “as of Feb 2019” were going to be considerably higher.

Ty Lue has a 1-18 career record in games without Lebron James.  Is that really a guy you'd want to give 5 years to?
"The Cavs didn't just have Lebron James - they also had Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love, and a bunch of role players.  The Lakers' problem is not coaching, its the players. The team generally lacks talent and the pieces do not complement LeBron at all. It's pretty basic strategy that has been known for years, to be successful you should surround LeBron with shooters - and that team sucks at shooting (29th in 3FG% last year). It's a bunch of young underperforming guys, old past their prime guys, and general castoffs/knuckleheads. On top of that, LeBron was injured for a while and management completely destroyed anything resembling team morale with the Anthony Davis trade deadline antics. Red Auerbach himself would not have succeeded with this team."
I just looked it up.  Ty Lue has a **1-18** record in games without Lebron James.  Holy shit.  I didn't realize it was that bad.
"How shitty of a franchise do you have to be to sign the best player in the league, get everyone to forget hes the best, cause discord in your young core w trade rumors. Trade a young asset for trash to a rival, lose your coach and fo figurehead....and hit rock bottom with fucking lebron james.    Its lebron fucking james all you had to do was get shooters like anybodyy with bron has been succeeding with for 15 years but no you have to try and reinvent  the wheel and instead catch your house on fire in the process"
"&gt;Takes your crown and throne? LeBron James is still the best player in the NBA. Steph Curry is the best scorer in the league. Steph showed up tonight, but he was on the porcelain throne last game.  =/=  &gt; Lebron is better than Curry.  **Especially** considering the context of the quote he was replying to.  &gt; Check yourself next time, might not be behind a screen next time.  I live in Brooklyn now.  If you happen to be nearby I'll glad meet up.  You're not nearly as tough as you think, I assure you."
"But he DID win a championship. Ty has been around all time greats in both coaching and teammates. It's profoundly biased of folx to ignore it and credit everything to LeBron. To make some distinction that Lue is a competent or a mediocre coach as opposed to a ""great"" coach comes off as if Ty had/has no impact on the court at all.   &amp;#x200B;  Frankly, I don't think anyone in r/NBA knows what a bad, good, or great coach looks like because of how trendy their takes are and failure to use actual concrete examples of Ty's failures -- and I mean, beyond normal short comings that literally every coach, or human for that matter, exhibit.   &amp;#x200B;  The usual take is Ty just gave the ball to LeBron.... Of course he leaned on LeBron and Kyrie ISO -- all good and great coaches facilitate for and through their star players. It takes a non-egoistic leader to accept that situation. Plus even a great coach will tell you their abilities are limited with their personnel -- Popp and D'Antoni come to mind.  &amp;#x200B;  Between the [story of Lue calling out LeBron's performance](https://fadeawayworld.net/2019/03/27/ty-lue-reportedly-called-out-lebron-james-in-game-7-of-the-2016-nba-finals/), the respect Ty has among other NBA players and coaches, and some of these videos about his approach to the [Pick and Rol](https://youtu.be/D-c4BrpctP4)l and [Spacing](https://youtu.be/dl2Moq3Cvq4) scream of a thoughtful, humble, and impactful coach, which are behaviors that separates coaches from others. Plus, I firmly believe Ty is learning and growing his career, which is relatively new compared to this colleagues. The criticism and bad publicity Ty gets are disproportionate with what is observable about him and his performance in reality.    &amp;#x200B;  I mean, imagine if at work you're constantly criticized for being good or just competent instead of  being the greatest employee ever? I'd be pissed because that's an unfair expectation to have of anyone -- no matter what field of work or level of importance."

"You are seriously embarrassing yourself in this thread. Bottom line is, despite LeBron being injured for a chunk of games (and sitting out the last 6), you literally got the best player on the planet and improved by 2 games on the season while missing the playoffs AGAIN. Your coach was fired and your GM quit. Don't talk shit about playoff teams when you were gifted LeBron fucking James and underperformed magnificently. Get real kid."

"Of the players equal to in age or older than LeBron this season, it's confirmed that Dirk, Jamal Crawford, Haslem, Wade, and Channing Frye are retiring.   Kyle Korver, Nene, and now Tony Parker are seriously considering retirement.   Guys like Pau, Calderon, Devin Harris, J.J. Barea, Raymond Felton, Gortat, Zaza, and Thabo maybe have no choice due to injury or lack of interest.   Bogut just kind of randomly signed with the Warriors at the very end of the season, and he might not do that again next year, and who knows what's going on with Melo.  If all of those players do hang it up, that would make Vince Carter, Tyson Chandler, Andre Iguodala, Marc Gasol, J.J. Redick, and LeBron James the oldest players in the NBA."
Funny for James Jones of all people to be telling Lebron he needs to do more.
this dude actually forgot the lakers landed lebron james.
"There's a famous story at half of Game 7 2016 where Lue got into LeBron's shit and told him he's not doing enough. LeBron was mad and kept asking diff people ""man isn't that fucked up he's yelling at me?"" and the legend goes that James Jones basically told LeBron that Lue was right and you do need to step it up more."
Derek Fisher has won as many NBA championships as LeBron James and Kevin Durant combined.
"Honestly, I think it'd be a great hire if he wants back in. I thought he was a pretty solid coach. But the question is will David Blatt want to coach Lebron James again? IDK if he wants to deal with what comes from coaching a team with Lebron. It could work better in LA for the simple fact that the Lakers organization is bigger than Lebron, but the spotlight could do him in since everything is so heightened and dramatic surrounding a team like the Lakers."
"Pretty nice to have that Lebron James guy too. I feel like that helps lol. This year for sure put a chip on everyone’s shoulder and as Lonzo said, “We gon’ figure it out”."

"Here's the actual report from the Athletic's Sam Amick  &gt;&gt; Team officials and rival executives alike have been predicting Kevin Durant’s departure in free agency for months now – cue Jay-Z and Alicia Keys, “New York…concrete jungle where dreams are made of…” But there’s a recent sense in Warriors circles that maybe he’ll think twice about joining them on this trek across the Bay Bridge, that this recent stretch of domination and fan appreciation might be the kind of thing that convinces him to – cue LeBron James’ personal motto that hasn’t exactly panned out in Laker Land – RWTW (Roll With The Winners).  Doesn't seem like much to go on tbh."
"Lue did not win a championship and go to three straight finals.  That's delusional.  Lebron James took those teams to every single Finals appearance and Championship (with some solid help from Kyrie).  Lue was consistently exposed for the bad coach he is.  He was a defensive assistant coach yet those Cavs teams had shit for defense.  His rotations were as confusing as they were awful, and he had no sense of how to develop young talent.  He doesn't even let young guys play.  The ONLY thing he seemed to excel at was drawing up clever plays during timeouts."
LeBron James.
"I mean, they could also view it as the number of Hall of Famers needed to bring down Lebron James."
"Minor nitpick: thanks to Lebron James and Kyrie Irving, I wouldn't say unparalleled.  Jordan Bulls and Kobe/Shaq Lakers three-peated.  &amp;#x200B;  Then again, the 60's celtics won 11 titles in 13 years, but there were only 2 teams in the league back then."
"One thing I'd say though is that people were going crazy during that time period and were being complete asshats when it came to LeBron. I'm not sure I have ever seen as much hate as that first year after he left Cleveland, people think KD had it bad but this was another level as anyone who loved the NBA during that time period would tell you I'd imagine. I'd also throw in it wasn't unwarranted, that televised ""decision"" was such an awful way to go about things even if it was for charity.   So I guess my question is, when is it appropriate for an athlete (much less LeBron James) to snap back at that kind of shit? I think ""never"" is probably the right answer, but it would get tough to deal with that for anyone. Like if you were built like Thor and some fat dude just started talking shit non stop and there was no way for you to really avoid him because he follows you everywhere (much like that LeBron hate did) you might hold off for a while but eventually you'd call him a fat fuck in all likelihood."

If he continues, then it’ll be impossible to bring up his legacy as a basketball player without mentioning everything else he’s doing. A true role model. To say anything contrary is damaging to the youth. They’ve got an amazing role model teaching them important values and how it’s all bigger than basketball. That extends from the professionals who should be giving back to their communities all the way down the kid on his/her local team focusing on their school work and just having good morals."

"Lol at you.  The part that's odd for Steph, like why does that mean there has to be some beef between us? He loves LeBron, he respects LeBron, and he's like ... 'Because the outside world is pitting us together, why do you and I have to now have this disdain between us? I thought we were cool.' ""That's the question that's in Curry's mind and Curry's camp: 'Why do you not like me when all I did was basically respect everything you did and kind of follow the model you carried out?' So there's an interesting dynamic there, and it's not just with LeBron. ""Steph wants to be accepted by all these guys. This is what he worked for - for you to say, 'Man, you're one of us.' It seems like they don't want to give that to him. Not yet, anyway.""   SPORTS LeBron James and some of the NBA's biggest stars have reportedly had a 'disdain' toward Stephen Curry that he doesn't understand Scott Davis Jun 3, 2018, 3:27 PM ET lebron steph Ezra Shaw/Getty  Stephen Curry is a respected and popular player in the NBA, but some of the league's other top stars, including LeBron James, have been irritated by his rise, according to a 2017 report. Some NBA stars reportedly felt annoyed by Curry's rise and the fact he seemed immune to criticism from the sports world. Curry was reportedly aware of this feeling and was confused by it, feeling he had proved himself as one of the NBA's best players. Stephen Curry is one of the best, most respected, and most popular players in the NBA, but his quick rise in the league reportedly rubbed some of his peers the wrong way.  In 2017, Marcus Thompson of The Athletic, author of the book ""Golden: The Miraculous Rise of Steph Curry,"" explained to ""The Big Lead with Jason McIntyre"" that Curry was not all that popular with some of the league's biggest stars, including LeBron James.  ""There's this thing there with he and LeBron that's a little weird,"" Thompson said.  According to Thompson, James and Curry were close from Curry's days at Davidson to his early years in the league. Thompson said James was ""like a mentor"" to Curry, but as Curry's game improved, coinciding with the Warriors' rise, he ""challenged LeBron's status."" Since then, the two apparently haven't been as close, and it reportedly bothers Curry.  Thompson said:   ""The part that's odd for Steph, like why does that mean there has to be some beef between us? He loves LeBron, he respects LeBron, and he's like ... 'Because the outside world is pitting us together, why do you and I have to now have this disdain between us? I thought we were cool.' ""That's the question that's in Curry's mind and Curry's camp: 'Why do you not like me when all I did was basically respect everything you did and kind of follow the model you carried out?'

It seems like they don't want to give that to him. Not yet, anyway."" During the 2016 Finals, the second rematch between the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers, things got noticeably heated between James and Curry as James' Cavs came roaring back and eventually won the series.  In Game 6, James swatted one of Curry's shots and trash-talked him afterward. The two had bumped each other a few times and exchanged words. Finally, Curry was called for a foul, lost his cool, chucked his mouthguard, which hit a fan, and was ejected. From there, the ""beef"" seemed real.  It resurfaced on Thursday in Game 1 of the 2018 Finals, when the two exchanged words after James blocked a shot by Curry. James eventually pushed Curry out of the way, rankling Klay Thompson, who exchanged some words with James afterward.  Thompson said the root of this disdain for Curry came from his leapfrogging so many players so quickly in the NBA's elite and receiving adoration for it.  McIntyre brought up an incident in which Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook laughed when they were asked about Curry's defense in 2016. Thompson said it was another example of the chasm between Curry and some of the NBA's stars:  ""I think if you ask them and they were being honest, they don't like all the hype he gets, and they have to direct it that way. I think out of all of them, if somebody doesn't like Steph Curry, I think it's probably Westbrook. He just shows no sign of - this really ain't about Steph. It's bigger. His seems to be, 'I don't like that dude.' ""But LeBron and them, I think they will say: 'Man, I like Steph. We can have a conversation.' But there's something that burns them about the fact that Steph is the one that is exalted, and because of that, they want to go at him and, in fact, kind of demean his hype. They want to take him down."""

"It was an all time great series because when you look at the Cavs roster outside of James after Irving went down and look at how great the Warriors were that season (especially at home), they had no business winning a single game and they won 2.  Efficiency is important because 99% of the time it helps improve your odds of winning. But winning is the goal, and Lebron helped lead his team to 2 wins more than they should have had, with a totally depleted roster against an all time great team, so who gives a crap about efficiency in this particular instance"
"What do you want from them? Their mantra has been to maintain flexibility. That is why they gave out the one year deals to maintain cap space. A franchise can be in a much worse place than having cap flexibility, young assets, and Lebron James."
"I think everyone except the Pelicans benefited from this crazy turn of events.  The NBA got Los Angeles and NYC to be very active in social media over it.   ESPN got early ratings on the Zion Hype.   Zion is basically St Vincent St Mary LeBron James and people are already buying a pre decision lool.   New Orleans are getting to sell Zion as an even bigger star specially if they get AD to scout him....  Lets be real, the NBA makes more money making the big markets viewers recognise the new stars while giving it to small market teams than vice versa."
Isn't LeBron James a pf on any lineup either in Miami or Cleveland that went small-ball?

"Jackie Mac casually on a podcast: Rumor has it that the Pelicans are being run by gnomes.  Obviously, that's not likely, because gnomes don't exist.  But the rumors are out there.  Brian Windhorst on the Jump: I heard Jackie Mac talk about how the Pelicans are run by gnomes.  And we all know Jackie Mac doesn't just make stuff up.  Broussard on First Take: Both Jackie Mac and Brian Windhorst have both been hearing rumblings about the Pelicans being run by gnomes.  I don't know if that's true, but I trust those guys.  Colin Cowherd: Jackie Mac, Brian Windhorst, Chris Broussard, all saying it.  It would be one thing if it was just one.  But all these reputable reporters, all saying the same thing?  It's gotta be true.  The Pelicans are being run by gnomes.  That's a fact.  Adrian Wojnarowski: LeBron James kicks puppies and strangles cats."
"He has no official ownership stakes but it is believed that Rich Paul got the money to start Klutch Sports from his childhood best friend, Lebron James."
"Draymond and Bogut never played together again after game 4, which the Warriors won easily.  IMO the series never gets to 6 or 7 if Draymond plays 5, but there's no way to know.   &gt; But you’re literally comparing that to Kyrie and Love being out a full series. Seriously, that’s what you’re doing.  Well yeah, because one series had a +43 differential for the winner and the other had a +4. 2015 wasn't even close, in 2016 a single made shot in game 7 may have tipped the balance of the championship. The point remains, player issues effected both series.   &gt; And the Cavs 2015 injuries could not realistically have been overcome, they simply did not have the scoring talent to compete consistently over 7 games barring a complete melt down of the warriors. They were reduced to essentially a 7 man rotation that included Delly playing close to 40 mpg and James Jones getting key minutes. That is a 3 legged dog that can’t fight back. Lebron even had back issues that whole year so that was probably the worst iteration of Lebron we’ve ever seen besides his inexplicable performance in the 2011 finals.  It would have been a Warriors meltdown, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have happened. It would have been more likely without Kerr going with Iggy to start."
"So the warriors got blown out start to finish in game 6 and lost game 7 at home because they didn’t have bogut? Bogut played roughly 10 mpg on a team that liked to play small and in fact went small against the Cavs the year prior with bogut being electively benched for the last 3 games of 2015. But you’re literally comparing that to Kyrie and Love being out a full series. Seriously, that’s what you’re doing.  And the Cavs 2015 injuries could not realistically have been overcome, they simply did not have the scoring talent to compete consistently over 7 games barring a complete melt down of the warriors. They were reduced to essentially a 7 man rotation that included Delly playing close to 40 mpg and James Jones getting key minutes. That is a 3 legged dog that can’t fight back. Lebron even had back issues that whole year so that was probably the worst iteration of Lebron we’ve ever seen besides his inexplicable performance in the 2011 finals."
I really don’t agree with this. Why wouldn’t the Pelicans trade their superstar who completely loathes them for 2 more years of guaranteed LeBron? Can you imagine the crowds that would flow into New Orleans trying to witness LeBron James and Zion playing together? They would instantly become a large market. I think that alone would be worth it.
"Kemba Walker - $3  Danny Green - $1  Lebron James - $5  Marcus Morris - $1  Joel Embiid - $5  &amp;#x200B;  Remember Shaq/Kobe? This lineup is akin to that one.   **Offense:** LBJ would be the primary ball handler surrounded by great shooters. Embiid can also carry that load by posting up and passing it out when he gets double teamed and unlike Simmons, LBJ can shoot.  **Defense:** Embiid is one of the best rim protectors so that is covered. On the perimeter, I have Green who is known for is defense and can cover for Kemba's occasional mistakes. Lastly, I have the rough Morris, who can cover for LBJ's mishaps.   &amp;#x200B;  Or alternatively,  &amp;#x200B;  Rajon Rondo - $1  Jrue Holiday - $3  Kevin Durant - $5  Al Horford - #1  Anthony Davis - $5"
"I would bet my entire life that Lebron James, as he is in this very moment, is a better player than Zion will ever be."
umm... Lebron James?
"exactly.  They couldn't even coast to the playoffs behind Lebron ""Best player since MJ"" James.  They aren't that good."
yeah but at least lebron james had lebron james on his team for that.
LeBron james is my GOAT  67 wins with Mo Williams? gtfo
Raptors losing game 1 is what happens 90% of our series. We usually come back to tie it in game 2 unless your team has LeBron James. So yeah I trust the team but it's going to be extremely difficult.
"Good. Fuck LeBron James' legal tampering, fuck the league for normalizing this, and fuck the Lakers. You should not be able to poison the water for a small market team and reap the benefits."
"Yeah we’ve been shit but right now we’re actually in the best position we have been in since Kobe retired.   We have a solid young core, all our picks, lebron james and cap room for a max FA in a loaded class.   I’m not one of the Laker fans who are upset with the FO, I actually think Jeanie is a great owner and Joey and Jesse Buss are great at what they do, especially Jesse running our scouting department."
"I like how people try to act like we’re in a bad position . We literally have a top 5 pick, young guys that have shown potential, a max cap slot, and LEBRON JAMES."

So it costs less than the LeBron James school gym renovations? Lol
"That's the difference between the respect of Kobe among players and a guy with a losing record in the Finals like Lebron James  Kobe hasn't played in 3 years and his mentality regularly referenced. Nobody has ever said ""you need to play like lebron"" or ""that was a Lebron mentality"""
Because NO doesn't want a bunch of young guys who are wildly overrated because they wear purple and gold and can't even make the playoffs with LeBron Freakin James?
"""LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARDS FOR HUMAN LIFE""  I will upvote anything Kevin Harlan, Mike Breen quotes. Those two are hands down my favourite announcers of all time. It's a privilege listening to them and they make basketball so much more fun to watch."
"That entire series was beyond painful. Everything went bad for the warriors, Lebron James playing like the 2nd coming of Jesus, and even then they barely squeaked by in game 7"
"&gt;You are okay with James returning to Cleveland after Irving was drafted and having Love there?  Honestly, it's ridicolous how many people buyed the whole ""I'm coming home"" BS when it was clear as the day that if Lebron wasn't 1000% sure to have K-Love and Kyrie waiting for him there, he would have stayed the fuck away Cleveland"
"&gt;	Did you just cherrypick two series?  &gt;	Look up his career numbers in the ECF vs the finals then get back to me  [Here](https://www.statmuse.com/ask/nba/lebron-james-averages-in-the-finals) you go bud.   So you can read OPs post and gets his ECF numbers, and his finals numbers are 28/10/8. So tell me again how you came to the conclusion that lebron only does it against the “farmers conference”?"
"I know I am biased, but I want to defend why many of us C's fans thought/think he is a generational talent last year.  Comparing Tatum’s rookie year to other players who played the majority of their rookie season as a teenager. Here is a list of some of the better players, (in no particular order):  Lebron James Kobe Bryant Giannis Antetokounmpo Tracy McGrady Carmelo Anthony Kyrie Irving Bradley Beal Kevin Durant Tony Parker Andrew Wiggins Devin Booker  Here is where Tatum ranked in counting stats:  PPG = tied for 6th APG = 10th TRB/G = 3rd STL/G = 6th BLK/G = 5th TOV/G = 2nd  Counting stats placed Tatum in the middle of this pack of players. He’s not the best, but not the worst either.  Here is where Tatum ranked in shooting:  FG% = 1st 3P% = 1st FT% = 4th TS% = 1st eFG% = 1st  There is no doubt that Tatum was the best shooter out of all these players.   Here is where Tatum ranked in some advanced stats:  WS = 1st OWS = 3rd DWS = 1st VORP = 3rd BPM = 3rd OBPM = 7th DBPM = 1st ORTG = 1st DRTG = 2nd TOV% = 1st TRB% = 4th AST% = 10th STL% = 7th BLK% = 3rd  Advanced stats absolutely loved Tatum, especially on the defensive side of the ball.  Summary: Among the elite players that had rookie seasons as teenagers, Tatum definitely looked like he belonged. Offensively, Tatum’s shooting was been better than anyone on this list and Tatum was also the best at taking care of the ball. His assists numbers are the worst among the bunch. Defensively, advanced stats love him above the rest.   Admittedly he should not have been ""untouchable"" in an AD trade and that is where the delusion started. However, to have high hopes of him being a generational talent was not unfounded.   In my mind, this year was a sophomore slump and he could be back to being a generational talent projection next year."

"I disagree.  You never hear LeBron, Harden or Durant referred to as a 'veteran' (even though they've all been in the league a long time).  As in, ""nice move by the veteran James"".  The announcers may not mean it as a pejorative but it is almost exclusively applied to role players or guys who are long past their primes.  ""Great play from the veteran David West"", etc.  My point is that a lot of people, including the play by play guys, seem to consider Iggy washed when he's still clearly a top tier athlete.  He deserves better than being called a veteran, he's the Ginobli of the warriors."

"They also need lebron playing to beat lebron, and they need a solid supporting cast around lebron to beat lebron. Basically just put kyrie and Kevin love on the Lakers for one season and see how KD destroys them so this dumb theory gets put to bed also this years version of the KD-less warriors feels different than that 2015 team, more experienced and better execution down the stretch. Well wait to see if and how they react to to Giannis but he will definitely be more problematic than James who plays a more tempered style."
"&gt;he is everything Lebron james is     Gonna have to disagree on that one. Kd has never had to facilitate and run an offense like Lebron does, and is nowhere near the passer that Lebron is. KD is a better shooter, but lets not get ridiculous and say Lebron can't shoot. Lebron is absolutely a good shooter. Not great, but definitely good.    In essence, kd is just a safety net for the warriors when Steph or klay don't shoot (ore are cold), they just give it to him in an ISO situation (which he is very good at) where he scores cause of the great spacing on the warriors. You can't leave Steph and klay open, so you can't double kd. Kd is also not a leader, Lebron is, and he has admitted as much. It is Steph's team, and he is showing us again why that is.    Another thing that no one talks about is that KD has also never had to deal with even close to as much media as Lebron has for the last 16 years. Even with KD making his move to GS, it was still mostly about Lebron and how he would react lol.    They are both GREAT players, but Lebron literally does everything, not just score, and that's why he is a better player in my opinion."
Because he is everything lebron james is but he has an actual jump shot and is deadly from 3.
"So he says, but that’s the same guy that spends approximately 87K on post game outfit accessories and that’s not even including jewelry. https://theundefeated.com/features/lebron-james-game-1-outfit-and-accessories-cost-more-than-45000/"
"He averaged 34ppg in last year's finals, with a 51 point performance. Not to mention he averaged 27.4ppg, with the lowest mpg in his career this far. The talk about his decline is ridiculous, he's still able to put up the numbers when he wants.  If the Lakers do get Anthony Davis, or any star for that matter, his current team will be drastically better than what he was working with back in 2016. His ability to play at an insanely high level has not changed, so if the Lakers do manage to build a good team around him, there is no reason they can't make a title run.  4 years is a long time, sure, but this isn't the typical NBA player we're talking about. It's LeBron James."
NBA sources say LeBron James has requested a trade for Kevin Love after watching today’s game of zones video.
"*Stephen A Smith voice*  Okay now Max, let me cover everything and put my disclaimers up there so I can be a TOUCH critical of LeBron James   LeBron is a great father, husband, generous philanthropist etc."
"Exactly, not hard to get your own as an all star when the other team is focused on limiting LeBron James.  &amp;#x200B;  Kyrie showed how effective he is as the #1 focus of the other teams defense versus a lesser team."
"""Kings Ransom of a deal""  You do realize that plenty of people weren't as high on Lonzo/Ingram/Kuzma as Lakers fans are, right?  Especially at that time, when Ingram hadn't gone on his late season tear of good play before the blood clot?  Or that future first round picks from a team that has both LeBron James and Anthony Davis (plus cap room for potentially another star) probably wouldn't be seen as picks that will have much value?"
Kyrie had lebron fucking james when he played steph.  I think we’ve seen how good kyrie is now when he doesnt have an all time legend with him in the playoffs
"Yup.  &gt;Reddish believes the national spotlight that followed college basketball’s national player of the year at Duke and in the lead-up to the June 20 NBA draft has been over-the-top.  &gt;“I do think it’s a little bit of unfair,” Reddish said. “But I think he’s more than capable of overcoming all that.”  &gt;At Tuesday’s draft lottery, Williamson tried to cool some of the hype by noting, “a lot of people see me as a superstar. I’m an 18/19-year-old rookie.”  &gt;Reddish said he knows Williamson differently than as a player who’s drawn LeBron James-level attention. Reddish said he's a goofball.  &gt;“He already embarrassed himself enough at the (draft lottery),” Reddish joked. “I love Zion. He’s a phenomenal guy to be around. He’s all laughs and giggles. He’s super, super humble. He shouldn’t be. I enjoyed his presence.”"

Kevin ducking Durant did it lol. Chris god damn Bosh did it. They both took pay cuts for one player. LeBron James.
"&gt; you’re a liar   No you are. Literally right out of your fucking mouth. I said it’s not indicative of a second round exit. You disagreed. That means you support the antithesis of my argument. So what the fuck are you talking about . You literally fucking said it.  Jeez you’re both backtracking and trying to defend your claim at the same time  Imagine calling someone a liar when all the comments are right there lmao   &gt; thunder sixers rockets   Two of those aren’t close to 70 and the third played the best team in the league in the second round   &gt; heavily upvoted  You have one comment with a whopping 24 upvotes and the rest don’t have shit. So even if you were appealing to authority it’d be a shitty appeal. But uh yeah I’m the liar I guess lol   &gt; Jrue is not the difference   This is a fair point If the person making it has a severe brain disability. But I assume you don’t so it’s a shitty point. The healthy lakers squad was fighting for the third seed and you’re conveniently forgetting three of their starters didn’t play a solid portion of the season.    So yes. A healthy Lakers squad with Jrue and LeBron fucking James has the potential to be WCF contender, all other things constant. especially seeing as there’s potential for several teams to get weaker this off season.    &gt; you assume Bron don’t decline   Because there’s nothing to suggest he will? He maintained his stat line from last year with arguably much less effort. I tend to base my arguments on facts, not bullshit narratives that make me sound like I know what I’m talking about  &gt; jrue Bron not win in west!!!1  I didn’t say that. I said that a team with 3 scorers in the 20 ppg range isn’t what you’d typically imagine a second round exit to be. It doesn’t fucking matter that there’s exceptions because my observation was based on perception (expectation of team performance as opposed to actual team performance)  I’m really entertained by this but it’s starting to get boring when you’re just saying the same dumb shit over and over.    Also.   &gt; isn’t a massive correlation between 70 ppg game scorers and making it past he second round!!!!!  Never said this. Simply said it wasn’t always indicative of a team that won’t pass the second round. Which is a completely subjective statement btw so the fact you got so butt hurt over it is hilarious."

"from another comment:   2018 Playoffs (Last Year)  Value Over Replacement Player  Harden - 4th  Curry - 6th  Box Plus/Minus  Harden - 2nd  Curry - 6th  Win Shares  Harden - 7th  Curry - 8th  PER  Harden - 6th  Curry - Outside the Top 10  Curry did not have a better playoffs than Harden even last year (and certainly not this year). ESPN kept a running ladder for most valuable players in the playoffs. The link below has the final rankings even after the Finals. They gave the edge to Harden over KD at 2, but I personally would have KD 2nd and Harden 3rd because of the finals.  Curry was ranked 6th on the list. People forget that there were legitimate questions about Curry's health last year in the playoffs because he was playing so poorly. He literally did not play the first 6 games of the playoffs and in the 15 games he did play he scored under 20 points 4 different times. He did have a really good overall finals despite the 3 for 16 performance for 11 points in game 3, but to say Curry outplayed Harden in the playoffs last year is very very debatable.  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/mvptracker23754885/nba-playoff-mvps-ranking-lebron-kevin-durant-james-harden-top-superstars    Also this year Harden had higher PPG,APG,RPG, eFG%,TS%, PER, Offensive Rating and better Defensive Rating than Steph and KD in their matchup series. Is it really that delusional to think Hardens been better given Steph’s inconsistency and room for error he has??"
"Wholeheartedly agree!  On paper, there's absolutely a case to be made that Lebron belongs in the competitor category. I'd add taking a pay cut as a sign of being a competitor over maxing out on earning potential, which Lebron did in Miami.  That being said, *watching* Lebron makes me think he's a company man just trying to leverage his athletic ability in the NBA [to become a billionaire.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2018/07/01/lebron-james-takes-big-step-in-goal-to-be-a-billionaire-with-move-to-lakers/)  This is part of the reason I'm currently holding out judgement on whether Lebron belongs in the GOAT Tier next to MJ, Kareem, Bill Russell, and Wilt or if he's in the Champions Tier with the likes of Kobe, Duncan, Magic, Hakeem, etc."

Lebron James didn't guard big men. At least not effectively
Here are the two articles I found on the matter:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2825181-david-griffin-cavs-tried-to-pair-kevin-durant-lebron-james-after-2016-finals.amp.html  https://www.google.com/amp/s/cavsnation.com/cavs-news-david-griffin-lining-up-potential-kevin-durant-acquisition-after-2016-nba-finals/amp/  Clearly it was a pipe dream that would have gutted the roster. All the Warriors had to do was not resign Harrison Barnes and Festus Ezeli. KD’s chances of winning a title would have been much lower in Cleveland (with the remaining player they would have had) than in Oakland. Combine that with living in the Bay Area as opposed to Cleveland and the answer was pretty obvious. LeBron had nothing to do with it. The Cavs never even had a meeting with KD in the Hamptons.
[Why Lebron James is undoubtedly better than Kobe Bryant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS9VhThNWg)
He was good for four months and the only two months he struggled happened to coincide with him trying to fit with Lebron James who even Kevin Love/Kyrie Irving/Chris Bosh/Dwayne Wade took time to adjust to.
He had to adjust to lebron James joining the team when he’s always been an on ball player. He hooped post allstar
"I don't think the Bucks were building to beat the Warriors so much as they are building to be their own juggernaut.  If you look at truly transformational players in the NBA right now (that is, guys who by their very presence change the way the game is played), the best two are probably now Curry and Antetokounmpo with LeBron James finally looking like he might have slowed down.  Curry has incredible gravity and changes the geometry of the floor. Giannis does the same, but from the inside (in many ways, he has the modern offensive version of Shaq's impact).  There are many other incredibly talented players who deserve top billing (Kawhi, Harden, etc.) but those two in particular just completely change what is possible.  As a result, I think the Bucks got to where they are by adding a coach who knew what to do with that (Bud) and supporting pieces (more shooting, e.g. Lopez) that maximize what their superstar can do. They match up with the Warriors because they have a guy who has the same kind of impact as Curry, and that's what you need to match them."
Giannis is so locked in this season he's looking forward to the possibility of playing LeBron James and the LA Lakers in the finals.
Remember Lebron James?
"“My dear friend Karen, who I have known for a *LONG*  , LONG time, and is a long time associate of Jeanie Buss, has informed me that their are rumblings within her circle and the Lakers organization to trade LeBron James”"
Who was in that spin class you ask?  LeBron james
You guys literally had Lebron James twice shut up
"He wasn’t allowed to fire Luke earlier in the season or last season. Jeanie was adamant that she didn’t want to be a franchise that got a new coach every 18 months and really valued the continuity.    I believe he only got the green light when it was clear we were missing the playoffs.   Also, Presidents of teams have done a LOT worse than get them LeBron James and waste a year. He’d be the worst ever seen if he’d have mortgaged our entire future for nothing like Billy King did."
"What? Yes? They will?? Are you silly lmao your OKC example literally proved my point. They all kept their production up.  Let’s think of another example. Oh when KD went to GS his numbers took a big drop because he had to share the ball with Klay and Curry! Oh wait no they didn’t, the warriors just scored a shit ton more points.   And one team has Paul George and the other has LeBron fucking James"
"Curry is 3-1 against LeBron, Finals MVP’s LeBron has the advantage, All-NBA doesn’t really matter because you can lead a team to a great regular season and still get swept in the first round. There aren’t any guards better than Steph, sure people put up good numbers, but Steph consistently scores 25+ and leads his team to a 1/2 seed.   Also, Steph can play as the first or second option on a team whilst LeBron can only play one style of basketball. Steph can move without the ball and find an open shot or create his own shot anywhere on the floor as well. Steph shoots a high clip from inside and outside, Steph is also the best FT shooter of all time while LeBron has been mediocre.   Steph might catch a 4th ring this year and showed up in a game 6 without KD to win a series against what could be a back to back MVP in James Harden.  The Warriors could lose KD this offseason and still win the championship next year. They’ll bring back Klay and be able to pick up another quality Bench player such as Rodney Hood, Tyreke Evans, Trevor Ariza, Or Demar’e Carroll."
LeBron James &amp; JR Smith. Truly an unstoppable force
"Exactly, people are approaching this like we're desperate for a superstar. We already have a superstar, we have fucking LeBron James *and* we literally have stars requesting to get traded to us every fucking year.  People have let the memes and narratives get into their head and forget that."
"&gt; in the last 20 years   You can go back even further, to the advent of the draft lottery in 1985. List is still only Tim Duncan, LeBron James, and Kyrie Irving."
"&gt;  The rumors were heavy  Just to be clear, the rumors came from a random post on a sub just like this one and you know this, right? With not a single reputable news site taking the 'source' seriously. It would be like me saying /u/southernmayd cries himself to sleep and then have half a dozen personal blogs (which wouldn't fact check) ""reporting"" the same thing to get clicks from the people who would search for it. You had those clearly random blogs reposting but that was it, not even TMZ (which is awful but at least reliable on finding out about those things) made news on this, the most they've had being one about a site being sued for defamation.  I mean, look at the shitty effort that random users were trying to make for sites to pick up on it. They were [sending great e-mails like this at the time](https://deadspin.com/ridiculous-rumors-started-by-internet-varmints-delonte-5539388):  &gt;My uncle is the general contractor at the Q and has been for the last 7 years. He is good friends with a lot of guys at the Q including some of the bigger boys in the organization and knows Gilbert personally. I was just told from my brother that a very reliable source informed my uncle that Delonte has been banging Gloria James for some time now. Somehow I guess Lebron found out before game four and it has destroyed our chemistry and divided our team. This is no joke, the only player worse then Lebron has been Delonte. I am not making this up, I wish it wasn't true but it happened. Wait and see if lebron stays you will not see Delonte in a cavs uni again.  Or this other one from someone with 'word from David Stern's office lmao:  &gt;A large number of NBA employees received a VERY interesting email today regarding a developing LeBron James story. I figured before the ESPN assholes get wind of it, you guys should break the story. The word from David Stern's office is that Delonte West has been sleeping with LeBron's MOTHER for a couple months now, and LeBron has recently found out. For some reason Delonte is still alive, but not for long - when Cleveland fans find out that for this reason LeBron wants out of Cleveland no matter what. This could explain Delonte's decreased playing time of late, and who knows - maybe why LeBron hasn't seemed to have his head fully in the game.  It's odd to believe on this.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;I remember reading something more concrete than I'm writing now (but it wasn't definitive), but I can't find it right now.  Find it. Post it."
"Two of those picks became Kyrie Irving and LeBron James (and we turned one into Kevin Love, cementing our 'Big 3'), how is that a mark of a poorly run organization?"
You have Lebron James and you couldn't do shit. GTFO
"First, LeBron will be a far better player than Zion will be for the duration of Zion’s rookie contract....the Lakers would never do it.   Second....The Lakers would require more than Zion Williamson in a trade for LeBron James. The Pelicans aren’t going to send Zion, a few future draft picks and a guy like Jrue Holiday to Los Angeles......that is assuming that huge heap would even be enough to get the trade done. LeBron is still a Top 2 player at 34. Zion hasn’t played a game in the NBA.   Third.....Drafting Zion may not be enough to keep Anthony Davis from leaving. Even if LeBron WERE to get traded, who knows how long he’d play after the trade. He may say fuck it and retire. New Orleans isn’t going to risk losing Zion, Davis AND James and be left with nothing. On top of the other players and future draft picks attached to the trade.   Never, ever, ever going to happen....."
2003 draft.   LeBron James and Darko Milicic.
"I think you can kind of tell what's generating clicks by what most of the stories are about. Bill Simmons indirectly (or maybe directly) said years ago that with Grantland he wasn't going to let his writers see the ""click count"" for each piece.  When 50% of the stories on ESPN's NBA page are about LeBron James, it's because that was getting the most clicks.  Which is also the reason that small market teams like the Spurs get almost no coverage, even when they won the NBA finals. Less clicks equals less coverage. Sorry, Spurs. Let's find out what LeBron thinks about the Spurs winning the title."
"Steph Curry is the second best player in the NBA, behind Lebron James. Actually him and Durant are interchangeable atm. Others are irrelevant untill they win something as team leaders"
"3/4 in finals appearances, back to back MVP’s. 3 rings over LeBron. Not to forget that he has changed the way people play the game. Without Steph, James Harden doesn’t get to ball out (ISO step back three or drive every play) in Houston and Damien Lillard doesn’t even practice that shot."
Zion is definitely in the “LeBron” or “Kobe” echelon of names where it’s iconic enough that it can stand alone but even they had King James and the Mamba. I think adding a little New Orleans flair to it can be fun
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Delonte West. The cuckolding is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Gloria James most of the memes will go over a typical nephew's head. There's also Delonte's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. Lebron understands this stuff; he has the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these memes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Delonte West truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the cuckolding in Delonte's existencial catchphrase ""I fucked your mom"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Delonte West's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂   And yes by the way, I DO have a ""Gloria"" tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."
"""Aristotle, Newton, Sagan, Copernicus, and hopefully James. That is the starting intellectual 5 that LeBron could find himself in if he nurtures that genius on the court by going to college.""  - Theoretical Bill Walton"
"You have a very interesting interpretation of a good signing. When the deal was signed, it was pretty universally panned and seen as throwing a bone to a clutch sports and hoping to get in the good graces of LeBron.  "" Oh hi Lakers, it's Mav.  I see you got a fuck ton of cap space and I got a client who ain't getting shit anywhere else. I know you want LeBron in a year, so why don't you show us how committed you are to him."". Pretty much extortion lol.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/hoopshype.com/2017/07/19/kentavious-caldwell-pope-gives-lebron-james-agent-better-access-to-lakers/amp/"

"Connor McDavid and Sidney Crosby were top 10 players in the NHL their rookie seasons.  Mookie Betts and Mike Trout, same thing.  LeBron James, same thing.  I don't know why it's so hard to believe a highly hyped prospect is in the top 200 players in the league. Embiid, Simmons, Tatum, all were better than league average their rookie seasons. Zion is hyped more than any of them.  In his first game Zion will absolutely be better than half the league. Probably closer to 75% of the league.  Lmao"
Has anyone else forgotten that Lebron James still exists?
"Son of a BITCH do I hate the Warriors. I know most everyone does but for me it goes much deeper than that. I am beyond hate. 4 straight Finals. 4 straight Finals have I put up with the Warriors and their nonstop Warrior winning wats. I have had to watch Draymond Green eat his fucking W's for the past half decade. My friend is a Jazz fan, he says ""Oh yEaH I HatE tHe WaRRiOrs tOo BrO"" and I say You dumb bitch. Shut the fuck up with your dumb bullshit. We have to play them FOUR TIMES A YEAR, EVERY YEAR. and he says ""yeah but"" and I can't even hear him because at this point I'm thinking about that youtube thumbnail of baby faced, chewing on his mouth guard, cocky little fuck Steph Curry when he dad dicked the Thunder and there is blood in my ears and hate in my heart. FUCK.  And don't even get me started on their fans. One of my ""friends"" is a Warriors and a Patriots fan. THEY'RE ON OPPOSITE COASTS YOU FUCK. And he has the nerve to call me out for being a Clippers and a Saints fan. LA (louisiana) DIDN'T HAVE A BASKETBALL TEAM WHEN I STARTED WATCHING, YOU STUPID BITCH. I CHOSE THE TEAM WITH THE PRETTY COLORS CAUSE I DIDNT REALIZE THEY WOULD HAVE SATAN AND HIS SNEK AND DONKEY IN THEIR DIVISION. I love how on this subreddit you can go to any given comment thread and find some idiot with a warriors flair talking about Curry. Every warriors fan would let steph curry shit in their cereal every morning for a FORTNIGHT just to suckle one of his ring fingers. and I just KNOW that they're reading this right now, because they infest game threads like a ganon of leeches, and halfway through skimming it with their limited reading skills they realize they have an erection, so they ctrl+shift+n and search ayesha curry feet until they bust a nut onto the keyboard, posting comments like ""if this wasnt curry people would think this was cool"" or just ""mmmphmmgofgpsngfjg"" because they still have Steph Currys DICK in their mouth.  They say don't cheer for injuries. Fuck that. I hope Steph Curry gets hit by an airplane. He'll be screaming at one of his teammates who works day in and day out for him, because the warriors are only up 74 - 8, and some insane fan will just lose it and prison shank him 3 times, and then once more for good measure. And I'll watch that shit on youtube for the rest of my life. I'll be there at his funeral to comfort Ayesha with hors d'oeuvres but when it's my turn to sprinkle dirt on his coffin I'll drop a picture of LeBron James instead. And when security drags me out for causing a rumpus I'll just laugh and laugh, because I know that I hired the insane fan to do it. It was my plan all along. All I had to do was promise him the chance to wear step currys skin. Oh, you thought the funeral was closed casket out of respect? No, no my friend. His SKIN is gone. Where is it now, you ask? It's been... distributed. A small bribe to the chef was all it took. And now Ayesha is wondering why her pig in a blanket has the faint taste of vegetable curry ice cream, and the tears begin again as my laughter drowns out the wind and the rain. And the world keeps spinning. I am home now. Some days are good. Some days aren't. All I can do is live what life Curry has left me."

"The Cavs' playoff years coincides exactly with the Cavs' LeBron James years. His first stint is 2003-10, his second is 2014-18. Also: the franchise goes from not making the playoffs, to 4 finals appearances in 4 years, to not making the playoffs."
"If LeBron James got the super team he wanted, Magic would still be around. Magic Johnson was jealous of LeGoats success and was trying to hold him down obviously"
James Harden is not better on offense than kd or lebron in the playoffs IDC what the stats say
Lebron James and his team look like idiots as well. They put Lebron in a toxic situation full of people who can't run a team properly.
maybe in a world where LeBron James just straight up fuckin doesn't exist

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true          shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"&gt;Kyrie Irving ""opted out of what Love is dealing with,"" Windhorst said. ""Love deals with the persecution of being a LeBron teammate, of being blamed, of dealing with his social-media undercutting, of being the fall guy, as he's called himself.""  &gt;He added: ""There have been so many days and nights where Kevin Love has walked out of a building feeling beleaguered or beaten down either directly because of LeBron"" or indirectly.  &gt;But Windhorst says Love insists that it's all worth it because playing with James also means playing late into the season and competing for championships.  &gt;""I have to give Kevin a real major hat tip for being a professional and being an adult about it,"" Windhorst said. ""He has always seen the big picture ... He has always maintained that this is all worth it, that playing in these late games — I mean, this is a guy who played for six years, whatever it was, never sniffed the playoffs. He's like: 'This is where I'm at right now. This is the charge for playing with [James].'"""
I don’t think it’s rigged every year but it is very suspicious that the A list #1 picks have gone where they have.  2003–Cleveland after sucking for years gets hometown star Lebron James.  2004–Tracy McGrady is leaving the same off-season.  Orlando gets Dwight Howard as a replacement.  2005–No #1 pick with superstar upside.  2006–No #1 pick with superstar upside.  2007–Seattle SuperSonic amidst turmoil given 2nd pick guaranteed Oden or Durant.  2008–Hometown star Derrick Rose the clear #1 pick given to Chicago.  2009–Clippers given Blake Griffin.  2010–Wizards win John Wall.  2011–Kyrie gifted to Cleveland a year after Lebron leaves and the roster is a dumpster fire.  2012–Pelicans gifted Anthony Davis after losing superstar Chris Paul.  2013–No clear #1 pick.  2014–No clear #1 pick.  2015–Wolves win KAT after losing proven star Kevin Love in trade.  **Not sketchy like the situations surrounding other teams that won a top pick though**.  2016–After years of sucking with nothing real to show for it except 31 games from Embiid coming off a serious injury Philly wins Ben Simmons.  **Debatably not sketchy given they hadn’t won the 1st pick despite tanking as hard as possible for years**.  2017–No clear #1 pick.  2018–Phoenix wins first #1 pick ever.  Having only drafted 2 decent players since 2012(Booker and Warren).  Ayton and Doncic have superstar upside.  2019–Pelicans gifted Zion after superstar Anthony Davis makes it explicitly clear he is leaving and trying fri leverage a trade to the LAL.
Yea .. Magic Johnson helped sign LeBron James ... Phil Jackson at least caught a few net positives with the few assets he had.  Thomas buried the franchise for the entire decade. No contest.
"I don't get how people say KD is a top 2 player without any hint of how ridiculous it sounds.   He's the second best player on the Warriors. He's not in the same league of elevating a team to championships as Curry, Kawhi, Lebron.    His numbers look great because he never gets double teamed. If James or Kawhi were on the Warriors they'd be doing far more damage than KD.    He's a great player but nowhere near a top player. He doesn't have what it takes to win championships. That's why he had to bandwagon his way to his only rings"

"Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, Lebron James in 2016."
"First off I think that's a precendent that exists in every sport. If Lebron murdered the families of every other Laker, the first thing Jeanie would do is ask Lebron where he wanted the bodies.   Now, Russell aint Lebron, but Nick Young aint Russell. And its not like Nick Young was in the right - he cheated on his fiancee. No one wants to come out and say they support a snitch, but Im sure a lot of guys (Lebron ""married to the his hs sweetheart"" James in particular probably think Nick Young is a shitty person too.  In any case I dont think a single incident like keeping Dangelo is going to detract anyone from going to the Lakers. What might detract someone however is trading away every good player on the team for scraps until you cant even make the playoffs with Lebron."

The Raptors should probably be up 2-1 in this series, and while they have nobody to blame but themselves for not closing out Game 1, to pretend that this series has been all Bucks is laughable."

"imagine a world where Lebron James used burner accounts to argue with fans about whose fault it was that the lakers didn’t make the playoffs.  kevin is a cupcake. kevin wants to be the best basketball player in the world, but doesn’t know how to handle the hate that comes along with it."
Lol have you been watching the playoffs? The warriors are not playing better without him at all. If the warriors were to play like this against the Bucks or hell even Toronto and maybe even the Sixers THEY WOULD NOT WIN A SERIES they are fortunate the blazers are in the WCF.... I’ll give klay and Steph credit for closing out game six against the rockets without him but the rockets didn’t play anywhere near close to form. KEVIN DURANT IS A HALL OF FAMER. HE IS ARGUABLY THE BEST ALL AROUND SCORER OF ALL TIME. Nothing to prove. HIS RINGS ARE VALIDATED. WHY??? HE WAS SHITTING ON LEBRON JAMES WHEN IT MATTERED.

He didn't even play during the Golden State series.""  **Stephen A:** ""He's 23 years old!""  **Magic Johnson:** ""Listen now, LeBron James and Lonzo Ball made Zubac better. Why? Pick and roll, rolling for the dunks. Boom. He was going to be a restricted free agent. We knew we was going to use that cap space for a superstar. Now, I had to try and space the floor, so the trade I made I wanted to make sure I could see if we could space the floor, and it didn't work out. Now, Zubac has got a long way to go to be special, but we had to try things. So that wasn't a trade like we traded a guy to win a championship for the Clippers, but I will say Brook Lopez, I didn't get it done. I didnt get it done.""  **Stephen A:** ""By the way, Zubac 5 points, 5.5 rebounds per game""  **Magic Johnson:** ""Say it a little louder!""   **Stephen A:** ""I said 5 points, 5.5 rebounds in the postseason!""   **Magic Johnson:** ""Thank you, thank you."""
You're totally right.  Magic is being forthcoming only with respect to things that make him look better.  He completely dodged the question of why he didn't call Lebron James before stepping down.  There are many things he has no answer for.
Lebron hasn't won a finals game without King James Jones on the roster
The One True King James   Plus he taller than Lebron better shooter than Lebron and had better lineup   How can he not be the GOAT
This is just something small market teams like to circle jerk about and use as an excuse why their team is ass but lets just look at the last 10 years in the NBA. What big FA have signed with the Lakers in the last 10 years? Dwight Howard was traded. So its just LeBron. Who just signed 1 year ago. LeBron James signs with the Lakers at 33 years old and somehow that equals us having a cheat code because we get all the Super stars just because we are in a big market. How about the Knicks?
"&gt; Why wouldn't we be better than the Lakers. We're already better than the Lakers  Lebron James isn't coasting next season. Even if Lakers whiff on AD I think they likely get a Kemba Walker as consolation or even a Kyle Lowry. Why would I trust a team that hasn't made it to the playoffs in a decade except for the season when you had two top 25 players in the league, one of which left? Doubt KAT leads the team to 50 wins as long as Wiggins is getting 30MPG."
"Damn I didn’t know getting LeBron James, keeping majority of your young assets, and creating cap space for a max free agent was ruining the job."
"It's about the brand, LA and most importantly, *LeBron James*.  I don't think anyone is going to go ""Fuck I really want to go to the Lakers but I won't because of Rob Pelinka"""
"[Tbf, LeBron himself told Boozer to take the money in Utah] (https://thebiglead.com/2018/12/07/carlos-boozer-lebron-james-cavs-jazz/)"
"I think we're about to see that change. I mean CP3 / Blake only just left the Clips. Those are/were two of the biggest names in the league for a while. Although they didn't have success, the Clips have shown their BBIQ and are improving as an org.   &amp;#x200B;  The Lakeshow is a shitshow and other than Kyrie ""Morty"" Irving possibly wanting to play with ""daddy"" LeRick James again, I don't see lots of high profile guys going to LA until after LeBron is done and the org fixes itself. Hell Kyrie might not even want to get that close to the earth's edge and he may stay in the east somewhere, Toronto?  &amp;#x200B;  The west is stacked and if players are going to move to the west just to live in LA, it doesn't matter if it's the Clips or Lakers, but if you are going to include prestige or basketball reasons, the only current choice would be the team not melting down and that is the Clips."
Ty Lue may have that championship experience but he also had Lebron James. The marginal benefit of Lue over Saunders doesn't make the T-Wolves a championship team.
"I honestly feel bad for the Lakers. They have a good young core, they have fucking LeBron James, and they risk to accomplish nothing because of organization problems.      Let's see how it turns out during the offseason"
"I thought the Suns and Knicks were bad, this is the team with Lebron James on it."
"I just love how blind Magic is to how devastating this is to himself right now. He is doing himself zero favors right now and he’s putting the team he “loves” through absolute hell because he just couldn’t shut up.   The one person I feel bad for through all this is Lebron James. I mean, fuck this organization for putting the GOAT through all this. The man is still producing ridiculous numbers yet he has to deal with our trash team and as well as all the petty high school drama."
The clippers are not the lakers. The lakers are a historic team that makes a lottt of money and has a lot of notoriety. Believe it or not people still wanna play with lebron James.
"Their plan was like the Legion of Boom Seahawks. The refs can’t feasibly call 4 fouls every possession, especially not on Lebron James. Notice how they really only used this strategy against Golden State."
You could make a case that says James Jones was more responsible for the Heat and Cavs success than Lebron. He was kind of the glue in the lockerroom...which is more important than what you do on the court.
Really? I thought LeBron James was the coach of that team that won a championship.
"LeBron hasn’t won a ring since James Jones retired, just sayin"
"""I've heard from multiple people that LeBron James calls me his Howard Cosell.""  I cringed into oblivion when Skip said that."
"So the Raptors are down 2-1 in the Eastern Conference finals and are ""actual garbage"", but the Lakers with LeBron James for most of the season, comfortably missed the playoffs but are not ""actual trash""? You've clearly got such homer goggles on to not even see the massive hypocrisy in your thinking."
lebron james left the east lol
Y'all couldn't make the playoffs with fucking LeBron James lmao
"I’d say a role player is a guy the team brings in to make sure they’re getting the best out of their franchise player. That doesn’t mean they can’t be stars, and it doesn’t mean they have to be stars. Like lebron James, one could argue kyrie and Kevin love we’re role players even though they were both stars. The reasoning is because they brought love in and kept kyrie because they fit well with lebrons strengths"
Y'all got the 4th pick with Lebron James on your team lmao
"""The probability of Event B occurring, given that Event A never occurs is obviously zero."" - Lebron James"
"""lebron james needs to play more like kevin love"""
"LeBron ""RJ"" James"
https://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/?sort=POSS_PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*James&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season  Lebron has never been an iso guy because he’s not a great jumpshooter. More of a pick and roll scorer
"Just gonna put this out there. Kawhi had been absolutely unreal these playoffs and was against us, but is clearly worn out from last series. I think that speaks a LOT to how insane some LeBron James playoff runs have been where he just keeps going and going and doesn't stop"
Bring back LeBron James to playoffs
"Argumentsn favor of the Cavs:  -LeBron James is unstoppable. There's nobody on the Rockets who is both as quick and as strong as he is. The closest matchup is a still-good Clint Capela, but every other possible LeBron defender is either a slow big or a lighter-than-LeBron wing.   -LeBron James really is unstoppable. The Rockets will have to contend with 45 minutes of this guy. If he can win his minutes through sheer force of will and athletic body mass, the Rockets need to win the game in 3 minutes.  -The Rockets were built to defeat the Warriors. That means they were collectively designed to switch everything, shoot 3s, and draw fouls. The Cavs are a much different matchup. In many ways, the Cavs are much more similar to the Rockets than the Warriors. They iso like it's going out of style, shoot 3s at a higher rate than the Warriors, have a switchable center and streaky 3-point shooters, are built around a ball-handling, playmaker MVP, a ball-handling iso special All-Star, and a 3rd wheel big man who complements what his costars do. The switching defense is almost a detriment against a team that prefers getting good iso matchups over off-ball movement. The Cavs can shootout with the best of them, as evidenced by 2017 Game 4.  Arguments in favor of the Rockets:  -Kevin Love will get blended by Harden and/or Paul every time they go down court. He wasn't a plus defender in 2017, and this matchup plays to his weaknesses.  -Kyrie Irving and JR Smith aren't exactly inspiring defenders. The rest of the Cavs lineup is similarly shaky, and with so many questionable defenders, there is no place to hide anyone on defense. Outside of Anderson, the Rockets do not have such defensive problems.  -While Kyrie is incredibly difficult to bottle up, a good cast of wing defenders is probably the best way to do so.  -JR Smith."
and people here think he's really gonna go to the clippers where he'd have to do the same thing lmao. there's only one man in LA that he can team up with to win a title and his name is lebron james!
The Los Angeles Lakers have Lebron James on their team.
OP was probably trying to get gold by including LeBron James in the title. He failed to spell his name correctly tho.
"All star, a fan voted accomplishment. Don't you think that would be easy playing on a winning team with LeBron James (the biggest name in the league) and being one of his sole competent pieces? Cause it definitely would, look at Kemba getting in this year (Kemba is not my favorite PG), he got in mainly cause it was a home game."
Goddamn LeBron James lol
"Great players make others better around them.  Or that's the argument for Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Lebron James, and countless others greats or that's atleast how they've been portrayed by the media.  Why does the narrative change for Kevin Durant? What does it result too a low iq post about how  ""KD IS DA BETTER PLAYER, but STEPH IS DA MOST IMPORANT PLAYER"".  https://imgur.com/a/iROddqt  How does that even make any sense? The most important player is the best player. Without Steph they ain't going to the finals. Without KD they can still win a chip and they already proven that. Basketball is not a 1v1 game. It's a 5v5 game.  Wish i could downvote you more."
The young LeBron James model
Lebron James
Have you watched basketball the last decade? Is this your first year as a fan? Are you sure you're not confusing LeBron James with Devin Booker?
imagine getting lebron james on your team and still being a lottery team LMFAO.
"the hypocrisy of people on this sub is that they shit on los angeles &amp; NYC constantly, and then talk about how their own cities are amazing. and for some wild reason they wanna prop up the nets and clippers as though any star player looks at his options and thinks yeah ""lou will or dlo is the guy i wanna team up with to win a title, not that lebron james or KD guy"""
"Right??? That comment was absolute bs hahaha  The Clippers are literally positioning themselves to lure at least one established superstar, as they should. Brooklyn is supposedly going after Jimmy, as they should. Both teams want championships, and both know that simply developing what they have and ""making good trades"" won't be enough.  Not to mention the Lakers actually did sign *Lebron James*, which changes the entire way you need to operate the team. It's such a dishonest comment, mostly held up by omitting a lot of relevant data."
LeBron Raymone James Sr. would never!
"Having LeBron James, a nice young core, and cap space?"
Yo where is that video clip of Lebron James with Christopher Walken narrating about a lion. That got my so hyped back in the day
"Lebron James played legit 7 games of perfect basketball. Also, didn't he and Kyrie drop 40+ points in Game 5 or 6?"
"regardless of exact diagnosis, pretty sure it doesn't help to play with a puffy hand(scroll down a bit and comparisons show):  https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/06/11/lebron-james-hand-injury-photographic-investigation/"
Hes definitely a point guard but I wonder if in today's game we'd call him a point forward like a lebron James esque role
"It's almost as if that was - wait for it - **last year**.  And I'm just pointing out that criteria based on 2018 James is ridiculous, not agreeing that he's no longer the best. But for what it's worth, this sub was fully on the bandwagon that KD or Giannis were the new #1 when Lebron and the Lakers failed to make the playoffs. Here we are revising it just because the Dubs are good without KD. Lol."
Lebron James. Oh sorry I thought you said ALL the love from the refs my bad
"LeBron missed 17 straight games in the middle of the season, with the Lakers as the 4th seed in the West. That was extremely impressive. Then the failed AD trade happened and injuries to Ball, Rondo, and Ingram happened. Even then the Lakers still might have made the playoffs had LeBron not missed 17 straight games. The Lakers failing to make the playoffs was the result of a good number of straight mistakes and misfortunes and is not on James."
"Well we won more games than you last year, have another max contract, and have Lebron James so... yeah we are lol"
"LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, OKC choking, and Draymond's obsession with kicking people in the dick"
Paul George vs Lebron James in the 2013 ECF. For me that is when Paul George officially arrived.  He may not be the “star” you were looking for but I thought that was a great series where he established himself as a future star in the league.
"forced his way? he singed a bunch of 1+1 contracts, he could have gone whenever he fucking wanted he is LeBron James"
"Magic! Magic!  I am a KING!  You slayed lord bird in the past, but can you slay me?  They say you are the greatest of all time, prove it!  *lakers miss the playoffs* *Magic resigns in shame*  ""well.... good job Magic...you boomed me.  BUT I GOT YOU TOO!""  LEBRON JAMES.  *waves hands as if reading words in spotlight* GOT. MAGIC. JOHNSON. FIRED."
By your logic LeBron James is the only superstar in the league there’s no one that is remotely close to the amount of media exposures that he gets.
Steph Curry joins LeBron James as the only players to ever drop 35+ points at exactly 10:03 AM
"The untouchables:  These players are in everyone's top 10. If they aren't then that person is pretty much not to be taken seriously. These are guys I won't argue for. No reason to.

&gt;  He is the only superstar whose team ever played competitive basketball against Durant-led Warriors and the list of players who tried includes LeBron James twice.  The Clippers without any bonafide superstar gave them a good run for their money.
"Lebron ""nobody should wear 23 after Jordan"" James"
Y'all let LeBron fucking James leave... TWICE
What if LeBron James is the reason he doesn’t want to go there
"Lakers have assets, cap space and LeBron fucking James.  Regular season wins are irrelevant."
That’s called a dominant stretch lol how is that a rabbit out of a hat? Lebron James and Kyrie Irving essentially dominated he series after game 2.  Rabbit out of a hat would be getting unlikely performances out of players or pulling out fluke wins not blow outs and solid wins on the road... wtf are you talking about honestly
"Only the warrior killer can. At his slow and grind rhytm. Remember Memphis how tough was to beat? GS kryptonite is an old tough game with two bigs with great touch and 3 super athletic defenders, willing to sacrifice their body (Tony Allen). It makes me smiling, bc the most perfect and beautiful team ever assembled has only a bad: if they meet a junkyard dog team, with tons of contacts, who make them sweat for every shots, they loose part of their invincibility. That 2016 Cavs warriors series took the best off James, who apart from all, really understood this and started to dirt every possession. After that block, if u ever played, u know GS wouldn't have win, bc that type of play stop your thinking, above all in last 2 minutes. I'm trying to explain that it was needed a special version of Lebron James among all the other key pieces, to win that series. I don't see anyone in the nba besides the Bucks (but they have 0 experience once starts May) to pull a similar strategy (due to Mike Budenohlzer): straight to the rim and when they double up the star (Giannis), pass for the 3 point shot; on defense start to let them feel every fucking contact. I mean the strongness of this beautiful game is that coaches who compete for the championship can prepare their strategy year after year after seeing how the Champions had win and which modalities they used. If after 5 years (they have already won for me this nba title) only one team beat'em and it was Cleveland, man u have to watch every tape and understand why they just had the chance to re open that series."
Ah yes. The hot takes that he'd rather team up with Lou Williams than LeBron James.
"Lebron James needs to get younger, without having to lose all the experience he had gained of course."
"He has the audacity to say Lebrons overrated.   -Carried 2 different sorry ass rosters to the finals.  -He’s the best at being good at everything.  -8 STRAIGHT FINALS   -Last years post season run was something out of this world.   -2 points isn’t 2 points. I’ll explain later. Did you watch him EXPLAIN IT?  For fucks sakes lebron plays like he was created in a lab. The way he does everything. You can read faces when he’s on the floor, they know James is the best when he’s out there. When he was at his absolute peak he was literally out of the damn world.  His coasting is the rest of the leagues prime. I have full belief lebron isn’t slowing down anytime soon because he hasn’t showed a reason why he would.   He’s not overrated one bit. Recent bias, he’s underrated. Ain’t nobody doing it like LBJ.   Like I’m trying to look at this from every angle and I just can’t imagine how he’s overrated. He has set the bar so damn high, that playing anything under GOAT status he gets backlash. That should tell you something."
Winning 3 out of 4 games with 2 on the road and multiple blow outs is a rabbit out of a hat? Elite talent and shooting with Lebron fucking James and Kyrie Irving is a clear cut worse team? You need to reconsider your opinions on those 2 teams lmao.  The Cavs had by far the best player out of the two teams that automatically makes winning very possible.
"&gt; If you actually think Lebron James would want the Lakers to trade for Rudy Gobert, I guess we don't have much to talk about.   I mean, tbh after you posted Gobert was worth just Bridges and Zeller I think anyone with a brain figured your opinion wasn't really worth much, tbh.    Gobert on the Lakers meant they would've made the playoffs, for a start.    &gt;You actually think they would give up all their young assets to trade for a guy that plays the same position as Anthony Davis.   A.) Davis trade hasn't happened yet, and isn't guaranteed.      B.) Your dumb ass complains about me 'changing the discussion terms' then tries to spin 'willing to give up good assets' (literally your words) into 'give up all their young assets'?  Man, you are stupid.    &gt;even though the two best 5's Lebron has ever played with in terms of fit were Kevin Love and Chris Bosh, two of the most prolific big man shooters in history.  So... Lebron's two best 5s were shooters, and that somehow means... that Lebron only plays with shooters?    Not to mention that while both guys have played at the 5, the main centers on those teams were Joel Anthony / Haslem and TT.  Bosh and Love were primarily 4s.  Shit dude, you've literally gotten nothing right.    &gt;Atlanta will make the playoffs next year.   Only if Dennis Lindsey goes on a coke binge and trades them Gobert.    &gt;Charlotte has never been rational   Oh shit, it's the first thing we agree on.  But they've got Kupchak now, who's not an idiot, so you're still pretty wrong.    &gt;It illustrates the point that there aren't a lot of candidates to push hard to pursue Gobert.  It illustrates that you're fucking deluded.    &gt;Your last comment just shows that you really don't understand how trades work.   Lol, your initial proposal was Zeller and Bridges for Gobert.  Neither team would benefit from that.  The most basic principle of a trade is that both teams have to be interested in doing the trade for it to happen.  You fail.    &gt;If you already have a good center under contract, you wouldn't be a candidate to give up assets for Gobert.   You do if Gobert represents a significant enough upgrade to your guy.  And he would for a shitload of teams.  He hasn't been in trade rumors because everyone knows he's untouchable: if he were on the trade market people would damn well offer more than the garbage platter you posted.    You do not understand trades, you are ignorant about how basketball works, I don't think you understand how logic works, and the only thing that could probably keep the Warriors out of the playoffs next season would probably be your getting appointed GM."
ya a 35 year old Lebron James....time is running out for him.
"sure - i think luka is closer to making all star than BI too. but even your numbers are smacking you in the face that the gap isn't as crazy as you try to make it sound  * you bring up usage and that luka is first option and BI is third option as if that's supposed to prove that luka is better. luka was the main ball handler for dallas. we have a guy named lebron james who does a lot of that. * luka has a much higher usage rate than BI, yet only averages 3 points more, with shittier efficiency * you're trying to hide the disparity between their efficiency (luka 43% fg, bi 50%, both same 3%) by using their TS, yet even that's still saying BI was more efficient. so much for your ""much better scoring"" player losing that to a ""3rd option wing who cant shoot"". yikes * yea, advanced stats will favor doncic more than BI - he sucks at FTs and he doesnt shoot many 3s. this has been discussed ad nauseam.  if there's a difference, its not a huge difference. the only reason you think its ridiculous to suggest BI might make an allstar is because you dont like him or the lakers. enough said"
Lebron James.
 &gt;Lebron James clocks out as the 19th best player (not factoring GP) in the league by this model. Only 12 spots higher than 1 Danilo Gallinari   Lmfao
"Great analysis by you. I can give you some actual analysis if you want though.    Analytically in a model factoring PPG/RPG/APG/SPG/BPG/EFG/FT%/GP/ SGA/Gallanari/Lou Williams/Patrick Beverley/Green/Temple are all players who measure above the 40th percentile of active players last season.    For The Lakers only 2 players were above the 40th percentile.  Javale Mcgee and Lebron James.     Lebron James clocks out as the 19th best player (not factoring GP) in the league by this model. Only 12 spots higher than 1 Danilo Gallinari.     Lakers rookie contracts are going to be in cap trouble as rookie contracts run up. Not to mention Lebron James value is declining by the day.     And to finish this one sided journey off, The Lakers coaching/Front Office/Ownership situation is in shambles, while the Clippers may very well be the best in the league. These intangibles only add to the value of The Clippers as an org."
"well you see, kawhi leonard and lebron james are both very good basketball players, and having both of them on one team would make that team really good"
Warriors only fear Lebron James
Jrue Holiday  Buddy Hield  Danilo Gallinari  Lebron James  Rudy Gobert
"If you actually think Lebron James would want the Lakers to trade for Rudy Gobert, I guess we don't have much to talk about.  You actually think they would give up all their young assets to trade for a guy that plays the same position as Anthony Davis.  Rudy Gobert, who can't shoot outside the paint, even though the two best 5's Lebron has ever played with in terms of fit were Kevin Love and Chris Bosh, two of the most prolific big man shooters in history.  Atlanta will make the playoffs next year.  Charlotte has never been rational and honest about needing to rebuild and has Michael Jordan running the show.  That's why they MAYBE are on the list of the 5 teams that could rationalize pursuing Gobert.  And even then, I agree, they are long shots.  It illustrates the point that there aren't a lot of candidates to push hard to pursue Gobert.    Your last comment just shows that you really don't understand how trades work.  If you already have a good center under contract, you wouldn't be a candidate to give up assets for Gobert.  Your right, it's not rocket science, but you're still struggling with it."

"1 more MVP compared to a guy that was playing with Kareem and James Worthy both top 25 players if all time is not a positive for Lebron.

In the past it’s been pretty accurate with the sole exception of LeBron James. It’s just impossible to predict hot streaks unless you’re LeBron.
"Lebron James is more than just a couple all-nba guys, yes."

"It's funny because all the stats people try to use to say Kawhi locked up Lebron actually show the opposite. From your source:  &gt;Leonard's defense on James in the series was key. James shot 57.6 percent against him, but he wasn’t always able to get his shot off or even get the ball."
"Because it's not true? Lebron was scorching hot against anyone guarding him like his usual self.   &gt;Leonard's defense on James in the series was key. James shot 57.6 percent against him, but he wasn’t always able to get his shot off or even get the ball.  http://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/91529/mvp-leonard-does-it-all"

Lebron was his usual self as a scorer. The problem was all the shooters were shut down, and lebron only averaged 4 assists."
"People didn’t come to play with the fucking cavs, people came to play with LeBron James."
"It’s funny you mention them, Cause in 2016-2017 season the top 3 mvp candidates were 1. Russell Westbrook 2. James harden 3. Kawhi Leonard  Literally no one you mentioned was brought into the conversation of mvp (except maybe lebron at 4)"
"&gt; He was outplayed significantly by Kawhi  You know the funny thing about all this? Whoever wrote that horseshit, is an imbecile. But you acting like a messenger to horseshit, is quite worse. That's how you spread false shit.    &gt;  LeBron was nights and day, the best player on the floor, even in that series.  He finished the series with great numbers and an insane TS%.. so the numbers suggests the same. Kawhi's role in that series was the same as Iggy's role in the 2015 Finals. Kawhi had no offense back then, other than just some off ball cuts   &gt;  But guess who was the best player for the Spurs, and just an achor? Tim Duncan. He was still the man.     &gt;  So that fool saying 'Kawhi outplayed LeBron significantly"" like quite hilarious, and scary too. Scary, because people hates on someone so much, they'd believe and say the most outrageous shit.   &gt;  &gt;Lebron had 9 points in first half and the Heat were blown out by 19 at halftime. He padded his stats from there, and he did not score on Leonard in the first half.     This is another example. Padded his stats? Everytime i hear this horseshit statement, i just laugh. I mean, folks really think this is NBA 2k my park or some shit. Really? Padding stats? Maybe a bench player or role player would do all that, just to get more attention and minutes. But superstars? And especially LeBron?   &gt;  LeBron played the 2015 Finals against the Warriors, with Dellavedova as his 2nd best teammate.    &gt;  Kyrie leaves in 2018 out of nowhere, forces a trade. That Cleveland team changes its roster 2-3 times, mid-season. That was a legit lottery team, but they still had LeBron.   &gt;  So somehow, they fucking go to the Finals. That was the greatest one man carry job of all time, literally a one man carry job, at age 34.   &gt;  And there's ignorant as fuck delusional goofs out there, who puts the phrase ""statpadding"", with LeBron James. Really?   &gt;  Forget stat padding. LeBron doesn't even care about regular season MVPs anymore, and hasn't cared for a very long time. He's all about the playoffs and championship runs.   &gt;  People like you and me, would need to stat pad. But LeBron? I mean.. as a fucking Cleveland fan, you of all people should know how disrespectful and stupid that shit is.. That man single handedly made y'all relevant, made ya shitty Front office and team relevant, and also brought you a championship, just like he literally promised. That was the greatest championship series of all time as well. Cavs fans are the last bunch of people i expect to be so fucking idiotic and hateful, towards LeBron. Ungratefulness ain't cute. That's sad"
"Nobody's saying that Iguodala locked Lebron James down. They are saying that his defense is instrumental to the Warriors winning the finals tho. Nonetheless, Curry probably should have gotten it, and Lebron was the best player in that series, but to imply that Iguodala's defense didn't impact the course of the finals is revisionist af.  Look at the on-off stats: Lebron shot 44% with Iggy on the court, and 33% with Iguodala as the primary defender."
"&gt;Not on Kawhi. In garbage time, of which there was a ton of. Rewatch that series   Lol fuck outa here. Did YOU even watch the series? You just blatantly wrote some horseshit, and even told others to watch it.. but you are the one who never watched. Imagine that  &gt;  In that series, there was ZERO garbage time buckets..  Unless you changed the definition of ‘garbage time”??  He only played some real garbage time minutes in Game 5, but that's about it. I mean,  it's LeBron.. did you really think, no matter how good Kawhi’s defense is, he would have literally “lock down” LeBron James? He just made it the hardest for Bron, same way Iggy did back in the 2015 Finals. That’s how both of them won the Finals MVP, just because they defended LeBron.   &gt;  But LeBron still averaged monster numbers, and was the best all around player on the floor, as usual. He got most of what he wanted. He just couldn’t find his usual rhythm, because Wade was trash, and no one else was making shots. So he couldn’t pass the rock to someone effectively, like he usually does. No one was hitting anything. Same thing happened in the 2015 Finals. His best teammate was Dellavedova, against the god damn Golden State Warriors. Rest is history  &gt;  But the most fucked up thing is.. ignorant and illiterate haters like yourself, say some of the most wrong shit, but confidently.. and just hope that the others might be an idiot just like yourself, and believe it blindly. Well, you got upvoted quite a lot, so it kind of worked. Congrats, i guess. Ya bum"

"In the second movie, Lebron James skill gets taken and lost forever forcing him to sign a contract with the Lakers. Lebrons mediocrity in L.A causes him to become evil and tries to steal talent of other NBA stars by luring them to the Lakers and draining their powers. But Drake saves the day by flying in on magical colorful cellphone and defeats him in a rap battle while Lebron endlessly jacks up bricks for the rest of his Career.   The third movie plot would be the transformation of Linsanity into MJ reincarnate, and the NBA banning of clone Machines."
&gt; Cmon bro we both know you don’t even believe what you’re saying yourself.  I 100% believe it. I truly believe LeBron is undeniably the best basketball player in the world.   If there's one player that saying that about *isn't* an exaggeration it's LeBron James.
Lebron James.
"Kawhi is a major upgrade from DeRozan in every way. The Raptors weren’t going to ever win anything with DeRozan at the helm. It’s great to see the Raptors FO make the decision to move their franchise player for someone who has proven they can thrive in difficult situations, play excellent basketball on both ends, and has overcome the Rap’s roadblock in LeBron James before. I’m very happy to see how much the Raptors have thrived with such short time together with a new coach, some new pieces, and new challenges in the east."
LeBron James.
LeBron James
Last year's raptors also had Dwane Casey trying to guard Kevin Love and LeBron James with CJ Miles
Seriously the dude is the only guy on the planet that can guard Lebron James. So why the fuck didn't he start on Giannis?
"He also didn’t let him catch the ball nearly as much, didn’t let him drive nearly as much which stops the defense from collapsing, and he didn’t attempt nearly as many shots when Kawhi was guarding him. There is a lot more to defense then just shutting someone down when it’s Lebron James. Kawhi limited the shit out of him, that was the story the whole series whil everyone was watching but the further away we get from it the more people just bring up Lebron’s TS%."

Okay you got me. MAYBE Lebron James could carry a team to the playoffs in the west in a perfect world where every other team still had injuries but the Lakers were immune. There’s maybe 2-4 dudes in the league who can pull that off. We’ve established that Klay probably isn’t a top 5 guy in the league
"Well right, basketball teams still have more than one player. If you give him trash teammates he’d be in the lottery, but so would literally everybody else in the west (See Lebron James)"
"There's this concept you should consider trying called ""watching games"".  See LeBron James. See LeBron walk. See LeBron not even make it across half court before the other team scores."
"what about kevin durant AND kawhi leonard AND lebron james, then truly the league will be OVER"
Lakers got Lebron fucking James after years of bums and they didn't accept him cause he's better than Kobe. You're not wrong.
If Lebron James was a good friend? I think you could let it slide.
Props to Lebron James and VanVleets wife.
New NBA I suggest watching the NBA videos about the 1980's and work your way up to nowadays learn the history of the league and study Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant LeBron James
"LeBron ""Moses"" James"
"Did you see Giannis cutting in too, I thought we were gonna see one of those moe Williams to Lebron James plays, but maybe the angle of the tv and the pass wasn’t actually there"
"Not to shot on the east. I'm loving the ecf so far but watching this really highlights on how much of a different level lebron James is on   His court vision, ability to finish through contact, passing. I mean damn."
"Ehh I'd say the Cavs since they got to draft LeBron fucking James, get him back, win a Finals, get multiple fucking #1 picks in a decade and still act like they somehow got fucked with their team."
"LeBron James and Michael Jordan are both really good at basketball, even better than Giannis, who is also really good at basketball"
Lebron James is the greatest player EVER no question and i hate him
lebron james can be great whilst being insanely overrated.   kawhi leonard and kevin durant are currently neck and neck for the best player in basketball.
"That means he’s not the first, he’s the second, just say that he’s the second?? LeBron James is a basketball player the last time I checked"
"ESPN stats.   Kawhi Leonard has 7 35-point games in these playoffs.  Over the last 20 seasons, the only other player with 7 35-point games before the NBA Finals? LeBron James. 3 different times."
"You're likely going to the finals so I think he stays.   No one in their right mind would leave a finals team just to go play with Lou Will. If he goes to the Lakers I'm sorry, LeBron James is still LeBron James despite all the hot takes."
This is better than “LeBron James made it to 8 straight finals” which gets posted daily here
"Definitely the bigger problem in my opinion. After seeing things like [Lebron's slide tackle](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/06/nba-says-lebron-james-slide-tackle-on-steph-curry-was-incidental-contact-game-3-foul-cavaliers-warriors) being called incidental contact or the ""hot stove contact"" earlier this year, I pretty much lost any hope that this would be used to objectively look at missed calls in big or controversial games.  I notice those examples since I'm a Warriors fan and I'm sure it's much worse if you can get all of the BS justifications from every team."
"Bet if the raptors had LeBron James instead of Jodie Meeks, this series would be a wrap already. Your comment may be the dumbest I have ever read...lol"
Two minute report is going to call it [incidental contact](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/06/nba-says-lebron-james-slide-tackle-on-steph-curry-was-incidental-contact-game-3-foul-cavaliers-warriors)

"Damn FUCK the media idiots and their shit narratives. Both Klay and Draymond deserve All-NBA spots. We’ll look back on lists like this and want to puke not seeing some of the best players to EVER do it on an historically great(if not the best) team all-time, not making these lists behind players like Kemba Walker, Kyrie Irving, Rudy Gobert, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, LeBron James, etc. How fucking stupid and lacking perspective can somebody be to mangle their vote so badly???"
"""No LeBron James out west"" -Reginald Miller"
"When was the last time double teams, triple teams or even fucking walls stopped LeBron James?  The ""Giannis is the best player in the world"" hot takes really trigger me."
"Fucken, it's all the media. Guys that deserves it doesn't get it. Fuck the nba media and dumb ass voters. So biased. Lebron James made all nba? for what? popular vote."
"This is formatted so poorly, it hurts my eyes.

The LeBron James foundation
"This makes no sense to me  Carmelo Anthony is a better #1 option than Pau Gasol. He's a better #1 option than Chris Bosh. HE's A BETTER #1 OPTION THAN SCOTTIE PIPPIN.  But the Lakers or the Heat do not win those titles with Carmelo, because he provides nothing that Kobe/LeBron/Wade dont already have covered. He's gonna take possessions away from better offensive options, while providing negative value everywhere else. The Bulls are not the great dynasty they are if you swap Scottie and Melo.  A sidekick's role isnt to just be a first option, but with less possessions. It can be that--Kyrie in Cleveland--but usually it's to be a swiss army knife who covers whatever else the team needs to win.   Being a bad first option is NOT more impressive or important than being a dynasty sidekick. **The Bulls dont win 6 titles with MJ and Mitch Richmond.** They probably don't win 6 with MJ and Alex English. They needed Scottie to be a sidekick.  Being the 10th best volume scorer in any given season is not more valuable than being prime Pippen, Pau Gasol, Chris Bosh, or Klay Thompson. There's no value to Kemba being better than Klay at scoring 27ppg for a team that wins 39 games.   Kemba is never going to win you a title as a first option, so who fucking cares if he's better than Klay at it? History doesnt. 15 years from now, only us basketball nerds will remember the 11th best volume scorer in 2019. Everyone will know who Klay was.  I'm randomly looking at the 1988 NBA PPG leaders. Everyone knows who James Worthy and Kevin McHale are. They're behind plenty of long forgotten bad first options: Mark Aguirre? Dale Ellis? Tom Chambers? Terry Cummings? Imagine arguing that Mark Aguirre was a better player in 1988 than McHale or Worthy"
"""Do they want Lebron James and Kyrie Irving""?"
Is Lebron James a good player?
"This doesn't take into account disproportionate values.  If you have 15 players and 150 mil in hard cap you aren't going to pay LeBron James and an end of the bench guy each 10 million, role players lose out in this system and if another market will pay more in a soft cap or cap free environment role players will leave the NBA, International players won't enter the draft, it's slow stagnation leading to death.  The NBPA bargained for the salary arraignment and at the end of the day the talent holds all of the power and it's the leagues responsibility to try and make it as fair as possible.  Hard capping just pisses off the talent."
Paul George is in his prime and elite offensively and defensively.  LeBron James is still offensively elite when he bothers. He also missed a third of the season to injury and defensively is nonexistent.
"Russell Westbrook: Averages triple double, leads league in assists:  Third team?  LeBron James, Averages 27/8/8: Third team?  I don't post those to suggest I disagree with the selections. Only to highlight how lucky we are to be watching a league that is SO deep that performances like those aren't even voted to the second All-NBA team."
DAE like a Lebron James?
I wasn’t aware LeBron James played for y’all
"I have no complaints.  I only have observations and opinions.  Making observations and sharing opinions is pretty much the whole point of this website. If Chris Paul and LeBron James are interested in my observations and opinions about the NBA they can visit this site, although I will not be holding my breadth."
He picked him with his very last pick of the first round. LeBron is not a big fan of James harden.
Yeah last year's Cavs was literally LeBron James. Anyone who says that this Toronto team couldn't beat them is on something lmao
"imagine if there was a money in bank scenario in the NBA where a NBA superstar can cash it in to join whichever team he wants in the playoffs....and now entering for the Toronto Raptors,  6'8 forward Lebron James..."
That Lebron James just might turn out to be a pretty decent player if you ask.lol. Kid’s got potential. That Durant fella seems like a shady one though. Type to jump ship I’d say.
Congrats LeBron James jr.. You're going tooo...winnipeg!!!
"Yes, rookie/sophomore Michael Jordan and the barely-not-a-lottery-team-Bulls should definitely be compared to in his prime super team Lebron James."
KD is also better than Lebron James.
"I have never seen something that so well fits the term ""Herculean Effort"" as LeBron dragging that shitty roster kicking and screaming to the Finals. If we hadn't had LeBron, I am 100% convinced we would've been swept in each and every one of those series. But LeBron, because he's LeBron motherfucking James, took them to the Finals instead."
"&gt; That’s without a doubt a fair take but are you telling me that Nurse hasn’t benefitted from gaining one Khawi Leonard and losing one LeBron James to the Western Conference?   To say Casey wouldn't have benefited would be absurd. But the was fired for under performing with the group he had. And not just once but multiple times. He was given a long ass leash, more than most GMs would have given him tbh."
Penny Hardaway  LeBron James
"Yeah no one is calling Steph ""SC"" or Klay ""KT"" the most common inital nicknames are AI for Allen Iverson, MJ for Michael Jordan, LBJ for LeBron James, KD for Durant, CP3, KAT etc..."
"That’s without a doubt a fair take but are you telling me that Nurse hasn’t benefitted from gaining one Khawi Leonard and losing one LeBron James to the Western Conference? Don’t get me wrong, Nurse seems like a great coach and probably even a better one than Casey is, but to just assume Casey wouldn’t be in a similar situation given the circumstances of this Raptors team is probably a little misleading and not necessarily true. I’d bet good money this team would still be in the Finals."
"Bruh, LeBron James went crying in the league office in order to get DG suspended so he could beat the Warriors."
"&gt; If winning in the post-season is your sole metric for success, then I hate to break it to you, but the key seems to be having Steph Curry or Lebron James on your team.  Seeing how my whole post was only talking about NBA finals i think it does.

LeBron James will play at least till 41 and he will still dunk on people - this guy is a Monster
"If winning in the post-season is your sole metric for success, then I hate to break it to you, but the key seems to be having Steph Curry or Lebron James on your team.  There's a lot of randomness in basketball.  If Embiid didn't get violently ill during the series, the Sixers probably would have beat the Raptors.  The Nuggets outscored the Blazers in their series.  Shit happens for no reason sometimes.  A BO7 series that's taken to game 7 means that the teams were very closely matched, and could have easily gone the other way."
"The Sixers were the 3 seed and the Nuggets were the 2 seed, and both teams took their series to game 7.    If you're looking at what teams ""know"" they can win a championship with, the key seems to be having either Steph Curry or Lebron James on your team."
Live look in at Rich Paul and Lebron James:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyziGbUQBIc
"With wall out his 3 point percentage was always going to take a hit, imagine if he went to the lakers with fucking lebron james..."
"Still not as bad when they turned down the Chicago super team of Rose, Wade, Lebron, Bosh, Noah, Taj Gibson, Jimmy Butler, and James Johnson."
"feasibly? they were lucky to win 1 against a hobbled warriors team  i said this before and ill say it again, the 2015 cavs were NOT gonna win against the warriors that year no matter what  if their plan was to outgun them . the only time the warriors had looked vulnerable was vs memphis, there they slowed the pace down and grinded it out, limiting the warriors transition and 3 point opportunities; and blatt tried to slow the pace down too. delly and tt/mozgov were much needed the first half of the series to limit curry/draymond. watch the tapes. we all know what delly did to curry in their 2 wins but what may dont remember is now much mozgovs height and verticality bothered draymond when he got the pass off the short roll. he was stymied until he used the floater the second half of the series.   sure it wouldve been nice to have kyrie and kloves offense, but we have been shown lebron was a greate enough player to shoulder the offense. you can point to bad shooting by mike miller, james jones, iman, and jr smith, but those were lebrons guys and he had some input as to them being on the team, so i wouldnt really take that as an excuse.  however, once the warriors trotted out the death lineup full time, it was over for the cavs. the league was not ready for that lineup. no team in 2015 or 2016 would have beaten them at that point because they simply werent prepared for that style of play. (outside the 2016 cavs, but we all know the extenuating circumstances on that series)   that ""horrible path"" led to the cavs in ruins with bloated contracts and one dimensional players, with no real way out in sight other than to hope sexton develops well and love stays healthy. im good. fuck legm"
"Right?? Like yes they have been dysfunctional but still, just look at their roster.  There is no doubt that you have quality talent in Ball, Ingram and Kuzma.  You have fucking LeBron James whose still avg 27/7/7.  You have a top 4 draft pick.  And you are a destination spot that will likely pull a free agent this offseason.  If this team just stays fucking healthy they will be competitive.  The only glaring weakness is LeBron needs more spot up shooters.  The team is not without talent but they need guys who he can toss to when he pulls 4 guys into the paint."
TIL I am closer to Steph Curry in career playoff points than Steph is to LeBron James in career playoff points
"The real problems IMO was two-fold:   1) Magic wants to own the Lakers. He tried to act like an owner instead of what he was really brought in to do which was evaluate talent, run the day to day operations, and be the brand ambassador for the Lakers.  2) The Lakers still are approaching talent acquisition from the standpoint of ""We are the big market Lakers and everyone should automatically want to play for us"". They are still playing the ""big name free agent"" game to build the roster, team chemistry be damned. They refuse to be patient, develop a clear strategy, and put the premium on talent evaluation. Players have figured out they can be international stars on any team and playing in a good basketball situation is just as important.   Interestingly enough, they evaluated D'Angelo Russell correctly but were too impatient to stick with it. On the other hand, I think they overvalued LeBron James at this stage of his career and the desire of other players to follow him."
"Then stop crying. Lakers have the 4th pick, great young players who also double as trade assets, and a fully rejuvenated lebron James. Ignore the espn clamor, these idiots live off controversy"
Man. That Lebron James video will never get old
they added Lebron James and got *worse!* That shouldn't be possible.
"Shaq would be my 2nd.LeBron is up there but it is recency bias. He created that team by getting Bosh on board, not joining  a Championship level team already in place.  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/nba-superteams-history-lebron-james-heat-cavaliers-warriors-061617   here is a good read on superteams if you want to make your point a little better. I agree that this softness is on levels and has been going on since Wilt Chamberlain in Philly."
"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"In the 2018-19 season, Jayson “he got next” Tatum had more playoff games than LeBron James"
"bulls and heat fans are unhinged when it comes to lebron james. its so sad esp with the heat fans, whom, if not for LBJ, wouldn't have anything to celebrate.  bulls fans have nothing better to do so i can understand their situation"
"I hear you but that’s a high bar. At pick 9, you’re not expecting LeBron James or a title winning player. A solid starter would be a nice pick."
"So you're choosing to ignore how terribly Lebron shot from the field in lieu of ""all the times he failed""?  I agree Curry was the best player but the gap wasn't that large and Iguodala had the narrative.  [These are shots defended numbers. Iguodala was ridiculous defensively.](http://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/106613/iggy-makes-lebrons-shooting-iffy)   |LEONARD |	BUTLER |	IGUODALA | :--|:-:|:-:|:-:| Series |	2014 Finals |	2015 Conf Semis |	2015 Finals FG pct |	58%	| 39% |	33%  &gt; Of James' 54 shots when guarded by Iguodala, eight have been uncontested. Although James is 7-of-8 on open looks when guarded by Iguodala, he is 11-of-46 on contested shots when guarded by Iguodala. On shots contested by Iguodala, James is shooting 24 percent from the field. On shots contested by anyone else, James is shooting 41 percent. Eighty-five percent of his shots when guarded by Iguodala have been contested, whereas 78 percent of his attempts guarded by anyone else have been contested. The average distance of those shots has been the same. So in short, Iguodala is contesting James' shots more often and having more success when contesting those shots, despite them coming from the same distance (an average of 11 feet).  &gt; When Iguodala starts a possession on James, the Cavaliers have rarely gotten him to switch off. Iguodala has started on James 90 times, and the Cavaliers have forced him to switch 18 times (20 percent).  &gt; But when they have, James is not taking advantage.  &gt; Over the past three games, there have been 13 instances in which Iguodala has switched off James after starting the possession on him."
A few blocks don't make you DPOTY.  Last year KD had a couple highlight blocks on LEBRON JAMES. That does not make him DPOTY.  Giannis is neither an elite perimeter or interior defender. He should not be in the DPOTY discussion.
"I think any time a new owner comes on, the team goes through a period of learning. Steve Ballmer is a much better owner today than he was when he first bought the team. Joe Lacob, despite having experience as a minority owner of the Boston Celtics, grew exponentially in his time owning Golden State. Tillman Fertita is getting shit now for not wanting to come under the tax, and he’ll learn how he wants to spend that money as he continues to own the team. Wyc Grousbeck has talked about how much he’s changed as an owner as he’s learned more about being an NBA owner.   It’s happened to every team. All of those guys have made questionable hires and fires, made some meh trades and draft selections, and may have prioritized the wrong things within an organization. Although Jeannie has been involved for years, her current role is one she has never had before. How quickly she’s able to learn what that entails is going to go hand in hand with how successful we are as a team.   And even thought magic did some messed up shit while he was here, he didn’t do as much as people say. He didn’t trade away any of our future draft picks. We still have most of our young core. The deals we signed under him are mostly one-year deals, except for LeBron James. Our young guys have shown noticeable improvement every year, except for Hart.   On top of that, our projected 11th pick is now the 4th pick. We hired a coach who seems to understand that LeBron plus shooters is a good strategy. We have the cap space to sign a star because we didn’t take too many big deals, and we have LeBron helping in the recruiting process. Magic, who appears to have been the worst of our terrible structure, quit on his own volition (I’m not sure Jeannie would’ve fires him outright). We fired our medical staff and brought in someone who by all accounts is someone worth hiring. Was this year a failure? Absolutely. But I think we have a lot to look forward to"
What blame would he have for dysfunction in the front office and upper management. I know he's Lebron James but he's still just a player.
"Playing with a GOAT would entice a lot of players. I'm not saying any FA they want is a lock, but you'd be a fool to believe that *nobody* wants to play with Lebron James."
"LeBron ""Bill Clinton"" James"
Ya with LeBron James. Why go to the clippers and be with Lou Williams as your number 2
"There’s a difference between joining forces with some all star friends to form a powerful team to win, and jumping onto an established record setting dynasty of a team that could win without you and just beat your team in the playoffs in embarrassing fashion. If Chris Paul has been in Miami Wade and Bosh before LeBron, and Miami had won a championship with that team and broke the record for wins, and then stomped James Cavs in the playoffs, then you could compare it LeBron left Cleveland and joined them in Miami. Don’t you see an incredible difference?"
"I’ll always argue for what James did. LeBron and D Wade had had enough of being beaten by the Celtics. They didn’t join the Celtics, they joined together to beat the Celtics.   KD straight up flipped the chess board, pissed on it and told us to eat a steak off it."
Game-tying/go-ahead field goals with under 10 seconds left in the postseason:  Michael Jordan: 7/15 (47%) Kobe Bryant: 5/22 (23%) LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)  (May 2018)

"Gee, talk about selective listening. Kendrick Perkins, Richard Jefferson, even Lebron freaking James himself said the decision he made was fine."
"To the both of them they know neither of them are really winning. Sure CJ is expanding his clout by disrespecting Skip quite hard, but CJ knows that this is also expanding Skip’s clout. There’s a reason Lebron James has never acknowledged Skip by name and it’s because he has the self confidence to do so."
"Stockton, Malone, and Barkley are better than any player that Lebron faced in that 8 year Finals run. And then MJ also faced Gary Payton, Clyde Drexler, Magic Johnson, James Worthy, Shawn Kemp to add onto that. MJ faced far superior competition in the finals compared to what Lebron faced in the Eastern Conference."
Lebron James and his superteam\*  &amp;#x200B;  FTFY
he only allowed it because he knew their 73 win team couldn't beat the greatness and GOAT that is LeBron Raymone James Sr.
"When you’ve played 16 seasons in the nba, and almost as many postseasons, a year like this is more likely the start of a decline than a an off year. Lebron James was not the best player in the league this year and he isn’t getting younger."
I'm willing to go on the record and say that LeBron James is pretty good at basketball.
"Cavs up until 2017 would have beat anyone but the warriors there just werent a lot of great teams in the east.  Even so they still had a worthy adversary to overcome in the warriors (pre Durant). The warriors talent gap between everyone including a team with fucking Lebron James and Kyrie Irving was so large that it’s a joke. Those Cavs would have smashed any other team in the league, you can argue KDs thunder could challenge them but I don’t think they really would.  After Cavs, thunder, warriors there was a humongous drop off in talent so after signing KD the warriors have twice the talent of every team."
Do you guys think this lebron james guy might be really good?
DAE LeBron James
"&gt; The Toronto series every Cav was automatic for some reason  Because for the majority of the series the Raptors defense gave up wide open threes while half-heartedly trying to double LeBron James without actually doubling him. Something like that, I will never watch that awful series ever again, tbh. One of the most pathetic defensive schemes I've ever seen."
"whenever lebron james is mentioned, they become incredibly unhinged. 3-1 will burn in their body more than winning fake titles ever could"
"I mean a lot of those names are memes but LeBron got some decent help out of those guys all things considered  I know box scores aren't everything, but LeBron definitely carried his team way harder in 2018 than he did in 2007.  Last year LeBron put up 34/10/8 on a .655 TS in the first round and **barely** won while Kevin Love was basically 2016 Finals Harrison Barnes. The Toronto series every Cav was automatic for some reason, but then they went cold as shit relying on James again completely in the ECF.  In 2007, LBJ was definitely the best player on that team, but his role players played a hell of a lot better in every one of those series except the Finals (where really no one was good, no team from the East would have beaten the West champion that year.)"
"LeBron James, 2007   Man had to do it all"
"Steph curry is one of the top 5 players of all time. Lebron James isn't.  (If anyone is curious, my list for the top 4 is Michael Jordan, Steph Curry, Wilt Chamberlain, KAJ. Lot of candidates for 5th)  BRING IT ON, I'M READY FOR THE ARGUMENTS"
"Skip Bayless:  ""Kawhi Leonard has one more steal than LeBron, it is crystal clear that LeBron James is the worst player in the history of all professional sports."""
"Lebron James 2018: 61.9%   Kawhi Leonard 2019: 62.3%   Pretty comparable efficiency, considering that this is including Lebron's series vs the warriors which Kawhi hasn't had to face yet."
Lebron James 2018: 61.9%   Kawhi Leonard 2019: 62.3%   Pretty comparable efficiency
"He had one down season and people forgot who LeBron James is. Simple being compared to him is an honor for most players in this generation, including Kawhi."
A healthy LeBron James is still the best player in the world. Right now.
I hope the LeBron James dominate the NBA for another 20 years. Bring it on Bron!
"Tbh if I was LeBron I’d do everything to discourage my kid from being on social media. Like wtf could be a benefit for him for being on there?   I’m guessing it’s not that difficult to get laid if you say your dad is LeBron James. Networking is probably made a lot easier because of your dad. If you do something worthy of going viral, it’s gonna go viral because of your dad.   I really can’t think of much positive coming out of having a social media presence while being the relative of one of the greatest athletes of all time. Just a good chance of all the shit taking a huge toll on the mental health of a kid still not old enough to drink."
"Skip Bayless - ""LeBron James has no heart.  Michael Jordan wouldn't have smiled all summer after not making the playoffs.  This just shows how unclutch LeBron is.  SAD!"""
One big difference is Lebron had to pick up the slack for his team being awful. He shouldn’t have to put up those totals. His run was really impressive because the Cavs were basically “Lebron James the basketball team”
"Skip starting hating on lebron bad by his second year in the NBA. But that was mostly due to the media calling LeBron the next Jordan and the best player in the league.  The skip you guys see now is soft compared to what he used to be. He uses to absolutely destroy lebron saying he's not clutch and calling him prince James.  Ever sense lebron won his first title Skip backed off on lebron tremendously. He will throw jabs at lebron here and there when the Jordan debate comes up, but again you also have to blame people like Chris Broussard and Shannon Sharp who he keeps baiting Skip to say things about Lebron.  He was popular before 2011, but lebron losing to the Celtics and going to the Heat started the rise of Skip Bayless.  Look up old rants on YouTube when Skip ripped lebron for losing to the Celtics. Then it continued from there"
I was too young to watch Jordan in his prime. So LeBron James no question.
LeBron James: “It got me. That fucking *Toy Story* franchise boomed me. It’s so good (x4). I’m going to add *Toy Story 4* to the list of movies I watch this summer.”
"You are conflating “that shot saved Brons legacy” and “Ray Allen gets all the credit for the series”  The NBA is very star driven. In most cases the stars get the lions share of the credit or blame. If Miami lost that series as favorites and the Big 3 era only produced one ring and 2 finals let downs, it would be devastating for Brons legacy. That’s just a fact. No one who isn’t trolling suggests Allen deserves more credit than James or that James was just a passenger, it’s just that shot saved the game and thus James legacy because it allowed for Lebron to get the credit he deserved for winning back to back championships."
"The Warriors won, not Steph. His 0 finals MVPs can attest to that. It came to the point where they almost gave LeBron finals MVP on the losing team due to how depressing Steph was. All 3 rings have a stamp on them that people will forever remember due to the perfect set of circumstances it took for them to win. They didn’t have to battle, the only thing they had to do was beat an injured LeBron team and 1 James Harden.  The Rockets sent Michael Jordan into retirement because he knew he was going to get knocked out for the next 2 years."
"It’s definitely conspiratorial, but the BALCO investigation started in 2002, which was years before Caminiti died.   My theory is the entire shit-show started because of the general overall hatred of Bonds.  Bonds was known for being an absolute dick to the media his entire career.  As soon as the public opinion shifted on Bonds (during the 2001 HR chase), the media and investigators had a wide open lane to start poking and prodding around his steroid usage.    If the NBA had a LeBron James level star, who 95% of the world hated (including his own teammates and members of the media), I’m sure the media would start digging deep in to any aspect of the dudes life they could find which could take that player down."
LeBron James is his dad. He had a jumpstart at the moment of conception.
"I think his Dad, LeBron James, shouting him out to his 50m followers is enough of a jumpstart."
"You must still be hurt about 2016. It’s ok, everyone has to let it out every now and then. Deep down you know the Warriors have relied on luck and a thin-skinned KD joining them to even win a single ring. Imagine being a fan of a team that had to literally assemble the western conference all-stars just to beat LeBron James and JR Smith hahaha I would be hurting too"
"To be fair, we were a joke of an organization in many ways. I don’t blame him. We have done a total 180 and are all in to be an elite org, but we weren’t previously.   On top of that, Lebron James, Rich Paul, and Magic sold AD this summer on being in LA and AD is a very naive, weak willed guy, by all accounts. He imagines himself in a glamour market being a big star. He doesn’t have the self awareness to realize he has the personality of 2 day old oatmeal."
"It's not really about elevating those individual player's game although that is the case in some cases. It's about suddenly making a role player an integral part of a contender. Curry does the same thing he makes his teammates better. So did Shaq and Duncan. Role players playing with them suddenly become very important.  That was the case at the time though. In their preseason interview, all three of them Bosh, Wade, and James said Boston was the team to beat. Boston literally had a big 3 and beat both James and Wade the previous years.   Wade was a top 5 player for sure, but Bosh was not and never was. You realize Bosh made 1 all-nba teams his whole career right? He was 2nd team all-nba in 2007. In 2010 his last year with the Raptors he didn't even make the playoffs, and the following big men were on the all-nba teams over Bosh: Bogut, Gasol, Duncan, Nowitzki, Amare, and Howard.  There is no measure that places Bosh has a top 2 or 3 or even top 5 *power forward*.  &gt;Okc has a big 2. Harden wasn’t that guy yet. We was a strong 6-man.  Harden was the 6th man of the year. Ibaka was 1st team all-defense. Kevin Durant was the leading scorer in the league and Russell Westbrook was 5th. OKC was definitely on par with James/Wade/Bosh.  You're also missing teams like the New York Knicks. Carmelo Anthony was all-nba 3rd team same as Wade in 2012. Tyson Chandler was all-nba, all-defense, and the DPOY.  In 2011 there was the 60 win Bulls. Rose was the MVP and Noah was all-defense. They got Jimmy Butler too.  See the Heat had plenty of competitors just as good of them. Remember Chris Bosh was none of these things not all-nba, MVP, DPOY, or all-defense. It was really Wade and James. Technically, some of the teams they faced had more players with accomplishments than them.  This is not the case at all with the Warriors. The Warriors have DPOYs (Draymond), all-defense (Draymond and Klay), multiple all-nba guys (Curry and Durant) and all-stars (Klay). No team they faced comes close to them they don't have equals out there to compete with them.  &gt;Lebron kicks if someone help defends his drive. If not, he tries to finish himself.  He primarily does pick and rolls with rolling bigs like Tristan Thompson, Joel Anthony, Timofey Mozgov etc. These guys were never asked to shoot 3s or even jumpshots. He definitely does not try to finish himself he is 50/50 correct playmaker type of player. His picks and rolls can result in shots for himself in the paint, shots for the big man rolling with him/alley oops, shots for shooters at the 3 point line, or a  3 point shot for James himself. He forces defenses to make mistakes so someone on his team can get a quality shot and he always makes the right play.  &gt;More than just having those guys on Lebrons team, they also were no longer on other teams in the east, making it even weaker.   That's really only the case with Wade. Love was busy not making the playoffs in the West, and Kyrie and Bosh were busy not making the playoffs in the East.   &gt;Likely, those players would have kept their superstar numbers and status though.  How? They would get faded into irrelevance. Karl Anthony Towns gets buried now for doing what Kevin Love was doing on those Wolves. Devin Booker is putting up the same numbers as Kyrie, but Booker isn't recognized as a superstar. In fact, Kyrie really became recognized as a superstar only after his performance in the 2016 finals."
Imagine thinking lebron james is just some tall ass brute who doesnt have any talent lmao
LeBron James sr
"I feel like naming a son Jr. is a weird ego thing. Like why name a kid literally after yourself... but slap ""Jr."" on it? Like it implies being second, or inferiority in some way like just name him LeBron James with a different middle name, or just a different name in general so that your kid doesn't live in the shadow of your name, too."
Doesn't help his name is Lebron James as well
Lebron: I shouldn't put too much pressure or expectations on the kid.. he's just a kid  Also Lebron: Wassup LEBRON JAMES JUNIOR!!!
"Yeah 2013 is definitely a weak year for the NBA...Lebron, Kobe, Wade, PG, CP3, Kyrie, Harden, Westbrook, Duncan, Blake Griffin, Kawhii, Howard, Iggy, Joakim, The Truth, Garnett, Rose, Ibaka,  James Butler, Oladipo, Lowry, Derozen, Aldridge, Varejao, AD, Bynum, Gasol, Chandler, Tony Allen, etc."
A team who would sign ***3*** Lebron James - Celtics playing the long con for 2037!
now i want to see a fat lebron james dominate the post for a few seasons before he retires lol
"Lmao I remember the tweet that said that and some guy replied  ""Now checking into the game, number 0 Lebron James Jr.""  ""Ayo who's that guy"""
And what team would pass up signing 2 Lebron James
"At least it's LeBron James Jr.   Imagine how fucked up it would have been if he named him, like, Steven Johnson Jr."
The weight that comes with that name... LeBron James said he regrets naming his son a Jr.
LeBron James tagged him and that really but also he can shoot lights out
"Wanna hear my conspiracy theory: I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."
"can't agree with u enough. only thing more annoying is listening to talking heads debate if player X has the KI or not on sports radio/tv.   I mean not only is it an abstract thing that can't really be quantified, the people that are referenced as having the killer instinct aren't more clutch than those who don't have it.   For example game-winning/tying shots w/ 10 sec left:  Kobe Bryant: 5/22 (23%)   LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)"
"If only for marketing reasons he’ll probably make it. Look at how Giannis’ younger brother got drafted essentially because of the family connection. Teams will likely salivate over the marketing potential of LeBron James Jr (and the potential to help them recruit LeBron Sr.) even if he isn’t that great of a basketball player. So yeah, him making the league is not a “for sure” but definitely a most likely."
"He won 50-60 games regularly with just role players. He elevated entire teams and that's where the he makes teammates better comes from. He makes teams better.  &gt;Before their first games, Lebrons heat team was further ahead of their competition than the Durant warriors.  How? Before their first games, Lebron's Heat was evenly matched with Boston. Literally position for position. Also OKC and San Antonio had their big 3s soon to be big 4s brewing with Ibaka and Leonard.  Th Warriors before Durant were already evenly matched with the other best team in the league the Cavs. Kevin Durant joining the Warriors made them a big 4 and since then there have been no other big 4s in the league to challenge them. Lebron James joining Miami made them a big 3 and there big 3s around the league.  &gt;I’m also confused as to how Green got turned into a spot up shooter? When did that happen?  He is forced to stand at the 3 point line and shoot 3s even though he is a bad 3 point shooter. Same with Iguodala when he is off-ball. They have to do this to space the floor for Steph to run their offense. This is like Lebron making Udonis Haslem or Tristan Thompson shoot 3s.   Except Lebron's system never forced them to do that it only forced actually good 3 point shooters like Love and Bosh to shoot 3s, and Lebron actually gets criticized for that.  &gt;(And stat pad of course)  Nonsense. This implies just giving the ball to a player a lot will result in great stats. That is nonsense. Only great players can score so many points so efficiently, and handle the ball so much without turning it over all the time.  &gt;Because Lebron has had some of the most stacked teams in NBA history, he’s hurt more than he’s helped.  Kyrie Irving, Chris Bosh, and Kevin Love would not have championship rings without Lebron. Dwyane Wade would have ended his career with 1 ring without Lebron. These guys benefited heavily from Lebron."
"so is the lakers. the nba community and media just don't want you to acknowledge it  clippers have two max contracts sure, but no allstars and only good young player is gilgeous alexander.   meanwhile lakers had two and gave one to the GOAT lebron james. now they have 2 young stars in the making, #4th pick, good young role players on great contracts, and space for another max contract. not to mention the LAL brand."
"Last time Lebron didn't make the playoffs is a crazier, I think.   &amp;#x200B;  No iPhone, no Uber, Facebook was just getting launched, YouTube was founded.  [https://www.si.com/nba/2019/03/23/lebron-james-missing-playoffs-first-time-2005-lakers](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/03/23/lebron-james-missing-playoffs-first-time-2005-lakers)"
"That's crazier. No iPhone, no Uber, Facebook was just getting launched, YouTube was founded.   [https://www.si.com/nba/2019/03/23/lebron-james-missing-playoffs-first-time-2005-lakers](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/03/23/lebron-james-missing-playoffs-first-time-2005-lakers)"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true          shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"James Jones has 3 rings, Lebron has 3 rings, who do you rank higher?"
The one that’s Lebron James
dam a.i got that lebron james hair line going on.
I'm basically the LeBron James of intelligence.      (Or being drunk and salty that golden state won)
"There's a different between hot take and thinking Kyrie would be better than Lebron ""34/8/10 against the Warriors"" James."
Imagine thinking Magic Johnson was a better basketball player than Lebron James LMAO
"Drake is the number one artist streamed on Spotify. I would wager anywhere he goes people, sports fans and non, would recognize him. LeBron is huge. Really really huge. But I know my girlfriend and her sisters wouldn't recognize him. I would bet a lot of non sports fans might not be able to recognize him in public. They might see a large athletic man and think ""pro athlete"" but might not recognize him as LeBron James."
"Dud the curry haters and warrior haters just hate good basketball. Steph Curry is 3-1 (along with his greatest sidekick ever Draymond Green) in the finals and beat lebron james 3 times and hes about to beat Kawhi leonard. You probably couldnt even break down an elementary or middle school basketball game let alone the NBA. Sad and pathetic, i downvote you and move on you stupid animal."
"PG: Steve Nash / Al Attles   SG: Steve Kerr / Ron Adams   SF: Willie Green / Jim Barnett   PF: Jarron Collins / Bruce Fraser   C: Adonal Foyle / Bob Myers    The Strength In Everybody But The Players lineup is a lot stronger than I thought it would be. It's not going to take out the old Lakers lineup, but maybe with Magic getting replaced by Kidd, Walton stepping down, and LeBron not being LeCoach, the Warriors organization might stand a chance.  PG: Magic Johnson / ???   SG: Miles Simon / ???   SF: LeBron James / LeBron's playing the full 48   PF: Mark Madsen / Mychal Thompson   C: Luke Walton / Luke is only 39"
he doesn't have to be Lebron James to make some of these bounce passes that are there 90/100
"You hate the dude because he is close friends with Curry, Klay, and Durant and roots for his friends in the hopes they find success?  If LeBron James considered you a close friend, like he does Drake, would you not root for LeBron if you attended a regular season Lakers game?"
"Yes, the “narrative” was that they were chokers when they lost to Lebron James everytime. Does it make you a choker if you lose to a better player? Is every single player in the league a choker if they don’t win they championship? My argument is that Kawhi is overhyped for the success of his team when the Raptors are an great team without him. Look at their record without him this year plus if you want a more recent showing, look at game 1."
Yes thats why he isnt LeBron James. He isnt perfect
This is what I was thinking. Not everyone is (little kid voice) LeBRON James.
People really forgot that the Raptors are an elite team and only lost to Lebron James last year but Kawhi comes and makes it to the finals and he’s literally the second coming of Michael Jordan.
Probably the Blocked by James moment. But I think that was more of a LeBron legendary moment nore than Iggy failing to be clutch.
How do you have Lebron James and not make the playoffs?
"Andre ""Lebron James"" Iggy"
Lebron James and Kevin Durant are also holding him back
"I've been saying it, but only 2 teams can consistently survive 3rd quarter Warriors.   1) Rockets   2) Lebron James.   Good effort Raptors, especially cause this was still a winnable game, but goddamn does it hurt."
"Son of a BITCH do I hate the Warriors. I know most everyone does but for me it goes much deeper than that. I am beyond hate. 4 straight Finals. 4 straight Finals have I put up with the Warriors and their nonstop Warrior winning wats. I have had to watch Draymond Green eat his fucking W's for the past half decade. My friend is a Jazz fan, he says ""Oh yEaH I HatE tHe WaRRiOrs tOo BrO"" and I say You dumb bitch. Shut the fuck up with your dumb bullshit. We have to play them FOUR TIMES A YEAR, EVERY YEAR. and he says ""yeah but"" and I can't even hear him because at this point I'm thinking about that youtube thumbnail of baby faced, chewing on his mouth guard, cocky little fuck Steph Curry when he dad dicked the Thunder and there is blood in my ears and hate in my heart. FUCK. And don't even get me started on their fans. One of my ""friends"" is a Warriors and a Patriots fan. THEY'RE ON OPPOSITE COASTS YOU FUCK. And he has the nerve to call me out for being a Clippers and a Saints fan. LA (louisiana) DIDN'T HAVE A BASKETBALL TEAM WHEN I STARTED WATCHING, YOU STUPID BITCH.

It's just a nickname.  Like Lebron was King James before he got crowned.  Why's Kobe the Black Mamba. He's not a snake.
He using the Ty Lue - LeBron James playbook
I guess they're letting Leonard do that 'shove people out of the way with your forearm' move that they let Lebron James build a career off of.
Lebron James
*cries in lebron james*
"This is why Lebron James is the GOAT  Look at how Kawhi has played this series, and remember what Lebron did last year while playing next to Iman Shumpert and George Hill"
Warriors wouldn't have beaten Cavs without Durant. It's a joke whoever thought that they would beat a much much better Raptors team barring Lebron James
"Son of a BITCH do I hate the Warriors. I know most everyone does but for me it goes much deeper than that. I am beyond hate. 4 straight Finals. 4 straight Finals have I put up with the Warriors and their nonstop Warrior winning wats. I have had to watch Draymond Green eat his fucking W's for the past half decade. My friend is a Jazz fan, he says ""Oh yEaH I HatE tHe WaRRiOrs tOo BrO"" and I say You dumb bitch. Shut the fuck up with your dumb bullshit. We have to play them FOUR TIMES A YEAR, EVERY YEAR. and he says ""yeah but"" and I can't even hear him because at this point I'm thinking about that youtube thumbnail of baby faced, chewing on his mouth guard, cocky little fuck Steph Curry when he dad dicked the Thunder and there is blood in my ears and hate in my heart. FUCK.  And don't even get me started on their fans. One of my ""friends"" is a Warriors and a Patriots fan. THEY'RE ON OPPOSITE COASTS YOU FUCK. And he has the nerve to call me out for being a Clippers and a Saints fan. LA (louisiana) DIDN'T HAVE A BASKETBALL TEAM WHEN I STARTED WATCHING, YOU STUPID BITCH.

Yeah that's a stupid argument lol. LeBron wouldn't have any rings without James Jones for all we know

"LeBron James  Tim Duncan  Kobe Bryant   Shaquille O'Neal  Dirk Nowitzki  Kevin Garnett   Dwyane Wade   Kevin Durant   Allen Iverson   Jason Kidd  Fine, he's top-25, but definitely not top-10."
Lebron James
especially considering we get Lebron james if we get the #1 lol. How were we lucky to drop that year.
"That's no surprise. He's on the third axis of transcendence right now. Kyrie Irving moves in anti-planar reality (or prime-planar reality, shouts to my qmech nerds who really buy Frisch-Hayes.) While guards like Mike Conley or Chris Paul see the game from an x and o perspective, Kyrie has vision of the omega and delta factors surrounding any given basketball event.  There's a reason Kyrie was able to lead LeBron James to the 2016 Finals. Put simply, Irving is visuospatial jazz. Think of Ornette Coleman or George St. Breux, not Goran Dragic or PatBev. The dorian stylings of a Eric Dolphy better describe Irving's game than a monotone listing-off of conventional basketball skills. Ball handles? When you're in constant tune with the precise Hz pitch of the hardwood like Irving, English words like ""good handles"" cannot encapsulate even a fractoid of the scientific and metaphysical majesty of Kyrie."

Yes they traded dlo to obtain Lebron James. Not the worst trade.
I don't think you get to compare regular season on a LeBron James' led team.  2016-2017 was the best iteration of Cavs and they would've won if KD didn't go full on snake mode.
"As a big supporter of LeBron James, I think Kawhi joining the Lakers would be kinda rigged. I'm not thinking about that right now. I want Kawhi to shock the world against the Warriors. Let's go Raptors continue to do your thing tonight! Play that stingy defense against the Warriors, and VanVleet, Siakam, Danny Green, Lowry continue to put the pressure on the rest of the Warriors too."
"&gt;A LeBron James-led team finished with an unremarkable 37-45 record. While one should certainly expect a Davis-James combo to lead a team to greater accomplishment, it’s not a lock. LeBron will turn 35 next December and his odometer has surpassed 56 thousand minutes. That’s a ton of wear and tear and we may have already witnessed the start of the end when he missed five weeks due to a strained left groin. Previously, LeBron had never missed more than two weeks — dating all the way back to high school.  &gt;“I had never been injured before like that,” James said.  &gt;Another salient point, where will the Lakers be in the hierarchy of the standings once LeBron retires? Anthony Davis has yet to prove he can individually carry a team to great heights, and adding premier, winning talent next to James has thus far been a problem for Rob Pelinka. The Lakers have all of their future first round picks. Who wouldn’t love to gamble on their 2023 first rounder — the year after LeBron’s contract is up?!  You didnt exactly summarize the second half of the article very well.  Who's the one doing the clickbaiting other than you?"
"I have these two streamables that show the mind games Draymond and Lebron play against each other and what high level basketball really is. The whole possession is about them and everyone else is just a pawn.  This is a play the Cavs like to run for Kevin Love: https://streamable.com/gxrbd  The first option here is for Love to reject the screen and backdoor his man sprinting to the rim for an open layup. Point guards are generally hesitant to switch onto big, and big guys are generally hesitant to switch onto to smalls, so the Cavs like to take advantage of that hesitancy with this play.  The second option is for  Love to use the screen from a point guard, get a small switched on him, and then back him down in a postup, or for Love to get the smaller guy on him and then elevate for 3 over him.  This play is very effective against most teams but not against the Warriors because of Draymond. Here it is: https://streamable.com/3mnjj  Draymond actually knows what play Lebron is running here. Bell doesn't want to switch off of Love and onto a point guard so he hugs him, so Love sprints toward the basket and gets ahead of him. But he can't get open because Draymond comes over and stands in his way.  Lebron immediately realizes Draymond has figured the play out, so he calls Tristan Thompson (Draymond's man) for a screen. Durant gets rubbed off like a fly, and Lebron knows he is getting an open jumpshot because Draymond is down at the baseline. Draymond rushes over but it's a late contest, and James has won that possession."
"You've won the lottery 4 times, more than any other team, and got luckier than any team in history except the magic when you jumped despite having only a 1.7% chance. Additionally, you won the year Lebron James was the first overall pick"
"Nope  [OC] Steph Curry and Kevin Durant will likely never reach top 10 all time  There have been alot of posts lately about Steph and Kevin Durant becoming top ten all time players.

"chris paul and lebron james colluded to manipulate the cap to force kevin durant to join the warriors. so now there is a team so stacked that they could lose to them in the playoffs and not have it hurt their legacy, all while durant has to deal with wildly unfair scrutiny"
"Basically every season stat is based on per game. Nobody says James Harden led the league with 2,815 points. His 36.1 ppg is going to be basically the same regardless of 66 or 70 or 82 games played.   The only thing it messes up is career totals, but that's just an added on resume thing not a career definer. If Kobe is 3rd all time or 11th all time in scoring it really doesn't change his legacy. And I don't think anyone who believes MJ is the GOAT will change their opinion if/when LeBron passes Kareem."
"Stop hating, losing to LeBron James doesn't cancel your whole season. Such a hater, I'm sure you'll find a way to say the Raptors weren't top 3 this season either.    People act like when you lose in the playoffs, your season suddently don't count anymore. Just like when we swept the Blazers last year, suddently tons of people started acting like you, and saying their 49 wins was worthless.    I thought you were on the right path with your mindset of ''we shouldn't only care about rings'', but your system doesn't work. What about a system where you get points for the amount of regular season wins (like 1 point per win), then points for each playoffs round you reach (lose in 1st round is 10 points, lose in 2nd round is 20 points, etc)."

I mean LeBron James did manage to play 82 games and take the cavs to the finals last year
"Okay take your L. I brought up numerous examples but you’ve only been a Nba fan for a week so it don’t matter to me. Lemme go over all the points I did make one time so you can understand what it means to be educated.  You play Lou 12-14 minutes when he averaged 27/4/7 per 36 minutes. Wouldn’t you feel like your talent was being wasted? If you were Lebron James would you want to play role player minutes (exaggeration in case you didn’t know). As I said quite clearly, this is egos colliding. Search up what ego means cuz you probably don’t know. Putting a potential all-star SG as your backup and playing him 12 minutes makes literally no sense.  A team is only as good as its best player and I stick by that. However if you have a great player and the team around you is bad then you won’t be successful. Say you put a bunch of perennial all stars on a team and you play the Raptors. I believe the Raptors would win because they have Kawhi Leonard. Second of all, Blake Griffin is not top 15 stop cappin.   Having talented players isn’t going to cut it. Everyone’s talented in this league. You need that one superstar who will send them over the edge. Let’s look at the greatest example of this, the Cleveland Cavaliers of last year. How good was there best player? And where did they end up because of him? And where did they end up because he left. I’ll say it loud and proud, “AN ABOVER AVERAGE TEAM IS AS GOOD AS ITS BEST PLAYER”.   Again I don’t know you fully understand the concept of deep. Having an all star off your bench would not give you the same productivity as a great role player cuz role players have one job, to play their role. It doesn’t matter if you can’t be good at anything else, if you can shoot, your valuable. Basically, because you struggle to understand, role players have a duty. To shoot threes or maybe defend. Having Draymond Green off your bench would be less efficient than having Spencer Dindwiddie off bench.   Portland has Damian Lillard who is most definitely a superstar and solidified that these playoffs, even though they got swept.  This is most definitely a super team attempt. Your stacking up stars and hope they get you to the promised land but it doesn’t work. It hasn’t worked with the exception of Golden State who are just a well built team all together in my opinion.   You literally sound like you just trade for all the stars on your 2K and the game sims you winning the ring every year. Real NBA isn’t like that buddy. There’s egos, game restrictions and other things that lead these teams to be unsuccessful and I could prove it to you a countless number of times. OKC 2017 and Miami when they lost two finals, (if you wanna count this bc they still won rings, but this is an all time great SG and PF, plus you had HOF Chris Bosh). You’re a new fan for sure and I don’t hate you for that. I get it , you see raptors on the news and you want to join the bandwagon. Understandable."
That doesnt seem like the official King James Version of the Bible. But I guess that would be about Lebron.  (I chuckled when I read your comment)
"The matchup between the Golden State Warriors and Toronto Raptors on ABC averaged more than 6.8 million viewers, according to the data; the audience skewed 80% male and 20% female versus last year’s 73%/27% split. Sixty-five per cent of viewers were in the adults 25-54 demo.     Those results were down from last year’s Game 1. One reason could be because the Raptors are the first Canadian team to make the NBA Finals – and are obviously not associated with a US home media market.   “Game 1 was down from an OOH average of 10.2 million viewers for the [same game in 2018](https://www.rapidtvnews.com/2018060252343/nba-basketball-finals-game-1-nets-strong-streaming-broadcast-performance.html). The lack of a second US home team coupled with the absence of LeBron James and Kevin Durant may have cost the game some viewers in out-of-home locations,” said Paul Lindstrom, head of research and analytics, Tunity Analytics. “This year’s higher male skew could also indicate that the games are attracting more of a hardcore fan base over casual viewers.”     In comparison, the Eastern Conference Finals averaged more than 2.3 million viewers over seven games on TNT and the Western Conference Finals averaged 4.1 million viewers over four games on ESPN.  &amp;#x200B;  [For comparison's sake, Super Bowl LIII drew 12 million in out-of-home viewing.](https://deadline.com/2019/02/cbs-tacks-on-12m-to-super-bowl-tv-rating-due-to-out-of-home-viewing-1202552629/)"

LeBron James? Is that the guy who owns Blaze Pizza?
"The only title LeBron James actually earned and deserved was in 2016...  and now look at him the only way he can win another title is to contact other players to come help him win ... that’s not success that’s just lame... he didn’t even win in 2007 so who cares lol... now the 2003 pistons that was a team lol ... anyway after reading about how Lebron wants jimmy butler and Kawahi Leonard to join him is just stupid... he should be fined and suspended for trying to lure players while they still under contract.. he didn’t even play his heart out this year and as well getting his agent to talk to the commissioner about his coach?? Guy has no respect for anything..  amazing player, amazing talent... had respect for him in 2016 but lost it quickly again...  once he is done playing I would be surprised if he is super respected..."

"What other points? All you do is make insults. It’s just basketball bro... No need for the Reddit tough guy act.   Veggas odds to win the 2010-2011 NBA Final Championship Title are now posted on NSAwins.com and vegas oddsmakers have listed the revamped Miami Heat the +185 favorite to win the 2010-2011 NBA Championship. The Heat are the talk of the sports world heading into the 2010-11 NBA season after striking gold in NBA free agency by signing free agent supertar forward Lebron James and free agent power forward Chris Bosh. Combining those two with Dwayne Wade have given new meaning to the term “Big 3” as James and Wade are clearly two of the Top 3-5 players in all of basketball, while Bosh is one of the game’s premier power forwards.  https://www.nsawins.com/nba/early-2010-2011-nba-championship-vegas-odds-and-predictions-miami-heat-the-favorite/"
"&gt;In the 2016 NBA Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers had a rule. Former Cavs and current Pelicans general manager David Griffin termed it, “Get a touch on that motherfucker, every time.”  &gt;Beyond the off-ball grabbing when defending Curry, the Cavs sought to get Steph guarding LeBron James pick-and-rolls, repeatedly. When Curry was screened, they sought to really “get a touch on that motherfucker.” Nothing dirty per se, just physical. These were not attempted knockout blows, but instead a diligent process of erosion. Did it work? Ultimately, they got the desired result.  &gt;The 2019 Toronto Raptors are not the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers. Some might argue that they’re comparable or maybe even better, but among the key distinctions between the last team that beat the Warriors and the one that currently aspires to, this one is especially salient: The Raptors do not punish Steph Curry on the defensive end.   &gt;In the second-round series against the Rockets, Curry was targeted defensively and repeatedly smacked with screens. In Game 1 against the Raptors, Curry went completely untouched on defense all the way until 2:36 left in the first quarter, when he was grazed by Pascal Siakam as Fred VanVleet attempted to get loose. That was 55 plays into the game.  &gt;“We use a term ‘keep playing’ on offense,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse explained Saturday on why they avoid targeting Curry in pick-and-roll. “That means that we don’t like to react a lot of times to switches. When there’s a switch made, as I mentioned, we have a switch offense that we play. But a lot of it is to just keep playing, and not let a switch stop your offense and try to overanalyze a mismatch or bog down and wait 10 seconds to try to post feed against a smaller guy or whatever, because all it does is send you into a low-shot clock situation, which are low-percentage situations. We like to just keep playing.”  &gt;There is another reason for why the Raps eschew hunting Curry with screen-and-roll, though: They likely don’t have the proper personnel.  some excerpts for non-subscribers"
"Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, and Kyrie as far as high profile players go. Draymond is a phenomenal on the mic, KD would be fucking hilarious because he's funny as shit, LBJ because he's in the old man stage of his career and doesn't give a fuck and Kyrie because he's pretentious as hell but has chemistry with KD and to an extent LBJ."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"You, YOU AND MANY OTHERS! Are exactly why I get sick and tired of the Warriors. NOTHING you tell me will prove why Durant is better than LeBron James. NOT ONE reason. I want Kawhi Leonard and the Raptors to scratch those Warriors with their sharp claws and get them stuck in Jurassic Park."
Kevin Durant is better than LeBron James
James Jones had LeBron

Conspiracy bro. This is just another play to get this generation to call LeBron James the GOAT. Lets get. It wont happen. Ever.
"He is 6'7 285lbs.. unless he has LeBron James, government super soldier test tube study, powers he is going to suffer a leg injury next year.  It's a 82 game schedule and he ain't coming off the bench. They are going to run him."
"It's not a weakness so much as everything else he has is at such a strength it feels like. His passing is fine and at times amazing. But that court vision doesn't seem to be there the same way it is for a LeBron James. But that's okay, nobody is great at everything."
[OC] hey guys what would happen if LeBron James farted and everyone on the court could smell his stinky poop

"As lebron James said, 2 pts is not just 2 pts."
"yeah the FO that created max cap room from the mozgov and deng contracts, drafted well both high and low in the lottery, and signed Lebron James to a multi year contract is the dumbest in the league  and definitely NOT the one that signed CP3 to a $40mm per year deal"

"Over the past 10 years, you've had 3 of the top 15 players of the past 20 years linked to the Bulls in Free Agency. Carmelo Anthony, Dywane Wade and Lebron James(2010). Had the number one overall pick in Derrick Rose and Thibs ruined him. You even have the chance to have the bragging rights to have had the greatest of all time player in the world play and win multiple championships. Also, Chicago aint no slouch city. Try being a Mavs fan, at least Chicago actually gets a fucking meeting and consideration from a star free agent."
"Yeah a superstar carried us in one second round series. The other guys won him game 1 of the nba finals.  A superstar that truly doesnt have help right now is Lebron James, who's surrounded by a plethora of bums."
"one of Lebron James, Kevin Durant, or Anthony Davis."
"u cant compare Golden State with the under .500 Cavs team that LeBron joined back then come on. I'll give u Wade and Kyrie (altho he developed under LeBron and wasnt a star before) but besides that... The cavs stink vbefore james returned and they stink now, SAME with Miami...cant compare that with the KD cheese"
Yes it was Lebron James’ 8 record for consecutive fgs. Before that was Kobe with the exact 8 consecutive fgs.
We already saw Lebron James' soft on 4 years ago in the Finals
Depends if you want the attention that comes with a Laker and to play with LeBron James
"[also apparently the deals the lakers gave were pretty shitty](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/7/2/17524398/lebron-james-lakers-offseason)   &gt;With LeBron officially agreeing to sign with the Lakers, it’ll be fascinating to monitor what type of leverage the Spurs can create for Kawhi Leonard, who still desires to play for the Lakers, according to multiple league sources—all of whom say offers to the Spurs have been underwhelming. One executive said the proposed packages have gotten worse with each round of negotiations, while another said they’re flat-out unacceptable."
1. Kevon Looney 2. Kevin Durant 3. LeBron James 4. Steph Curry 5. Kahwii Leonard 6. Klay Thompson 7. Anybody who isn't Russell Westbrook 8. James Hardens coach 9. Draymond Green 10. Giannis  11. Andre Igoudala

"Overall they were, but the Cavs had a Lebron James playing at the highest level we may have ever seen a player play"
&gt; 238	LeBron James	22  so close
The Lakers have Lebron James stop. I get hating LA but acting like AD and LeBron wouldn’t compete is asinine
"Because they have LeBron James, who I understand is pretty good at winning."
"LeBron James &amp; Nathaniel Friedman's tweets are spot on. You don't push someone while their working. It's the fans' decision to sit that close, whether or not they are part owners... it gives him no right to retaliate. It's like sitting in a splash zone during a theatrical performance of Evil Dead the Musical...you're gonna get fake blood all over you, and that was your choice."
Lebron James will forever be a legend for a 3-1 comeback against the best regular season team of all time. You can be as salty as you want and he will still be a top 5 player of all time.
Kyle Lowry and Lebron James are snowflakes
Why would anyone care what LeBron James thinks

It's Lebron James y'all
"Ofc Drake is privileged, due to his brand he got a private jet for free, his out here trolling games on the court daily, you think anyone can be on the court dancing every game.  LeBron also very privileged, not just money, he privileged to be a freak of nature, he has insane connections due to his success in the NBA, not everyone can build their own school, make movies and so on. But LeBron fucking James can."
Seams like all the top comments here are dedicated into trying to derail the legitimacy of what LeBron had to say. You may not like LeBron James as a basketball player but  he makes a very valid point.
"Ron Artest, Kawhi Leonard, Tony Allen, Bruce Bowen, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Scottie Pippen, Raja Bell, Paul George, Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler, Danny Green, Robert Covington, Andre Roberson, Tayshaun Prince, Michael Cooper, LeBron James, Eddie Jones   Those are just some guys that come to mind for me.  I don't think I'd jump to take Iggy over any of them.  Not saying he's bad, by any means.  I just wouldn't unequivocally put him in top ten or fifteen consideration.  And keep in mind, those names don't go back very far.  There were all time greats before the eighties, too.  Thanks for making me do this!"
[I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? Lebron James.](https://youtu.be/889TxAYXu9k)
"It's well known in the Cleveland area. People have asked owners of the restaurants he used to frequent, they all have stories similar to this one: https://deadspin.com/lebron-james-has-obviously-never-been-a-waiter-388546  It isn't the same but it's annoying when people treat LeBron like he is the voice of god himself and he kind of sucks."
Lebron James streak of being in NBA finals continues...
 it's really not. Imagine how much money LeBron James has and now double or even triple that and now we're talkin Mark Stevens money  500k will not affect him in any noticeable way
TIL Lebron James writes like my mom.
"never has a team with LeBron James had the #4 pick, with that team also being the fucking Lakers lmao"
&gt;at the end of the day he is still Lebron James  Lebron James isn't Lebron James. I'll explain it to you later.
Where are you getting this from?  Imma need a source on Lebron James being racist.  And supporting black people can't be your source.  And nothing from breitbart or fox news please either.
TIL Lebron James is illiterate
"Lebron James pretty much said it all... The only difference I'd add to his workplace comment is this... If I talked to my coworkers the way these guys talk to each other, HR would've scalped me a long time ago. LMAO"
We all know who LeBron James blames.
You guys are wildin. U really talking about trading Lebron James a GOAT level athlete for someone who hasn’t even been drafted... Zion’s fire but can’t disrespect the king
"&gt;Kawhi said he doesn't want to play second fiddle, so clearly it's not the lakers.  Kawhi Leonard has never been on record saying that he doesn't want to play ""second fiddle"" to LeBron.

If it was a normal situation I'd say yeah it'd be one of the most unusual. What caused it though was a broken AC in the arena.  https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/11039853/2014-nba-finals-lebron-james-exits-game-1-loss-thigh-cramp-c-fails
"Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't he cramp in this particular game because the air conditioning was broken?  [ESPN Article on the event](https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/11039853/2014-nba-finals-lebron-james-exits-game-1-loss-thigh-cramp-c-fails)  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;SAN ANTONIO -- Miami Heat forward LeBron James was forced to exit early from Game 1 of the NBA Finals because of severe leg cramping caused by extremely warm temperatures after the air conditioning in the arena malfunctioned.   &gt;   &gt;""It was the whole left leg, damn near the whole left side,"" James said. ""I was losing a lot \[of fluids\] throughout the game. It was extremely hot in the building, you know, both teams, fans, everybody could feel it. I was the one that had to take the shot."""
That's all the SJW types have.  Fuck lebron james. He needs to shut up and do his job.   He's painfully uneducated on what he's trying to speak about.
LeBron James is gonna make a mini series out of this
"Wow, LeBron James doesn't write that well"
"Lebron, Wade, (Bosh or Deng), Noah, Rose, Taj Gibson, James Johnson, Jimmy Butler. No amount of incompetence could have stopped them from winning championship after championship."
"For hours, I was wondering about what Lebron James had to say about this incident."
"Pascal Siakam yelled, ""There you go!"" Kawhi Leonard gave a look of pleasant surprise. Kyle Lowry belted, ""We got a fucking squad now."" And when DeMar DeRozan never hit the locker room door, ex-Raptor killer and proud father LeBron James smiled &amp; said, ""Y'all look so different."""
"This thread is literally a joke, people calling the FO a dumpster fire, why? Because the POBO stepped down who himself was the incompetent one? No way in hell were we a dumpster fire, we conducted a proper coaching search, and we have a solid staff right now, plus Lonzo, BI, great young pieces in Josh Hart and Kuzma along w Lebron James and a the ability to use the pick for AD AND sign a FA. People acting like the FO was incompetent but no one said that when we were 4th place and were crushing playoff teams. We had a rock solid team that we can blame to nothing but Injuries."
"I named off good shooters who were on a team that had LeBron James, ""team was offensively built well for LeBron without a true second star"".. what is confusing about that? They played well without LeBron and provided him spacing to do his LeBron things.  Magic were a great DEFENSIVE team, offensively they were fairly middle of the road most of the season and for most of the Playoffs as well, as seen by how they were largely offensively inept against the Laker. They did play a great series in the ECF and nobody can take that away from them."
"• ""No LeBron James/**Kobe** and Warrior fatigue.""  I think by now, it's accepted that he's retired among causal fans."
"We can make all the 3-6 jokes we want or the worse than Jordan comments but at the end of the day he is still Lebron James  He is a top 3-5 biggest name in sports so far this Century, and his legacy Will easily go beyonf basketball   He could lose other 3 finals tp Warriors and he would still have his basketball creed"
"Jr and Shump were the only playable shooters the Cavs had. Mike Miller and James Jones occasionally got a few minutes but they couldn’t do anything besides shoot open threes at an nba level at that point in their career.   Delly also was hospitalized because of the strain of playing so many minutes and defense. That team was too thin, their defense and Lebrons efficiency was falling apart. Having Kyrie would’ve given them a much better balance on offense and defense. You’re really understating how much worse the Cavs got, Lebron was constantly having to drive into crowded paints and they usually couldn’t get better shots than that.   Letting Delly and Mosgov play more minutes instead of KLove and Kyrie is not the defensive boost you think it is, and it doesn’t compare to the offense and general stamina due to depth the Cavs lost."
"I’m going to try to be as objective as possible with this (sorry if formatting is weird, doing this on the mobile app, will fix later when I get home from work):   - Did the team perform to expectations?  Most definitely not. I hate to blame injuries but they definitely played a huge part of our season. If we had our full roster, I’m sure we would’ve made the playoffs. Hard to say how far we would’ve gone, but definitely a playoff team. Because of this, we definitely fell far below expectations.  - Why did they fall short of/meet/exceed expectations?  No playoffs = below expectations  - What were the highlights of the season?  Highlights were: beating the Warriors on Christmas Day, watching Ingram and Rondo take on CP3 hahaha, beating the Thunder in the gritty OT game in January, and seeing LeBron in a Laker uniform. Hopefully we have more highlights next season.  - What were the lowlights of the season?  LeBron’s injury, the whole trade deadline fiasco, Zo’s injury, Ingram’s blood clot scare, missing the playoffs, Magic Johnson + offseason drama, you name it lol.   - Which players impressed you?  Honestly, Javale’s first half of the season before his pneumonia was fantastic. He was electric on offense and was a great rim protector. On top of all that, he seemed to be a great locker room presence.    Also, Caruso was great in the final stretch of the season. I hope that we bring him back as a backup. He played smart basketball on both sides of the ball. He’s proven himself to be a great backup for our second unit.  - Which players disappointed you?  I think Rondo disappointed me the most. He definitely had his great moments throughout the season, but his defensive liability definitely outweighed his offensive impact. He was basically a chair on the court that made some decent passes once in a while, amidst tons of questionable passes too (he would turn the ball over trying a bounce pass to Javale in traffic every game instead of just lobbing it up).   - What offseason moves do they need to make (draft selections, trades, free agent signings, staff changes etc.)?  We need to get an all-star, no question. Whether by trade or free agency. If we strike out on the major agents, then we HAVE to secure a decent roster of vets and shooters around LeBron. Our young core isn’t terrible but it’s not enough to win a ring alongside LeBron. I’m excited yet cautiously optimistic about our offseason. This is a big summer for Pelinka, he’s gonna make or break himself with the moves he makes.   We also need an offensive minded assistant. Our coaching staff is pretty good IMO, but it would be great if we could add an offensive specialist to solidify the staff.   We have the fourth pick, and our scouting department has been phenomenal the last few years so I’m not worried about who we pick. I’m sure this person would become a great addition to the team or a great trade asset. We’ll have to wait and see.  Side note: we got Judy Seto back on our training and rehab staff, so I’m super excited about that. For those who don’t know, she was our PT during Kobe’s years and he credits her with much of his durability and recovery throughout his career.   - Who is set to break out next season?  Brandon. Fucking. Ingram. He was on a post-ASB tear until his injury. He’s expected to make a full recovery and if he is on our roster by the start of next season, OH BOYYYYYY. The league better watch out for the Sleepy boi.  Also...LeBron James, anyone? His first full offseason of rest. Hard to say that it’ll be a “breakout” season because he’s maintained such a high level of excellence for so long, but I think that he’s about to prove the “LBj is getting old” crowd wrong. He takes fantastic care of his body and he’s getting tons of rest this summer... watch out.....  - Who is set to regress next season?  If we bring back Javale, I’m not surprised if he regresses. His last season was a tale of two halves. Hard to tell if he’ll be fantastic like the first half of the season or decent like the second half. I expect him to fall somewhere in between, if we bring him back.  - What are the main concerns for next season?  Our main concerns coincide directly with our expectations, so I’ll answer this one below.  - What expectations are there for next season?  With LBJ, on your roster, your expectations are always: winning championships. If we fail at that, then we are below expectations. My concern with this ties with our offseason moves. If we strike out entirely, then I’m concerned with our championship chances. If we do hit on one or two all stars, then my concern would be: making sure everyone (mostly our young guys) play a full season. They’ve been hit with some unfortunate injuries the last two years and it sucks to see them unable to finish a full 82.    I’m sure I’m missing so much in my write up. Would love to hear what you all have to say. Cheers 🤙"

Kawhi Leonard? Lebron James? Chris Paul? Paul George?  Wonder how many I. The league there are?
"&gt;Did the team perform to expectations?  No. But injuries were the main factor here that affected the team.    &gt;Why did they fall short of/meet/exceed expectations?  Winning record and making the playoffs were the target. They fell short. Again, blame needs to be placed on the injuries affecting the whole team.     &gt;What were the highlights of the season?   Lebron James walking out onto the Staples Center court in Purple and Gold.    &gt;What were the lowlights of the season?   Injuries and not making the playoffs    &gt;Which players impressed you?  Kyle Kuzma. Legit future all star   &gt;Which players disappointed you?  I think KCP was the leadt impressive for me. He was brought in to be our 6th man and he didn't quite get there for me.     &gt;What offseason moves do they need to make (draft selections, trades, free agent signings, staff changes etc.)?   Go after the top tiere free agents this summer to add to LBJ talents.    &gt;Who is set to break out next season?   Brandon Ingram if he stays healthy for a whole season.    &gt;Who is set to regress next season?  Josh Hart.  He needs to find his niche and excel in it.    &gt;What are the main concerns for next season?   Team health. New coaching. New players acquired from the draft and FA   &gt;What expectations are there for next season?   Same for every season; winning record and make the playoffs to see how far they can go.."
No LeBron James/Kobe and Warrior fatigue.

Its a 100% pose, not geniune at all, it is not his experience in life, he is just saying things he thinks will make him more admired....like much of the social justice stuff is, with most people."
"Dede is your typical energy guy. He could play in any era. He doesn't have the skill of a LeBron or KD but makes an impact on every game.   KD was a free agent and he chose GS. What are they gonna say ""No"" we don't want you? They won 73 but didn't win the chip so that season was a loss. They added 1 player. Its not like the Celtics who added Allen and Garnett or Miami who added James and Bosh and Allen."
&gt; Never trust a person with a first name as a last name  Michael *Jordan*  Kobe *Bryant*  Lebron *James*  Hm.. Sensing a pattern here...
"Overall I think the season went okay, but the shit show of having a front office lead by people with very little front office experience was foreshadowed to be a clusterfuck at some point and that was definitely this season. I think they under performed a little bit due to injuries though ultimately the season would have still ended with missing the playoffs even in what I see as a perfect scenario. I was impressed with the continued progress the young guys have made, and pretty disappointed by the lack of effort showcased by Lebron especially in the later parts of the season. Lebron is either going to be the greatest asset or problem going into next season. Ideally the team is structured and plays with Lonzo being the primary ball handler and play making rather than Lebron but that's not a role he's accustomed to taking and based off of how last year panned out, I doubt that will start now.   &amp;#x200B;  Going with their short term mentality, they need to make some decent free agent acquisitions, but pulling another sign a bunch of aging rusty guys who can't contribute isn't a way to succeed. The worst thing they could do is trade Lonzo, Ingram, and the 4th for Anthony Davis but I have a feeling that's exactly what is going to happen. That'll make them decent for a couple of years , which would be fine if they win a chip...but yeah this is the west not the east. AD plus current Kyrie and Lebron isn't going to be enough to win the west, and they'll need to offer their best young players in order to get AD. Really just looks like they are stuck again because the front office doesn't know wtf they are doing.  &amp;#x200B;  The best thing for the organization long term IMO, would be to keep focusing on building through young players and not trading them for trash. In my mind, the ideal situation would be to continue to build through the draft with their lucky as shit lottery picks and keep developing their young players, though that requires the front office to not suck. I like most of their recent draft picks, but they need  a better coach and better leadership. In my head canon, Jeanie and Phil reunite and get married and Phil Jackson returns as head coach of the Lakers and gets organizational control. Lebron James lets one of the greatest coaches of all time coach him and he actually listens, Kyrie comes in FA and rotates with Lonzo who spends the off season truly working on his scoring. Ingram continues to grow and turns into the player everyone has been waiting for, Kuzma gets more consistent with his scoring and the other young guys on the Laker bench start coming into their own. They don't make any trade for AD and let him come when he is a UFA if he really wants to. Ultimately the Lakers move focusing on the long game, because realistically in the short term nothing they put together is really going to be competitive against the true contenders."
"With the NBA draft two weeks away, which teams can make the best trade offers for Anthony Davis if the New Orleans Pelicans decide to move him? Davis met with new Pelicans EVP David Griffin last week to discuss the future of the franchise, according to a report by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. May's draft lottery results -- with New Orleans winning the No. 1 pick and surprise teams in the top four -- have changed things since Davis' initial trade request in January. Here is a look at what the potential suitors -- including the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks and Boston Celtics -- can offer in trade talks, who is likely off the table, the challenges each team faces and the risks involved.  What the Pelicans can include  Even if the Pelicans agree to the parameters of a deal before the draft concludes, don't expect to see an official Davis trade until after July 1 for the following reasons:  EDITOR'S PICKS  ￼  The Kawhi pitch: Toronto's best case to keep its superstar free agent  ￼  Next moves for NBA teams: Trade, free agency and draft decisions  Teams are operating under the 2018-19 salary cap until July 1. For example, the Lakers are projected to have $32.5 million in room starting then that can be used in a Davis deal.  Free agents cannot be signed and traded until July 6.  The Celtics are in a holding pattern until July 1 and are waiting on a decision from Kyrie Irving.  Off the table: Jrue Holiday. The point guard could be the next domino to fall, but New Orleans should hold off on any potential talks until there is resolution with Davis. Holiday is under contract through 2021-22 (player option) and would be high on many teams' lists if made available. Not available: Julius Randle (player option), Darius Miller (free agent), Elfrid Payton (free agent), Ian Clark (free agent) and Cheick Diallo (restricted free agent) Draft assets  The No. 1 pick in the June draft  All future first-round picks (2020-2025)  All future second-round picks (Chicago can swap in 2021)  Cash to be sent out and received: $5.6 million  Draft rights to two players  Tradable contracts (2019-20 season) 1. Anthony Davis: $27.1 million, under contract through the 2020-21 season (has a player option)  15 percent trade bonus, valued at $4.063 million if traded in July  Davis is not eligible to sign a $240 million supermax extension with his new team.  Six months after the trade, Davis would be eligible to sign a four-year, $145.6 million extension.  Davis could sign a new contract with the acquiring team in July 2020 for up to five years and $205.3 million. Signing with a team that has cap space would secure Davis a four-year, $152.2 million contract.  2. Solomon Hill: $12.8 million, under contract through 2019-20 3. E'Twaun Moore: $8.6 million, under contract through 2019-20 4. Jahlil Okafor: $1.7 million, under contract through 2019-20 (team option)  $54,000 salary protection if his 2019-20 team option is exercised  5. Frank Jackson: $1.6 million, under contract through 2019-20  Contract for 2019-20 becomes guaranteed if not waived by June 30  6. Christian Wood: $1.6 million, under contract through 2019-20  Contract for 2019-20 is non-guaranteed  7. Kenrich Williams: $1.4 million, restricted free agent in 2020  Contract for 2019-20 is non-guaranteed  8. Davis Bertans: $1.4 million, restricted free agent in 2020  Contract for 2019-20 is non-guaranteed  Complicating factors  The salaries for Okafor, Jackson, Bertans, Wood and Williams would not be included in matching purposes for trades. The five players have minimal or $0 salary protection for 2019-20.  Boston Celtics  The Celtics have the right mix of draft assets, young players and tradable contracts, but can Boston take an aggressive approach with New Orleans, knowing that Irving could leave in free agency? Not available: Kyrie Irving (free agent), Marcus Morris (free agent), Terry Rozier(restricted free agent), Daniel Theis(restricted free agent), Brad Wanamaker(restricted free agent) and Jonathan Gibson (restricted free agent) Draft assets  Picks Nos. 14, 20, 22 and 51 in the June draft  All future first-round picks (2020-2025)  Memphis' 2020 first-round pick (top-six protected, then unprotected in 2021). This is the crown jewel of the Celtics' draft assets.  All future second-round picks  Cash to be sent out and received: $5.6 million  Tradable contracts (2019-20 season) 1. Gordon Hayward: $32.7 million, under contract through 2020-21  15 percent trade bonus: valued at $4.9 million in July  2. *Al Horford: $30.1 million, under contract through 2019-20  15 percent trade bonus: valued at $4.5 million in July  3. Marcus Smart: $12.5 million, under contract through 2021-22 4. Jayson Tatum: $7.8 million, restricted free agent in 2021 5. Jaylen Brown: $6.5 million, restricted free agent in 2020  Extension-eligible starting in July  6. *Aron Baynes: $5.5 million, under contract through 2019-20 7. Guerschon Yabusele: $3.1 million, restricted free agent in 2021 8. Robert Williams: $1.9 million, restricted free agent in 2022 9. Semi Ojeleye: $1.6 million, restricted free agent in 2021  Contract becomes guaranteed if not waived by July 1  *Horford and Baynes have player options and cannot be traded until they opt into their contracts for 2019-20. Complicating factors  Making the money work if Horford and Baynes opt out of their deals could limit Boston's options. The Celtics would have only seven players to trade, and that includes Hayward's $32.7 million contract (not counting his $4.9 million trade bonus).  Los Angeles Lakers  After seeing their numerous trade proposals rebuffed at the deadline, the Lakers had to wait until the summer to pursue Davis. Despite receiving a solid offer that included two first-round picks along with Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram and salary relief with the Solomon Hill contract, New Orleans decided to pass.  NBA Finals Presented by YouTube TV  ￼ The Warriors and Raptors are set to clash in the Finals. Tune in here. Friday, June 7 • Game 4 | 9 p.m. ET | ABC/WatchESPN Monday, June 10 • Game 5 | 9 p.m. ET | ABC/WatchESPN The big question now: Does the No. 4 pick in the draft make New Orleans interested enough to consider a deal? Off the table: LeBron James Not available: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope(free agent), Rajon Rondo (free agent), Lance Stephenson (free agent), JaVale McGee (free agent), Reggie Bullock (free agent), Mike Muscala (free agent) and Tyson Chandler (free agent) Draft assets  The No. 4 pick in the June draft  All future first-round picks (2020-2025)  All future second-round picks  Cash to be sent out and received: $5.6 million  Draft rights to two players  Tradable contracts (2019-20 season) 1. Lonzo Ball: $8.7 million, restricted free agent in 2021 2. Brandon Ingram: $7.3 million, restricted free agent in 2020 and extension-eligible in July 3. Moritz Wagner: $2.0 million, restricted free agent in 2022 4. Kyle Kuzma: $2.0 million, restricted free agent in 2021 5. Josh Hart: $1.9 million, restricted free agent in 2021 6. Isaac Bonga: $1.4 million, restricted free agent in 2021 7. Jemerrio Jones; $1.4 million, restricted free agent in 2020  Contract for 2019-20 is non-guaranteed  Complicating factors  Los Angeles is left with seven tradable contracts (not including LeBron) in the offseason. The Lakers project to have $32.5 million in room and could use the available cap space as a buffer to make a deal work. They could use their own free agents in a sign-and-trade, but that would require each player to sign off on a deal and the Pelicans to take back unwanted salary.  The Lakers can add a third max player but would have to sign that free agent first and then acquire Davis in a trade. In this scenario, the Lakers would have to trade up to $21.6 million in salary. If the $7.1 million salary of the No. 4 pick is involved, Los Angeles would have to wait 30 days after the contract is signed.  The only way for the Lakers to have cap space in 2020 if Davis hits free agency is to yet again sign players to one-year deals.  New York Knicks  Would a Duke reunion of RJ Barrett and Zion Williamson entice the Pelicans to bite when it comes to a Knicks trade? As outlined here, there is a clear pathway to New York signing two max players first and then putting together a package for Davis. Off the table: DeAndre Jordan (free agent), Mario Hezonja (free agent), Emmanuel Mudiay (restricted free agent), Allonzo Trier (team option), Billy Garrett (team option), Henry Ellenson (team option), John Jenkins (team option), Luke Kornet (restricted free agent) and Noah Vonleh (free agent) Draft assets  Picks Nos. 3 and 55 in the June draft  All future first-round picks (2020-2025)  An unprotected first-round pick in 2021 from Dallas  A top-10-protected first-round pick from Dallas in 2023, 2024 or 2025  Second-round picks from Charlotte in 2020 and 2021  Future second-round picks starting in 2022  Cash to be sent out and received: $5.2 million  Draft rights to two players  Tradable contracts (2019-20 season) 1. "
"James, Lebron."
No? The biggest reason was they had LeBron James and in 2015 they also had Kyrie Irving until he went out in Game 1 of the Finals
"&gt;LeBron James is the first player in NBA Finals history to lead both teams in points, assists and rebounds for the entire series.  The very next year in 2016 when they finally won the 'ship. Lebron led all players on both teams in every major statistical category for the series (first time it's ever happened in ANY playoff series in NBA history) Points, Assists, Rebounds, Blocks, Steals; honestly that alone is sooooo impressive not to mention, 1st team to ever come back from a 3-1 finals deficit, broke the 52 year championship drought for his Hometown team, beat the team with the best record in NBA History at 73-9 etc. The more I look back on that 2016 series, the more absurd what Lebron accomplished that year sinks in."
"By the time he is eligible there will be 200 people in the Hall of Fame.  As of now just looking his NBA stats- he's 25th in steals, 92nd in Win Shares, 79th in BPM, 38th in VORP, 66th in Games played, 54th in minutes played.  25 players that have played more minutes than him and not yet been enshrined: Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, LeBron James, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, Joe Johnson, Clifford Robinson, Buck Williams, Jason Terry, Pau Gasol, Andre Miller, Shawn Marion, Otis Thorpe, Mark Jackson, Jamal Crawford, Horace Grant, Kevin Willis, Tony Parker, Carmelo Anthony, Michael Finley, Derek Harper, Antawn Jamison.  Can make an argument for each of those guys to get in. You show that you are year after year good enough to play basketball professionally and all of the sudden you're good career has you top 30 in rebounds or top 12 in assists. These guys have all shown that their varied individual skill sets contribute towards winning basketball games."
This is such a goofy ass take and I cringe every time I see it    We literally saw what happened when you pair Westbrook with a ball dominant SF. Twice.  They play really fucking good together is what happens. KD and PG both fit around Westbrook great.   But once the playoffs come around instead of hobbled PG you have Playoff LeBron James.  Add Russ to the current Lakers and they’re a title contender. Add Jrue and they’re WCF at best.
"No they fell well short of expectations. Those expectations weren’t championship because they are very young and it was their first year together but second round of the playoffs would not have been unreasonable.   The low point of the season was Christmas Day. Yes we still beat the Warriors in oracle but when LeBron got hurt the season got hurt with him. The best was probably how well BI played before he had medical issues.   Moving forward the Lakers should resign Reggie, Caruso, and Magee (forgive bad spelling),And then try to get a max FA.  If we can’t get a max guy there are three big free agents we should chase Reddick, Seth Curry, and Ariza. In those guys we get shooting and some defense with a defensive coach. Then I think we look for a trade. I think Beal is a better fit with LeBron but with all that’s happened in the last 6 months we have to try for AD, plus we could use an all-star big man. So get one of those guys but don’t trade all four main pieces in Kuz, Ball, BI, 4th pick. Keep at least one two if you can but don’t miss on the trade trying to lowball the other team.   The best part of next year will be LeBron James. This man just watched the whole world take the title of best in the world from him while he was playing injured. He is going to come out and prove a point next year. I believe he will be the MVP.  I have no faith in the front office however, and I think they will continue making weird moves that no one understands and take the attention away for the game, I expect that to be the worst part of next season however. If we stay healthy and either as shooters or a max FA in the off season then a noisy dumb front office will be a sideshow but mostly a non factor, if we’re lucky.   Expectation moving forward. We have the best player ever(my opinion) cap space, trade assets, a very talented young group of guys, and one year of struggles under their belt together. Not to mention the Lakers are the biggest brand in basketball and so many big players want to live in LA so this team is very well off and needs to be in the conference finals or better next year, and I expect them to be, or next season is going to be fun and I’m excited to see what happens."
ah yes another lebron james post in a finals that he's not a part of. because we don't talk about him every single day
"Its kind of weird how the narrative is now, this is what Lebron had to do.   SO NOW CURRY IS LEBRON JAMES? Self proclaimed king and GOAT?  This is why i can't take Lebron stans seriously."
The white Lebron James
...how does it put LeBron's performance into context when we already know Curry isn't performing better than LeBron in his position  Was there an ongoing debate between Curry leading the Cavs to better performances than James that I missed since 2016?
"I keep seeing we got lucky are y’all serious? Did you not see 2016? We lost Steph Curry to injury until he came back but he still had problems. Kawhi btw every single sports segment has the excuse that he’s injured right now. We lost Bogut in the finals. No rim protection against Kyrie, Klove, and Lebron James. Lebron’s primary defender was hobbled in Andre Igoudala who could barely play.   There are no excuses. If the Raptors win so be it just like the Cavs did. But don’t rewrite history."
I thought Brook Lopez was Lebron James in disguise
If he didn't win then he came up short. You can't position superstars to be all time greats when they win then blame everyone else when they lose. LBJ is also a really bad example because he's proven that he can carry a team without a hall of fame supporting cast. Steph has not. If his only true comparison is LeBron James then he should be expected to carry teams the way LeBron hsd
He obviously did come up short by definition if they lost the game. LeBron James has nothing to do with this. There's nothing to defend. His team needed more points and he didn't get them.
"Well, LeBron James is better so..."
"&gt; Jordan is a better offensive player  How? Lebron scores almost as much as Jordan and also playmakes for others.  &gt;All of the stats back this up.   No they don't. Lebron has better counting stats. More points all time regular season and playoffs. More blocks, more assists, more rebounds more game winners. He's more efficient better FG%, 3pt%, TS%. Lebron has the highest elimination game scoring average of all time.  He has many advanced stats better than Jordan such as box plus minus, VORP, and win shares.  Lebron has literally won more games. He's scored more points than Jordan in less games.  &gt;LeBron was just physically bigger and more athletic than most of his competition.   This is not true and demonstrates that you have an untrained eye and do not understand Lebron's game at all. There are plenty of players with similar body types to Lebron such as James Johnson on the Heat. Why doesn't he just be Lebron if there is no skill involved?  There is plenty of skill and footwork involved in Lebron's game. For example in transition [Lebron will use footchops or double hops](https://streamable.com/kjgjk) to get defenders out of position.  &gt; They think, wow he's bigger, stronger, and faster and people can't stop his very basic offensive skillset.   Yeah, if they only understand very simple basketball. You have no understanding of the intelligence in Lebron's game so let me show you a play another user clipped. Here is a play the Cavs like to run for Kevin Love: https://streamable.com/gxrbd.   They get a point guard to set a screen for Love. What usually happens is the point guard doesn't want to switch onto Love, and the big guy doesn't want to switch onto a point guard, so both defenders hesitate. The Cavs like to take advantage of this moment of hesitation by having Love sprint to the basket for an open layup.  If they don't get that, they can get the switch with a small on Love so Love can post up or shoot over him, and a big on a point guard so the guard can try blowing by him.  But now this same play against another intelligent player like Draymond doesn't work. Here it is: https://streamable.com/3mnjj  Draymond understands what the Cavs are trying to do. Jordan Bell is hesitant to switch off of Love so he holds onto him so he doesn't get screened off, and so Love backdoors him and runs to the rim. But he can't get open because Draymond goes and stands in his way.  Lebron intelligently recognizes that Draymond has figured out the play, and so he calls Draymond's man Tristan Thompson to come set a screen for him. The screen easily rubs off Durant who has no idea what's going on, and Lebron knows he's getting an open jumpshot because Draymond has committed to stopping the play on the baseline. Draymond rushes over to contest when he realizes Lebron has countered him, but it's a late contest and James win the possession.   THAT is just a sample of the beauty and skill of Lebron's game. He has all the physical tools, yet he is also able to engage in mental games in the middle of a rigorous exercise. And he's got the skills to make it all work as well so he is a complete player. That's his claim as the GOAT."
I mean would you really call [this](https://gfycat.com/excitablealivebedlingtonterrier-lebron-james-celebrity) healthy?
"Lebron in 2015 Finals had a similar series  LeBron James finished the 2015 NBA Finals with averages of 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game.   LeBron James is the first player in NBA Finals history to lead both teams in points, assists and rebounds for the entire series.  Without James on the floor, Cleveland’s field goal percentage dropped for 40% to 17%, and it’s offensive efficiency fell from 97.3 to 50.9.  According to Tom Haberstroh of ESPN, James accounted for 38.3% of Cleveland's points in the Finals, the second-highest percentage of team points in Finals history. He is edged only by Michael Jordan scoring 38.4% of the Bulls' points in the 1993 Finals, which Chicago won.  He was responsible for an average of 57.7 points per game on points he either scored or assisted on; which in turn, accounted for 62% of the Cavaliers’s points in the NBA Finals.  According to ESPN Stats &amp; Information, by pulling the Elo Ratings for each team to make the NBA Finals before the series began, and taking into account a team’s home-court advantage, it was able to project each team’s chances of winning prior to the Finals. What was discovered was that James’ teams had the lowest expected winning percentage — 37% — out of any of the other players on this list. If you consider that James still managed to win two titles with those odds stacked against him, the four losses don’t seem so terrible. And if we look at the 2015 Finals by itself, we’ll realize that James did was pretty much unprecedented.  “If we look at a multi-year Statistical Plus/Minus talent projection for every NBA Finals team, this Cavs team ranks as the ninth-least talented NBA finalist since 1985. (By contrast, Cleveland’s opponents, the mighty Golden State Warriors, rank as the 14th-most talented.) Remove James, and things get even more dire; his supporting cast ranks as the third-worst team carried by its best player to the NBA Finals since 1985.”  If you were to take James’s talent rating (6.6) and replace it with that of the league-average player (0.0), the Cavaliers’s talent rating would dwindle to -0.1. So what the King ended up doing was carrying one of the three-worst supporting casts in NBA history to within two games of a championship. Of course, what we forgot to mention was that FiveThirtyEight also determined that these Golden State Warriors finished the year with the second-highest peak Elo Rating (1822) in NBA history and third-highest Composite Elo Rating of all time (1796), making them one of the best basketball teams ever. And what James did against them remarkable.  When LeBron was NOT on the floor, JR Smith, Matthew Dellavedova, James Jones and Iman Shumpert DID NOT MAKE A SHOT in the NBA Finals  Without LeBron James on the floor this series. JR Smith 0/9 FG Delly 0/7 FG J. Jones 0/3 FG Shumpert 0/2 FG Total 0/21 FG"
"offensively they got worse. defensively they got better. Kyrie and Kevin Love are not good defenders. like I said, LeBron was obviously capable of carrying a bigger load on offense.  &gt;Dray, Iggy, and Boogie are all better players than any one of those names.   again, you're not understanding what i'm saying. sure Boogie is a better offensive player but he didn't even play 20 minutes tonight. on the court were other guys that are much bigger liabilities on offense, atleast spacing wise. Jr Smith, Iman Shumpert, James Jones, Delly is much better spacing than Iggy, Dray, McKinnie and Livingston.   &gt;just watch the games and actually act like Lebron didn’t have even worse spacing than Steph tonight.  lol are you really saying Draymond, Iggy, McKinnie, Livingston, Bogut, Jerebko space the floor better than JR Smith, James Jones, Delly and Shumpert? you're crazy. obviously the spacing that series was bad considering their normal standards.. but you obviously don't realize how bad the Warriors shooters are."
"Lebron played most of his career with average role players. His last season in Cleveland his TS was 60%. The starting lineup for that team featured two traditional bigs Anderson Varajeo and 38 year old Shaq. It wasn't some spaced out team with a player like Love or Bosh.  I get where your theory comes from, but it's complete baloney. Lebron's efficiency was below his standards that entire 2015 season. He had back issues that year. His FG% that season was 48%. The 5 years before it was always 50% or better. And the 4 seasons since 2015 it has also been 50% or better. So 2015 is the outlier year as a whole and Kyrie and Love were around in the regular season.  &gt; LeBron wouldn't be getting easy looks in the paint and we all know his jumper isn't consistent  Lebron's jumpshot has been consistent for a decade now. Lebron's jumper is arguably as consistent as anyone probably more so. And no matter how great of a shooter you are all shooters are streaky. Klay Thompson is streaky. Steph Curry is streaky. If anything, Lebron James is not that the only player as consistent as him is MJ. Lebron almost never has bad shooting games."
I sexually identity as Lebron James and am offended

"This is so wrong. Rewatch the 2015 finale, Lebrons team clearly got significantly worse, he just somehow carried them to 2 wins anyway. His roster was TT, Delly, Jr, Shump, Mosgov, and James Jones. It’s not even remotely comparable to the players Steph had around him.   Dray, Iggy, and Boogie are all better players than any one of those names. Don’t even look at the names, just watch the games and actually act like Lebron didn’t have even worse spacing than Steph tonight."
Oh of course. Lebron chose to have srub teammates he passed on adding James Harden and Kevin Durant to his team lmao. Get out of here there are only role players for teams to choose from to pick up.   He never ever threatened to leave he even signed a 2 year deal after the 2015 finals.
Hey mate I'm not trolling. You really still arguing lebron James doesn't shoot 3's? I've watched hundreds of his games. If he's open he shoots 3's. Hell I bet as of late he shoots more volume than most and has a fair percentage of his shots from 3. He's not great at them but he's good enough you have to close out. So he shoots 3's and you are wrong here.
I can’t win with these cats - Lebron James
"Everyone talking about how Curry lived the ""Lebron James Finals Experience"" but Lebron had Kyrie, Love, and a 6'8 250 lb frame that could do just about anything. When's the last time we've seen a point guard of Curry's stature try to impose his will on a finals game? Isiah Thomas?"
the amount of LeBron James posts tonight is suspiciously high.
They're tryna kill lebron James by suckin all the air out of the arena
"Son of a BITCH do I hate the Warriors. I know most everyone does but for me it goes much deeper than that. I am beyond hate. 5 straight Finals. 5 straight Finals have I put up with the Warriors and their nonstop Warrior winning wats. I have had to watch Draymond Green eat his fucking W's for the past half decade. My friend is a Jazz fan, he says ""Oh yEaH I HatE tHe WaRRiOrs tOo BrO"" and I say You dumb bitch. Shut the fuck up with your dumb bullshit. We have to play them FOUR TIMES A YEAR, EVERY YEAR. and he says ""yeah but"" and I can't even hear him because at this point I'm thinking about that youtube thumbnail of baby faced, chewing on his mouth guard, cocky little fuck Steph Curry when he dad dicked the Thunder and there is blood in my ears and hate in my heart. FUCK. And don't even get me started on their fans. One of my ""friends"" is a Warriors and a Patriots fan. THEY'RE ON OPPOSITE COASTS YOU FUCK. And he has the nerve to call me out for being a Clippers and a Saints fan. LA (louisiana) DIDN'T HAVE A BASKETBALL TEAM WHEN I STARTED WATCHING, YOU STUPID BITCH. I CHOSE THE TEAM WITH THE PRETTY COLORS CAUSE I DIDNT REALIZE THEY WOULD HAVE SATAN AND HIS SNEK AND DONKEY IN THEIR DIVISION. I love how on this subreddit you can go to any given comment thread and find some idiot with a warriors flair talking about Curry. Every warriors fan would let steph curry shit in their cereal every morning for a FORTNIGHT just to suckle one of his ring fingers. and I just KNOW that they're reading this right now, because they infest game threads like a ganon of leeches, and halfway through skimming it with their limited reading skills they realize they have an erection, so they ctrl+shift+n and search ayesha curry feet until they bust a nut onto the keyboard, posting comments like ""if this wasnt curry people would think this was cool"" or just ""mmmphmmgofgpsngfjg"" because they still have Steph Currys DICK in their mouth. They say don't cheer for injuries. Fuck that. I hope Steph Curry gets hit by an airplane. He'll be screaming at one of his teammates who works day in and day out for him, because the warriors are only up 74 - 8, and some insane fan will just lose it and prison shank him 3 times, and then once more for good measure. And I'll watch that shit on youtube for the rest of my life. I'll be there at his funeral to comfort Ayesha with hors d'oeuvres but when it's my turn to sprinkle dirt on his coffin I'll drop a picture of LeBron James instead. And when security drags me out for causing a rumpus I'll just laugh and laugh, because I know that I hired the insane fan to do it. It was my plan all along. All I had to do was promise him the chance to wear step currys skin. Oh, you thought the funeral was closed casket out of respect? No, no my friend. His SKIN is gone. Where is it now, you ask? It's been... distributed. A small bribe to the chef was all it took. And now Ayesha is wondering why her pig in a blanket has the faint taste of vegetable curry ice cream, and the tears begin again as my laughter drowns out the wind and the rain. And the world keeps spinning. I am home now. Some days are good. Some days aren't. All I can do is live what life Curry has left me."
"&gt;Let me tell you a story about my uncle Jim, who has always had a fascination with toes. When him and his family come over for dinner, he spends the entire time under the table licking our feet like a dog. One day he took me to a Bucks-Cavs game and got us court side seats. I was really excited until he ran on to the court and tackled LeBron James. He never was able to get LeBron’s shoe off and fulfill his lifelong dream before security got him. Such a sad story...  Airball my dude"

1. Tell me without a shred of doubt that James Harden would NOT try that shit.   2. Tripping someone is a foul. Not sure what you’re on about here.    3. You mean to say that Lebron doesn’t invite contact when he drives? No player EVER takes a shot in attempt to draw a foul? What game are you watching?
"&gt;First of all Kuzma isnt a starter.   That's not what he wants:  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2018/10/30/18043576/la-lakers-kyle-kuzma-brandon-ingram-lebron-james-julius-randle-luke-walton-quotes-analysis  The Lakers are trying to win the championship. Kyrie+Lebron has been tried against the KD Warriors already and failed. You just want to try that again for what? You're trying to out offense the Warriors and that will never work with just those 2 against the Warriors trio.   Kyrie is a great scorer but adding him isn't enough to win the championship. Only Anthony Davis is, or by taking either Durant or Klay from the Warriors is."
Congratz Kawhi for 2nd ring and 2nd mvp.. You are better player than Lebron James   Kaawhi best player in the world
day in the life of lebron james.
And now Steph knows exactly how it feels to be LeBron James in the finals.
lebron james experience
"Steph ""Lebron James"" Curry"
"Well, my uncle Jim has always had a fascination with toes. When him and his family come over for dinner, he spends the entire time under the table licking our feet like a dog.

"Hey, when you beat a team of LeBron James, Tristan Thompson *checks notes* Matthew Delevadova , Timofey Mozgov, and Iman Shumpert, you know you've done something special!  Not to mention JR Smith, James Jones, and Mike Miller coming off the bench!"
"*LeBron James Finals Experience (2007, 2015, 2018)"
#LEBRON JAMES IS  filming space jam lmao
2019 Steph Curry is 2015 LeBron James
Curry experiencing the Lebron James finals experience.
Lebron James lost to my San Antonio Spurs by a record margin.
True... But what if they had prime Lebron James *and* Michael Jordan?
Steph Curry in 2019 can now sympathize with Lebron James from 2015.  He wanted it so bad but with all the injuries doesn’t have the supporting cast.
And if the Raptors had James Hard and LeBron James GSW would collapse. What kind of idiot comment is this.
"Steph Curry pulled a LeBron James. Carried but team wasn't good enough, maybe this will make them realize how easy they have had it."
I wouldn’t exactly use the phrase “brilliant man” to describe Lebron James.
