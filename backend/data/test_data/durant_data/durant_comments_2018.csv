"In no particular order:  Anthony Davis  KAT  Giannis  Kevin Durant  Honestly this was harder to narrow down than I thought, maybe another young guy like Porzingis/Jokic? It would probably be Embiid if he didn’t have any injury concerns.  A top 10 would probably be easier."
Kevin Durant is the greatest scorer of all time.  And I'm an OKC fan saying this
So? Kevin Durant is a 4 time scoring champ. lol.  
James Harden had 3 games in last years playoffs that were arguably worse than any game Kevin Durant has had in his entire playoff career    |Rk|G|Date||Opp||GS|MP|FG|FGA|FG%|3P|3PA|3P%|FT%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PF|PTS|GmSc|+/-| |-:|-:|:-|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |4|4|2017-04-23||OKC|W (+4)|1|39:18|5|16|.313|0|7|.000|.857|7|8|1|0|7|3|16|6.9|0| |7|7|2017-05-03||SAS|L (-25)|1|33:39|3|17|.176|2|9|.222|.833|7|10|2|0|4|4|13|7.8|-13| |11|11|2017-05-11||SAS|L (-39)|1|36:36|2|11|.182|2|9|.222|.667|3|7|1|1|6|6|10|1.4|-28|
"Kevin Durant defense, 7 foot scoring machine"
"Is LeBron no longer a top 100 player?  I am a cavs fan, but I genuinely believe after watching this season that multiple players have surpassed Lebron.

Kevin Durant :(
I thought it had more to do with Kevin Durant on first read but either way
i dont think kevin durant really cares about joe ingles.
The addition of KD makes winning while bodying Curry impossible because you're not leaving harrison Barnes open anymore that's Kevin fucking Durant 
2016 is 2016. You now have Kevin Durant who cannot be shut down and gets buckets in his sleep. People keep thinking its close between the warriors and everyone else. Its not and everyone's going to see that.
The following list is **my opinion**. I have arguments for every ''controversial'' pick (Westbrook over Curry and Harden in particular).  1) LeBron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Russell Westbrook  4) Stephen Curry  5) James Harden  6) Anthony Davis  7) Giannis Antetokounmpo  8) Kawhi Leonard (despite being injured for almost the whole season)  9) DeMarcus Cousins  10) Jimmy Butler  11) Chris Paul  12) **Kyrie Irving**  13) Paul George  14) DeMar DeRozan  15) John Wall  16) Damian Lillard  17) Karl Anthony Towns  18) Joel Embiid  19) LaMarcus Aldridge  20) Kristaps Porzingis
Kevin Durant is the second best shooting guard of all time and he's playing right before our eyes
"That's pretty interesting. The average NBA team is officially about revenue neutral (not really, but that's what's on the books). The rich teams- LAL, GS, CHI, and NYK, are coming out like $50-100M ahead every year. I'd imagine that they would pour all of that into their designated player. That sets the ballpark for the contracts, anyway  I think it's entirely plausible that any of those teams would give Lebron James $100M, and if he turned it down they'd offer a similar number to Kevin Durant."
"&gt; What does this have to do with Kevin Durant?  I'm sorry, are DWS relevant or not ? Because you can't point to them as clear evidence one second, and dismiss them the next.  &gt; The team was good defensively because LeBron was a great defender already. What you are saying translates to team defense overrides the players defense. For example, according to your logic, players like Ben Wallace, who played for a great defensive team, got his 4 defensive player of the year awards more because his team was good defensively.  This is literally barely intelligible. Team defense often does override players defense, at least for perimeter players. Just look at this year, the Bucks have a ton of great defensive talent yet aren't good defensively. The Lakers have barely any defensive talent and yet were elite defensively early in the year. It's not always the case but it was for that year. LeBron was not a great defender already, nobody watching at the time would take that argument seriously.  &gt; Reading comprehension  Right back at you. That point does nothing to refute the idea that the Cavs were a great rebounding team independently from LeBron.  &gt; Not only was lebron good on defense, but he led the team in virtually everything else. Giannis is a superstar too, you realize that right?  Yes ? My point wasn't that LeBron had a great supporting cast, it's just that it wasn't really weaker than Giannis'. Listing the things LeBron led his team in is literally the worst way to convince anyone he carried them more than Giannis did, because Giannis led his team in all 5 major categories."
"&gt;No, clearly Kevin Durant should have won DPOY in 2013 because he had more defensive win shares than LeBron, and that’s all that counts, right ?  What does this have to do with Kevin Durant? Lol nice deflection. I was bringing up his defensive win shares relative to his team. You said he was average or below average overall and that the rest of the cavs defense covered up for his poor defense. Which is completely wrong.   &gt;LeBron’s DWS was high in 2007 because the team was good defensively,  You got it backwards. The team was good defensively because LeBron was a great defender already. What you are saying translates to team defense overrides the players defense. For example, according to your logic, players like Ben Wallace, who played for a great defensive team, got his 4 defensive player of the year awards more because his team was good defensively. To which I say, LOL.  &gt;Where?  &gt;LeBron in ’07 averaged 8.7 rebounds per100 possessions. He was third on his team in RPG, behind Gooden and Big Z, **despite the fact that he averaged about 12 minutes per game more than each of them**  &gt;Meanwhile Giannis led his team in all the things LeBron led his team in, was 2nd in DBPM, and also led the team in rebounds and blocks.  Reading comprehension. Those points I made about LeBron were refuting  your point that the cavs were not a bad team because their defense carried lebron. Not only was lebron good on defense, but he led the team in virtually everything else. Giannis is a superstar too, you realize that right? "
"TRADE TALK: with Kevin Love out, I think the Cavs should target two teams for a trade...  1. Cavs trade for Anthony Davis from the Pelicans. With Boogie injured, and expected to be out for a long period of time, the Pelicans may find themselves in no-man's land. They may have to reconsider giving Boogie the 5yr/$175 mill contract that was expected. Achilles injuries, especially for someone with Boogie's body type, can be career-altering. He may never be the same, and without Boogie in the picture, the Pelicans aren't competitive. The Cavs could sell the farm for Anthony Davis, and include the acquired Brooklyn 1st Round Pick. Only issue is, if the Pelicans do move Davis, they may wait until the summer to get all possible options. AD would put the Cavs right back on top. This would also set the Cavs up for the next few years, and could entice Lebron to stay, if he was considering leaving. Sell the farm for Davis.  2. Cavs trade for Marc Gasol and Tyreke Evans from Grizzlies. Gasol is a big body that has a decent mid range jumper. I wouldn't classify Gasol as a stretch-big man, but he can shoot, and is hitting about 1.5 3s per game, which is the all important stat in today's game. Tyreke Evans is putting up a pretty monster season, and adds an all-around game that is a perfect fit for the Cavs. He can do it all, and is an underrated perimeter defender. He could match up with Klay, or perhaps even Durant, if there is another finals meeting between the Warriors/Cavs.  3. I HATE the idea of the Cavs getting Deandre Jordan, even if they can also acquire Avery Bradley. Jordan doesn't help the Cavs beat the Warriors."
"LeBron was an average defender, at best.  &gt; This is flat out wrong. He had a defensive win share of 5.7 that year that is higher than his 2012-2013 season where he finished second in defensive player of the year  No, clearly Kevin Durant should have won DPOY in 2013 because he had more defensive win shares than LeBron, and that's all that counts, right ?  LeBron's DWS was high in 2007 because the team was good defensively, and that's taken into account in the calculation. You think it's a coincidence his highest DWS came in '07, '09 and '12, the years where his team was best defensively ?  Also do you think it's a coincidence that 3 other guys on the Cavs had 4+ defensive win shares that year, while nobody other than Giannis even had 3 on the Bucks ? Gimme a break.  &gt; Op wants to hold his rebounds against him  Where ? I didn't say he was a poor rebounder because of this, only that he wasn't as good a rebounder as Giannis is now, and had more help on the boards. Giannis played next to a center and a power forward too btw, neither averaged more boards.  &gt; He led the team in points, assists, steals, PER, offensive win share, defensive win share, total win share, VORP and 3rd in DBPM  Meanwhile Giannis led his team in all the things LeBron led his team in, was 2nd in DBPM, and also led the team in rebounds and blocks."
"Good thing you're gut feeling doesn't determine whether things are good or bad. I guarantee you could find a 65 shot streak of Kevin Durant where he shot around 10% yet that doesn't mean he's bad?   Shooting 8 threes a season (65 over 8) means he's taking one every 10 games, it's not like he's able to gain a rhythm or confidence in his shot. "
"I'm either completely misunderstanding you or this is the wrongest thing I've ever read.  Harden, Chris Paul  Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving, Horford  Lamarcus Aldridge, Pau Gasol  Only the Raptors are an exception."
Lalalala im not Kevin Durant but you gotta admit harden may be good but not as good as Kevin Durant who I definitely am not. Lalalalala

Kevin Durant in a Joe Ingles costume played tonight 
"Have you watched your team? Do you know that big guy, shoots well, number 35, Kevin Durant? Ring a bell buddy? "
The official list of top 5 according to me and I don't think unless you're biased you should have an issue with is.....  1) LBJ  2) Kevin Durant  3) Stephen Curry (Now I love the guy and I know a lot of folks want me to put him before KD but let us just face reality right now together)  4) James Harden  5) Brodie 
"J James Harden and Russel Westbrook dropping numbers Kevin Durant never had. Its crazy how OKC fucked up the big 3.   Edit: I started a huge debate lol. When the big 3 was together, of was no1  then Westbrook. In OKC there's no number1; whoever opens gets the ball.  I believe harden was in okc for only 3-4 years, and became an all star off the bench. If Kevin Durant was in okc, nobody would've known Westbrook was this great.  OKC severely under evaluated harden and Westbrook potential. They did have good chemistry and as they developed they would've been more comfortable and able to share better."
They are shook and should blow it up. We accept Kevin Durant if they dont need him anymore.
"""Kevin Durant? Never heard of her"" - Joe Ingles -"
"CP3 is just as injury prone as Kevin Durant and Steph Curry, and Lebron is actually still playing far above average defense, you’re just not paying attention.  Besides that Lebron not playing as hard til the playoffs isn’t that big of a problem anyway, that team is built to do one thing, beat the Warriors. I also doubt they’d have to give up all three of those players to afford Lebron "
"who's he supposed to be over because he's not over KD, kevin and durant"
"Even though KAT hasn't been that prolific for a full season, I'd say he is on the low end of the Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, LeBron tier of scorers and has the potential to rise. "
"Agreed. Swapping Dray and Klay for AD is a bad idea.    Klay and Dray were basically hand made to fit on this squad. Neither need the ball to contribute. Klay is an elite defender and all time shooter. Who brings zero drama to the team. Draymond is an elite playmaker and all time defender. Who is the teams life force. Without him the Warriors have a bunch of quiet nice guys who any mom would love to date their daughter.      Draymond is who psychs Steph up, who holds KD in check and who anchors the defense.       Klay guards the other teams best player on most nights, he’s irreplaceable. You may be able to get a SG who is 70% of the shooter Klay is (Nick Young, Korver etc..) but you won’t find one who can defend at his level either, and if you replace him with a lockdown defender, he may shoot 32-35% from 3 (Roberson, Tony Allen, Wesley Mathews).       If the Warriors do the trade our lineup projected would be.   Steph Curry.    (Wes Mathews type).    Kevin Durant.   Jordan Bell.   Anthony Davis.       And while it would be tantalizing to have 3 frontcourt players all average over 2+ blocks, its not a better team than what they have now.       So I vote against it very much.      If anything I’d rather trade Durant for AD.    Steph.    Klay.    Iguodala.     Draymond.     Davis.       That’d be sexy.      But wouldn’t help our bankroll any.        "
Kevin Durant ruined nba parity. At least though the warriors will get old and there is an upside to seeing a team this entertaining play. 
Kevin Durant is a hoe ass 
That’s not true.  The amount of hate when Kevin Durant went to the Warriors from the in-laws in OKc was legendary.
"Man, poor team Lebron.   Looks like they wil just have to settle for Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Russel Westbrook and Kyrie Irving.   Damn that really sucks for them..."
Kevin Durant. Felt dirty rooting for him on the thunder.
"They didn't just recruit another all-star though, they recruited *Kevin Durant*, and this is when they already had a championship winning team. I mean I don't blame them though, the only person I don't like in this situation is KD. "
And this baby's defense will make me look like fucking Kevin Durant.

"Aldridge is the best if you wanna win a championship. He can give you enough rim protection and defense against the likes of lebron James and Kevin Durant while also being decent enough on the perimeter. He can still abuse smaller defenders inside with his post game and while he doesn't have the spacing horford or love does he still has good spacing with his elite mid range.   Horford next, he is defensively pretty great but against the elite teams he can be abused. He's been destroyed by lebron time and time again (not that many can say they haven't) and Durant, kawhi, harden etc aren't really deterred by him. Offensively he's better than aldridge with his distribution ability but in the playoffs id still rather have aldridges tough shot making and post game.   Love is the worst for a contender but the best for a bad team. No defense, but the offensive player of the bunch. Knock down shooting and spacing as well as elite rebounding. His defense will kill you tho against the elite teams"
Kevin Durant proves your statement wrong 
No but I wish Kevin Durant wasnt the biggest bitch in NBA history and stayed on his previous team that was more than capable of winning an NBA championship
&gt;the warriors are not going to get kevin durant. i really doubt we’re going to try and entertain any ideas of trades. it would be fucking stupid.
"Sure, whatever you say dude. People will forever see Kevin Durant as a scrub because he joined a basketball team that's fun to play with /s  Have you ever thought that maybe in 5 years, or 10 years, the culture in the NBA might change? What if it becomes normal to team-up as superstars attempt to challenge the warriors? Fans from that era would then reflect on KD's career in a different light. You have no foresight, is the problem. You're only capable of understanding waht is right in front of you. The NBA changes fast bud."
"I think it's somewhat of a false comparison though because individual players and more importantly superstar players aren't the same as NBA franchises. We value them and judge them on different merits. For players, the main parts of their brand are their success on the court, but also their personality, the way they conduct themselves on and off the court, etc. For most franchises we only judge them on the merits of whether or not they win. My point is that what Kevin Durant did was best for himself with respect to winning a championship, but it wasn't necessarily what was best for himself in terms of being a competitor and showing the competitive side of himself, something we greatly value in athletes. So while he did accomplish his goal of winning a championship, he definitely took the easy way out in doing it, and he is thus judged for it because that's not why we like watching sports. We judge franchises differently because there usually isn't an easy way out in the same way because for the franchises it's a zero sum game. You either win or you lose, so every other franchise is your competitor always; therefore, we only really judge them on the merits of winning or losing. If the franchise isn't maximizing its current and/or future potential to win, then it's failing.  TLDR: We respect franchises that win titles, but we respect players for a lot of different reasons. "
"Kevin ""Finals MVP but literally a role player"" Durant"
"Are we really going to use overall wins  in season as a way to prove/show which teams were good? Come on man.  The Warriors won 73 games, then added Kevin Durant, and won 5 less games the following year. That was obviously a better roster with Durant on it, still won 5 less games."
"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2734119-kevin-durant-admits-to-regretting-signing-with-warriors-at-first-due-to-backlash  There's your source. Also TY for the downvotes, guess you guys take criticism about as well as he does."
"Look man, obviously I dont know KD personally, I'm just a simple average plain old man but believe me when I say this...KD is not a snake or a SNEK or whatever everyone calls him. Maybe he had personal reasons to leave and it’s likely justified. But what do I know? I'm just a plain old average man and NOT NBA superstar Kevin Durant.  All I'm saying is before you hate on him look into it that's all. "
"A tall PG you say? If only the Jazz had a super high upside PG that was like... I don't know, 6'6"" or so?   Seriously, Exum's the answer there, probably. And even if he's not, Mitchell can play the 1 or the 2. His wingspan (6'10"") makes his height much less of an issue.   From [Cleaning the Glass](https://cleaningtheglass.com/midseason-review-marvin-bagley-iii/) this morning:   &gt;If we look at the 200+ players who measured at least 6-feet 9-inches barefoot at the Draft Combine in the last 16 years, there are 12 players who made the All-Star team at least once. If we sort this group by the ratio of their wingspan to their height, we find something startling.  &gt;Of the 50 players with the longest wingspans relative to their height we find 8 of those All-Stars: Andre Drummond, Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, DeAndre Jordan, Kevin Durant, Dwight Howard, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Brook Lopez. (Plus six more players who have started the majority of their career games played: Hassan Whiteside, Rudy Gobert, Nene, Brendan Haywood, Myles Turner, and Nikola Vucevic.)  &gt;Of the 50 players with the shortest wingspans relative to their height we find one All-Star (Chris Kaman) and three other players who started the majority of their career games (Mason Plumlee, Cody Zeller, and Troy Murphy)."
"I'm sorry, this sounds petty as fuck. Lots of fans endure losing seasons for years, much longer than OKC thunder fans, but it's still enjoyable. I mean, if it's so upsetting that you can't even forgive a professional athlete that you've never met and appears to (you know, in real life) be a great person, then why bother? You Oklahoma fans sure rallied around Joe Mixon when he hit that girl in the face, but you'll forever hold a grudge against Kevin Durant, who donated his own money to help tornado victims. SMH"
Right but what happens if you pull Lebron off the team? What happens if you pull kevin durant off the warriors? The warriors are still favorites in that scenario.
"Agree on everything. He tends to be critical of people on air and then when he brings them on as guests he completely changes his tune. With Kevin Durant  that is exactly what happened. He went above and beyond to kiss Kevin‘s ass. It was nauseating.  I understand that he now owns a company snd needs to be a company man, but he needs to have a balance. And what he did with Kevin Durant was over the top.  Then we all find that Kevin has multiple social media accounts and when Bill finds out he says absolutely nothing. Nothing."
I don't think I'm overreacting when I say that Kevin Durant ruined my life. 
"Okay, I see your point. Maybe Kevin Durant and Harrison Barnes aren't on the same level..."
"Celtics fans: Man I’m so torn up about IT being traded. He gave so much for this team. That was some legit loyalty playing after losing a family member.   Celtics fans 20 minuets later: Danny is a genius. We unloaded an injured system player for a superstar. Lmao he don’t deserve a 30 second tribute. We don’t love you like Paul little guy.   And don’t think I haven’t noticed the Cavs fans wanting to trade him. This guy is the most disrespected player in the league. Yes even worse than Kevin Durant.    100% of Celtics fans miss IT, but how many of them would undo the trade? It’s not just the teams that ain’t loyal."
Kevin Durant will make OKC champs
Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are tied with the greatest 3-1 chocking performance ever.
"Even in those finals, KD went for 31ppg on 55-39-84. The uptick in 3p% can be chalked up to growth and openness because fucking Kevin Durant is the third best shooter on the team. Basically LeBron at his peak did just a little bit better than 2017 LeBron did against KD. The only real difference is that KD had more open shots because of the offensive style and weapons. LeBron actually still did okay on one on one situations... there just weren't that many of them."
"Dude. This is the field goal percentage opposing players shoot when defended by a specific player.  Josh Richardson, Joel Embiid, Al Horford, and Kevin Durant are the 4 best in forcing lower % shots.  How is that garbage?"
"There's 10 seconds left in game 7 of the finals. No timeouts. You're down 1 point. Draymond is guarding the paint, mouth open, sweat pouring down his forehead. He's focused. ""Nobody is getting past me,"" he shouts, daring Ish Smith to drive against him. Ish falters at the threat. ""I... I can't do it,"" he says, defeated. Drummond has already fouled out. Tobias is busy doing the Milly Rock at half court—he is of no help. Avery Bradley is on defense even though the Pistons have the ball. So they all turn to Boban... he catches it at the top of the key... Draymond closes out on him... Too late, Boban is in position... he backs Draymond up in the post. ""Help me out!"" he cries to his Warriors. Klay won't help. He has forgotten the play. Steph gets open, but that's of little use on defense. Iggy is too sore and stays on the wing... age is hard. ""I will help!"" calls an eager JaVale on the sideline. He can't, though, as he is not in the game. That leaves Kevin Durant. He takes a step toward, Boban, contemplating. He is a defensive player of the year candidate. If he and Draymond double him, there is no way he can score. But a voice in his subconscious stops him. Learn, it tells Kevin. Learn from the best. So he watches, knowing history is being made. ""You can do it, dad!"" Jordan Bell says from the sideline, cheering Draymond on. He's right, Draymond tells himself. I don't need them. But he's wrong. Boban shoots 100% from 0 to 3 feet in the playoffs. Statistically, he can't miss. Pistons win. Boban is awarded Final MVP. Not Finals MVP, but Final MVP. Nobody after him will compare so this is the last one."

Then went to Memphis and in some way, traded Pau for the Marc in what was likely the same kind of deal he did with Divac and Kobe. Him and Mike Conley are the core that powered the grizzlies for the last 10 years.   Again with GSW he traded Monta and lead a rebuild around the Splash Bros(and secured Kevin Durant.   Jerry West has to be very active in the locker room to have this kind of influence on these teams and the players coming and going."
Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are under 30 and on the same team. There's zero reason to compete now.
"He may technically be more efficient, but that's with lower volume. Let's compare.   Curry for his career has a TS% of 62% and an eFG% of 57.8%, but he does this taking **16.9 FGA per game.**  Jordan, on the other hand, has a TS% of 63.3% for his career which is only 1.3% higher and a eFG% of 67.6% which is almost 10% higher (so I will give you that). However, he only attempts **5.6 FG a game.**   Basically, although the stats point to Jordan being more efficient by the numbers, he shoots a lot less than Curry does per game. The fact Curry can almost replicate his numbers at such a higher volume speaks a lot to his insane efficiency.   [A few snippets from this article](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-curry-is-the-revolution/):   &gt;Among players with more than 200 shots, Curry was only the fourth-most-efficient shooter on a shot-by-shot basis (behind Kyle Korver, DeAndre Jordan and Kevin Durant) **Yet Curry has more than 1,600 shots in that span, while none of the other three players has even half that. He has 371 total points added from shooting efficiency alone, with Korver in second place with 247.** Note that this doesn’t include additional value from free throws earned — which would probably make Curry’s advantage even greater (Curry has 416 made free throws in the period, compared to Kyle Korver’s 118).  Granted that article doesn't detail his full career, that should at least show you just how efficient Steph has become.  Lastly let's look at another efficiency stat: PER  Throughout his career, Jordan's PER is only 18.4. Steph, in comparison, has a career PER **23.8**. That's a pretty colossal difference.   In summary, there is a lot more to the efficiency story than just TS% and eFG% alone. "
"The Miami Heat started with a good roster and created a super team when Bosh and Lebron joined. There was no telling whether or not this team would function as expected and could've been a complete failure.   Kevin Durant joined what was already the best regular season team in history and had already proven that they had the ability to be the best team and get to the Western conference finals without KDz  It's like Wade, bosh and Lebron all worked on a group project together and were successful while Kevin Durant fucked around for a bit than joined a group that was already successful."
Did you not read the bit where he said mediocrity was ok? Especially for a team like Detroit that will never attract a LeBron James or Kevin Durant. For teams like this it's ok. The Grit and Grind era for the Grizzlies hasn't been a failure because we didn't win a chip or even make it to the finals. We won a lot of games had packed playoff crowd and most importantly had some damn good basketball to watch just because it wasn't in the finals doesn't make some of those games any less exciting to watch.
He’s very much a very poor like no prospect of food coming your way Kevin Durant. 
"&gt;well one of the main advantages the cavs had when they won in 2016 was offensive rebounding killing us.  &gt;  That, but the main thing the Cavs had in 2016, was some sort of unreal confidence. Not just because they had the best player in the world, but everyone in the Cavs thought they can really beat the Warriors, doesn't matter they won 73 games, they were sure they could beat them, because precious year in 2015, Cavs had no Love or Kyrie in the Finals, and LeBron alone almost beat them, dude was a monster. So they thought with a healthy team coming back for a rematch, they can definitely beat the Warriors, and they did.   &gt;  This year, it's not the same. Warriors didn't want a rematch, they went ahead and made a super team recruiting Kevin Durant, and hence last year despite LeBron averaging 33-12-10 on 56% shooting, series ended in 5, because Durant with this 73 win team is just that, quite unbeatable.   &gt;  So this year most Cavs don't even believe they can beat the Warriors. LeBron was a God last year, and the series ended in 5. How else can they beat this team? Plus their second best player is gone now, Isaiah is a horrible replacement. So they just don't have the same focus or confidence, and most people also believe LeBron is gone next summer LMAO so they all just lost. It's quite sad, not for LeBron, but the Cleveland organization because if LeBron leaves, they again going back to lottery. "
Kevin Durant goes to the next 73 win team.
Will LeBron James go to OKC next season to help them in a championship just like how Kevin Durant went to GSW?
Kevin Durant was on OKC?  Jk
"&gt;but I think if he plays Steph like this in 1-2 games over a series it could really help the Cavs.  There will be 1-2 games where Steph struggles in every single series that he plays against the Cavaliers or any team that dedicates their defensive scheme to getting the ball out of his hands. Look at game 4 last year. Look at several games in the 2016 and 2015 Finals. The Cavs do not need Bradley to prevent Curry from dominating them as a scorer when they already have the blueprint and throw the kitchen sink at him giving everyone else, including Kevin Durant, single coverage. At this point their more concerning issue is finding someone to defend Durant, and Bradley has limited defensive versatility (which is why the Celtics don't miss him at all right now defensively).   Curry scored 27 on 64% in the first clip with Bradley guarding him on the majority of those possessions and 29 on 47% in the second. I would not take those clips as being gospel for his ability to stop Curry or Irving or any elite guard without a ton of help behind him. "
"Kevin Durant, he was legit my favorite player and left for my least favorite team. Not my favorite anymore. "
I could see it. He’s improved every year (and his 3 point % has skyrocketed recently) and he has the drive for it. He’s very much a poor man’s Kevin Durant- which is pretty awesome relatively speaking 
Lance is Sheogorath confirmed  Kevin Durant is Boethiah
"To start, endorsements from the wealthy San Francisco/Silicon Valley area are going to be more than OKC. [The main thing is access.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/style/kevin-durant-silicon-valley-golden-state-warriors.html) Many Silicon Valley investors and company founders are Warriors fans (or bandwagoners). I figure being the best/second best player on the team is a great way to meet potential opportunities. Apparently Iguodala is invested into Facebook, Twitter, and Tesla too, so it isn't just great for stars."

"i don't understand how someone who gets paid to write about basketball and ask basketball questions can say it's a challenge to add someone like kevin durant. ""hey you won 72 games and then added a future hall of famer and one of the best players on the planet. that must have been like totally hard and challenging!"""
"Asking me to explain why LeBron is the best player in the world is like asking me to explain why the earth is round.  Its honestly just not worth my time.  If you think Steph Curry or Kevin Durant is better, then i congratulate you on having four top 20 players on your favorite team including the 2nd and 3rd best player in the league and I wish you the best."
"Blake, even when healthy, wasn't a franchise player like Lebron, Durant, Harden, Steph, Westbrook, etc are. At his best he is enough to be a very good #2 option on an NBA finals team, but more realistically he'll be a slightly better Kevin Love (in terms of impact, not playstyle) for a team.  edit: If he was a franchise player, then how do you explain the multiple disappointing postseasons despite having Chris Paul on his team? "
"Ummm every player in the league is ""available"" except like maybe 3 or 4.  Gianni's for Kevin Durant and Steph curry?"
"Worth it imo, for the shoes but also for the story.  “Yeah, Kevin Durant punched a ball into the stands and it hit me in the face.”"
"I remember one of Doris Burke's questions to Kerr right after GSW won the finals last year was something like ""You faced many challenges this year... including having to fit in Kevin Durant..."" and Kerr completely deflected that as a coaching challenge and basically repeated that when the players are this talented, they'll figure a lot of this out on their own."
I think with Lauri there almost literally isn't a better comparison. Like who is better? Rashard Lewis? Kevin Durant? Boogie? KAT? Porzingis? Turner? None of the good-great tall mobile guys who can shoot seem very much like Lauri. Dirk actually seems like an okay comparison.
Did Kevin Durant die? 
That'd be amazing. Showing Matt Barnes carrying on the we believe legacy and closing the book. All because Kevin Durant got hurt and they needed a rebounder. I'm so happy he got a ring. 
"I think the main argument against ejections is that fans paid a lot to see certain players.  I'm sure there were some that saved up money to go see LeBron play a few months ago only to see him play half the game because he was ejected for a bullshit reason.    I guess in same cases, like Kevin Durant getting ejected a million times this season, at least you still get to see Curry, Draymond or Klay.  But ejecting a player just because they strongly disagree with a call is lame to a lot of fans."
"I mean, if we could get Kevin Durant..."
Kevin Durant? No! He's the loyalest human ever! He won't ever join a superteam. Only snakes do that!
"Mark Jackson is one dimensional and overall a shit announcer. All he does is rotate the same 3 catch phrases. What really bugs me is how often he says 'you've gotta give X player credit... '  Like in the celts warriors games, he said we should give Kevin Durant credit for clearly fouling the player on a shot, throwing up his arms and getting ready to blow up at the ref, and then holding himself back. That doesn't deserve credit Mark, if anything it's discrediting to even start to blow up about the call. "
The Snake is a symbol of American History   Kevin Durant is one hell of a Patriot
"[Believe it or not, 34% is better than Durant, Melo and Wade’s rookie seasons] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Donovan+Mitchell&amp;player_id1_select=Donovan+Mitchell&amp;player_id1=mitchdo01&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y2=2008&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Carmelo+Anthony&amp;player_id3_select=Carmelo+Anthony&amp;y3=2004&amp;player_id3=anthoca01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Dwyane+Wade&amp;player_id4_select=Dwyane+Wade&amp;y4=2004&amp;player_id4=wadedw01&amp;idx=players)  "
"Well I believed I did when I mentioned Steph's off-ball threat but I shall elaborate further. We can begin with the personnel, guys like Draymond/Livingston/Iguodala. While other top teams like Cavs/Rockets/Raps/Blazers are stocking up on 3&amp;D guys the Warriors are utilizing playmakers. Normally a team's primary playmaker brings the ball up and the offensive motion starts, GSW is an anomaly in the sense their PG in Curry does not have the ball in his hands alot of the time. He pulls defenses apart off the ball which I said is one of his all-time great skills that no one can replicate and because GSW built around this they can plug in any playmaker in while Steph does his thing.   While touching on that, we can talk about how GSW modernize the small ball game. The delicate nature of the small ball lineup means you have to control and play with pace, which goes back to my point of them having the #1 pace with Steph and #14 without.  Kevin Durant as great of a player he is, and don't get me wrong he is a fantastic 2-way player and an offensive juggernaut. However given all the skills he has, he absolutely CANNOT replicate what Steph does for the Warrior's system. His off-ball threat is just not the same as Steph's. I mean, the Warriors won 73 games in the RS with Harrison Barnes in the place of Kevin Durant. KD CHOSE to play in Steph's system. You can see the difference when the Warriors are without Steph and without KD, that's how I quantify most important. In terms of being the best, KD is just an overall more complete player than Steph there's no denying that."
Kevin Durant is actually a sleeper cell. He’s gonna rip off his jersey to travel a Thunder shirt underneath. He’s been on contract with them the whole time.  So don’t worry Jazz takes it in 4
"You mean you fan't survive with Kevin ""2nd best player in the NBA"" Durant and won?"
"You know what, fuck this argument. I don't have a problem with people saying he shouldn't be MVP, but fuck outta here with it being the only factor. Oklahoma was pretty much the worst team in the league with him off the floor, and he had one of the best clutch seasons anyone has ever had. Combine that with Kevin Durant leaving, and he could very well have won the mvp if he got 9 rebounds instead of 10"
"Crazy, because.... We literally have KD. KEVIN FREAKING DURANT. And we still lose. Nuts. "
"I know it's kind of pointless to compare now that they're on the same team, but I never saw how that was even much of a debate. Curry lead his team to the best record ever before Durant joined.  The fact that Kevin fucking Durant joined a team and *wasn't* the face of that team's franchise speaks volumes. "
You forgot Kevin Durant.
"""Kevin Durant needs to be getting more hate"". Just stop right there fam you already got my upvote"
"The problem with how people rate Curry is they knock him imaginary points for not looking like he should be an elite basketball player.  Kevin Durant looks like he's a better basketball player than Curry, so people say he is.  Daryl Morey goes over this in the Undoing Project (Marc ""Man Boobs"" Gasol) and how judging people based on whether they fit our image of an elite basketball player messes up evaluations."
"The Kevin Durant approach...a bold strategy Cotton, let's see if it pays off for him"
"The problem is any time you try to point out that Stephen Curry is the best player on here, Kevin Durant and/or his business manager friend get on here with their alt accounts and brigade the crap out of you."
Great. Our Kevin Durant defender and 3&amp;D guy just dislocated his shoulder again. 
"It amazes me how everyone paraphrases this interview, but somehow his answer slightly more dickish each time.    When they asked if any other rookies ""caught his attention"",  he shook his head and said “I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That’s where I want to be. I think for me, that’s what I love to watch.”  Him saying he doesn't follow other rookies and only watches superstars is a lot different than dogging the other rookies.  "
"It was nice of the Jazz to allow the Warriors G league team to play them in their final home game of the season, that Kevin Durant kid looks like he could be special!!"
"Thats the coaches fault then. KD arguably has a bigger gravity than curry since hes the better player. Of course the teams gonna falter without your franchise player. However, when you have Kevin fucking Durant, you shouldnt be losing to Utah by 30 unless youre tanking lol"
Kevin Durant is seriously considering joining the Jazz this offseason. 
"Seriously dude, introspection. Read the damn quote. Simmons was asked if any other rookies had caught his attention. He said none had. **he never mentioned Mitchell, nor any other rookie.** All he said is that he watches the greats, not other rookies.  People made it into a diss at Mitchell because Mitchell is the 2nd best rookie this year, but Ben Simmons didn’t say a single damn thing about Mitchell.  For someone who has literally no idea what you’re talking about, you’re really full of yourself. Can you be a big enough person to admit you were wrong, or are you going to continue obliviously insulting me like I’m the one out of my depth?  “None,” Simmons responded promptly. “I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That’s where I want to be. I think for me, that’s what I love to watch.”"
Kevin Durant seems to be thoroughly jingled

"Ben's comments were taken out of context.  EDI: This is the full quote (same thing he said before the season):  ""None,"" Simmons told ESPN. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like (Kevin Durant), (LeBron James), (Stephen) Curry, Russell (Westbrook). Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch."""
Top 2 NBA player Kevin Durant can't get em looks? 
"I mean they aren't playing their best but let's not act like Kevin Durant didn't just try super hard two games ago and go off for 41 points.   They definitely care, especially when they're playing playoff teams they might have to play for 7 games in a week. "
Kevin “Kevin” Durant
What is Kevin Durant doing lol ? I guess it’s a lot easier to back up Steph Curry than to do the heavy lifting yourself. He’s mentally checked out 
Lol at Kevin Durant locking any fucking thing down in the 2018 NBA season.
"Steph Curry is  better than Kevin Durant at basketball. KD’s only value is neutralizing LeBron’s production in the Finals. Other than that, he seems to have no extraordinary value on this team. "
Imagine still thinking Kevin Durant is better than Steph. 
Yeah he said it on the Bill Simmons and Kevin Durant podcast ep. #65
Kevin Durant disagrees
"Kevin Durant shot below 30% from 3 in his rookie season; Lonzo's form isn't MKG level busted, he'll grow into a more consistent and confident shooter in time. "
"Your arguments aren't bad, but the original scenario is two max contracts for Jordan and B Jordan.  All I'm saying is that with zone defense one Jordan isn't as good as both LeBron James and Kevin Durant combined, or really any other pairing of two max contract superstars.  Like whatever you run with MJ + 4 role players could be better run with LBJ + KD + 3 role players."
Maybe because he witnessed the professor swat a Kevin durant jumpshot and maintain one of the highest defensive win shares among guards in the entire league in only his second season ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
"Even twenty years from now it will blow people’s minds that Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden were all on the same team in their early 20’s"
Kevin Durant is mesmerizing the way he can score anywhere 
Dude im talking about last years playoffs wtf lol. That warriors team with curry as the main option with a slumping thompson wouldnt have beat the cavs without kevin durant. 
Kevin Durant was a surprise guest at Hoopfest in Spokane last year too. He's universally loved in Washington as far as I know.
I see your Kevin Durant flair. I’m curious because I had a taken a break from basketball when he was drafted...what did people think of him when he played for Seattle?
kevin durant
Picking up Kevin Durant on a basketball team is a smart move... go figure lol 
"Yeah actually Jordan Clarkson is just as good as Steph, we just don't want anyone to figure it out yet. And try to tell me Cedi isn't every bit as good as Kevin Durant"
"You should re-read the article.  They didn't ask which rookies whose accomplishments he was ""aware of"".  They asked which rookies caught his attention.    ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be.

Zero % chance he hasn't noticed donovan and what he is doing "
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there. Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy."" My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."
I mean the Warriors still have Kevin Durant.... not like they're some scrubs without Curry. And idk why you would be worried the Rockets aren't losing 4 games to the Wolves

It's exactly as I'd have thought -- LeBron mentally goes AWOL when the situation is the most dire, which is precisely the reason why clutch FT's (for which, if one is behind, definitionally one must ""make to tie"") are so difficult for him.  As an aside, I'll throw you a (small) bone: for the postseason stats above, Kevin Durant is 1/8 (so he's even worse).  But I would have *suspected he was mentally weak in that scenario as well*."

I don't think it has to be considered a slam on Mitchell, Believe me, as a diehard Mitchell fan I'd defend the shit outta that if I sensed any shade. I just think his comment is a byproduct of thinking big picture/long term/historical greatness. And good for him.  I honestly think anyone interpreting Ben as having any sort of beef with Mitchell is just looking for a fight."
Good point. Let's get rid of him; anyone in the market for a slightly used Kevin Durant?

I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""**  Nobody asked him what other rookies he likes or thinks are good.  They asked him which rookies ""caught his attention"" and he responded saying none because he follows the greats, since that's where he wants to be someday.  That's a perfectly acceptable answer and isn't dogging DM or any other rookies.  Ppl will play that narrative, but it's a stretch. "
"Calm your shit.  It's sports man.  When we say we hate someone or that someone is a dick, it's just superficial judgment.  Like when someone says ""I hate Kevin Durant,"" they don't mean they literally hate him as a person and wish him ill, they're commenting within the bounds of the sport.  I'm not saying that Ben is a bad guy deep down, or even a dick personally.  I'm just making one-off comments on interviews I've seen.   So save me the treatise on us not knowing him well enough to judge him.  If you've ever talked shit on any professional athlete ever, you've violated your own preachy principle.  But nevertheless, you know this is where to get upvotes so you're gonna mine for upvotes.  "
[Kevin Durant feels the same way](https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/sports/kevin-durant-thoughts-simmons-vs-161651181.html) 
"You get that it's largely an act right? Like if Skip hated Kevin Durant Shannon would ""love"" him."
"""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like (Kevin Durant), (LeBron James), (Stephen) Curry, Russell (Westbrook). Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch."""
"&gt; ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like (Kevin Durant), (LeBron James), (Stephen) Curry, Russell (Westbrook). Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  INB4 the circlejerk  This is the mindset he should have.."
kevin durant isnt a leader. He couldnt lead a horse to water.
"What the hell happened to Kevin Durant, he was so likable. Even in his last few years in OKC he started turning into a miserable ass. I feel like he says shit just to say it. I also wouldn’t mind never hearing him talk again, he brings nothing new or original to the table. "
"Yeah, that guy Kevin Durant sure played like a scrub when he was teammates with Westbrook. Steven Adams would be the white Shaq if it wasn’t for Westbrook. Andre Roberson would probably shoot 75% from 3 if he didn’t play with that ball hog"
"Similar impact sure, but in my mind a player like Kevin Durant with the supporting cast and coaching he has access to should be able to get a chip no problem.  So perhaps its more a reflection on KD than the Warriors.   In my thinking we're going to see an insanely motivated KD in these playoffs. "
"Is it really *that* much more unlikely than Kevin Durant joining the 73 win team that had already won a title without him and had beaten him in that season's WCF?  I mean, we agree that Boston is the best fit for basketball purposes right? No place has perfect health guarantees, so Kyrie-Hayward-Tatum-LeBron-Baynes (with the opportunity to move the Kings and Memphis picks for another player) is the best situation for him. It's also the best coaching situation LeBron will ever have been in, considering Stevens is the best tactician in the game and his guys play fewer minutes per game than most starters do in the league (thereby reducing the wear and tear on LeBron).   Yeah I know I'm probably wasting my time but there's realistically no better fit outside of Golden State. As a legacy play raising Banner 18 in Boston would be the 2nd most significant title in modern NBA history (behind only LeBron raising a banner in Cleveland).  I could go on, but you get the idea."
LMA deserves first team forward over Kevin Durant and Lebron deserves MVP don’t @ me
"Even that’s out of context though  &gt;""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  He’s saying he’s not looking at other rookies; he’s looking at the best players in the league as his peers. Probably not worded in the most elegant way possible, but I love the mindset."
"""Fuck analytics, watch a game blog boi"" - Kevin Durant"
"This is arguably the second Process that worked in the last decade.  The 2006-07 Sonics finished 31-51 with a veteran roster that included high-paid guys like Ray Allen, Rashard Lewis, Danny Fortson, and Luke Ridnour. They responded by getting rid of almost all their significant veterans, drafting Kevin Durant 2nd overall, and trading Ray Allen for 5th overall pick Jeff Green. They played Durant out of position at SG (at 6'9"", 240 lbs) his entire rookie season to develop his ball skills, but also to tank further, finished 20-62, and drafted Russell Westbrook (one of the most raw but highest-ceiling prospects) 4th overall the next year. Then they finished 23-59 and drafted James Harden. During this whole period, the Sonics/Thunder made virtually no efforts to sign any impact veterans, and ended up with three generational talents.  I stopped paying attention at that point, but I assume those guys played together for many years and won a few championships."
"Not trying to start something, but I don’t think you can say Mitchell has a higher ceiling. Tatum is 6”9’ and still growing, has an extremely impressive offensive skill set, and has one of the highest 3 point percentages in the league. His defense also has a ton of potential, I really think Tatum’s ceiling is a Kevin Durant like player. If you think Mitchell has a higher ceiling than a Kevin Durant then that’s fine, but even speculating for either one of these guys is pointless. They’re both really, really good for just rookies. Can’t wait to see how their careers pan out."
"**All-NBA First Team**  * Guard: James Harden, Houston Rockets * Guard: Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers * Forward: LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers * Forward: Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors * Center: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans  The five players from my MVP ballot fit nicely here. Stephen Curry and Chris Paul could’ve gotten Lillard’s spot, but both played less than 60 games. Giannis Antetokounmpo missed out on a first team forward spot only because of the brilliance of James and Durant, while Joel Embiid wasn’t good enough this season to outdo Davis for the first team center spot.  **All-NBA Second Team**  * Guard: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors * Guard: Chris Paul, Houston Rockets * Forward: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks * Forward: LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs * Center: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers  Curry, Paul, Antetokounmpo and Embiid were all obvious selections for the second team, leaving just one forward spot up for grabs. That went to Aldridge, who has been outstanding for San Antonio, keeping the Spurs in the playoff hunt despite only having Kawhi Leonard for nine games due to his bizarre, season-long quad issues.  **All-NBA Third Team**  * Guard: Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder * Guard: DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors * Forward: Paul George, Oklahoma City Thunder * Forward: Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves * Center: Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz  Westbrook is close to averaging another triple-double, while DeRozan has been the engine of a Raptors team that could win 60 games. George and Butler were the clear choices as third-team forwards, with the NBA thankfully changing Butler’s eligibility from guard only to guard/forward, alleviating a very difficult task of trying to find a sixth forward worth including.  The final spot came down to Karl-Anthony Towns or Gobert, the league’s best offensive and defensive centers, respectively. By the slimmest of margins, Gobert gets the nod.  **All-Defensive First Team**  * Guard: Jrue Holiday, New Orleans Pelicans * Guard: Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers * Forward: Al Horford, Boston Celtics * Forward: Paul George, Oklahoma City Thunder * Center: Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz  Gobert, the defensive player of the year, was an easy choice, and sliding Horford over to forward makes for two of those. Holiday and Oladipo make their teams massively better when they are on the court (Indiana is 7.3 points per 100 possessions better with Oladipo out there and New Orleans is a full nine points per 100 possessions better when Holiday plays). George gets the final spot — both because he’s a great defender and as a nod to Andre Roberson, who was on pace to be the league’s best defensive player before suffering a season-ending knee injury.  **All-Defensive Second Team**  * Guard: Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves * Guard: Dejounte Murray, San Antonio Spurs * Forward: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans * Forward: Robert Covington, Philadelphia 76ers * Center: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers  Minnesota has struggled on defense all season long, but would be completely lost without Butler (they are 7.4 points per 100 better defensively with him on the court). Murray, on the other hand, made a real impact in his second season, and first as a starter. Covington is the prototypical “3-and-D” player, and Davis is simply a monster. Embiid was the automatic choice as the second-team center.  **All-Rookie First Team**  1. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers 2. Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz 3. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics 4. Lauri Markkanen, Chicago Bulls 5. Kyle Kuzma, Los Angeles Lakers  Simmons, Mitchell and Tatum were automatics. Markkanen has exceeded just about everyone’s expectations in Chicago, looking like the foundational piece the team hoped he’d be. Kuzma has predictably cooled off after his hot start, but still has been a gem of a find as a late-first rounder.  **All-Rookie Second Team**  1. John Collins, Atlanta Hawks 2. Lonzo Ball, Los Angeles Lakers 3. Dennis Smith, Jr., Dallas Mavericks 4. Bogdan Bogdanovic, Sacramento Kings 5. Bam Adebayo, Miami Heat  Trying to fill out the all-rookie second team is always a challenge, but this year was easier than most thanks to a deep class. Collins has emerged as a long-term rotation piece in Atlanta. Ball — despite all of the noise surrounding him — has actually contributed to winning as a rookie point guard, which is hard to do. Smith had an encouraging year in Dallas, where he’s been given the reins as the future of the franchise. Bogdanovic has been Sacramento’s best player, while Adebayo has shown the supreme athletic tools that will likely make him Hassan Whiteside’s successor in the middle in Miami.  edit: formatting"
"**Most Valuable Player**  1. James Harden, Houston Rockets 2. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 3. Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans 4. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers 5. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors  Harden goes wire-to-wire in this race, and will be a fully deserving MVP after finishing as a runner-up twice in the past three years. There has been a late push from James and some voters that he should be the pick for what would be a fifth time.  James had his chance to take control of the race when Harden went down with a hamstring injury on Dec. 31. Instead, January wound up one of the worst months of his career, the Cavaliers subsequently imploded and eventually swapped out nearly half their roster at the trade deadline. That simply can’t be ignored, nor should it be considered a positive even though the Cavaliers are better for making the trades.  As for the rest of the ballot, Davis edges out Lillard for third because of his contributions at both ends. Fifth place could go in a few directions — including toward Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo — but Durant gets the nod for helping lead the Warriors to near 60 wins despite the team’s myriad injuries.  **Defensive Player of the Year**  1. Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz 2. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers 3. Al Horford, Boston Celtics  Gobert has been the NBA’s best defensive player this season. The only debate is whether he’s played enough games to edge out the league’s second best defender, Embiid. But that was before Embiid’s recent orbital bone fracture, which knocked him out for the final few games of the regular season. The difference thus became negligible, paving the way for Gobert to win. Horford gets the nod in third for being the linchpin of Boston’s defense, the NBA’s best this season.  **Rookie of the Year**  1. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers 2. Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz 3. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics  One of the year’s most contentious races. Simmons and Mitchell look like future superstars, and both are deserving. But Simmons gets the nod for how he’s played down the stretch — including a triple-double in Friday’s thrilling victory over the Cavaliers — helping the 76ers to what should be the third seed in the East. Tatum gets third place due to his contributions in Boston.  **Sixth Man of the Year**  1. Lou Williams, Los Angeles Clippers 2. Eric Gordon, Houston Rockets 3. Fred Van Vleet, Toronto Raptors  Williams and Gordon are closer to starters than bench players, but since they qualify they are atop this list. Williams gets the nod for his brilliant play with the Clippers, who he helped stay in the West playoff race until a loss to Denver Saturday. Van Vleet gets third place for his role as the leader of Toronto’s brilliant second unit, the NBA’s best this season.  **Coach of the Year**  1. Brad Stevens, Boston Celtics 2. Quin Snyder, Utah Jazz 3. Dwane Casey, Toronto Raptors  This was, by a significant margin, the toughest race to figure out. There are eight legitimate candidates: Stevens, Snyder, Casey, Philadelphia’s Brett Brown, Indiana’s Nate McMillan, Portland’s Terry Stotts, San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich and Houston’s Mike D’Antoni. A case can be made for all of them.  Stevens gets it, though, for the way he’s helped the Celtics to 50-plus wins despite losing Gordon Hayward five minutes into the season, and Kyrie Irving after just 60 games. Snyder is second for turning a rookie (Mitchell) into the focal point of his offense who led the Jazz to a top-four playoff spot in the West, while Casey is third for guiding the Raptors from one style of play to another with largely the same personnel, an extremely difficult task.  **Most Improved Player**  1. Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers 2. Andre Drummond, Detroit Pistons 3. Spencer Dinwiddie, Brooklyn Nets  Oladipo will almost certainly be the unanimous winner given that he went from being an awkward-fitting sidekick to Russell Westbrook in Oklahoma City to an all-star in Indiana. Drummond gets second for his all-around improvement — including his stunning turnaround at the free throw line — while Dinwiddie is third after transforming from a fringe NBA player entering the season to a surefire rotation player in Brooklyn.  "
Especially when that pick could have been Kevin Durant.
"How in the world are you arguing that a rookie has a better legacy than Kevin Durant, I believe Lonzo will turn out to be a great player but KD is one of the best scorers of all time.    You can’t just say “oh well player X is on the way to a long career with multiple championships so he’s better than an established superstar and MVP” just because that super star switched teams.    We don’t know what’s going to happen in Lonzo’s career and I hope he becomes the star your team is looking for, but for now he doesn’t belong in the same conversation as KD, take your homer glasses off for a second and be real."
"Darkest timeline is LeBron and Kevin Durant join up somewhere. If Harden wins a ring, that is a major boost to the Houston economy. He is going to drop crazy fat stacks at every strip club in the area. Houston needs that money to be recirculated. It might not be your favorite timeline, but really, it's for the greater good"
"[“Hey Kevin Durant, did anyone in your whole life playing basketball did they ever make you feel that you needed to work harder than them and they acted they were better just to make you feel a better player and be a better player?”](https://youtu.be/rUp5isyJb4g) "
"Kevin Durant.   Every time his name is mentioned you'll see a million snake references. And the other day people actually said and upvoted a guy saying Curry is a better defender than KD.   The next 4 is probably Harden, Zaza, Draymond, and Westbrook. "
Bro they were playing in the last olympics and shut down everyone when they became serious. Paul George and Kevin Durant terrified Serbia and Serbia is the absolute best of euro ball the past three years now. Your funny if you think it was ever close .
I'm Kevin Durant but I'm a 15 year old girl and I suck at basketball
how long will kevin durant warriors last?
"Excuses excuses, they had so many stars pass through.  If only they had a Kevin Durant....  If only they had a James Harden...  Oladipo would make such a great addition...  Paul George and Melo now.. Ffs son, the problem is westbrook."
"Yeah, they tried to make that on a ""who has had the best career"" and cut off people with short careers because of that. Using the data I collected last year, the current VORP leaders that are active players (this may be a bit off as it's last years data) is:  * Lebron James * HUGE DROPOFF * Chris Paul * Dirk Nowitzki * Dwyane Wade * Vince Carter * Pau Gasol * Russell Westbrook * Kevin Durant * Manu Ginobili * Andre Iguodala * Stephen Curry  So Manu is probably one of the bigger steals of the century.  edit: overperforming starting 5:  * SG - Manu (VORP as of 2017: 46.8, pick 57) - 1999 - 30th overall in VORP/Game * PF - Paul Millsap (VORP as of 2017:33.5, pick 47) - 2006 - 47th overall in VORP/Game * PG - Kyle Lowry (VORP as of 2017: 31.5, pick 24) - 2006 - 37th overall in VORP/Game  * SF - Kawhi Leonard (VORP as of 2017: 25.6, pick 15) - 2011 - 13th overall in VORP/Game * C - Marc Gasol (VORP as of 2017: 31.2, pick 48) - 2007 - 23rd overall in VORP/Game  This being said Nikola Jokic should probably be there at C instead (VORP as of 2018: 13.7, pick 41) - 2014 - 17th overall in VORP/Game (2017) or maybe even Rudy Gobert (VORP as of 2018: 15, pick 27) - 2013 - 34th overall in VORP/Game (2017)  edit 2: definitely a case for jimmy G buckets as well (VORP as of 2018: 23, pick 30) - 2011 - 25th overall in VORP/Game"
"I hate you, Kevin Durant."
really? You're going to get caught up on whether Draymond or KD is the 4 when its irrelevant to the rest of the statement.   I'm not going to put 33 year old Paul Millsap and Wilson Chandler in the same discussion as Draymond Green and Kevin Durant
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there. Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy."" My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."
"Except he wants his son to model his game after Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant, so I dunno if that is really accurate."
Kevin Durant should leave in free agency this summer. He can’t win with those cats.  /s
"Kevin ""beta"" Durant "
&gt; I feel like most people who complain about him would defend him if he played for their team.  Without a doubt. In that sense he’s like Kevin Durant. I absolutely love that he’s on my team but I also realize why everyone else isn’t into him. He’s efficient but not entertaining (then there’s all the snake stuff). What gets on my nerves is Harden fans that either don’t admit or don’t realize why other people don’t like him. 
[Kevin Durant is pretty much smack dab in the middle of qualified players in AST/TO ratio in clutch time this season](https://stats.nba.com/players/clutch-advanced/?sort=AST_TO&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=FGA*G*40&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)
"They have already made rules specifically to deter Harden. That is just a false statement.  Watching guys whose primary strategy is to get to the line is bad basketball. It isn't entertaining, and it is something that's already on their radar.   I mean just look at the big picture. Harden should be revered in NBA circles like Lebron James or Kevin Durant or Steph Curry but he isn't yet. That isn't cultivating a star. It's creating an enigma and it's bad for the league all around."
"'The MVP should embody the spirit of the game and live by a creed that includes good sportmanship, honor, and integrity' sorry but in a league where Kevin Durant joins a team comprised of already 3 all stars and other noticeable antics like the reffing shit show of this year, what is the point of saying that? Of course we all know Le' perfect'bronsexman is an honourable and charitable man who gives to the people, but that doesn't mean shit when it comes to the MVP.   Don't say that when you're a fucking Atlanta Hawks fan, James has done more for this city than anyone from your team, he is an asset both on and off the court and will win the MVP, so just deal with it mate. "
"Harrison Barnes: 7 finals game wins  Kevin Durant: 5 finals game wins  Now I ain't sayin KD is a pussy ass bitchboi cupsnake, I'm just sayin, facts are facts."
I mean he's Kevin Durant and this is like his ninth year in the league he really doesn't need to do shit
"Because they took their 73 win core of Curry, Klay, Barnes, Green, Bogut, Iggy, Livingston and replaced Barnes and Bogut with kevin durant and David West "
"lol, dude.   you said you ended duncan’s career. that’s two years ago. i said i feel like something has changed since then (again, since you’re from oklahoma: 2 seasons ago) regarding the makeup of your team. namely, losing a player named Kevin Durant.   how did you not get that....it was so obvious 😂"

"Yeah, you're right, he hasn't had ""shooters""; he's had to make do with Steven Adams being everything he could possibly ask for from a center, Roberson who despite being a poor shooter has played up to his contract through defense, a front office that finagled their way into expensive trades for Paul George and Carmelo Anthony to try something new, as well as James Harden, Victor Oladipo, and Kevin Durant.  Westbrook's had so much talent come and go around him I don't think it's reasonable to say that he hasn't been successful because his team couldn't get him the right kind of guys (shooters). "

"Old guys on my local radio station don't think there's a chance in hell that Kevin Durant is better than Bird, or that LeBron will ever be better than MJ.   They also said that MJ would've won 8 straight if he never retired.  Those types of people aren't going to be reasoned with via stats or the like, they're only using emotions and nostalgia in their reasoning ."
"I only see NBA since 2013, so i will do a starting lineup since that.   By personal taste:  Russell Westbrook, Khris Middleton, Klay Thompson, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid  By quality:  Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Lebron James, Anthony Davis"
PG: Steph Curry. SG: Michael Jordan. SF: Kevin Durant. PF: Tim Duncan. C: Hakeem Olajuwon.  I think this also makes sense from a chemistry perspective. Eg obviously LeBron is a better 3 than Durant but I think the egos wouldn't quite work out. 
Because they won 73 games then added kevin Durant 
It’s dumb to suggest that the team who has Kevin Durant and Steph Curry is going to win the series pretty easily? Ok...
"Darko? I think Yao was more hyped, but I think people thought Darko was going to be what Kevin Durant ended up being. A 6'10"" guy who could drain 3s and beat you off the bounce."

Kerr turned the Golden State Warriors into the greatest regular season team of all time. It was his coaching that took a non contending low playoff seed and turned it into an unstoppable juggernaut. He did this before Kevin Durant. I don’t know how he is untested. 
Klay also plays next to Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry the second and third best players in the world. Put lilard next to lebron I’m sure his efficiency takes a jump as well. Klay is great and plays his role to a T but he isn’t better than lilard

[Kevin Durant's college stats](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/kevin-durant-1.html)  [Beasley's college stats](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/michael-beasley-1.html)
"you’re crazy, dude.   You’re acting like the Warriors were some 5 seed who needed a league MVP to become contenders. Of course adding KD made their team stronger, but it’s not like the 73-9 Warriors *needed* prime Kevin Durant to win a championship(s) "
If Paul Pierce and Kevin Durant had a kid Tatum would come out.
Same can be said about Kevin Durant And Golden State. KD consisteny shitted on the Warriors
"Eh it's not really fair to compare help  after 2010, he was past his prime at that point. Bynum was a nonfactor in 2008, and Pau is essentially Kevin Love with less shooting and more post game. Plus Wade was still a great second option until 2014. With Love+Kyrie+elite shooters Lebron had probably the best perimeter offense help until 2017 when Durant went to GS. Again, check the win record"
Kevin Durant will look better against the Cavs than Celtics.
"LeBron had shit help before he left Cleveland.  Kobe had shit help after Shaq left until Gasol arrived.  In terms of who has had more stacked teams, it definitely has to be LeBron.  LeBron has lost more times in stacked teams than Kobe has btw.  Kobe lost once (in a stacked team) against the Pistons. His other finals loss was against a stacked team.  Still losses, I'm just mentioning it for comparison reasons.  LeBron lost twice while being part of a stacked team, once against the Mavericks and once against the Spurs. His team in Cleveland post-""i'm coming home"" was also stacked, but so were the Warriors.  So if you want to hold 1 loss (pre-kevin durant) against him or not, it's up to you. But it's still a loss against the Mavericks and against the Spurs.    People like to say Kobe's team from 2008-2010 was stacked.  It wasn't.  It was simply enough for Kobe to contend with.  Pau was great. One of the greatest international players.  That said, he's not better than Kyrie or Wade.  At best, he's Kevin Love quality.    If you want a comparison, Kobe's teams from 2008-2010 are what Lebron's team is today.    Kobe=Lebron Pau= Love   Everyone else under that is comparable in terms of quality to someone in the other team.  "
" Draymond may've had best FG % allowed but not best points allowed per possession. Reason being he fouled LeBron more and allowed 38% from three. More importantly since '13 (as far as NBA Stats site goes back), he only averaged 9.3 possessions defending LeBron per game. Iguodala defended LeBron the most of the Warriors at 33.4 possessions per game, likely because he has the speed to keep up with Bron on the perimeter.  [There was a post yesterday that detailed how  well several known premier  wing defenders did vs LeBron including Green, Kawhi, PG13 and Morris,](https://ps.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8izkxn/oc_how_marcus_morris_and_other_top_wing_defenders/) and from points allowed per possession (he used per 40) it's actually Morris, Kawhi and Butler who stand out, allowing the least. Kawhi arguably did best in limiting him from both shot attempts and assists to teammates (Cavs likely going to Kyrie amd others more often), and Morris and Butler best at limiting him on the perimeter. Note LeBron was 0-3 last night when defended by Morris (0-5 in total), improving all-time to just 20% from three.  #Points Per 40 Possessions  Team | Defender | POSS | PTS | ASTS | TOVS | BLKD | FGM | FGA | FG% | 3PM | 3PA | 3P% | FLD :-:|:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: [](/TOR) | OG Anunoby | 40 | 15.4 | 4.6 | 0.9 | 0.0 | 6.1 | 10.9 | .560 | 0.4 | 1.7 | .250 | 1.2 [](/GSW) | Draymond Green | 40 | 15.4 | 3.6 | 2.1 | 0.2 | 6.2 | 13.7 | .450 | 1.4 | 3.6 | .381 | 1.7 [](/GSW) | Kevin Durant | 40 | 14.2 | 4.1 | 2.2 | 0.4 | 5.5 | 10.5 | .519 | 1.2 | 2.9 | .405 | 1.2 [](/GSW) | Andre Iguodala | 40 | 13.9 | 3.5 | 2.2 | 0.2 | 5.3 | 11.0 | .480 | 1.1 | 3.0 | .369 | 1.7 [](/OKC) | Paul George | 40 | 13.2 | 3.2 | 1.7 | 0.0 | 5.0 | 9.4 | .531 | 0.7 | 2.0 | .321 | 1.2  [](/MIN) | Jimmy Butler | 40 | 12.3 | 4.2 | 2.0 | 0.3 | 5.1 | 11.0 | .464 | 0.6 | 2.3 | .273 | 1.0 [](/SAS) | Kawhi Leonard | 40 | 11.8 | 3.0 | 2.0 | 0.0 | 4.0 | 8.0 | .495 |  1.2 | 2.2 | .552 | 1.8 [](/BOS) | Marcus Morris | 40 | 11.6 | 4.0 | 1.7 | 0.0 | 4.8 | 10.0 | .480 | 0.5 | 2.4 | .214 | 1.6  "
"But you're bandwagoning a team with Draymond ""Nutcracker"" Green, Zaza ""Anklebreaker"" Pachulia and Kevin ""the hardest road"" Durant?"
"Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Stef Curry"
I can't believe Kevin Durant is making me root for Houston. I'm excited and so ready to be let down.
"What about that ""death lineup"" GS has had for virtually four years now, formerly with Harrison Barnes and now with Kevin Durant."
I picture Wilt as Kevin Durant playing against 5 Isiah Thomas's. 
"A group of students sits in a classroom, murmuring to each other. Most are dressed in athletic wear, while one student pokes holes into his OKC Kevin Durant jersey in the back corner with an extra sharp pencil. A few students sit at the very front, on the edge of their chair.  The door bursts open. The first thing the students can see is a black, glorious beard. The beard is followed by a tall man wearing a Rockets #13 uniform.  Harden: Today, class, you're about to learn the most important lesson in your college careers.    *A student raises his hand in the front row, bursting to yell*    Harden: Yes?    Eager Student: How to tip strippers?!    *The classroom scoffs at him; a few chuckle*    Harden: That was last week's class. Keep up, young one. No, today, I am going to teach you an art form so secret that no other player has been able to replicate: the flop.    Brainy Student: Is that also known as the Skilled Tumble?    Harden: Too many syllables. Too lazy for that shit. We'll stick with the flop. NOW.....    *Steph Curry sits jubilant outside of the classroom door peeking in*    Harden: I brought a guest with me today to demonstrate how to not flop. Come on in!    *Marcus Smart starts to walk through the door, but it catches his back heel. He launches into the air, almost looking as if to perform a graceful swam dive. When he reaches the apex of the jump, he begins to flail and allows a grimace to wear on his face. He groans with the might of an ox in heat. He goes sprawling into three students and their desks, as pencils, notebooks, and shoes fly into the air.*    *The students gasp, surprised and worried about their classmates.*    Harden, yelling over the commotion: They're alright, they're alright! But could you see what was wrong with that ish?    *Students look left and right, waiting for their peers to speak up.*    Harden: No one? Then let me show you.    *Steph begins to hop up and down, holding his hands together near his smiling mouth*    *Harden grabs a basketball from his desk chair, and begins to do a flurry of hesitation and crossover moves, before driving to the middle of the classroom. Suddenly, a rope drops from the ceiling with a light, red ball near Harden's path. Harden picks up the dribble with his right hand while he uses his left arm to hook the rope. The hooking causes the ball to flail into Harden's path, bumping him lightly. Harden adorns a facial grimace and flails, like his flailfathers taught him many years ago.*    *Steph, who cannot contain his excitement any more, kicks the door open, startling the students. He struts into the classroom, shoulder shimmying.*    The Student with the Durant Jersey: Knew I should have taken the D. Rose class on Women's Studies."
"counterpoint: he kicks ass off ball and will play alongside Tatum, brown and Kyrie so it's not like they're any more redundant than say, Kevin Durant and Steph curry. "

Nancy Kerrigan Kevin Durant. They don’t stand a chance against a healthy Warriors.
"Lmao you guys fellate the guy guarding Bron and acts as f it means anything. People were all over iguodalas dick and LBJ proceeded to kill them and win a championship. That same team had Togo get Kevin Durant to win. So let’s calm down and see how the series progresses, he will be bbq chicken by the time the series is over."
"&gt; this sub just obviously can read his mind and is very close with him and his inner circle  But you can?  &gt; Yes the player that's repeatedly said he wants to finish his career in SA...

Maybe his priority is to play in LA, maybe it's to win a championship. SAS aren't his best odds for either of those anymore.   Kawhi's not gone from SA, but it's definitely not certain that he's re-signing"
I always forget about this. We were lowkey very close to signing Kevin Durant lol. The NBA would be so different if that had happened. 
Are you trying to compare Dennis Rodman to Kevin Durant?
"Very specific conditions had to occur for that to happen though, and you still had two stars in Lebron/Irving. I feel like a rookie team with zero superstar power beating a Warriors team with Kevin Durant would be equally, if not more, surprising. "
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrwHB2rSX1s    Kevin Durant drinks beer then spits it out
"&gt;The longtime Sports Illustrated writer Jack McCallum reported in his 2017 book “Golden Days” that West, partly because of Myers’ rise in stature, was asked to take a reduction in compensation to stay.  the golden state warriors have looked at jerry west, stephen curry, and kevin durant and tried to get discounts. amazing"
"Well he should have gotten one back in 2008 but its a voting thing just like I think Harden should have gotten in 2015 instead of Steph but whatever.  Also Steph has Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant. Luckily none of those guys got injured at Key moments unlike the Clippers where Blake Griffin and Chris Paul both got injured at horrible times."

"I think Curry is plenty appreciated outside of r/nba. He was voted as an all-star captain, after all.  I do agree that Kevin Durant helped make the Warriors and, by extension, Curry a lot more hateable, though. During the 2015 Finals, I was on a long road trip with a couple of friends and we were working our way back East from California as the Finals began. Even as far East as Chicago, people were overwhelming rooting for the Warriors and my buddies and I had to be very quiet when we rooted for the Cavs in a bar. When the Cavs lost, I wasn't even mad, because I appreciated that the team we lost to was basically revolutionizing the way pro basketball was played, and they had basically acquired all their talent from the draft and stuck with their development. The KD signing totally changed that perception and it seems like a lot of the country is rooting for LeBron as a David vs. Goliath character nowadays.  At the end of the day, I think Curry and Durant are both obvious locks for the hall of fame but I don't think either will be remembered as top 5 of all time players. Curry, however, will definitely be remembered very, very well for completely changing the style of play in the league for an entire era."
"god, r/lebron has become annoying (for me), cant wait till all the lebron stans start whining about how kevin durant ruined the nba again..thats what i like"
"No. 1A &amp; 1B means 1A &amp; 1B. Quick, who’s the true number one option on the Warriors? Steph Curry or Kevin Durant? Who’s riding whose coattails? Who’s getting carried? The lack of Finals MVP’s says it’s Steph. See how dumb this sounds. Y’all sound just as dumb using this argument on Kobe and Shaq. Kobe averaged 33 points in a few playoffs series back then. In what world is that a second option. "
Ya they were closer to evenly matched for the one year that the Cavs won. Although warriors were favorites every year. To put it into perspective the Warriors were the favorites before adding Kevin Durant. Crazy

"When listening to sports radio or on lots of talk shows when ever they mention superstars they often say” a Lebron James, a Kevin Durant, a James Harden, a Russell Westbrook.” And then they get to their point or they’ll talk about top point guards and talk about Chris Paul, Lilard and Westbrook and dove into their topic and never even mention him. I get that he was injured for a lot of the season but come on you could at least mention him. I don’t need them to gush about him but you shouldn’t ignore that he exists."
"This is my favorite theory. It has nothing to do with the fact that we hit an all time record number of threes in a playoff game or anything.   If we want to complain about refs helping decide a game, how about we talk about Kevin Durant not getting called for his third foul in Game 5 after hitting LeBron in the head on a dunk attempt? Something that Love got a flagrant for that series. Having three fouls in the second quarter drastically changes how much you play and how you play. But no biggie. "

"I understand your point, but the reason people dislike Golden State is solely because of Kevin Durant. There’s no other reason past it except their insane amount of entitlement they exhibited this regular season (complaining about every little call, starting arguments and having 2 league leaders in ejections).

Draymond Green is more important to the Warriors than Kevin Durant.

"Golden State was somewhat likeable before the whole situation where they blew the 3-1 lead and Draymond had to call Durant whole crying in the parking lot to join them. If it was fully home grown with a lower-tier free agent that was anyone except Kevin Durant, especially after coming back 3-1 against him in the conference finals, then they’d be a more liked/supported team.

"I'd easily take PJ Tucker, Andre Iguodala, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant, and Trevor Ariza as well as Kawhi to defend Lebron over Marcus Morris any day of the week.  I'd say there's probably 10-15 guys in the NBA (I only used SF's) that would be no-brainers for me to have defending Lebron over Marcus Morris as Jrue Holiday and Draymond Green would come in at other positions against him.  Considering that he's not a top-15 or top-20 defender (or even close to that), I'd say it's pretty off-base.  Not even one of the top 3 defenders on his own team.  That being said, I'm sure Brad Stevens has a gameplan for slowing down Lebron, but I think there will be more involvement of Jaylen Brown with a side of Smart (won't guard but can switch onto him), Horford (crash the paint if Love is cold), and Tatum."
Dirk has an MVP and is 6th all-time in points. Kevin Durant is 41st.  They both have a FMVP and Dirk's is worth more.
I literally told you he's 5th. People in this sub keep repeating this narrative of kd being a top 3 or even the best scorer ever and it's uninformed. And of course you assume Kobe is there too lol.

Kevin Durant  is better than both
That's true. Most stars seem to take the Kevin Durant Hardest Road™ to a Championship. 
Kevin Durant cant be considered an all time great as long as his career is with the current warriors lineup. 
"https://m.newsok.com/article/5508075/okc-thunder-journal-how-close-was-al-horford-to-joining-okc  &gt;*How close was Al Horford to joining OKC?*  &gt;When rumblings of Al Horford coming to OKC started, Kevin Durant was reportedly a lead recruiter for the veteran power forward.  &gt;But Horford picked a four-year, $113 million deal with the Celtics over the Thunder, reportedly wanting assurances he couldn't get from Durant and Russell Westbrook that they'd be around long term.   "
"At this very moment, right now, Kevin Durant is a better player than at this very moment, right now, Kobe Bryant.  15 years ago, at that moment Kobe Bryant was better than at that moment Kevin Durant.  No legacy, purely basketball ability at that specific moment in time.  He's asking when the flip happened."
"Well, Popovich did talk to LaMarcus Alridge and said he wouldn't trade him unless he could get a Kevin Durant in return. So... maybe he says the same to Kawhi, ""hey Kawhi, we will trade you to the Cavs, but only if Lebron James comes here, otherwise, your ass goes on the court to play.""  So, I don't see Pop trading Kawhi to the Cavs. The Cavs have nothing of value. The only valuable thing they could have is first round picks. Maybe Love and first round picks. But otherwise?"
"&gt;(a lot of people said the same thing here)  That's because people post every play he doesn't get back on defense and it is front page news here lol. He does it once a game at least for sure but I saw Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant do the same thing regularly in their series but they are considered good defenders. In fact, Davis never runs back on defense.  Lebron is ranked 112 in defensive rating (per game) these playoffs right behind Kyle Anderson and Giannis and ahead of Ben Simmons, Jonas Valanciunis, Jimmy Butler.   James is also ranked 56th in defensive win shares per game in these playoffs ahead of Terry Rozier, Steven Adams, Jae Crowder etc.  Moreover if you look at the counting stats they are also good for James as he is averaging 1.5 steals and 1 block per game in these playoffs. For comparison Kevin Durant is averaging 1 steal and 1 block in these playoffs."

LeZard JamesSsSsss  *Kevin Durant pokes his head out of the dirt to taste the air.*
He (Kevin durant) {sic} was not a better player than Kobe Bryant 
&gt;Kevin Durant is a great player and perhaps the third best player in the league already but he is being babied and groomed by the league to be LeBron's foil. I hate watching him play because he draws so many fucking fouls with minimal contact by jerking up his arms against defenders who are just stronger than him.   Just replace KD with Harden but it wouldn't be unpopular
I know what you were implying but you're not [wrong](http://blacksportsonline.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Kevin-Durant-Sonics-.jpg) either way
Adding one of the best shooters in the league to a 73 win team with an established system is obviously going to be easier than adding Lebron and Kevin Love to a team that just made the lottery and won the 1st overall pick. This just isn't a good comparison and is poor evidence for your argument.  Do you really think Curry or Durant could carry the Cavs past the Pacers as while all the other players collectively crapped the bed?   
Kevin Durant joined a team that lost the Finals by 4 points in game 7 after going 73-9 in the regular season. KD was also defeated by that team in the WCF and was 1 game away from going to Finals himself. Don't be obtuse.

I hate watching him play because he draws so many fucking fouls with minimal contact by jerking up his arms against defenders who are just stronger than him.   I'm going to keep this on speed dial whenever Warriors fans cry about them fouling Harden.
Kevin Durant made a good move going to Golden State and doesn't deserve the hate. 
The Warriors didn’t have Kevin Durant in 2016
"In the last 2 years, with Steph Curry on (and KD off), the Warriors have ORTG of 121.6 and DRTG of 103.9 (making an insane net rating of +17.7)  With KD on and Steph Curry off, the ORTG is 111.8 and DRT is 109.3 for a net rating of +2.6  With both on, ORTG of 124.3 and DRTG of 110.8 (net rating of +13.5). There is such an enormous gulf in impact between Stephen Curry &amp; Kevin Durant, it still amazes me that Curry isn't consensus 1B to LBJ's 1A.  "
 Kevin Durant has been better than LeBron Since 2012 
I was just saying Kevin Durant isnt a Lebron stopper lol. And no Durants team was only worse early in their career maybe but once Westbrook and Ibaka and Harden were there they were pretty equal teams.  
"He’s going to be covered in blood by the end of the ECF if he drags this shitty Cavs team past the Celtics, I don’t know what he’ll look like at the end of a finals run with the mvp trophy in his hand. Do you think he’ll be collecting fangs in a necklace and wielding a spear yet? He’s something fucking primal right now already. I don’t even for a moment expect him to win a title this year, but I wanna see it happen so badly for the spectacle and because fuck Kevin Durant."
In the Finals Kawhi Kept Lebron to only attempting a shot on like 27% of his total possessions....that’s wayyyyy below his average. Yes there is no Lebron stopper but Kawhi is the closest thing to one you can get other than Kevin Durant 
Kevin Durant did.
"Agree, lol. ""Kevin Durant is a great player and perhaps the third best player in the league already but he is being babied and groomed by the league to be LeBron's foil.""  This is so on point."
"I'm not trying to excuse Presti (because he should have been able to keep both Ibaka and Harden if he let Perk go), but Ibaka over Harden was a popular opinion at the time. People felt like OKC had enough firepower with Westbrook and Durant, and they needed Ibaka's defensive presence to match up with the hyper athletic wings and bigs in the league. Kevin Martin was supposed to come in and do Harden's job (which he did fairly well that season). He picked both Harden and Westbrook earlier than they were projected to go as well. "
Still can't wrap my mind that this already deadly lineup added Kevin fucking Durant
"Greg Oden was a better prospect than Kevin Durant, that should say enough."
"That .... is not our starting five. That is our game-winning lineup specifically designed to go against the Hampton 5. Unless Anthony Davis decides to out Kevin Durant Kevin Durant. Which you know, he could."
"&gt; What if Portland drafted Kevin Durant instead of oden  i don't remember this being a consideration at the time, really. oden was a generational big man, and you just do not pass those up at #1. centers have higher ceilings than the rest, and he honestly didn't have a concerning injury history at that time. they were always going to take oden."
"and adam morrison has more championships than charles barkley, dirk nowitzki, chris webber or modern era kevin durant, kyrie irving, anthony davis...   not saying tatum isn't good, but this stat is useless"
"Kevin Durant, is that you?"
Did you miss the last 20 years? We got this thing called the Internet now.  These stupid press conference things mattered in the 70s. Now we have streaming video and Iguodola can speak his own damn mind if he wants to. The NBA doesn't need reporters it can release its own coverage. It definitely doesn't owe these antiquated gotcha men anything. The TV deals themselves aren't even as important anymore ; I pay for my games directly via league pass. The death of television is something we've been writing about for a decade and the death of print even longer.   Sports gets coverage from us. Its us talking about it on our lunch breaks.  Our video and selfies spammed to need ferds. Our worn and sometimes tattood logos. Those reporter dudes make stuff up half the time and half the time players themselves leak the real gossip. (Sup Kevin Durant and every other player with alt accounts!) . Iguodola is not wrong ; if he says anything the only person that benefits is the reporter.   
"This is so overstated.   1. Outside of the Cavs what injury caused the warriors to win? What series do they lose without that injury?  2. Kevin Love was a completely overstated injury. He was a horrible matchup for the Warriors even before Durant. In the 2016 Finals the Cavs played WAY better with him off the court if you look at +/- and his stats were pretty terrible. He played one good defensive possession on Curry and everybody seems to forget that. Same trend in 2017.  3. The Warriors dominated the 2015 series way more than people think. They actually had better point differential metrics in the 15 finals than in the 17 finals. Because it was 4-2  people just knee jerk say it was close. In reality a 7 game series to small a number to use the game count ratio to determine closeness. Winning 2 out of 3 games against a team is actually really good and really dominating. If you extrapolate that out past a 4-2 number its an insanely good record. Its a 55 win season compared to 27 win season for the losing team. Because its only 7 games people look and say ""thats one less than the max of 7 so it must be a close series.""  4.  Kyrie was definitely a blow to the Cavs but this idea it was an automatic win for the cavs had he stayed healthy in 2015 is ridiculous. The cavs were also not as good in 2015 even when fully healthy as they were in 2016. Lebron was not AS good that season as he has been since, so you don't get to throw the 2016 cavs into the 2015 finals even if you want to eliminate the injuries and speculate."
Well the ruining parity narrative didn’t come up until they got Kevin Durant.  I do think the first championship they got wouldn’t have happened if they faced healthy teams in the playoffs. 
Kevin durant. Nobody wants to fuck a snake.
"Ok..?   Kevin Durant is a freak player, using his height as an example as to why Russell would be undersized at Center is just dumb.   6’10 with length and insane athleticism is completely fine, if not ideal, for a Center in today’s NBA, just look at how impactful Horford was able to be on Defense."
"You lost me when you started comparing Bill Russell and Kevin Durant and modern era comparisons. Someone should tell the anti-vaxxers that vaccines won't give your kids autism, but this dude's posts surely will. "
"Kevin Durant, although tall, is considered to be super skinny. I used him as a comparison because Durant is taller and heavier than Russell, yet wouldn’t be considered a superb center."
"Weird hearing that from a lakers fan. Most would say NYEH LONZO POINT GOD AND BRANDON ""KEVIN DURANT"" INGRAM WILL SWEEP FINALS"
"Kevin Durant talking about how ""selfless"" the Warriors playstyle is, and how it was a breath of fresh air or whatever certainly seemed like a shot at Russ"
"Thats really sad, really cements the rumors that he is thin skinned. If Kevin Durant wants to redeem himself, he will have to leave GS and stop acting like a little bitch. He is only recognized by GS fans but not the rest of the NBA."
no this is a thread saying Kevin durant is better. and it's 62% upvoted.   
"&gt; There are maybe 10 players in the NBA making more than $1 million a year on endorsements  There's a lot more than 10 players making $1M+  1. LeBron James: $52 million  2. Stephen Curry: $42 million  3. Kevin Durant: $33 million  4. James Harden: $20 million  5. Russell Westbrook: $19 million  6. Kyrie Irving: $14 million  7. Damian Lillard: $14 million  8. Dwayne Wade: $14 million  9. Giannis Antetokounmpo: $13 million  10. Klay Thompson: $13 million  Then you start adding Melo, Blake, PG, DRose, CP3, DeMar, Dwight etc etc etc...the list goes on and on till you'd get to under $1M"
"no, he has good reasons to leave, but making kawhi seem like the second coming of kevin durant is no something i agree with "
"Players worthy of that money by and large haven’t been able to get it since that offseason.   All the cap space that would be available for those free agents to capitalize on has been sapped up by guys like Chandler Parsons, Nic Batum, Solomon Hill, And Luol Deng. Compound with the lack of teams capable of bidding of these guys, and it has suppressed the market.   That’s why Boogie Cousins probably isn’t going to get an amazing contract this offseason. Few teams have the the ability to offer him much without hamstringing themselves by getting rid of junk salary.   The cap spike also handed the Warriors Kevin Durant."
"I was bored today so I took a shot at this. I have Klay just inside my Top 20 and Draymond just outside. To be clear, this is based on how good I think these players are right now, if fully healthy (which is certainly a big assumption for some players, like Cousins).  This is obviously super subjective, and I'm probably a little off here and there but I think it's roughly right.

Kevin Durant is better than LeBron James
"&gt; You have no means of justifying his behaviour because it's pathetic   Holy shit. So you mean his happiness doesn't mean shit? You have absolutely no clue what you're talking about because you're not Kevin Durant. Sure him joining the Warriors fucking sucks, his insecurity is off the charts but who are you to tell him what he should have done? At the end of the day, he's him. You can't possibly say what you'd do when you're on his shoes because it's completely moot. You have absolutely no clue how he lives his life, you're not him. Fuck the Warriors but I hate reading stupid shits like this thinking they got it all figured out. You don't know what makes him happy, so your comment is completely redundant as well. "
Kevin “Snek” Durant
"""You're upset. It's ok, I get it."" -Back2back finals MVP Kevin Durant.   Just putting up career bests with iconic daggers. KD shine all over those rings, swallow the whole load /r/nba"
Of all teams that needed Kevin Durant after the 2016 season (let alone the teams with the cap space) the last team was Golden State. 
"In my opinion, there's no way Kawhi Leonard is worth a Kevin Durant."
"Imagine having 3 of your players named to the All-Star game, one of them winning the first ever unanimous MVP, winning a record 73 games, and CHOKING a 3-1 lead to a team with only 1 player who made the All-Star team. Absolutely disgraceful by Golden State. They needed Kevin Durant and they needed him badly. "
"Not if I was Kevin Durant.. Also known as one of the top 5 players in the world. Debatably 2/3 at that time.   Not If I had my opponents down 3-1 and their squad was one of the best of all time without me.   Not all of us are cowards with burner accounts, say what you mean, mean what you say. KD could've got paid max anywhere, and could've joined any top play-off team and turn them in to contenders. "
"100% it’s this. Joining a good team for a better chance at winning is (provided context) okay — joining a team that just beat you the previous year after choking against them and realizing it’s the easiest avenue to a championship is not.   Kevin Durant took off his white panties, put them on a stick and waived them in the air as he signed with Golden State. It just showed he doesn’t have the backbone and competitive edge that most other players do.   He had every right to do it, and he still deserves the respect for being one of the best who has ever played, but my god, that move to Golden State is some Hoe Hall-of-Fame shit. "
Top 15 all time? Are you retarded? Freaking Kevin Durant has to bust his ass and *hope* he can end up there.Kawhi's ceiling is not even top 10 in the 21st century.
Lol. Kevin “I’m such an incredible pussy when everyone thought I had dog in me” Durant can’t kill LeBron’s legacy.  Everyone knows that the Warriors and Durant had to add the 2nd best player to keep from getting dad dicked by LeBron. 
"Kevin ""i killed lbjs legacy"" Durant"
"His [Instagram burner](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/lookit/2017/9/18/16327672/kevin-durant-private-instagram-account-arguments-nba-warriors) is a lot worse, and in no way endearing. Like, imagine being a 28 year old that is making millions as one of the best of their profession, and telling actual kids they’re bums for living with their parents."
Yeah but Kawhi fits their classic ball movement system. With him they’d go back to being the Warriors instead of Kevin Durant and the Warriors. 
Kevin Durant will finish his career in the 8-10 range all-time
"....? what? can i cite it? like from a dictionary? are you retarded?  the warriors are the best team in the nba. stephen curry and kevin durant, two warriors players, are some of the biggest sports superstars on the planet. you’d have to be living in a cave not to know who they, or their team (again, the warriors) are. thus, if you call someone “the warriors” of their field, you are saying they are at the top of their game and so immensely popular that people totally unaffiliated or unfamiliar with that field know and can recognize them.   how is this complicated dude. "
"I can’t disagree with you. I will say this though to hopefully add some clarity to the state of our fanbase:  JR holding that ball out at the end of regulation in game one against the Warriors is such a microcosm for LeBron’s Cavalier legacy and (it may be a stretch but) Cleveland sports teams in general.  We’ve missed our chance. LeBron James has become more than a generational player. In a lot of ways, he’s the greatest to ever play the game (we can talk MJ debates later, just roll with it for now). Not only does Cleveland line up to take him with an unlikely first pick, but he’s also from northeast Ohio. Who the hell comes from northeast Ohio, right!? We’ve done our waiting, we’ve had our heartbreaks, and we’ve endured our pathetic teams. Now it’s time to cash in. Now we get a turnaround. We get to be on top, as unlikely as it is. He left and came back. He’s now the complete player. Annnd we get steamrolled by the perfect sports organization riding the coattails of a perfect salary cap payroll. Fuck. What a wasted opportunity.  We’re supposed to win with LeBron and watch him cement his legacy as the greatest ever. He’s supposed to get 5 titles in 7 years with Cleveland and become undisputed and immortal. Damn. Not happening  What about the other teams? Browns; fuck nope. What a joke of an organization. Indians; great team. Great ball club in the last 25 years with three really good periods (mid-late 90’s, early-mid 00’s, and mid-current 10’s) and no World Series to show for it.  We’re emotional, bitter, jaded, degenerate, and unintelligent. We went all in on this guy. We’re a down and out, shrinking city, staying relevant outside of sports thanks only to a Great Lakes Port, I-90, and huge hospitals. We’re not Silicon Valley. We’d probably be okay with being the bad guys and switching roles with the Bay Area because we’ll take titles however we can get them. I think we’d rather win like villains than die like heroes at this point.  We’re also not very attractive as a bandwagon team, are we? So the Cavs flairs in here are MOSTLY locals. No rich history prior to LeBron. Some history, not rich though. So while plenty of other fans in here maybe don’t have their livelihood associated with their team’s success, most of us do. And it sucks because it didn’t have to be this way.  There’s a lot of irony in Kevin Durant joining the Warriors a la LeBron joining the Heat and creating the Heatles. If he didn’t directly inspire KD’s move - he very certainly enabled the plausibility of it. But that doesn’t mean the timing has to be so entwined that his return as the prodigal son is thwarted by another player embarking on the same super team journey. KD should be 5 years later and we’d all be happy as multi-title Cavs fans. It’d be great to have four finals against the Warriors and trade off each year turning the series into a series on top of a series. I know the neutrals and most everyone else would hate that but we’d like it. But, unless we somehow go back to back with LeBron in the next two seasons, our time is up. Our chance is gone and there’s nothing residual about LeBron’s success that we can ride once he’s gone. That’s it. That’s why we’re bitter, unintelligent, degenerates (myself most definitely included). You just have to deal with us until LeBron leaves Cleveland whenever that may be. Then we can cast ourselves away into oblivion; happily or otherwise."
"I don't live there, but visit often. San Antonio is under rated imo. Food scene not great, but good enough, great night life, and undeniable culture for city dwellers. Outside the city is the Texas hill country which is the most beautiful part of the state. Then, for those Kevin Durant types that have business interest, you are short drive to Austin. Probably a shorter drive than most places in the Bay Area.  "
&gt; please explain how kawhi is not a top 2 player.  Lebron and Kevin Durant exist.
"Kevin Durant has a totally normal sized peepee. It's just that I'm so tall and lanky, that's why it looks small.     Edit: \*He's, not I. This is definitely not Kevin Durant."
They won when all other opponents were injured and then choked in the finals. They drafted well but don't act like Kevin Durant didn't push them
"But the bench press requires drastically different lever and types of strength from every basketball move. There’s a reason Kevin Durant couldn’t bench 185 at the combine. His arms are crazy long, and that’s not good for the bench press, but it’s great for basketball and doesn’t limit his ability to be strong on court. "
"please explain how kawhi is not a top 2 player. he can guard, literally, any other player on the planet. lebron and kevin durant cant even claim that. plus, he can still get his on the other end. lebron is better because he can do more things offensively, but kawhi is close. durant is good, but his defense isnt transcendent like kawhis. no other top player could even potentially do all of the things those 3 can."
"to be honest, even retroactively saying stuff like Cavs would have won in 17 or Rockets would have won this year is not really meaningful.  If the Warriors dont sign KD that year, it means they would have had the capspace to bring in either greater depth, or another contributer.  Yes, that signee would not be as good as Kevin Durant, but they wouldn't just be this current team minus KD.  They could very well have built a team and still won these last 2 years; we'll never know.  "
"kevin durant joined the team that beat him, immediately after he blew a 3-1 lead to them"
ahhh the Kevin Durant timeline
"Timofey Mozgov, Evan Turner, and Allen Crabbe were all even more inexplicable in my opinion. The year Deng got paid, he had just finished doing his best Kevin Durant impression on us in the playoffs. Fucker averaged 22/7 on 64/65/65 shooting over the first three games of that series. None of those other guys were even league-average players."
Anything that involves Kevin Durant not winning a ring is fine with me.
"&gt;We seriously don’t know all the facts.  While it is more fun to speculate and pretend to have some idea of the mental makeup of people (see Durant, Kevin) this is 100% correct.  "
Kevin Durant Kevin Garnett Kevin McHale Kevin Johnson Kevin Love Kevin Willis  Kevin Martin Kevin Grevey Kevin Loughery Kevin Duckworth 
"Not at 2014, not at all.   Blake Griffin, Westbrook, CP3, Kevin Love, Durant, Harden, Dwight (lol I swear), Joakim Noah (LOL I SWEAR), Dame, Wall, DMC, Carmelo, Lamarcus, to name a FEW players were all considered better than Kawhi.   He won Finals MVP because he was the most impactful player on a good Spurs team, but no one thought he was anywhere NEAR 2nd best player in the world in 2014. He didn't even make the All star game the season after winning FMVP. ESPN player ranking had him ranked at 24th best player after the 2014 Finals, to give you a sense on what the general consensus on Kawhi as a player was.   2016-2017 is the only season where you can make the argument Kawhi is the 2nd best player. "
Some candidates off the top of my head  2010s  15-16 Curry  17-18 Harden (16-17 also works)  12-13 LeBron (17-18 or 15-16 can work too)  13-14 Kevin Durant  17-18 Anthony Davis  &amp;nbsp;  80s  88-89 Magic  87-88 MJ  84-85 Bird  87-88 Barkley  80-81 Kareem
Im freee —- Kevin Dobbie Durant
Not Kevin Durant 
It’s just amazing to see the NBA community unite over a joint hatred of Kevin Durant. 
Kevin Durant.
I’m just gonna go ahead and just reiterate that Kevin Durant sucks
"An elite Two-way player to me means said player excels on both sides of the ball. Kawhi is elite offensively and defensively. Just like Jimmy Butler, Paul George, and Chris Paul.   To me, a two way player should be relatively even  in ability for offense and defense. There's no making up for bad defense with amazing offense and vice-versa.  These players are the best fits for teams because they have no weaknesses. You don't have to hide them on defense like Lebron or Curry and the best of them are amazing play-makers unlike Gobert or Marcus Smart.  Kevin Durant would be the best two-way player if his defense was a little better. He just isn't an elite defender like the other guys I mentioned are.  Anthony Davis is probably the next best two way player after Kawhi for example."
"What are the Lakers gonna trade for him? Ball had a lousy first season and comes with the added headache of Lavar (which I can't see the Spurs putting up with), Kuzma will be a decent 4th/5th starter at best, Ingram's *a lot* closer to Michael Beasley than to Kevin Durant.  The only way the Lakers can win this is by default - if nobody else makes a trade offer, if Kawhi plays hardball and refuses to commit to every other organization, or if Adam Silver pulls a reverse basketball reasons."
Suddenly Kevin Durant wants to play for the Lakers.
Reminds of kevin Durant for entire okc career until July 4th 2016
"Why wouldn't it be? Kawhi is consistent on the offensive end and defensive end, probably better than any other player Lebron has played with. Kawhi should be comfortable at SF or SG; it likely won't matter because defensively he's getting the most difficult backcourt matchup. I think he was a really efficient 3 pt shooter 2 years ago, so it isn't like Lebron can't get him shots.  There is no better calculated move than to join the player best able to defend Kevin Durant. Even if I'm off on the #2 in the league, I'm not that far off."
I don't want the warriors to succeed either but I don't want LBJ on the team. I'll have anyone else not named Kevin Durant and LBJ on the Lakers. 
"In my experience, most Lakers fans under 30 didn't give a shit about the Warriors and were just happy to see a team from California doing well that wasn't the Kings or the Clippers since the Lakers were/(are) not competitive. So if you were going to root for another California team, the Warriors were it.  Lakers/Warriors haven't had a rivalry in our lifetime, Kings were an obvious rivalry in the early 00's, and fuck the Clippers.  I understand disliking them after the Kevin Durant thing, but before that idk."
Kevin Durant is less of a snake than Kawhi Leonard is right now. Full stop.  
We are at a Kentucky fundamentalist church service right now. Kevin Durant just wriggled off the altar.
"&gt;Would the Warriors be better with a Bogut that never gets injured or a regular Kevin Durant?  &gt;no one is saying take away Michael for him  # YOU ARE, you numbskull  this is basically the same thing but for GSW"
KEVIN DURANT MADE THE OFFSEASON GREAT AGAIN
"From my perspective (fan of neither teams), the potential LAL roster and situation in general is a lot more likable than the current GSW roster. The level of cockiness from KD, Draymond, and Steph is crazy given the fact they added Kevin Durant to a star studded 70+ win team (that had just beaten KD’s team in the playoffs).   I’m not saying people will like LAL, but GSW will still be the villains in my eye. And sure .. if LAL hypothetically fails they will die a hero.. but if they have success long enough they will become the villain. "
"We are at a forbidden tree in the middle of an idyllic orchard, by the way. Kevin Durant just offered Eve an apple."
"Kawhi literally can shut down Kevin Durant, LeBron is LeBron and wouldn't have potatoes as teammates, Paul George is good until the fourth quarter, and Lonzo gonna be racking up assists"
"Most likely scenario.  1. People call Kawhi a bitch. 2. Lebron, Chris Paul, and Kawhi all end up on the Lakers. 3. People start calling Kawhi a snake instead of a bitch. 4. People use this as an excuse to start rooting for Kevin Durant again. 5. Warriors sweep the Lakers after Kawhi and Chris Paul go down with their yearly injuries and Lebron is left trying to beat the Warriors by himself again. "
"We are at the 2016 WCF right now, by the way. Kevin Durant just ran off the court."
"If he's going to the Lakers to team up with Lebron, I'm pretty sure Lebron is betting on it as well. He's the best first option for defending Kevin Durant (and Lebron) and he has elite offense to go with it."
"Giving up Lonzo ""can't shoot"" Ball, Brandon ""bubonic plague survivor's Kevin Durant"" and Kyle ""only plays defensive on social media"" Kuzma for the best player in the world, another top 5 player and DPOY and an elite 2-way wing? Hell fucking yeah."
"Kevin durant on suicide watch knowing that gsw will have to face lebron, pg, and kawhi all on the same team"
Man I go poop and come back to see Kawhi wants out. Brb gonna go poop and think about Kevin Durant 
"Better coach and better injury luck... we're talking about them being injured in 2013 (WB, next best option is Kevin Martin lol, beaten by Grizzlies who got swept by the Spurs), 2014 (lose Ibaka, lose 1st 2 games of WCF), and 2015 (KD injury, plus others, miss the playoffs entirely). Heartbreaking.   This team should've won at least one of '14 or '16, maybe even '15, and instead got neither. I remember in the 2014-2015 season KD came back from injury and dismantled the champions-to-be Warriors to the tune of 30 pts in a half, and then he reinjured his foot. Probably the most frustrated I'd ever been as a Durant fan was that moment cuz he could've easily gone for 50, and he lost the rest of his season. Plus, the foot injury took away some of his aggressiveness going to the rack."
"I think if you're straight up comparing Kevin Durant and Andrew Bogut, this is a ridiculous question. Bogut, even if healthy, would never be the level of player KD is.  But if you're asking if Bogut stayed healthy and the Warriors kept their depth rather than being top heavy with KD, that's a different question and valid I think.  That 73-9 team was lethal on both ends and so damn disciplined. They were also much more engaged as a team because they have to be. Throwing the ball to KD for a guaranteed bucket makes the other guys not as aggressive. That old squad had everyone firing on all cylinders and Steph doing ridiculous things every night."
"That's a mighty good point.  And thing is, I don't know.  Some people see Brandon Ingram as potentially the next Kevin Durant.  Which, of course, would give him a higher ceiling.  But the thing was, out of high school, Jaylen Brown was a consensus top two talent (him and Ben Simmons split the top rank).  He slipped in his one year of college because he gave the impression that he could only drive to the basket to score and wasn't ready for NBA team ball.  That was proven wrong in Boston, and that could mean that he could be considered higher.  The other thing is the ability to reach their ceiling.  I think that even if Jaylen Brown's ceiling is lower, he has a higher chance of achieving it."
"Ever get the idea that you've been played for a fool, that you are nothing but a mark for con artists like Kevin Durant? Well, that's why I need to tell you that in the good old days, when courage, honor, devotion, duty, and loyalty meant something, it was comparatively easy to work beyond the predatory plasticity of Durant's shenanigans. I will start by responding to some of Durant's ad hominem attacks. These attacks are not original but rather are drawn from lies that Durant and his imperium have manufactured out of past statements attributed to their targets. I will deal with those attacks that are specific to me, partly because I'm familiar with them and partly because Durant is an acrasial psychopath. I'm being super-extra nice when I say that. If I weren't so polite I instead would have stated that Durant's inveracities stink of cover-ups, stalls, diversionary tactics, legal maneuverings, and other measures that reduce religion to a consumer item in a spiritual supermarket. That's too big of a subject to get into here so let me instead discuss how he repeatedly expresses the view that rallying for a cause that is completely void of moral, ethical, or legal validity is essential for the safety and welfare of the public. If the average Joe actually paused for a moment to analyze this dreck in a clear-eyed way, he'd realize that I fully intend to weaken the critical links in Durant's nexus of anal-retentive scapegoatism. When people ask me, “What can I do to help?”, I always suggest that they build alliances to combat Stalinism and barbarism. Such actions are moral in the true sense of the word. Furthermore, they help people see that Durant believes it's perfectly okay to develop a credible pretext to forcibly silence his foes. More than anything else, such beliefs shed light on Durant's moral values and suggest incontrovertibly that he considers all of his corrivals to be vitriolic, wretched thought police—or worse. When describing them, Durant lets some of the most pernicious, blasphemous, and stinking words I've ever heard pass through his lips, words that serve no purpose other than to bring home the point that Durant is convinced that people everywhere have a deeply held love of resistentialism. I claim that if he held a rally in support of resistentialism, no more than two people would show up—one if you exclude the local street vendor who just happens to be peddling his wares in the vicinity. The reason, obviously, is that while Durant and other backwards dips sometimes differ on the details and scale of their upcoming campaigns of terror they never fail to agree on the basic principle and substance. Hence, it is imperative that you understand that one of the things I find quite interesting is listening to other people's takes on things. For instance, I recently overheard some folks remark that there is more at play here than his purely political game of pooh-poohing the reams of solid evidence pointing to the existence and operation of a humorless coterie of despotism. There are ideologies at work, hidden agendas to tour the country promoting dictatorial favoritism in lectures and radio talk-show interviews. Durant's loyalists say that nothing would help society more than for them to paint decent people as impudent slubberdegullions. Sorry, I don't buy that. Sure, we could just sit back and let Durant clear-cut ancient forest lands, but that prospect really grates on people who have any kind of common sense. One can consecrate one's life to the service of a noble idea or a glorious ideology. Durant, however, is more likely to reopen wounds that seem scarcely healed. No one today believes that promoting ethnocentrism helps one gain skills for success in an increasingly complex and globalized marketplace. Well, that's getting away from my main topic, which is that soulless momes like Durant are not born—they are excreted. However unsavory that metaphor may be, I'm at loggerheads with Durant on at least one important issue. Namely, he argues that he's a saintly figure—philanthropic, noble, and wise. I take the opposite position, that Durant claims to have donated a lot of money to charity over the past few years. I suspect that the nullibicity of those donations would become apparent if one were to audit Durant's books—unless, of course, “charity” includes Durant-run organizations that threaten the common good. In that case, I'd say that Durant seizes every opportunity to reduce history to an overdetermined, wireframe sketch of what are, in reality, complex, dynamic events. I cannot believe this colossal clownishness. Any sane person knows that Durant yearns for the Oriental despotisms of pre-Hellenic times, the neolithic culture that preceded the rise of self-consciousness and egoism. By the same token, he abhors the current era, in which people are free to maximize our individual potential for effectiveness and success in combatting him. Despite what Durant says, he aims at nothing less than the complete overthrow of capitalism, representational government, and democracy. I hardly need to add that Durant's philippics are eerily similar to those promoted by madmen such as Pol Pot. What's scary, though, is that their extollment of voyeurism has been ratcheted up a few notches from anything Pol Pot ever conjured up. Although I prefer appealing to evidence and logic, Durant is driven purely by emotion and anxiety. That's why it's hard to convince him that he claims to have solutions to all of our problems. Usually, though, these supposed solutions ride on the backs of people who are poor, powerless, or who don't have the clout to lead Durant out of a dream world and back to hard reality. It's these classes of “solutions”, therefore, that demonstrate how Durant's statements such as “Little green men live on Mars” indicate that we're not all looking at the same set of facts. Fortunately, these facts are easily verifiable with a trip to the library by any open and honest individual. I have long been under the impression that I'm no psychiatrist. Still, from the little I know about psychiatry I can say that Durant seems to exhibit many of the symptoms of Asperger's syndrome. I don't say that to judge but merely to put Durant's adversarial, imprudent reports into perspective. A day of reckoning is coming, and Durant will be called to account. As an interesting experiment, try to point this out to him. (You might want to don safety equipment first.) I think you'll find that I can easily see Durant performing the following hideous acts. First, he will cultivate the purest breed of irresponsibility. Then, he will pull the levers of antagonism and oil the gears of antipluralism. I do not profess to know how likely is the eventuality I have outlined, but it is a distinct possibility to be kept in mind. Durant has begun—without so much as a by-your-leave—an effort to create anomie. There's nothing controversial about that view. It's a fact, pure and simple. It was a fact long before anyone realized that I, for one, have no doubt that Durant will cause me to lose my temper. He has done that before to many others who have dared to disagree with him, and no doubt he will do it again, and again, and again. I contend that my only ability to thwart this asinine effort is to alert the public that the most unprofessional manifestation of lubricious sentiment among breathtakingly stroppy stool pigeons has been the way they brandish the word “roentgenographically” (as it is commonly spelled) to hoodwink people into believing that education should teach the precepts of Leninism and the duties of man towards litigious yo-yos. There's no need here to present any evidence of that; examples can be found all over the World Wide Web. In fact, a simple search will quickly reveal that Durant expects us to behave like passive sheep. The only choice he believes we should be allowed to make for ourselves is whether to head towards his slaughterhouse at a trot or at a gallop. Durant indeed doesn't want us choosing to disabuse him of the notion that an open party with unlimited access to alcohol can't possibly outgrow the host's ability to manage the crowd. Although Durant's goal is to bathe in splendor while the rest of us go to work in the mines, many Web sites paint Durant, accurately, as a repugnant liar and cheat. It's that simple. I, speaking as someone who is not a stentorian marauder, like to say that he consorts with the worst types of brain-damaged babblers I've ever seen. Durant never directly acknowledges such truisms but instead tries to turn them around to make it sound like I'm saying that he has his moral compass in tact. I guess that version better fits his style—or should I say, “agenda”? He is trying to create a world without history, without philosophy, without science, without reason—a world without beauty of any kind, without art, without literature, without culture. His mission? To terrorize the public. It's not the bogeyman that our children need to worry about. It's Durant. Not only is Durant more feebleminded and more wishy-washy than any envisaged bogeyman or bugbear, but just as night follows day, Durant will subordinate principles of fairness to less admirable criteria in the blink of an eye. He avows that it is better that a hundred thousand people should perish than that he should be even slightly inconvenienced. Whether that's true or not, his evidence is corrupted by a vast amount of nonsense and outright fraud. Before we can further discuss Durant's claim we must acknowledge that Durant has, on a number of occasions, expressed a desire to conscript traditional academic disciplines into the service of serfism and its ideological variants. On all of these occasions I submitted to the advice of my friends, who assured me that I like to say that his goals violate the rational, enlightened claims of their own enunciatory modality. Durant always gets agitated whenever I say things li"
"Agreed 100%, and thats why conversations that go into ""Player X is a top 10 most-skilled player of all time"" (usually when talking about Kevin Durant or someone like that) isnt all that meaningful.  You dont win games off skill, you win them on combining that skill with your mind and actually performing .  And some players over their careers dont perform up to their skillset (like KD, for example.  And lebron earlier in his career), and thats the mental toughness aspect"
Kevin Durant wouldn't survive the Mikan era.
"God damn i relate to this so hard.  I love Kevin Durant as a player, he is amazing to watch, and im really happy he came to Golden State. But i cant talk about him without getting nuked into the ground because “HAHA HE A LITTLE BITCH” and “NO ONE RESPEC DA SNEK”.  It frustrates me to no end. On top of that, everyone seems to think that he shouldve gone anywhere else, even if it went against what he wanted. Its clear the guy, despite being a top 3 player in the league, doesnt want to be a leader, and thats fine. Everyone assumes that all the most talented players should be natural leaders, but thats not the case. I get that “the hardest road” and his social media antics is pretty god damn petty, but it feels like 9/10 threads on r/nba are about snek. "

"From February of 2017  &gt;""*Where do you see Kevin Durant's ceiling in the all-time NBA ranks?*"" --Sahith Vadada  &gt;Given that Durant's the same age now as Michael Jordan was when he won the first championship, it's probably still somewhat early to be putting a ceiling on him. That said, if we give Durant a median trajectory from here on out -- a few championships with the Warriors, but no more MVPs, because while he's in his prime he splits credit with Stephen Curry -- I don't think he could pass Kobe Bryant, who finished No. 11 in last year's all-time #NBArank voting. And he'd probably be behind Curry, too. So I think Durant may have a tough time getting any higher than about 13th.

"Enjoy basketball with your son? That is impossible, because Kevin Durant ruined basketball! Everyone knows this."
"&gt; As an aside do you watch basketball? Because there is no fucking Earth where Kevin Durant adds more to the Cleveland system than he does when added to the Warriors.  One has a real system and the other has the LeBron system. That's also what makes the decision difficult since the Warriors objectively had and have the best brand of basketball. The Celtics are the only other team that compare, but I'm not sure I wanna run over to a lineup of IT, Horford, and young players when LeBron has a big 3 and whoever comes out the west is the Warriors big 3 or good enough to beat them. I think the main thing is even if they had to get rid of Dray or Klay as well to get KD and get a quality center and replacement player he still goes. It's hard to argue any team over the Warriors right now, even the Spurs given their roster's construction. Right now it's the Warriors, Celtics, and then everyone else."

What does the Warriors before adding Kevin Durant have to do with them now? They are a different team. As are the rockets after adding Chris Paul. Or do you think since okc won 3 against the warriors in 2016 that means they could do it again in 2017?

You got that right. Kevin Durant knows that Kevin Durant's favorite Warrior is Kevin Durant.
"As a Kevin Durant hater I actually don’t hate Boogie for this move. He increased his Max $$ next off season, purely by just going to the warriors. He’s coming off an injury that derailed Kobe.

Kd is still a bitch for what he did, but boogie basically is betting on the warriors success (good bet) to guarantee long term money next off season. "
"In 2016 LeBron was guarding Draymond Green which allowed him to play help defense. The big problem with Kevin Durant's addition was that someone had to guard Kevin Durant, and it sure as hell couldn't be Kevin Love or anyone else. Our team is better suited (at least physically) to guard the Warriors, and allow LeBron to guard Draymond Green, which unlocks his help defense.  The Cavs rolling out that lineup didn't have the defense elsewhere to make that possible. Not saying this defense is great, but it would be better than when the Cavs rolled it out."
"well let me address your points step by step.  West/Chandler/Peja is overvalued.  Chandler was not the defender he was later in his career and played 45 games in 09.  Peja was past his prime and had only one good season in 08.  That year wasnt anything crazy however 16.4 58ts% 15.7 PER .144ws/48, on the lower end of 3rd options if you compare them to great teams but good tbf.  West was the overrated one, an inefficient 20ppg scorer(granted a good defender but not at the level he was in indiana).  The good teams in the West in 08 were known for having a guard/big lead them as the two best players.  West was arguably the worst second guy of the bunch(Gasol in LA, Manu in SA, Boozer in Utah, Yao in Hou, Stat in Phx).  Notice how all those teams besides Hou had good 3rd guys too.  Seriously only one I take West over is Terry in Dal.  The fact that you name crawford for the clips means you're not viewing the situation correctly.  The 3 main guys were blake/dj/reddick.  That lineup was better than NO but I can also detail some of the flaws more.  Blake was pretty much injured the last 2 years, and started declining after 14 when he had to rely on a jump shot to score and coexist with DJ.  With him healthy, we're a decent contender in 16,17.  Our bench was absolutely awful til 17(and some of this is due to crawford's bad shot selection).  Like one of the worse you'll see from a 55+win level team.  I like rdj+reddick a lot so I wont criticize them but you do better for 3rd and 4th players when you see GS and Cle the past few years.  I see some comparisons of reddick to someone Jeff Hornacek on those 90's jazz teams and I take hornacek because he did quite a bit more elsewhere with his passing and better defense.  Who cares if he never played the team that won the title.  He always lost to great teams.  In 2 of his big disappointments, his teams lost the defending champion Spurs with their big 3 and kd/westbrook/ibaka okc.  Was not favored significantly in either of those series(the underdog vs OKC most likely)   Anyone can name a few bad series on defense.  Gary Payton got absolutely lit up by Nick Van Exel.  No point guard in history is really expected to shut down Curry or Westbrook(and I'm not even saying Paul's an all time defender at pg, he's very good and deserving of the all-nba nods most years however).  Man on man defense can definitely get overvalued, the fact that cp3 can switch onto kevin durant and not get destroyed is hugely valuable.  The fact that you also say Billups was washed up with the Nuggets makes me question if you even watched NBA that year.  Not as good as he was in Det but still played at an excellent level with very good numbers.  People seriously debated if he or Melo was the best player on the Nuggets(Melo had a down year in 09)  The two chokes(14,15) are inexcusable but most greats have some in their career.  They should've got past Hou.  However may I add, Blake was the one who choked more in 15 and there's nothing you can do when josh smith and corey brewer raining 3's.  also Paul is reason the series went a game 5 tied 2-2 vs OKC, it's disingenuous to not admit.  He absolutely won them game 1 going 32/10 on 12/14 shooting.  He went 22.5/11.8 on 61ts% for the series and absolutely outplayed blake, that's still very good and impact/numbers most great pg's can only dream of.     He was pretty good vs SA in 08 even though he may have had a poor game 7 and had a bad 4th qtr in game 3.  It still doesnt change he put up 35pts in game 3 so 4 points is nothing garbage time wise and he was the main reason it was close to the 4th(which you know ofc but are ignoring disingenuously).  Good for West on defense, on offense he put up 20ppg but on 50ts%.  Peja put up 13ppg on 57ts%.  These are not good supporting cast numbers.(Love put up 19 on 53.5ts% in the finals and no one considered lebron to have decent help).  Ortg is pure efficiency.  Look at WS instead which do overrate Paul(because he's literally one of the best all time there) but still should show, Paul had an incredible prime.  Every stat has outliers, no stat is good on its own.  Blocks/steals are terrible for defense(far worse than drtg dbpm etc).  No one is dumb enough to use just ppg to compare people now.  The Rockets would've made the Finals with Paul most likely running the offense and draining some jump shots 3's or midrange(he's actually their best shooter).  The Rockets were also playing a ineffective Mbah a Moute or missing, an important defensive piece especially vs GS.    I dont think people realize how hard it is to add 10 wins to a 55 win team.  It's harder than adding 10 wins to a .500 team.  It's because of how pythagorean records work and teams can only be so good and extra talent becomes redundant(which many people expected with harden/paul during the offseason).  They were 50-5 when harden/paul/capela played with a 12 SRS i think(Hou had a 5.81SRS in 2017) and still had a 8.2SRS overall.  That impact is just great especially on an already very good team.  The rod strickland mention pretty much ruins any chance of me expecting you to be objective.  Strickland scored well, he's not close to Paul as a player and his efficiency was trash.  If you want a good defensive stat, why not use RPM which is mainly impact based.  Paul was 6th for pgs this year even with a down year on defense.  He was an easy first the last 2 years in 16/17 when he had to give effort with blake out."
"“Hey Barnes check out how tan JaVale got.”    Again, Klay, my name is Kevin Durant. I am a different person than Harrison Barnes.    “Lol you’re a riot Barnes.”"
Kevin Durant
"Naaaah bruh. That’s exactly my point. Lebron is the a bigger deal than KD. If KD had just signed and hanging wth Lebron, the headline would be ‘Lebron hanging wih recent lakers signee Kevin Durant’ "
I would say they are the closest ones to locks out of all those guys. But my main point was even if they do leave it's highly unlikely they would join lebron in la. Kevin durant would be essentially killing any legacy he had left if he did that. It just makes zero sense for him to do if the Warriors win again this year. Klay already said he wants to stay and again if he left I couldn't see him doing it by backstabbing the dubs and going to la with lebron unless the Warriors seriously did something to disrespect him. 
"So you're saying the best they can do is replace Steph [Curry], Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, [Andre] Iguodala, and Draymond for this...I'm going to need to hear from that third Lakers executive!"
"It’s meant to be a funny commentary on the argument used when Durant signed with the warriors.  I think you may be overthinking it there bud.  It just strikes me as odd that the community so vehemently defended his ability to choose his workplace and fails to recognize that even a player like Demar can be dealt effectively removing his choice to work in Toronto.  Demar is the common story, not Kevin.  "
Yes if you had Kevin Durant you would’ve won the finals 
Unless you're Kevin Durant
"How dare you make fun of Kevin Durant. He's better at life than you'll ever be. He just had a bad situation in OKC, don't you know?"
"Just a general observation. Obviously Kevin Durant didn’t realize that a franchise is allowed to trade your star teammate or fire your coach or even move the entire organization to a new city, but he’s not allowed to leave them once his contract expires. Silly KD. "
[Maybe LeBron and KD want to make another rap song together.](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/06/05/lebron-james-kevin-durant-rap-song-audio-leaked)

Of course! They broke the headline that LeBron and Kevin Durant were at a bar. /s
"Lebron’s first scandal cheating on his wife with Kevin Durant, he’s already gone full Hollywood."
Kevin Durant did nothing wrong
My least favourite thing is when people use shady front office decisions to justify Kevin Durant making the biggest bitch move in the history of sports. 
"Why Toronto won the trade: To win a NBA championship, you need to have 1 or more of the following: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard. The end. "
Breaking: Porzingis and fat contracts traded to Golden State for Kevin Durant
"Yeah, what kind of statement is that. 3 rings in four years, four All-NBA level talents, *and the wins record they took from the Bulls before they added Kevin Durant*."
- Kevin Durant
"Raptors got swindled hard. DeMar derozan is the one asset they should have not traded for Kawhi. The gm should’ve traded his wife before he gave up DeMar.   Now team chemistry is ruined, Kawhi has no desire to play there, and the fan base is outraged. The gm will likely be fired in a couple of years honestly.   No one will beat the warriors anyways this year. So why the fuck did u give up DeMar derozan and a 1st rounder for 1 year of Kawhi. In what scenario does Kawhi and Kyle Lowry beat Kevin durant, Steph, Klay, draymond and Demarcus cousins?   Raptors should’ve offered 2 First round picks a second, maybe a bench player or two. If spurs said no, then the conversation should’ve ended. "
They won 51 games in Mark Jackson's last season and that was without Kevin Durant lol
When Kevin Durant joins the warriors everyone has to reshuffle
PG: Steph  SG: Michael Jordan  SF: Bird  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Tim Duncan/Russell/Olajuwon
You should stop complaining because it happened two years ago and you should just deal with it. Kevin Durant plays for the Warriors and they are the best team and favorites to win for the third straight year. Like damn dude get over it and quit complaining. 
"PG: Oscar Robertson SG: Jordan SF: Larry Bird PF: Tim Duncan C: Hakeem Olajuwon  Bench: John Stockton Kevin Durant Bill Russell Dirk Nowitzki Dwayne Wade  Wanted to give an actual answer because people are shitting on you, and I also prolly missed some people that should be on but I wanted to have 2 of each position.

"what do you mean? just watch them play. Lowry is absolutely elite, but Paul and Lillard are very clearly on a different level.   if you’re asking why he’s not considered as elite as CP3, Lillard, Steph, Russ... that’s like asking why people don’t consider Gordon Hayward as elite as Kevin Durant. "
"HE HAD A CHOICE. HE COULD HAVE TAKEN THE QUALIFYING OFFER AND BECOME UFA THE FOLLOWING YEAR.  Nerlens Noel took the QO because he wanted more money, which was fair enough. That unfortunately backfired, and he now has to live with that decision. Leonard made the decision to sign the extension, then he should fulfill his contractual duties rather than crying to his uncle saying he doesn't want to play in SA.  But it seemed like he was content playing in SA with the money he would be getting.  And there's this thing called no trade clause - where player can say no to being traded. Current rule is 8 years in the league and 4 years with current team. If players are unhappy about it and think the restrictions should be less strict, then discuss in the next CBA.  Lastly, Kevin Durant didn't like the situation he was in. But he played through his contract and left via free agency. So I am uncertain to why this guy is unable to do so, and even went to the extent about threatening to sit out lmao."
“Kevin Durant is going to Orlando”
"PG: Steph Curry, Penny Hardaway  SG: Rick Barry, Klay Thompson  SF: Kevin Durant, Chris Mullin  PF: Nate Thurmond, Draymond Green  C: Wilt Chamberlain, Demarcus Cousins"
"Seeing all of these sad posts about Derozan-Kawhi, and then, seeing “I don’t give a f*ck” from DeMarcus Cousins on joining an already championship team, which was *already* a championship team before Kevin Durant arrived.  He doesn’t give a fuck, folks."
"You think adding Kevin Durant to a 73 win team (best in history by the way) doesn't guarantee a championship? That's like arguing that hand sanitizer doesn't kill all germs. Like ok, it kills 99.99% of germs but that's .01% is never going to matter."
I'm in the same boat. This is the same guy that hurt Kevin Durant.
Let me introduce you to Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant gave up when Curry fucked Durant’s mom in college. Durant then tried to fight Curry, but Curry pulled up with his homies, making the fight a 5v1 instead of a 1v1. Curry and his homies beat the hell out of Durant, and when the police confronted them about it, Curry told the police that Durant was beaten up by his own mom, who Curry had fucked the day before. The police believed it, and Durant’s mom was given 10 years in prison. Durant to this day still holds a gigantic grudge against Curry."

So basically it’s alright if I call Kevin Durant a little bitch?
"No one tells a team, ""Hey, you can't sign that good player!  You're already too good, and with him you'd win way too much!""  Because that's stupid.    But people are fine with telling players ""Hey, don't go to that team you want to play for.  With the great teammates, great coach, ownership willing to spend what it takes, and in a great area for (rich) people to live. Because then you'll win too much.""  It's just a stupid thing to get upset at a person about, especially for the fans who turn around and use the ""It's just business, they have to look out for their own best interests"" line when a team treats a loyal, good player poorly.  Why is Kevin Durant supposed to give a shit about the ""competitiveness of the league"" when he's making decisions about his personal future?    Ok, your team's chances of winning a championship will be lower while they're together.  There are plenty of fans of teams that would never have a chance to win a championship during that time regardless of how good the Warriors are, and they don't hate him any less, for the same stupid reasons."
Once again people are not mad that KD left OKC (besides OKC fans of course) the general public is mad about him going to a 73 win team after just choking a 3-1 lead to them. Stop trying to make this narrative and Leonard situation about Kevin Durant. His was a different situation and y'all know it.
"&gt;Golden State Warriors lead guard **Stephen Curry** already owns the franchise record for three-pointers made, attempted and free-throw percentage.   &gt;   &gt;Soon, he may be able to add assists to the list, too.   &gt;   &gt;At the moment, Curry is 628 helpers behind franchise legend and Hall-of-Fame floor general **Guy Rodgers** for the lead. Curry has only had more than 628 assists in a year once in his career, back in his breakout 2013-14 campaign when he averaged 8.5 of them nightly over 78 games played.   &gt;   &gt;If the two-time MVP is able to suit up in at least 70 contests next season, he’ll have to average nine assists per game to break the record by the end of the campaign. Definitely doable, especially as Curry will still have the likes of **Kevin Durant**, **Klay Thompson** and **Draymond Green** to distribute the ball to, as well as the fact there will be a certain behemoth joining the squad in **DeMarcus Cousins** who Curry will be eager to feed dimes to, as well.  this person doesn't watch Golden State basketball."
"It's not that he isn't happy, it's just [not meaningful like he thought it would be](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kevin-durant-i-thought-championship-would-fill-void-but-it-didnt/).  My guess why? Its because the journey matters. We exalt championships because they represent overcoming the competition. Did KD really do that?"
"This is a dumb argument, we’re just getting caught up in semantics. Kevin Durant works for the warriors who work for the NBA. Both our points are true.   You ask what KD owes the nba? He owes them his job because without the NBA then the warriors and thunder don’t exist. "
tell that to kevin durant oh wait
Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Paul George  Carmelo Anthony   Kevin Durant  (Small Ball lineup) Crazy how talented our team would be considering we’ve only been around since 2007
"He plays the same position as LeBron James and Kevin Durant, who are easily top five players at their position of all time, and now play in the same conference. I don't think that it's a mark against him to be worse than either of those guys when he's a really fucking good player. "
"If we're looking at the 2020 playoffs you need to start factoring in the ages of key players for both teams. Also, we need to assume Boogie will no longer be a Warrior since no matter how well he plays this year the most Golden State can offer him to re-sign next summer is only about $6 million per year. So here's the ages of the key players for Golden State:    Player | Age in 2020 playoffs ---|--- Kevin Durant | 31 Steph Curry | 32 Draymond Green | 30 Klay Thompson | 30 Andre Igoudala | 36 Shaun Livingston | 33 Jordan Bell | 25 Kevon Looney | 24  And here would be the ages of the key Lakers on this hypothetical team in the 2020 playoffs:  Player | Age in 2020 playoffs ---|--- LeBron James | 35 Kawhi Leonard | 28 Brandon Ingram | 22 Lonzo Ball | 22 Kyle Kuzma | 24 Josh Hart | 25 Kentavious Caldwell-Pope | 27 Svi Mykhailiuk | 23  Now while we can probably assume the Warriors Core 4 guys will still be in their prime and should be if not fully what they are now, pretty close, you have to wonder how much Igoudala and Shaun Livingston will be able to contribute by then, and those guys are key. Now for the Lakers if LeBron hits a wall due to age and his game falls off a cliff, then this is probably all academic, but it seems highly unlikely he's going to be too terribly worse than he is now. And virtually everyone else on the Lakers should be appreciably better in two years than they are now just due to getting closer to entering their primes. That series could be a lot more hotly contested than you're making it out to be."
Fuxkin Kevin Durant
"Go to LA in the middle of the season on a whim? You can't just do that, dude.  Beyond that, his family doesn't want to live in Texas (or Toronto). They stay in San Diego because that's where they want to raise their daughter. He doesn't want to uproot his family out of San Diego.   Kawhi's reputation is fine. NBA players are way more upset at the way the Raptors just did DeMar than anything Kawhi did. Players are for other players controlling their destiny. They're not bootlickers to an organization like a lot of fans are. There is absolutely no reason for an NBA player to be loyal to an organization.  Lakers fan has nothing to do with that, but thanks for using the laziest argument tactic in the book by flair-bashing. I will defend any player's ability to have more control of their careers. I've defended Kevin Durant and LeBron's moves on here before for the same reasons."
"Last I checked, Kevin “Snek” Durant still has a shitload of endorsements. Winning does that."
"Cue Kevin Durant ""My Next Chapter"" meme"
So he can’t get better? He can’t learn more because he is 28? Kevin Durant just won MVP and said you always need be training and learning.  Sharpen the sword
"Somehow convince everyone that Harden, Curry, Westbrook, Lebron, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant AND maybe CP3 isn't 1) in the same conference and 2) aren't better then him. That's not to mention Simmons, Embiid, Kawhi, Kyrie, Jimmy Butler, Porzingis, Giannis"
Anonymous NBA Player...that's a really unique way of spelling Kevin Durant.
"Ah yes because Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Morris, and Shane Larkin are clearly on the same level as Kevin Durant and Demarcus Cousins, not to mention getting both Curry and Klay on discounts, totally the same thing though "
Remember when the mayor declared Kevin Durant Day a citywide holiday?
*Rudy Cline-Thomas* shared a personal anecdote about KD asking him about business opportunities in the Bay Area in May 2016.  *Kevin Durant* laughingly characterized that as him 'basically' telling Cline-Thomas he was going to the Warriors.  *Rich Kleiman* said the characterization was 'hardly factual'.  *Rich Klein* is a name you made up.  I shouldn't have to correct you on the details of your own citation.
KD himself is probably the least trustworthy source out there Heres this article from just a week ago. He was already planning to go to the warriors.    Iggy says he was committed by the time he lost to them. Dray basically  called kd a liar for denying it.  https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-durant-reveals-knew-signing-171859855.html

"Kevin Durant joining meant that the Warriors had an extra offensive option, one that was one of the all-time scorers. That obviously had an impact on the way they ran their offense, and the way they ran their offense had an impact on the sorts of shots that Curry was willing to take, and the rhythm he'd get into as a result."
Kevin Durant joining shouldn't have had any negative impact on Steph's shot making from 35 feet away
"That's because he was. I wonder if he could have kept it up if Kevin Durant hadn't joined the team... if the rumors about him leaving next summer are true, maybe we'll find out."
Kevin Durant is now a member of the Orlando Magic
"Dirk really never should have won a title either, it took a massive chokejob from LeBron for that to happen.

"It's not egregious at all compared to other players, especially his OKC teammates.   James Harden has spent 6 seasons with Houston, 3 games without attempting any free throws.  Westbrook has had 10 games without any freethrows in his past 6 seasons, although two of those games were below 10 minutes so closer to about 8 games.   Kevin Durant has 12 games in his entire career without any free throws. 5 of those being with GSW. He has only 7 games before that without any free throws, 6 if you ignore the game as a Sonic where he played only 12 minutes.    A player who is not only a 1st option, but has a basketball playstyle where he literally shoot 3s and drives in, is it at all surprising if he doesn't have many games where he shoots literally 0 free throws?  I get that framing a sentence with negative connotations and then attaching Harden's name on it is easy karma, but James Harden and free throws feels like the basketball version of ""but her emails"" at this point.   "

"To say he was “never close to a prospect” is disingenuous at best. People were talking about Wiggins being the next big thing when he was 15.   Also, I can pretty comfortably state that I don’t think Oden had the talent to be as good as Kevin Durant.   By the way, there’s ways to argue without being a dick. Generally makes your point a lot better. "

Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant I started watching basketball his rookie season. He was a beast and watching him grow has been fun to watch. 6'11 with a 7'4.5 wingspan and one of the greatest scorers of this generation.
"James Harden = ZZ Top   Kevin Durant = Whitesnake   Jarell Martin = The Who   Javaris Crittenton and Derrick Rose = G'n'R   Chuck, Shaq, the Jet = Talking Heads   The 2016 Golden State Warriors = Big L   N/A = Sonic Youth"
"Drake is Kevin Durant. He keeps lighting it up, but a lot of people are kinda tired of the way he acts sometimes. A household name even outside of basketball."
"The Big 3: Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard and Cedi Osman with a player named Kevin Durant."
"Kobe, LeBron, Durant, MJ, Kareem.  Those five are firmly the top 5 imo.  I would say Shaq is also definitely above Dirk.  Malone is arguably better.  So no I don't think Dirk is in the conversation for top 5.  Durant is definitely better and it really isn't as close as you are making it seem.  Durant can do everything Dirk could and more.  Durant is a better 3pt shooter.  Durant is a 4x scoring champ in 11 seasons.  Dirk has never once lead the league in scoring.  This sub loves Dirk and hates KD, but I'm not sure how you guys think it is ridiculous to say Kevin Durant is a better scorer by a decent margin.  Also why is it relevant that he revolutionized his position? "
"It's not anymore unfair than Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Demarcus Cousins with Igoudala coming off the bench."
Kevin durant cuz whats the fun in knowing what will happen

"That is sort of their goal, I think.  Kinda like the Sonics playing Kevin Durant at shooting guard in year 1.  It makes Durant a better player long-term while making the Sonics a worse team in that year, which makes it easier to get a high pick.  Atlanta doesn't care if Trae shoots 33% from 3 on 600 attempts if it speeds his development curve for future seasons.  It will also give them great lottery odds.  "

Kevin Durant.  Supreme scorer. Supreme skill. Deadly anywhere on the court.

"Kevin Durant . I dont like him but he can drive, he can shoot midrange , he can fadeaway, he shoots 3 and have high release point. And if get fouled he shoot good freethrows."
"Listed heights are bullshit as well.  They lie for a variety of reasons and it's never corrected.  Kevin Durant recently admitted he's actually 7 feet.  Barkley was listed at 6'6, but admits he was actually 6'4.  Supposedly Jordan was also 6'4 without shoes.  Kobe's wife says Kobe is actually 6'4 and 3/4.  People were puzzled when they saw a pic of 6'10 Kevin McHale (then coach) towering over 6'10 Al Jefferson and McHale admitted he has always been over 7 feet, but just lied because back then you were considered a freak.   LeBron is another one who probably undersells how tall he actually is.  I've heard he's around 6'10 270.  "
"Nobody has ever said he was a bad teammate except the media and r/nba  [KD, thinking he was on his burner account, blamed everyone except for Westbrook](https://me.me/i/adodla-cat-kevin-durant-replied-h-colecashwell-5m-kdtrey5-man-i-18970110) "
He won’t be in position to help much if he’s guarding Kevin Durant. Besides you don’t start committing players to so much help defense when they’re defending this level of passing and shooting

Steph Curry when he chews on his mouthpiece. Such a bad habit man... or Kevin Durant for being the tallest biggest wanna be ever. Or maybe draymond for being annoying prick.   Maybe it’s just the whole golden state warriors since they win all the time and I’m a hater.
&gt; Pg situation is apples and oranges.     How is it apples to oranges? PG said he is not signing another contract with Pacers and he also said he dreams about playing in Los Angles. Kawhi himself hasn't said shit about his future plans.    &gt; Let's not pretend that Toronto is anywhere close to being on the same level as okc     We are better than OKC with much more future flexibility. They haven't been better than us since Kevin Durant left. We are also competing in the east.        Toronto as a city is not comparable to Oklahoma as well. 
"And you’re actually Kevin Durant, aren’t you? o_O"
"Don't sleep on the Warriors either.   PG - Stephen Curry, SG - Klay Thompson, SF - Kevin Durant, PF - Rick Barry, C - Wilt Chamberlain  With Draymond, Webber, Mullin, Richmond, etc off the bench.  "
"Every advantage? The warriors had Steph, Klay, and Draymond against LeBron and delly the first go around since love got his shoulder ripped out and Kyrie broke his knee. Then after we beat them they cried and got on their knees and added Kevin Durant. That's an advantage? Are you stupid? "
"&gt; Your entire argument seems to boil down to yeah we could go 1005 mph but 1000 mph is basically the same thing.   My argument is that you can get to 1100 mph doing other stuff but everyone is obsessed with the fashionable tweak that takes you from 1000 to 1005.  &gt; These edges are tiny and make a huge difference in the long run.  Yes, exactly. When there are other huge differences (say for example, everything Jokić does on offense compared to a guy like Embiid) that are not regarded as widely. Jokić is, and has been, a better center than Embiid by any measurement derived from on-court impact, and the reason for that is his offense is just below the Curry/Durant/LeBron/Harden/Chris Paul tier of offensive engines. He's so phenomenally good on offense that the Embiid comparison shouldn't end when someone mentions ""defense"". The rim protection gap is only 2 points a game--an elite offensive player can make that deficit up!  On the lower tiers you see similar things. Is Horford worse than Gobert? I'm not so sure. Is Kevin Love a worse center than Capela? That question sounds silly, but he is probably better, and I really doubt the somewhat-competent-in-analytics crowd is willing to overlook ""rim protection"" to come to that conclusion.  You didn't acknowledge it at first but now it seems like you're willing to give Kanter either ""better"" or ""a wash"" offensively with DAJ and Capela. I don't think he's better, but I think it's interesting that Kanter's reputation is so low that you will almost never see anyone praising his offense, while you'll hear plenty of people talk about Capela's excellent efficiency at the rim. Kanter is also good offensively!   Would I put Kanter over Capela on a playoff team with great playmaking already on the team? No. Is he underrated because of his reputation as a bad rim protector? Yes."
"Paul George caliber players are the dark horse all stars in this western conference, not Andrew Wiggins caliber players. Just look how stacked this list of options is:   Harden  Westbrook  Lebron  Curry  CP3  Jimmy Butler  Karl Anthony-Towns  Anthony Davis  Klay Thompson  Kevin Durant  Draymond Green  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Rudy Gobert  Damian Lillard  Paul George  LaMarcus Aldridge  Demar DeRozan  Nikola Jokic  DeAndre Jordan "
Arguably Cleveland's all-time best team. Too bad the Warriors massively upgraded with Kevin Durant...
"1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry    4. Kyrie Irving  5. Anthony Davis   (Harden is 6th, dip in playoff scoring makes me prefer other players)  Next 4 would be Giannis, Lillard, Leonard, and Westbrook would round out the top 10"
"&gt; Giannis with Durant's shooting  So, Kevin Durant?"
Kevin Durant. I used to dislike him in his early Thunder days and now I just admire and respect almost everything about the guy
http://nbatitlechase.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kevin-Durant-Covers-His-Entire-Body-In-A-Blanket.jpg  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bfff9_ECYAAqVIl.jpg
"Agreed, Stephs imapact on a offense is insane how he shifts that side of the floor and his deep shooting forces you to switch every PNR or double it. Kd is the better individual player because of versatility but Steph is a entire offensive system  Steph anywhere below three is selling him short. Steph is enemy number one for opposing defenses and this is while playing with KEVIN DURANT. Teams would rather a top 3 scorer of all time go 1 on 1 rather than to let Steph shoot. That tells you all you need to know right there"
"I'd certainly say Stockton was as skilled, if not more so, than Curry in a different way.  Curry's skill set is ideal for the modern NBA, but Stockton could have retired SIX YEARS earlier and still be the Assist Leader. Add on his ability to be an All Defense player and he's skilled.  Achievements. no, but pure skill?  Right now, Curry's records seem insane, but in 1995 the concept of Kevin Durant was insane, LeBron James was a thing of Science Fiction. And young kids are shooting more and more 3's, it went from a niche part of the game in the 90s to a primary offensive thing. It's not unreasonable to think that Curry's records won't be as dominant in fifteen years."
"Good thing they have both Kevin Durant and Demarcus Cousins.   But I mean Lebron becomes less of a problem each year going forward, and it isn't as if Harden was lighting the Warriors on fire during the last series. Even in the games that they won, Harden and Capela didn't exactly have dominant games.   It's a high bar. "
"Hey, he's only a couple of years away from being Kevin Durant at this point right?"
You mean Dwight ‘Kevin Durant’ Howard? 
"The All-Defense awards were unwarranted because he was good at the one aspect of defense that's highly visible, one-on-one on-ball defense. His help and off-ball defense was weak and both the eye test and defensive value metrics corroborate this.  The same thing is happening with Kevin Durant currently, with the inaccurate myth that he's a good defender because he gets a lot of blocks.  What compared to the players in the top 10 like Kareem, Garnett, Duncan, etc. yes his longevity is not on the same level."
Nope he hogged the ball too much and drove Kevin Durant out of town. 
Kevin Durant is underrated on all-time lists... He should be top 14 already.
"Wasn’t his fault he was so much genetically better, Lebron’s also genetically better than everyone in the league or Kevin Durant. Should we downplay their achievements?"
Kris Dunn for Kevin Durant
"Yes, Westbrook takes way more criticism than he deserves for the way his teams have played. Seeing Kevin Durant on the Warriors should make it clear that the lack of ball movement went beyond Westbrook. Westbrook's shot selection is obviously his biggest flaw, but part of that is due to the system they run. Even if you ignore the influence of system the narrative that people don't want to play with WB because of that is garbage. Players respect Westbrook's willingness to take tough shots down the stretch and it was clear in the 2016 WCF that Westbrook was trying to inolve KD. Westbrook does sometimes struggle to trust his teammates but some of that has to do with their play style. KD Paul George and Melo all have a tendency to settle for a difficult fadeaway when they could get to the rim. I think if you saw Westbrook on a team with better off ball movement he'd be less likely to take all those pull up threes, but too often he has 3 teammates standing covered on the perimeter and when they go under the screen the best shot he knows is available is the open pull up 3. If he doesn't take that shot the possession is most likely to end in a difficult fadeaway anyway so he'd rather put it on himself. "
"First off, you didn’t reply to most of my points. Secondly, you cherry picked the ones you did.  &gt; Yes, duh. They're gonna pay a hefty tax bill until this run is over no matter what happens. But stuff like only paying Livingston ä2million instead of $7.7 million for his last year is gonna make a much bigger impact in their tax bill depending on how high it's gonna be at the time. That's why they gave themselves some wriggle room.  No it will it not because the warriors would be In the highest “repeat offender” tax. That additional tax, would offset the 5 million Livingston’s deal saved. It gave you absolutely no wiggle room whatsoever.   &gt; Yeah, and now they get to eat the profit of it. Funny how that works.  You don’t what profit means because they haven’t recouped. (A point I brought up that you chose to not respond too) See to profit, you have to have made back all the money you put into it first. They put a billion into it. *They’re not to close* recouping the cost of that stadium. That stadiums cost will be sky high due to the cost of living in San Francisco. (All points I mentioned that you chose not to respond too).  They’re not close to profiting of it because they haven’t come near to recouping what they put in. Funny how that works.     &gt; Also why do you keep going on about Klay's potential max  when he's the one guy who already said he wouldn't mind taking a pay cut?  A pay cut? You wouldn’t be asking Klay to just take a pay cut. You’d be asking him to take $15-20 Million less than you could offer him and then you would still have to pay either or both Kevin Durant and Draymond. To still be in the luxury tax *and* to be a repeat offender meaning you get taxed more.  California has some of the highest income taxes in the country. Taxes in California take more than half of Klay’s check. So Klay’s taking a 15 million dollar pay cut to make 25 Million a year, just to give 13 of that to the state of CA? No. "
"&gt;	aye so lucky their backcourt was still recovering from injuries and they were missing one of their closers  And the Rockets were the picture of health by comparison. But hey, I am sure Iguodala, the fifth-best guy on the Warriors, is much closer in impact to *Chris Paul* than he is to, say, LBAM. That sure sounds like a good-faith counterpoint to me!  &gt;	c mon man they weren't losing that series this is one of the dumbest takes out  A.) Probably not, but we were also robbed of the chance to find out.  B.) Being lucky is not the same as saying, “You only won because of a fluke.”  That should not be a hard concept, but apparently you guys want to act as if people are saying the Warriors never should have won anything.  Just because the Warriors probably would have won in like six games does not mean it was not lucky the series became a total joke.  But I guess acknowleding that would require *actual meaningful engagement with the issue at hand*, and you are clesrly muchh more committed to reflexively dismissing anything which could cast the slightest aspersions on what is apparently the most wonderful and deserving and flawless team in the history of basketball.  &gt;	missing Jrue holiday and mike conley for 1 game each in series that were a sweep and 6 games wasn't changing the landscape of either series.   See above reply. You are also underselling the injuries to Holiday and to Conley (which is especially funny considering how much you are trying to sell the various aches and pains experienced by the Warriors at different times), and you are glossing over the injuries to the Rockets.  &gt;	love would've been a net negative in that series and Kyrie wasn't changing that series either - the Warriors would've won in 7 regardless  This is an idiotic and baseless take. Yes, the Cavaliers, who were exhausted after Game 3 and basically only had a rotation of six actual players at that point, would have been harmed by the inclusion of Love. Their main strategy - slowing down the game and trying to dominate the boards - would have really suffered if Kevin Love enter into the big rotation with Mozgov and Thompson. And Kyrie, who in the subsequent two series went toe-to-toe with Curry, would not have contributed to another win or two.  Brilliant.  &gt;	their 2nd best player suspended when he shouldn't have been only after Lebron pleaded to the NBA office..  Mm hmm, if Draymond is not belatedly penalised for his constant misbehaviour prior to this series, maybe the Cavaliers only beat the Warriors in Oracle by fourteen points in game five, rather than win by... what was it, twenty-something? Man, just imagine how ”lucky” all of the Kings opponents used to be when they used to play the Kings duribg one of Boogie’s suspensions. And we should just ignore the two times the Warriors lost after that, right?  Like the injury advantage is reasonably legitimate - although that advantage still pales in comparison to the advantage the Warriors had from injuries to Paul, Leonard, and Irving + Love - but it is grossly disingenuous to act as if a blowout loss at home - which was followed by two more losses! - would have transformed into another game five closing win.  &gt;	they didn't get lucky to sign durant they got him because they were the best run organisation in the league  Ah, I forgot the literally unprecedented cap jump was a result of how well-run the Warriors were. Do you guys go to a class on how to spin everything in toward the Warriors? Unbelievable.  &gt;	damn man you're stretching now how is this even relevant?  Yes, no possible relevance to being able to draft a superstar who, if any other organisation had those two picks in front of them, probably never would have fallen to them. It is certainly a most isolated point of luck, but considering they were the primary benefitting party from what might constitute one of the all-time worst and most nonsensical draft decisions by a team, I think it is worth mentioning. And while we are at it, it is also lucky that the three guys they drafted ended up being as good as they are, but at least that is something which can be credited to the actions of the players themselves, rather than fluke, series-swinging injuries on the opposing side. Hey, look, I just gave you another point you can disingenuously paint as wholly representative of my supposed clear and abject bias; I am sure the rest of your fellow Golden State circle-jerkers will really appreciate it!  &gt;	Everything you said is pure confirmation bias, you completely ignore the other side and play up shit like Jrue Holiday missing a single game in a series finishing 4-0 as ""lucky""  Lol, what a good-faith representation. Just a little debate tip: when your conclusion focuses on vague complaints of “pure confirmation bias” and unsubstantiated (and comically hypocritical) charges of “completely ignor[ing] the other side,” and then requires you to portray a relevant yet minor aside as the crux of the opposition’s entire argument, you may as well be declaring, “I have no valid standing here and thus cannot meaningfully respond to the actual issue at hand.”  I wonder, do Warriors cultists ever tire of defending the inherent infallibility of their bandwagon of choice, or are some of you self-aware enough to occasionally perceive the fundamental absurdity of this need to whitewash all possible negative contextual details?"
"4 WCFs and 1 Finals trips while fucking Kevin Durant was on the team, lol. "
"I think there is a pretty big difference in circumstances though.  KD made some questionable comments about OKC as an organization after he left and he went to a team that was probably one of their (if not - about to be) biggest rivals at the time, especially post 2016 WCF. His team clearly could've won that series and while I don't think their job rests on his shoulders, but rather the team as a whole - it's pretty spineless to get beaten like that and then leave to go to that team.  On the other hand, Lebron was born and raised in Cleveland. He never had a strong team put around him during his first stint. His management failed him. When he left it was too match the Boston team that he wouldn't be able to get past by making a team of greater strength in Miami.   The sourest part of Lebron's departure was The Decision, which I think everyone acknowledges was in poor taste - even if it was for a good cause.  While I do still agree that Kevin Durant would be welcomed back by OKC, I firmly believe a notable percentage of the fanbase would be pretty upset. Might lose some longtime fans honestly. I know that something like that would put a pretty sour taste in my mouth."
Now you’ve got me thinking about how Kevin Durant is the Lu Bu of NBA
First time I’ve heard Kevin Durant and steroids in the same sentence 
"Longevity, a statline of 40k 10k 10k, at least 15 All NBA First teams, at least 2-3 more titles with him being the Finals MVP in all of them,   preferably 6 or greater to at least match MJ's total, heck maybe even just 2 more titles if at least one of them is over the Kevin Durant Warriors.yb  LeBron may very well be better in vacuum right now. Just need the accolades."
Kris Dunn for Kevin Durant
kevin durant
Lmao that's a load of shit. You think any team with Durant and Kevin Love on it is getting knocked out in the first round of or possibly not even making the playoffs in that shit show of an eastern conference?  Hell I'd argue that for regular seasons sake they'd have been better off with Durant. 
"Yeah, these look like standard NBA moves (stopped 50 seconds in).  They just look the same because they have the same body type.  A cross-over then a layup is not something that only Kevin Durant can do.  "
"Well, Kevin Durant would pay a lot for it, but only if it was one click ordering.  He doesn't want to work too hard for a ring.  "
Mine are:  1. Kevin Durant 2. Steph Curry 3. Kawhi Leonard 4.  James Harden 5. Nikola Jokic (my long shot dark horse)
"Bro every 13 year old kid and their mother is rocking a warriors number 30 jersey. His wife has a cooking show, his daughter is a meme, and his style of play has inspired millions of children to jack up Ill-advised three pointers in their aau games. He’s the only player who has arguably usurped Lebron’s “face of the league” status in the last 6-7 years with his 2015-2016 domination. Kevin Durant is not a bigger star than Steph Curry."
"Great scorer, lanky athlete, big bushy mustache and glasses. I say he might be as good as Kevin Durant."
"Reggie Miller is another great shooter with a strange looking shot. And rookies almost always struggle adjusting to shooting in the NBA (believe it or not Lonzo shot better from three last year than Kevin Durant did in his rookie season). I think it's too early to draw any kind of conclusions about Lonzo as a shooter at this point, same as with any rookie who's only 20. Compare Lonzo's shooting with guys like Fox or DSJ and it's not much different, but I expect some or all of those guys to figure it out eventually."
"Vince Carter wasnt even as good as Tracy McGrady and you have him over kevin durant, harden, and westbrook?"
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is Brandon Ingram on steroids 
"boston's poised to pay horford almost 60 mil over the next two years, marcus smart has 52 guaranteed, and they're paying Gordon Hayward more than kevin Durant, but they're involved in a league-wide conspiracy to save a few mil on brad's contract? I must be an idiot, because that makes no sense to me"
"Here are all the players better than him that will hit FA.   1. Kevin Durant- could re-sign with GS now that they have bird rights or go to NY  2. Kawhi Leonard- wants to be in LA(doesnt care which team) but can also re-sign in T.O for more money  3. Kyrie- supermax from boston or go to NY. Plays same position as Dame  4. Butler- probably goes to NY   5. Klay- re-sign or LA  6. Al Horford- probably opts in to 30 mill player option and stays on a winning team.  Theres enough money on the 2 LA and 2 NY teams to grab these guys. And even if there isnt, they're gonna have many teams to look at before they think about Portland."
Best duo ever? Michael Westbrook and Kevin Durant?
"major implications for the careers of several superstars:  magic johnson = 6 career championships  clyde drexler = 2 career championships  charles barkley = 1 career championship  shawn kemp &amp; gary payton = 1 &amp; 2 career championships respectively  john stockton &amp; karl malone = 2 career championships  dirk nowitzki = 0 championships as of 2018  kevin durant, russel westbrook, &amp; james harden = 0, 0,&amp; 0 championships respectively as of 2018  tim duncan = 2 career championships  steph curry = 0 championships as of 2018    "
"No he didn’t. Melo just wasn’t a good fit but he never did wrong by the thunder, if anything the fan base did wrong by Melo. Look, Westbrook signed his super max in large part because of the Melo trade, who had to waive his no trade clause to get here. Paul George absolutely wouldn’t have signed a long term deal if Westbrook wasn’t locked into one. Melo waiving his no trade clause was so good for us that I’m not sure Russ and Paul aren’t wearing Laker gold right no without him in our history. On top of that instead of being difficult Melo waived his NTC again allowing us to have Schroder instead of dead money.  In addition to all that Melo did something no other superstar did for our fan base who is not named Westbrook, he chose OKC. Melo was important for our fan morale. The narrative was and is still somewhat that nobody wants to play with Russ, well Melo and Paul George did.  And Melo genuinely gave us what he had last year, we had a role for him that he wasn’t used to and he fucking tried. It just didn’t work out.  No I’m not going to let anybody act like Melo did us dirty, especially not be compared to Kevin Durant. "
So the rockets now have a Kevin Durant. Ruining the league.
"Because Kevin Durant is a big dickhead  Edit: downvote me all you want Kevin, you’re still a dickhead."
Lmao did Kevin Durant and Steph Curry die?
"Yep. I love the support on this sub for people who have mental health issues, but when so many posts and comments get upvoted attacking Kevin Durant on a personal level, it rings kind of hollow. "
"I agree, I am not Kevin Durant btw! Kevin Durant should be respected. Kevin Durant is the Best! And he is so smart! Yes! And handsome! He gets like every girl ever! He is immune to cooties even! All you cats need to chill!!!"
Kevin Durant is getting hate for no reason
#fuck you Kevin Durant 
Yes because Kevin Durant was a real head scratcher of a pick after oden was off the board /s
Yeah and it also helps when they have Kevin Durant added.  Had it still been the original big 3 and they came up short again like in 2016 they probably expect more money.
"I was invited to Las Vegas this past Summer to help Team USA with their conditioning before they head off to London, and as we know they would eventually bring home the Gold (USA). I've had the opportunity to work with Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade in the past but this would be my first interaction with Kobe. We first met three days before the first scrimmage, on the day of the first practice, early July. It was a brief conversation where we talked about conditioning, where he would like to be by the end of the Summer, and we talked a little bit about the hustle of the Select Team. Then he got my number and I let him know that if he ever wanted some extra training he could hit me up any time.  The night before the first scrimmage I remember I was just watched ""Casablanca"" for the first time and it was about 3:30 AM. I lay in bed, slowly fading away when I hear my cell ring. It was Kobe. I nervously picked up.  ""Hey, uhh Rob, I hope I'm not disturbing anything right?""  ""Uhh no, what's up Kob?""  ""Just wondering if you could just help me out with some conditioning work, that's all.""  I checked my clock. 4:15 AM.  ""Yeah sure, I'll see you in the facility in a bit.""  It took me about twenty minutes to get my gear and out of the hotel. When I arrived and opened the room to the main practice floor I saw Kobe. Alone. He was drenched in sweat as if he had just taken a swim. It wasn't even 5AM.  We did some conditioning work for the next hour and fifteen minutes. Then we entered the weight room, where he would do a multitude of strength training exercises for the next 45 minutes. After that we parted ways and he went back to the practice floor to shoot. I went back to the hotel and crashed. Wow.  And then:  I was expected to be at the floor again at about 11 AM. I woke up feeling sleepy, drowsy, and almost pretty much every side effect of sleep deprivation. Thanks, Kobe. I had a bagel and headed to the practice facility.  This next part I remember very vividly. All the Team USA players were there, feeling good for the first scrimmage. LeBron was talking to Carmelo if I remember correctly and Coach Krzyzewski was trying to explain something to Kevin Durant. On the right side of the practice facility was Kobe by himself shooting jumpers. And this is how our next conversation went -- I went over to him, patted him on the back and said, ""Good work this morning.""  ""Huh?""  ""Like, the conditioning. Good work.""  ""Oh. Yeah, thanks Rob. I really appreciate it.""  ""So when did you finish?""  ""Finish what?""  ""Getting your shots up. What time did you leave the facility?""  ""Oh just now. I wanted 800 makes so yeah, just now.""  My jaw dropped. Mother of holy God..."
I don’t understand why people say Kevin Durant is 250lbs lol. He’s probably not even 225. Snakes do have a tough time putting on weight
"Lebron joins heat = “oh his rings don’t mean anything. Kevin Durant hounds lakers = “couldn’t do it himself”.  Now I’m not comparing Mellon to these players, but my point stands. "
"Golden State Warriors’ general manager Bob Myers proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Stephen Curry and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured center Boogie Cousins yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Shaun Livingston gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Klay Thompson yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Durant hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”  “At the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,” Draymond said. “I know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that’s my mindset.”"
"GSW won 73 games, added All-Star Kevin Durant, then won 67 games with him."
"In what sense did I make something up? I made a not-so-original joke about a player, and then gave my opinion about the dude. If you can't handle that because you're too fucking fragile, then maybe you should just unsub and go defend your man somewhere else.  Unless.. am I speaking to Kevin Durant right now? If so, its an honor to have shit posted about you. Have a great season and stay healthy!"
Too bad Kevin Durant was there at 8:30 AM
You just described this sub's relationship with Kevin Durant.
"Kevin ""waking up at 8am is hard"" durant"
http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12596449/kevin-durant-says-love-stick-oklahoma-city-thunder-whole-career
No that's just silly. He's Kevin fucking Durant. Literally any team would give him as much as possible if he wanted to go to their team. Comparing him to Wiggins...
"The idea that Kevin Durant, probably the second best player of the last 10 years has to prove himself for a contract. "
1. Lebron James 2. Shaq 3. Kyrie 4. Kevin Durant 5. Russell Westbrook 6. Kobe Bryant 7. Steve Nash 8. Dirk Nowitzki 9. Allen Iverson 10. Tim Duncan
"The ""best player in the league title"" is fluid and constantly switches from Steph Curry, LeBron James and Kevin Durant. If I had to rank them it would be   1. LeBron James  1a. Kevin Durant  1b. Steph Curry  Steph Curry does things that make him the best player in the game no matter who's on the floor. His weakness is his physicality and the unusual amount of fouls that aren't called for him. Steph Curry is the most cerebral of the three, but he can be made uncomfortable by teams with physical defense. Also, Steph Curry needs to add the mid range to his game, for those nights he goes 0/10 from three. If he's cold, he needs to see that ball go in but refuses to take 2 pointers. It's frustrating  Kevin Durant is a transcendant scoring talent who sees the game on a higher level ever since he joined the Warriors. His weakness is that he's not as mentally strong as LeBron or Steph and is prone to breakdowns (Steph is the leader of the Warriors, even though KD is the most talented). I don't knock him for not being an alpha like Stephen A. Smith. Some people aren't born to lead, and that's okay  LeBron James brings more to the game than anybody else. LeBron has a lot of weaknesses, the first being his mental strength (which he has improved on the last few years) and the second is LeBron James isn't willing to play off the ball. This is why high IQ teams beat him in the finals (Mavericks, Spurs, Warriors). LeBron also isn't a good leader, but better than KD  &amp;#x200B;  Every time I get close to saying these things about any of these players I get murdered by there respective fan bases. It gets exhausting but its what I believe"
"My point is those guys have led their own teams and still didnt win any title.  What did PG achieve in Indiana all those years? Losing to Lebron in the ECF?   Harden only recently won MVP, but the rockets werent really contenders until CP3 came in. Before then the rockets made it to the WCF once and didnt really make any significant noise in the playoffs. Obviously Hardens numbers went up after he joined a team he wasnt coming off the bench.  Kevin Durant joined a team that went 73-9 in the regular season before almost swept everyone in the playoffs in 2017. This guy is the reason why warriors are heavy favourites to win every year.  Oladipo? What did Oladipo accomplish when he was in Orlando? Was he an all star talent back then before he joined the thunder? In fact, Oladipo credits Westbrook for pushing himself to get over that hump.  But nah Westbrick amirite lol?    "
LeBron James is the best player in Miami Heat history and it isnt close.  Steph Curry is more of a lock for the HOF than Kevin Durant.

"First of all, you do realize every star's TS% generally goes down in the playoffs and finals? Rare exceptions exist like Kevin Durant, and even then that's based off a few samples easily influenced by outliers as his overall playoff stats are far closer to his average. That's true for MJ as well. You still have yet to elaborate which ""stars"" you were talking about.   He averaged 27/9/9 in 2017 finals. That's way better than his 2017 regular season.   2018 he averaged 62% TS in three games while outputting 30+ points. That's elite. He got unlucky and had the worst outlier 11 point performance out of all his 89 post season games. That's why we look at median over average that are more stable to outliers. And what's unique about 2018 is he got four times more doubled than LeBron and KD combined, while only having 2.5 turnovers on average.   2017 his playoff was 66% TS on 28 points. Funny that looks better than his regular season. Looks like you conveniently left that out of the argument.   Even his ""terrible"" 2016 finals performance, you think 23/5/4 on 58% TS is a bad stat? The dude got more double teamed and hacked off ball than anyone in the game. No shit that limits the number of possessions he gets and increase turnover rate, but that's at the cost of allowing others to play 4 vs 3.   &gt; It doesn't make sense to argue otherwise.   Well maybe try not to make a buffoon's argument and it actually starts to make sense that he's not an under performer at all.   "

"Honestly I don't think there's a solid 5  Tier 1: Michael Jordan  Tier 2a: Wilt Chamberlain, Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Durant  Tier 2b: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Larry Bird, Tracy McGrady, James Harden, Hakeem Olajuwon  Tier 3: Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Julius Erving, Dwyane Wade, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Oscar Robertson, Dirk Nowitzki, Russell Westbrook"
"Floor is he won't be able to play at all or get many minutes at the NBA level.  I think his peak is probably the same as peak Joe Johnson or if you really want to believe in the guy, if everything works out perfectly, I think he can get to Kevin Durant level."

"Lakers sign KD with their max slot in Summer 19. Then sign Ingram to a decent sized extension. Then before 2020 trade deadline when Davis is preparing to be a free agent, package Ingram for AD. New Orleans bites because they don’t want to lose AD for nothing, and Ingram will have established himself as a legitimate asset by then playing alongside Lebron.

The Thunder are headed to the Finals for the first time in 4 years! The Thunder play the defending champions, the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Oklahoma City Thunder win their first championship at home in just 6 games. Westbrook and Durant share a Finals MVP. This crowd is ecstatic! In 2017, Zaza Pachulia is not with the Warriors. Kawhi Leonard and the San Antonio Spurs face the Warriors in the WCF. The Spurs win in a brutal 7 game series. The Spurs go on to face the Cavaliers. They defeat the Cavaliers in another 7 game series. Kawhi Leonard wins Finals MVP.  Kyrie Irving requests a trade. He gets traded to the Boston Celtics. In 2018, the Rockets defeat the Golden State Warriors in 7 games in the WCF. The Rockets now go up against the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals. The Rockets defeat the Celtics in 5. James Harden wins Finals MVP. In 2019, the Thunder face the Warriors in the 1st round. Durant and the Thunder sweep the Warriors. Now, the Thunder play the 66-16 Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals. They lose in 7 to the Celtics. Kyrie Irving wins Finals MVP. Klay Thompson leaves Golden State for the Indiana Pacers in the off-season and the league is still great in this alternate universe."
I’d prefer the one of Kevin Durant holding the Taj Mahal 
"The question is would Butler make the Rockets on-par with the Warriors, not would the Rockets be really good.  The Warriors have Steph Curry and Kevin Durant who are better than anyone the Rockets have, and they have two more players in the same tier as Butler who have perfectly complimentary skill sets to Curry and Durant, while Butler isn't a perfect fit.

"Kevin ""The Wet Blanket"" Durant"
Kevin Durant is my favorite social media troll.
He could have easily got paid more money with any other team. Kevin Durant is the classiest guy in the NBA and he wears the freshest clothes
"&gt; Well-run big market teams have recently signed Gordon Hayward, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Boogie Cousins, and Al Horford, to name a fe  Boston isn't a big market team really. Even covering such a large area, they're only the 10th largest market. "
"&gt;Literally every major ranking has him as a top 10 small forward in the league.  I don't agree with that dude or dudette's assessment of Covington, but [the top result if you google ""best small forwards"" has Covington #12.](https://hoopshype.com/2018/08/12/nba-projections-2018-19-top-small-forwards-lebron-james-kevin-durant/)"
Kevin “Twitter Fingers” Durant strikes again
Good thing I’m Kevin Durant and I’m not waking up for another hour
"Knicks and Nets are also bottom five franchises in terms of dysfunction. They’re literally so inept they can’t capitalize on the biggest asset in the NBA: New York City.  Well-run big market teams have recently signed Gordon Hayward, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Boogie Cousins, and Al Horford, to name a few."
"&gt; ""How many stars have signed there"" is the ONLY numerical evidence for whether star players like going there.  How is players saying ""I like going there"" not evidence for whether players like going there?  Also, not sure why you limited it to just stars as this list is about players in general.  If you judge whether or not players like a city by how many stars sign there then 90% of the league is a shithole.  &gt; Toronto might be able to keep stars but they have no track record of being able to convince stars to come play for them in free agency  Why is this your only measure of whether or not players like a city? You're ignoring so many other things. Your argument boils down to ""this is the one factor I use to judge a big subject, and if you don't fulfill this factor then you are at the very bottom"". This is like arguing that the USA has a very small land size because Russia has 1.8x the land. No other criteria will be used to judge the USA's land size other than its comparison to Russia's land size.  Using single, focused criteria on any question will most likely lead you to wrong or skewed answers. ""How many stars sign there"" is part of the equation for figuring out which cities NBA players like best, sure, but it's definitely not the only or final factor.  Even further, using it to justify Toronto and Philly being on the *bottom* of this list makes no sense. Boston didn't sign Kevin Durant, but that doesn't mean that Kevin Durant would like to play in Memphis just as much as he would Boston. Similarly, just because stars haven't signed in TO/Philly doesn't mean that TO/Philly is at the bottom of the list alongside Memphis and Cleveland."

How’s kevin Durant “by far” a better scorer than a man who can score 40 with his left hand when he’s bored 😂😂? Plus Bird was more efficient than Durant (even though he played the end of his career with a completely deteriorated back lol)
They would be fun to watch IF in the right roles. Gordon thinking he’s Kevin Durant taking pull-up jumpers isn’t that fun to watch 
"First thought was Kevin Durant, but then I remembered Tim Duncan. Great player, very little excitement.   I really dislike James Harden. I used to dislike him even more, but since my local team stopped gifting him 20 free throws a game, I've seen a better version of him.   &amp;#x200B;"
"Can't see it clearly, but I think Kevin Durant held him down a little with the left hand on the shoulder. If that's the case, his jump would have been hampered, forcing him to shove the shot too hard.  If Durant didn't hold him, there's no excuse :-)"
"It is, though. Not every shot is worth the same amount of points, so just going by FG% will lead you to believe that, for example, Ben Simmons is more efficient than Kevin Durant, but that's just not true. KD takes, and makes, a lot more 3s and FTs, which should be accounted for."

"I'm so tired of the ""Giannis needs a jumper"" narrative. For starters, Giannis and Embiid have exactly the same 3P%. Secondly, the problem is the extremelly horrific coaching the Bucks had for about a decade now, and even worse with Jason ""four-point plays are a thing"" Kidd. Furthermore, KD has played his whole career with at least one player that was/would-be an MVP of the damn league. Giannis has to drag a lottery team to the playoffs...  I'm not saying that Giannis is as good KD, yet, but is closer than people say.  PS: [KD himself said that Giannis can the best player in history](http://www.nba.com/article/2017/10/13/kevin-durant-giannis-antetokounmpo-could-be-best-player-ever)."

After that: Kevin Durant
&gt; Kevin Durant is already a better scorer than Kobe thus making him a better player   no point in trying to argue with someone who doesn't follow logic. better scorer doesn't mean better player
That's what you think. Kevin Durant had been quoted saying that the only reason he went to the warriors was because u/Jaykoh83.
Kevin durant is going to la next year 
Kevin Durant and LeBron on the same team would be a sight to see.  Who knows maybe next year they will be on same team. 
I wish this show was all about Kevin Durant just buying stocks of already super successful corporations.
"Kevin Durant is the most versatile scorer of all time. Kobe is the most skilled scorer of all time [making the shots that require more skill].      Durant rarely is put into a position that Kobe would always put himself into with inefficient scoring from bad shot selections.       They aren't really comparable. But one is clearly harder.       I think the first thing KD needs to do is win a championship on a team not destined to be the championship team. It's not ""fair"" that we judge his championships as less valuable than another, but I think it's the right thing to do.      Lastly, I think its easy that KD doesn't end up as a top 10 player to ever play."
It was Kevin Durant!
In which context?  Some people say a Franchise player is the best player on a playoff team. Yes  Some define it as a number on a championship team then. Probably not  But honestly we don't know.   I mean he grinded to become one of the best players in the league and when he got there who was his supporting staff? Who was his coach?   Let's pair the guy with an All-Star big man and a decent coach and see where he goes.   There are so many ways to make up a championship team its hard to say.   But if it's based on being #1 on a championship team there in my opinion is only 2 guys right now who have proven that and still could Lebron and Steph.   Yes Kevin Durant is great all-time talented player but I'll always grade his achievements with the warriors on a curve.
"So if Jimmy Butler joined the Lakers, everyone else stayed on the team, you don't think it's possible they win a ring in the next 4 years? That doesn't make any sense. Locking in a top 15 player is worth it, especially if you just go over the salary cap. Top players are worth the max, players like LeBron, KD, Steph are just worth even more than that. You can't just spawn another LeBron, a Kevin Durant, but you can put a top 15 player next to one and you should."
"from a 538 article:  &gt;Ever since Durant took home that hardware, Westbrook has outshone him in both Real Plus-Minus (8.1 to 5.6) and Box Plus/Minus (10.7 to 6.7). You can blame a little of that on a banged-up Durant toiling through injuries — his per-minute numbers are slightly down since 2013-14 — but most of it is because Westbrook has become an irrepressible hardwood force in his own right. Durant hasn’t gotten appreciably worse; Westbrook has simply gotten that much better. He may not quite be the best player in basketball right now (Steph Curry is off in another dimension), but Westbrook has staked a pretty solid claim to the No. 2 slot, well ahead of even Durant’s form in his MVP season.  &gt;Before last season, Westbrook was firmly ensconced behind Durant as the Thunder’s second banana, a configuration that — if history was any kind of guide — appeared ordained to stay in place as long as both players wore an OKC uniform. But Westbrook blossomed in Durant’s absence last year, and the changes to his game have stuck. He’s upped his offensive efficiency — despite a crushing workload — and he’s even improved to become one of the game’s best defensive point guards this season.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-wasnt-supposed-to-get-better-than-kevin-durant/  He started to take the lead role on the team and it seemed pretty evident on the court. He was able to generate shots for everyone and become that true PG. He developed some form maturity that isn't measurable or tangible. The pace that he started to play with was extremely valuable and I've never seen it from him. We have to give Billy Donovan some credit with this. I'm sure Billy got through to Russ somehow and having that change of coaches probably helped him develop a different aspect on the game.  2015-2016 was his 2nd best year, IMO. I think KD getting injured helped him and Russ getting injured helped KD. It's fascinating what growth can come when you have the ball more. "
"The Hall should be about honoring the best of the best. I think Aldridge is one of his generation's better players once you get beyond the Curry/Durant/Paul/Howard/LeBron/Wade/Nowitzki tier. Among players who debuted between 2003 and 2011, Aldridge only has fewer All-NBA selections than Westbrook, Wade, Carmelo, CP3, Howard, Durant and LeBron. In fact, there are only 67 players in NBA history selected to 5 All-NBA teams, and as of now they are 47/52 in making the Hall. The exceptions are your most popular HoF candidates today (Moncrief, Kevin Johnson, Hardaway, Webber and Ben Wallace). The 15 who aren't eligible are Aldridge/Amar'e plus 13 locks, essentially (LeBron, Wade, Carmelo, Harden, Howard, Paul, Westbrook, Durant, Nowitzki, Duncan, Bryant, Garnett, Curry). Once those 13 are elected, 5-time All-NBA players will be 60/66 + Aldridge (assuming Amar'e misses) but some of those six misses could still easily be elected. I believe they've all been finalists except Wallace and the still-ineligible Stoudemire.   &amp;#x200B;  What could set Aldridge apart from those guys is that they all had relatively light total points careers.  &amp;#x200B;  Aldridge: 99th in NBA/ABA history with 16871 points, 869 games  Webber: 94th with 17182, 831 games  Hardaway: 134th with 15373, 867 games  Wallace: Just 6254 points. 37th in total rebounds with 10482, 1088 games  Moncrief: Just outside top-250 with 11931, 767 games  Stoudemire: 116th with 15994, 846 games  Johnson: 200th with 13127, 735 games  Only Wallace even reached 1000 games and his style is super underrated. Aldridge has a chance to distance himself from any of these guys buy playing well another 2-3 seasons and clearing 20,000 points &amp; reaching 1000+ games. He's got a pretty good Hall chance."

"What? Why do you say this? Because in some games WB played well? Did I say he ever didn’t play well, or that he never dominated?  WB - 7/21 (2/4 from 3), 5/14 (1/5), 10/19 (1/5), 12/27 (4-8),  11/28 (3/8), 10/27 (0/5), 7/21 (2-6). You don’t see how those are pretty far below a dominate game by WB?  So 39% and 32% from WB. You don’t see how close they were to knocking out the warriors here? Hell, Klay himself said OkC was the best team in the playoffs that year.   I’m not really sure what you’re getting at. If you want to try and show “so many things wrong” maybe actually put any effort into making your case?  The reality is, Durant has been in the to the conference finals at least every year since 2011 except when he got was hurt all season and when he lost to Memphis in the second round, here’s how that series looked https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2013-nba-western-conference-semifinals-grizzlies-vs-thunder.html  Yes Kevin Durant lead all scorers on 6 out of 7 games, and all rebounders 5 out of 7 games.   And all with him being explicitly used incorrectly. Dunno how anyone can pretend this dude isn’t the second best player. Yes, Curry had the most amazing offensive season of all time, no, he’s not better than Durant. "

"Kevin Durant has a bunch of good nicknames he doesn't use, and a bunch of bad ones that somehow end up in print.  Devin Booker needs a nickname after he does something big. I guess he had one of the worst 70-point games in NBA history, but that doesn't make for a good nickname.  Oladipo's name works fine. It's like having the name Ginobili - you don't forget it.  LaMarcus Aldridge is in that weird space where he's good enough to get a nickname, but doesn't have anything that really sticks. Besides the derogatory LaMarcus Garbridge / LaMarcus Oldridge / LMAo stuff that pops up every now and then.  Jokic's nickname ""Joker"" is just plain lazy.  Draymond Green has a slew of awful nicknames that thankfully don't see the light of day that much: ""Day-Day"", ""The Dancing Bear"", ""DrayMagic"", and the ironic ""BDD"".

"&gt;Stats look good but people never forget context.  Tell that to 2013 Finals LeBron. It's been 5 years and no one remembers how much that shit looked like a play-by-play rerun of the 2011 Finals through most of the series. No one remembers LeBron staying on as the only starter in blowouts to salvage single-digit scoring outings, or when he dropped 9 points in garbage time, including a buzzer beater 3 with 20 seconds to go, in order to ensure he scored more than Wade. No one remembers that all of this was happening while the defense cheated 8ft off him. Because the only thing that actually matters to time is that Miami won and LeBron showed up to close out the series.  Context will fade and we will be left with the simple fact that, outside of Jordan, Kevin Durant has been the greatest Finals performer in the history of the sport. No one has done what he does game in and game out as a scorer."

[Indeed he did](http://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-walt-frazier-stephen-jackson-warriors-news-comments-video-free-agency/48l3j1bwzhne10cvrh2hi716a)

I'm ~~Kevin Durant~~ nobody of note
My sources have told me that Adam Silver dumped all this news today to cover up the fact that Kevin Durant is responsible for 9/11 and the bubonic plague 
"I'd go with guys with distinct looks and playstyles, like the first one. My picks would be:  Russell Westbrook James Harden Anthony Davis Kevin Durant not sure a bout the last...Blake Griffin maybe? "
Heard that if they're all willing to take pay cuts he wants to sign Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant as well 
"Yeah it's not like GS were the only team that knew how to run plays for fucking Kevin Durant, and no one would be mad at him for signing with any of the 29 other teams. "

Kevin Durant. Goes to the warriors and they immediately became a contender 
"Because they were considered ""definitely a top 5 team of all time"" and then they added Kevin Durant. And then they added Cousins."
"Brook Lopez means a lot to me, y'all. He embodied the Nets culture so hard. They could be 0-82 and he would still wear Brooklyn AND New Jersey Nets stuff and not give 1000 fucks about anything else. He was the one who wore his New Jersey Nets sweats to locker room cleanouts right before he was traded! The only other person that I can think of that reps their old team like that is (I know, I know!) Kevin Durant (Seattle Supersonics). Y'all saw KD when the Warriors played in Seattle during preseason!"
"His footwork though. When Kevin Durant comes out and says he tries to copy DeMar’s footwork, you know it’s amazing."
"Actually No, he does not have a higher percentage (does shoot higher volume though). Last season, Durant shot 49.4% from Mid-range at 5.8 attempts/game.  DeRozan shot 42.5% at 6.3 attempts/game.  This season, so far through 6 games, Durant is shooting 50% with 6.7 attempts, Deebo is shooting 47.6% with 8.4 attempts.  DeRozan is a really good mid-range shooter, and takes a higher volume of these shots, but he’s not as good as Kevin Durant. In fact, Durant has been significantly more efficient *every season*. Even Kawhi Leonard has a better mid-range FG% at a very high volume (both in 16-17, and this season).  Source: [NBA.com stats](https://stats.nba.com/players/shooting/?Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;sort=Mid-Range%20FG%20PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=Mid-Range%20FGA*GE*4)"
"he got OKC to a finals with, you know, Kevin Durant and James Harden and Westbrook and Ibaka.   he's obviously not good at preventing conflict and his offensive system is blech. "
"Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul.  There are a bunch of them, but these are the guys with the best midrange game in the league.  His stats from midrange weren't great last year either. Around 42-44%, while the guys I mentioned are consistently well above 50% in the midrange."
"Well, Magic did say a superstar.   So if he gets some big name good player but not superstar players like DeAndre Jordan or Melo or Dwight Howard, fans will be disappointed.  These are the 5 players I consider superstars or near superstars they can sign next year as a free agent that fans will be satisfied.  1. Kevin Durant  2. Kawhi Leonard  3. Klay Thompson  4. Jimmy Butler  5. Kyrie Irving  There are free agents that might be good, but not superstar level.  "
"With OP title and Durant recent quote ""I only think about the money"", I really thought we were still talking about Kevin Durant. The jazz part was a bit suspicious, but why not."
"tbh i just don't see kevin durant anyway else... where would he go that coud afford him? new york? he won't play with lebron or go back to okc. i expect durant to be back. cousins won't be but gsw doesn't need him.  the celtics is the only team that will give gsw a run for their money. the switching thing is intersting, okc did that against rockets last year to hid melo... but i don't know if its viable against a team with curry, klay and durant. your lineup is definitely interesting though. "
Just like when Kevin Durant put up empty stats for a while early in his career. Can't win with Durant right?
Drake repping a snake jersey made out of Kevin Durant 
I think 1 Kevin Durant costs more than that
"&gt; Timing matters. Wade was unlucky to peak at the same time that LeBron began to peak and Kobe was at his. Of course he wasnt going to win an MVP.  To be fair, Harden won an MVP award during the ""peak"" of Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, and LeBron James.  This doesn't mean I think that Harden is better than Wade, just that saying Wade was ""unlucky"" because he peaked alongside some fantastic players doesn't seem all that compelling because Harden is in the same boat with different stars, he actually won the award instead though."
"He can't shoot more times if he doesn't get the ball. He's trying to be more aggressive this season, and the *point guard* is declaring that he shouldn't be concerned about how many shots he takes.  Here's a fun comparison for you: While Wall and Beal were building a brick shithouse, Porter got 6 shots.  On the same night, while Steph Curry and Kevin Durant were going off, scoring at high efficiency, Jonas Jerebko got 7."
"Klay is developing the ability to create for himself here and there, but yeah, it's not his strength by a *long* way.  Here's a thing to point out though. Yesterday, Otto Porter had 6 shot attempts while Wall and Beal were themselves shooting like ass.  Jonas Jerebko had 7 while Steph Curry and Kevin Durant were both going off."
Kevin Durant just read this post on his burner account and threw his phone across the room
*Laughs in Anthony Davis.*  *Dies of crossing over in Kevin Durant*  *Shimmys in Stephen Curry.*  *Flops in James Harden.*
"Undoubtedly top 40, most likely top 30.   *EDIT:*  * I have top 10 (semi ordered): MJ, KAJ, LBJ, Magic, Bird, Shaq, Wilt, Hakeem, Duncan, Russell * Top 11-20 (semi ordered): Kobe, Oscar, West, Dr. J, Dirk, KG, Malone, Kevin Durant, Barkley, Curry * Top 21-30 (Semi ordered): Stockton, David Robinson, Elgin, Wade, Hondo, CP3, Nash, Pippen, IT, Kidd  I can't reasonably fathom him higher than Dirk, KG, Malone, Durant. I think if you are really compelled you could argue him over Curry Stockton and Barkley, but that's a stretch, Barkley and Stockton your only argument is ""rings"" and with Curry he will undoubtedly be better (if he isn't already) by the end of his career. He was a great player but even at his peak was a fringe top 10 player in the league. All of those other players have a legit argument for best player in the NBA (sans Stockton, but longevity is in play here). "
You underestimate the Warriors in the playoffs. They have demolished the West every year dude. The Raptors can enjoy the finals appearance and be sent back to Canada. Warriors own all championships until literally Kevin Durant gets bored.
"Some clown once told me Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook were all on the same team. What a joke!"
"&gt;all it takes is one Curry ankle sprain in round 2 or conference finals and Kawhi will smell blood.    That might have worked in 2015, but now he's not even the best player on that team. Without Curry, they'll still have the 2nd best player in the world Kevin Durant, with Klay, Dray and fucking DeMarcus Cousins   &gt;   Hell, when it comes to the playoffs or finals.. opponent teams would rather have Curry playing and Durant injured, than the other way around. Don't fool yourself boy"
"I came into work this week telling a coworker how another friend texted me after Curry's 51 point game saying ""Curry is the best player in the league and its not close"". The coworker laughed at it and said ""Yeah..did he forget about a guy named Kevin Durant???""  Smh"
"I had a dream last night that I met Kevin Durant but he was about 3 feet tall. I don't know if that's relevant, but it *feels* relevant. "
https://www.slamonline.com/nba/kevin-durant-i-am-thinking-about-the-money-im-going-to-get/ All these reports make me think he wants money more than chips. 
"this is why basketball is currently a bad sport  hopefully this off-season adam silver pulls some david stern magic and makes sure kevin durant leaves the warriors, making the sport watchable again"
"Will Chamberlain didn't get his rings on the warriors until Kevin Durant joined the team  Edit: *Wilt, but i actually like this better"
Kevin Durant uses noobtubes with danger close
Not sure if joking but I never said he’s the victim lol. He made a statement and everyone wants to clown him just because he’s Kevin Durant. There was nothing wrong with what he said lmao
"Hey, Thunder should go forward on that. I know Kevin Durant only has one year left but hey, scared money dont make none."
"KD would sign a deal worth more than 200 million, Curry recently signed a 37 mill per year deal. If Warriors Max Klay and Dray, the tax bill during the duration of the contracts will add up to around 2 billion.   The chances of Warriors supermaxing Durant will be very low because they will favor him taking a small cut and having room to give Klay a better competitive deal. Durant has already started talking about the off-season, common sense would tell you he has made his mind about what he wants to do, when has he ever started doing this? Especially, with the rumors talking of him and Lebron wanting to join. Now start connecting the dots.   As I said previously, if Kevin Durant signs a Supermax with the Warriors, Klay Thompson is much more likely to be leaving. Lakers are gonna be happen either way, because this is forcing the Warriors FO to dish out Max Contracts and raise the tax bill.   Do you understand now?"
"For a moment I was thinking ""hold up we got Kevin freaking Durant?"" before it hit me that its Kris Dunn  And yeah Jabari is god-awful on defense, eliminating world hunger etc might be easier than turning him into a positive defender"
Lakers won’t make the playoffs and Kevin Durant goes East for the money and won’t head to Lakers because of Lebron. 
"Ok for real? Let's go through starting small forwards in the West.  Pelicans - Middleton &gt; Moore  Nuggets - Middleton &gt; Craig  Blazers - Middleton &gt; Layman  Clippers - Middleton &gt; Harris  Grizzlies - Middleton &gt; Parsons  Jazz - Middleton &gt; Ingles  Kings - Middleton &gt; Hield  Spurs - Middleton &gt; Gay  Mavs - Middleton &gt; Finney-Smith  Lakers - Middleton &gt; Ingram  Wolves - Middleton &gt; Wiggins  Suns - Middleton &gt; Ariza  Rockets - Middleton &gt; Ennis  Huh, turns out he's better than literally every SF in the West other than Paul George and Kevin Durant. You're talking shit.     Since you deleted your reply: Giannis has played PF for the last 18 months                    "
Kevin Durant is the spawn of Satan
"Steph Curry is averaging 33.7ppg, 6apg, and 4.7rpg on 55/52/92 and 73% TS.   Kevin Durant is avg 29.7ppg, 5.8apg, and 8.2rpg on 55/36/94 and 64% TS.   This isn't fair anymore, they should not be teammates. "
Kawhi is the most dangerous player in the league for real. Pop does not want him in the same conference. He was gonna be sent east for pennies anyways. Lebron is great and all but has nothing to prove anymore. He has already proven and was considered the best player in the league for too long. That's why he doesn't play defense anymore. Pop wouldn't trade kawhi even for lebron james himself. The only way he would have traded kawhi to the east would be for kevin durant.
"Rashard Lewis and Kevin Durant two 6'10 and 6'11 small forwards who can score from anywhere. I was born in Orlando and than moved to California but the game that made me a Magic fan was Magic vs. Lakers were Jameer, Rashard and Dwight beat the Lakers in 2008. I became a die hard Magic fan and we made it to the finals that year been riding with them for almost a decade in one month. KD I have been a fan of since his Seattle Supersonic days I just enjoyed watching a skinny 7 footer scoring from everywhere. I was in 7th grade and it is crazy how great he became from his rookie year. I also remember the young OKC team KD, WB, Harden, Eric Maynor, Serge Ibaka, Nick Collinson, Kristic, Reggie Jackson, PJ3, Jeff Green etc. Man time flies lol will always be a die hard KD/RL9 and Magic fan."
"Rings are more an indicator of the team the player was on, not the player. No one’s putting Tony Parker in the top 5. Or Dennis Rodman. Or Pippen.   If LeBron had a Cavs team with any of the help Duncan, Steph, Larry, Magic, or Jordan had...he’d have like 9 rings.   Edit: just so it’s clear, as someone misread my last paragraph. I’m saying if LeBron on the Cavs had a Tony Parker and Manu, then he wins more titles. If he had Klay and Draymond and Durant, he wins more titles. If he had Robert Parish and McHale then he wins more titles. Etc etc  On the flip side if you put Michael Jordan with Larry Hughes and Mo Williams, Jordan’s not winning shit. If you put Magic with the remains of Kevin Love, the zombie version of JR Smith, and George Hill...he’s not beating the Warriors.  Durant is the same amazing player he was on the Thunder. And Durant couldn’t win a ring because the team wasn’t good enough. Durant being on a better team, the Warriors, results in multiple rings for Durant. Nothing about his game has changed. He’s still the same Durantula. All the rings reveal is that he had a better team around him.  We don’t argue that Nick Young having a ring and Barkley not having one means Young is better than Barkley. That’s because we know Young was on the right team at the right time and Barkley was way better. That same logic applies no matter the player. "
"Kevin Durant also has the luxury of having another MVP and 2 other(soon to be 3) all-star teammates on the floor. This allows him to not have to run on offense as much and conserve energy to use on defense. Lebron has also never joined a team that had an established proven system , certainly not one as great as this warriors team.Comparing KD joining the warriors  and buying  into it is nowhere near the same as LeBron joining an average heat team and an awful Cavs team. The reason so many of the Cavs were reduced to spectator 3 roles is Bc everytime lebron went to the bench none of them could create offense, they literally couldn’t do anything else even when given the opportunities. Also Bron played a good amount of off-ball in Miami, you saw wade and chalmers bringing the ball up a lot. KD is an amazing basketball player and no doubt #2 best player in the league. But he’s given luxuries Bron’s never gotten. This is a bad  take"
"My all time favorite players are Kevin Durant, Rashard Lewis, Tracy McGrady and Jonathan Isaac all 6'9-7'0 small forwards."
   RJ Barrett  Frank Knitilkina  Kevin Durant  Kevin Knox  Kristaps Porzingis  Mitchel Robinson   Tim Hardaway Jr.
"Aren't the Mavs supposed to have quite a bit of cap space next season? Dennis Smith Jr., Luka Doncic, Harrison Barnes, Kevin Durant, DeAndre Jordan sounds like a pretty solid starting lineup to me.  2nd Unit: Brunson, Harris, Maxi Finney-Smith, Powell &amp; Kostas as an energy plug in and ""Never Retiring"" Dirk as a spiritual leader and space creator for dayssssss.  "
That “article” is a literal quote from [Marcus Thompson’s ](https://theathletic.com/613059/2018/10/25/thompson-this-time-kevin-durant-isnt-trying-to-please-everybody-or-limit-his-free-agent-process/) article. 
When it matters Lebron plays defense. Against the Spurs Walton put him on Aldridge on a key possession in the 4th and Lebron didn't even let Aldridge get the ball. And then the other night against the Nuggets Walton put Lebron on Jokic who had a bunch of turnovers and missed layups against Lebron.  And Lebron and Kawhi are the only superstars who run back on defense at least sometimes. Anthony Davis NEVER does. Kevin Durant NEVER does. Steph Curry NEVER does. Kyrie Irving NEVER does. Russell Westbrook NEVER does.
I think they need a Kevin Durant and then they should be good tbh
"Damn, imagine saying someone is trying to make themselves look smart while trying to sound smart all in one paragraph. Quite the talent there ol’ Rob.  “People don’t know the tone”  It’s Kevin Durant highlights. Saying he “might get the max” in response to a “free agency audition” comment is pretty clearly a joke.  Ya got whooshed. It was pretty obvious it was a whoosh and ya still got whooshed. Get over it. You’re way too upset over this"
"Even if the Knicks are bad ABC still gets to fill the broadcast with ""And later today the Warriors will play. They have Kevin Durant, who might *and everyone at ESPN is praying will* become a Knick this summer"""
"Over his last four he's averaged 22 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 3.8 apg and 1 spg on 47/41/74 shooting. He's looked so confident. Easily our best offensive player in terms of all around game and creating.   EDIT: For reference, players averaging 19.6/6/3.8 or higher this season (Luka's season averages) are: LeBron, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Blake Griffin, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Nikola Vucevic, James Harden, Westbrook, Chris Paul and Giannis. Players averaging 22/5.8/3.8 or higher are: this list plus Damian Lillard, and minus Vucevic and Embiid "

Kevin Durant is a basketball player 
wow me and kevin durant are so alike!
"This is the title of the article written by Marcus Thompson “Thompson: This time, Kevin Durant isn’t trying to please everybody or limit his free-agent process”. Im suggesting that he not pull out one quote. "
Kevin Fucking Durant is what u all need to know. 
"That speaks more to the fact that Kevin gels super well with what the Warriors do. A lot of people thought they were unbeatable immediately after he signed but many were still holding hopes that he would ruin the chemistry. LeBron made his move claiming to win 7 rings in Miami, LeBron made his move with the intent of fucking parody. LeBron and Wade were the two statistically best players the season before they teamed up, Bosh was top 10. People will hate Durant forever because he slammed the NBA darling's championship window shut in his face, but they both made very similar decisions."
"This is why people just are hoping Kevin Durant is bored with winning, because if he's not and he likes playing with these guys everyone stays a quarter away from being obliterated."
Kevin Durant is not nice.
Kevin Durant missed a long 3 and it bounced back to an open Stephen Curry for a wide open 3 was like GIF summarizing the Warriors to the whole NBA. 
"That 4th quarter was some stupid stuff, Kevin fucking Durant."
*Insert meme of What we see vs what Kevin Durant sees where there’s no defenders in the second pic*
Kevin Durant
HOLY SHIT KEVIN DURANT WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
KEVIN DURANT LADS
Kevin Durant is unstoppable
Kevin Durant
This is a hot take but the warriors are really good because they also have Kevin Durant aside from Stephen Curry. 
KEVIN FUCKING DURANT IS ON FIRE
Some nice defense and Kevin fucking Durant has given us the lead
So wes mathews just decided he was kevin durant tonight?
Kevin Durant looks pissed...what a nice layup
"if that's the case then you also have to take into consideration that Curry has much better teammates than John Stockton did leading to a higher pass to assist ratio than LeBron and CP3. Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson are some of the best Shooters in NBA history who Curry has the privilege of passing to. So you have to look at the whole picture not just stats. Therefore my point stands that I believe John Stockton, CP3, Magic Johnson,Jason Kidd,and Steve Nash are better passers than Stephen Curry.   Don't get me wrong Stephen Curry is freaking amazing but let's not blind ourselves or get overzealous here. I fully recognize however that he is the greatest pure shooter in NBA history and his ability to score is ridiculous."
"You roll a **4**. You roll a **10.**   **Your 14** has Curry maintaining the the course of greatness. Curry, Durant, and the legendary Warriors squad easily defeats the rest of the NBA to win the NBA Championship for 2018-2019.   Kevin Durant leaves during the summer of 2019 and devastates the morale of the team. However, in 2019-2020, the 4th seed Warriors are able to surge in the playoffs behind Curry's 3rd MVP season. They miraculously win the championship that year too... defeating the Celtics in 7.    "
WELCOME TO THE KINGS KEVIN DURANT
Kevin Durant is known to quit if he's joining the team next year KD to Knicks confirmed
"When you call people an armchair psychologist for something that KD has said himself ""After winning that championship (last season), I learned that much hadn’t changed. I thought it would fill a certain [void]. It didn’t."" [Article](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kevin-durant-i-thought-championship-would-fill-void-but-it-didnt/)"
"[Wrong.](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/07/kevin-durant-contract-warriors-nba-free-agency-pay-cut-andre-iguodala-shaun-livingston)  &gt;The Warriors have Bird Rights for all of their free agents except Durant, but they had a “Non-Bird Exception” to keep Durant. That meant Durant could have taken — and was expected to take — $31.6 million this year along with a 5% raise the next year. And he could have taken that without impact the Warriors’ ability to re-sign Iguodala or Livingston to literally any contracts the veterans wanted.  &gt;Durant’s decision has a very clear beneficiary, then: ownership. He’ll save Lacob and Guber way more than that $6 million because his new contract puts the Warriors in much better shape with the luxury tax — essentially cutting in half the amount they’ll have to pay on it.   "
That snake looks like a fucking dragon! If I was a snake like Kevin Durant I would wanna be that snake too 
[MRW Kevin Durant cares about me](https://i.redditmedia.com/B8gNLF4Ew3WvqmybelvQvbLe-XDPTetVZakSY7AzODs.jpg?w=320&amp;s=62318f34762fb1a270b2e57b0b379103)
"https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kevin-durant-i-thought-championship-would-fill-void-but-it-didnt/  Not even armchair psychology, he said it himself. Stop whining"
Kd has repeatedly expressed that feeling. Like 'winning the rings was no big deal and I don't understand why everyone made it out like that'.  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kevin-durant-i-thought-championship-would-fill-void-but-it-didnt/
"Yeah but he didn't HAVE to take that pay cut. Theoretically, the Warriors' owners could have paid more money, but Kevin Durant decided to make that sacrifice instead."
I think it would be over $2 billion in payroll for the next 4 years if they maxed KD and Klay this year and Draymond next year  Edit: [just under 1.4 billion including this year's payroll](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/warriors-kevin-durant-steph-curry-free-agency-contracts-luxury-tax-cost/)
Kevin Durant. Even though golden state would still be good they would be vulnerable without him.
Clippers should move somewhere else then...  *Kevin Durant joins the Seattle Clippers in 2021*
"lol of course Chris Paul at 5-10.5/5-11(his real actual height) would be the one guy to actually be able to generate a stop in those spots on Houston.   But yeah Houston's switching D was sloppy last week real sloppy. The ""switch everything"" title is a bit of a misnomer there's an art to what Hou did last year in terms of knowing when not to switch. A lot of these switches came in reaction to what the offense was doing and when the offense already had the upper hand. They weren't switches that helped control and dictate the offenses action which is what they had success doing vs GSW and what the goal of the scheme was. NOP was also running these actions to get Davis switches deeper in the paint than GSW would last year with Kevin Durant or whomever else which is what you need to do.   Other issue is personnel here. Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah Moute have 7'2 wing spans. You throw them in a lineup with Capela/CP3/Harden(whos strength is post D) you are fairly well equipped for this. Instead they were out here getting burned with guys like James Ennis(who has 3 inches less on his wing span than Ariza/Luc), MCW and Melo(who in any general defensive capacity is a disaster) "
*Thibs face*  “Jimmy butler 6 months on contract is more valuable than Steph Curry and Kevin Durant”   *change my mind*
"I know we didn't get Kevin Durant? I don't even have Kevin Durant above Curry, let alone at #2. Subjective rankings aside, regardless of how your personal top 5 looks, my point still stands. And everything you said is purely your personal opinion lol, it has no bearing on what will actually happen. All we know is what already happened - which is Kawhi didn't want to play for the Spurs anymore, and he's currently playing at an MVP and DPOY level for the Raptors."
"You didn’t get Kevin Durant, you got Kawhi Leonard. A great player but he doesn’t want to be in Toronto and if there was more than one year on his contract he’d be doing whatever it took to get to LA just like he did last season. The Raptors traded their best player ever for a guy that doesn’t even want to be there. The Raptors are obviously ran way better than the Spurs, you’re right, that’s why no stars have ever wanted to play there besides the guy they forced out and the reason they have never accomplished anything during their entire time in the league"
"well i mean, after the warriors won they got Kevin Durant for less than total max, and after they won again they got Demarcus Cousins *on league minimum*.   "
He's very quietly been an elite scorer the last two years on the Warriors too. In 16/17 he was almost scoring as many points per minute as Klay Thompson and JaVale was second to only Kevin Durant in TS% on the team that year. Durant was actually the only player in the league who scored that many points per minute at a higher efficiency than JaVale that year.
Hate to see Kevin Durant losing with a team like this smh
Since 1980:  &amp;#x200B;  Michael Jordan '88 - '98  Shaquille O'Neal '94 - '02  Stephen Curry '15 - '19  LeBron James '09 - '13  Hakeem Olajuwon - '92 - '97  Magic Johnson - '85 - '90  Kobe Bryant '05 - '10  Kevin Durant '14 - '19  Larry Bird '83 - '88  Tim Duncan '99 - '04  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;
"Kevin Durant is absolutely not a top 2 SF and he's not even really close to being one. Don't act like it's a debate.  Unless you were talking about right now, but it seems to me like you're talking about all time."
"Dis the team with steph curry, klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and draymond Green die? "
"Kevin ""Barry Allen"" Durant fucked up the timeline in 2016. We seein the results"
"Trade for James Harden, sign Kevin Durant."
Wasn't Kevin Durant on that team?
"Why does shooting matter so much?   Last season Giannis averaged more points on just 0.7 more attempts per game, shooting a higher percentage than Durant. And then he played defense.  You are simply stuck on the idea that shooting is the only skill that matters. Boy, Shaq must have sucked. Do you find Drummond worthless?  Yeah, Kevin Durant is a generational talent. Giannis is one too, and he's still getting better.  We'll see at the end of the season which player gets more MVP votes."
https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/kevin-durant-on-joining-golden-state-warriors-the-hardest-road-to-a-championship-070716
"Well KD is also [6'10 3/4"" barefoot](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/). Hakeem was exactly the same height. I think those extra 3 inches over a wing like Kawhi or Pippen might make a world of a difference. Hakeem didn't have KD's guard skills, but he was an even better athlete with even better footwork.  If Hakeem came up in this era and emphasized perimeter defense more, he might be the best possible matchup for him. A man his size who can move like him, he can't shoot over him and he has to work to get by him, rather than just effortlessly blowing by."
Kevin Durant accomplished in his first 5 years with Seattle:okc more than Dame will ever accomplish in his career. Let that sink in
Kevin Durant uses fake social  media accounts to argue with high schoolers online
"Bro... think about what you’re saying. The Raptors WON and you’ve still got shit to talk about them lmao. Ur acting like as if the Warriors without Curry and Draymond are a bunch of scrubs that the Raps should’ve blown out easily. I dunno if you’re aware but they’ve still got former MVP, scoring champion Kevin Durant and second best shooter in the world Klay Thompson. That’s the NBA for you, no game is safe if you have that caliber of players on your team and it showed because Kevin Durant dropped 51 fuckin points on difficult shot after difficult shot. And hold up, you’re telling me the Raps PANICKED? BRO we won in an overtime and turned up when it mattered the most, I don’t even wanna IMAGINE what you would say if we lost lmfao. I don’t wanna call you a hater but it really sounds like you were planning to criticize the Raps regardless of the result. We took the dub, all that matters. 1 game of 82 doesn’t mean jack shit and it means even less when we win it. The team is moving on and so am I "
Michael Jordan  Dwyane Wade  Larry Bird  LeBron James  Kobe Bryant  Magic Johnson  Hakeem Olajuwon  Alex English  Carmelo Anthony  Bill Laimbeer  Muggsy Bogues  Isiah Thomas  Isaiah Thomas  Allen Iverson  Giannis  Russell Westbrook  Dominique Wilkins  Shawn Kemp  Gary Payton  Kawhi Leonard  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  Elvin Hayes  Wes Unseld  James Harden  John Stockton  Karl Malone  Scottie Pippen  And MANY MANY MAAANY MORE...  Let’s hope I live to 69! So I can brag about being able to see the next generational talent.
"Why would they? Besides, Kevin Durant is by far the best player in the NBA right now and it's not even close."
"He has talent and energy. All of what you said was before he started trying to specifically get triple doubles and while he had Kevin Durant. When your goal is specifically to artificially pump up your numbers, no matter how great you are, you will not be able to win games against especially elite teams.   Teams that can shoot efficiently with good defense and high total assists usually win games. If both teams are being efficient, there are just not enough rebounds available to get a triple double, so you will have to deliberately slack off on defense enough to try to make your opponent take a shot you hope he will miss. Or you will give your teammates bad shots to get the rebound. Or you will elect not to shoot a high percentage shot just so your teammate can give you an assist.   Westbrook is a selfish player who plays like Lebron, except Lebron shows restraint in his stat padding and is himself an efficient player (even if he slacks on defense and has such a high usage rate that his teammates get cold). The fact that Westbrook averages a higher number of assists than Lebron (I don't even like Lebron), who is literally one of the smartest point forwards ever should make you suspicious. Is diving for a rebound that Steven Adams basically already has winning basketball? Give me a break. "
This is why kevin durant didn't think you even had a phone. 
Hey Klay!  Does the Warriors team ever make fun of Kevin Durant for the whole burner account debacle? Or do you guys just not bring it up?
The rest is history - we got Kevin Durant 
"¡Suficiente es suficiente! Lo he tenido con este dominio de los guerreros. Adam Silver necesita arreglar este lío antes de que la liga se vuelva aún más desequilibrada. Ni siquiera es divertido ver la NBA cuando sabes que tu equipo no ganará nada importante. El hecho de que Kevin Durant puede tomar un pago para ayudar a los propietarios sucios y mantener vivo a su equipo sucio e injusto. ¡Es una sucia y sucia serpiente que solo ha tenido éxito en unirse a un equipo de 73-9 y ARRANAR la NBA por completo! Kevin Durant podría haber ido a cualquier otro equipo y hubiera estado bien, pero NOOO, tuvo que llevar sus sucios talentos a un equipo que ya ha demostrado ser dominante. ¡Quiero que alguien inicie una página de fondos para detener esta tontería! ¡Tal vez si recaudamos suficiente dinero, Adam Silver y la NBA tendrán que hacer algo sobre estas serpientes y este juego injusto! Menos"
Born in 98 1.Lebron James 2. Kobe Bryant  3. Kevin Durant  4. Dirk Nowitzky  5. Dwayne Wade  
1.LeBron James 2.Kobe Bryant 3.Kevin Durant 4.Stephen Curry 5.Tim Duncan (saw him post prime starting at 07-08ish )
It has just been reported /u/PantherU is being fined 25k from the NBA along with NBA player Kevin Durant. More info at 9.
"Not even Yao. The only people with the length to straight-up block his jumper are centers, but Durant is much more mobile than any dedicated center in the league. And once KD has the ball above his head, no non-center can block his jumper. The best way to stop Kevin Durant is with a defensive wing player who is good at picking pockets and getting steals. People who can get in his dribble or catch him early in his shooting motion are best.  Scottie Pippen is as good of a choice as any, really. "
"No. No one on planet earth past or present can STOP Kevin Durant from scoring. Pippen is probably the best guy you could ever have to slow him down, but no one is stopping him."
"He’s a better overall defender than all of those players except probably Simmons. I don’t really count Simmons as a “guard defender” he’s like Kevin Durant in the fact that he plays like a guard but should be considered a wing defender.   Honestly Smarts flopping and attitude must skew people’s perception of his defense because I don’t know how anyone who watches him consistently can say he’s not at the very least top 3 guard defender in the NBA. His versatility is insane, and he’s always in the right position. "
"Hey Klay.   When you were up here for a preseason game with Warriors. It also happened to be your first competitive game with Kevin Durant.  What were your overall Impressions of the trip, Canada, Vancouver?  Seattle or Vancouver if Silver asked you to choose for him a new expansion city.   Finally, is it true you shoot the most,and efficiently 3’s on and OFF the court in the league? Who’s second best?  I’m referring to 3somes. I only ask because my friends claim it happened up here.  So I figured it must happen often.    Also, which account do you use to give out all the gold?"
Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Draymond Green  Kevin Durant  DeMarcus Cousins
Kevin Durant lately.  
"Hi Klay do you or do you not agree with Draymonds opinion that Kevin ""the real mamba"" Durant is a bitch?"
bru Kevin Durant is not going to play in Sacramento  edit: nvm lol
Would you rather fight 1 Kevin Durant sized duck or 100 duck sized Kevin Durants?
"Okay, so according to Shaq last night:  * Kawhi Leonard is the second-best player in the league * Giannis Antetokounmpo is the best player in the east * The best player in the league is either Giannis, LeBron James or Kevin Durant * He’s talking apples and you’re asking orange questions"
"Dawg your reasoning doesn't make sense, LeBron went to the Lakers for a lot of reasons but to play with Kevin Durant is not one of them. You'll get a big free agent this year but it's not going to be the snake (or kawhi or klay). Durant would ruin his reputation forever if he got 3 rings and then went ring chasing again. He hates how he's seen by the fans and media and once he gets his next ring hes going to try to redeem himself. You don't redeem yourself on the Lakers you get hated more"
"Fuck, marry, kill: Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green?"
"A poll of NBA executives had:  35% say he stays with Golden State  26% say he joins the Knicks  19% say he joins the Lakers  8.5% say he joins the Clippers  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25391960/predicting-kevin-durant-next-team-nba-legacy  Oops: I said NBA executives, but you're right, it's panelists and reporters. But we are still talking about Rumours man, no one really knows jack but KD and his agent."
"Are these numbers if he signed for any other team (besides okc)? I found this:  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/07/signing-for-golden-state-will-cost-kevin-durant-an-absurd-amount-in-taxes  Along with some other articles, but they are all from a few years ago so I wasn't sure of the updated math."
...It's Kevin Durant. You get him and adjust your offense/defensive schemes because Kevin Durant is in a different stratosphere talent wise. 
Klay how did you feel when Draymond Green verbally assaulted Kevin Durant to the detriment of the True Warriors Team?
"in the last 6 months javale mcgee, tyson chandler, deandre jordan, and nerlens noel switched teams. any of those plus kevin durant makes you way better. i can't believe you're serious about this. it's kevin durant. "
"Imagine thinking Kevin Durant isnt the best player on the planet HAHAHAHAHAHAHA   Shaq is such a salty bitch anyone who challenges his legacy in any way he pretends is a shit player. Dwight/Embiid, Duncan/Durant. Hes so pathetic."
"You don't.   That said adding back those guys isn't just straight addition. They scored like 124 points per 100 this game. It isn't like steph can push that number up that much lol. Just, you know, when Kevin Durant isn't in God mode we have to deal with this from steph. "
How would Kevin Durant not joining a 73-9 team have changed the outcome of the last 2 seasons?
imagine if in OT  the stadium goes dark and each team gets a 6th man to play on the court and its someone from WWE. u just hear some funeral music and the undertaker comes out and just tombstone piledrives kevin durant and hes out for the rest of the game but then at 90mph ray mysterio comes out and slide kicks leonard down
Kevin Durant was on a different level. He was terrifying. Nothing the Raps were doing could phase him. His shots were high difficulty and he was making them look easy. 
"Rather have zero rings than a team with Draymond ""Natural Shooting Motion"" Green and Kevin ""Hardest Road"" Durant lmao"
"I know he's a professional athlete and the state of his body is somewhat open for discussion, but you don't tell Kevin Durant how to run his shit. He's Kevin Durant, he knows better. Like Ernie said, the man just dropped 51.  As a skinny guy, fuck all of you."
"Should use Kemba Walker logic with this one ""can't believe Durant scored 51 in a loss, damn Kevin you need to leave that teams not doing you justice! #FreeKD"" "
"lol did you even read that article?  It does not indicate Durant intended to sign there at all.  It just says Washington really really hoped he would but KD gave them zero indication.  &gt;Just one year ago, it seemed as if the Wizards had as good a chance any to win the sweepstakes for D.C. native Kevin Durant. Now, the latest reports suggest that Washington isn't even one of the half-dozen or so teams to get the opportunity to meet and make a pitch.  .   &gt; ""A lot of people will be devastated. But at the end of the day he never promised us anything,""   -Wall  &gt;Durant isn't all that keen on returning to play in the city in which he grew up. Friends, family - some real, some claiming to be - all come out of the woodwork in those situations, and Durant, who has tightened his inner circle considerably in recent years, isn't interested in dealing with them."
Kevin Fuck You Durant
"Nah.   The 73-win Warriors losing to the Cavs in the 2nd of 4 straight seasons in the finals.... before saying, ""this isn't even my final form!""    Then Kevin Durant showed up."
Kevin Durant went hollow confirmed. Get that man a humanity and a bonfire.
"This would be surprising for any team but the one with Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson on it"
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant was insane to watch at Texas. Kevin Durant now I can't even imagine.
Kevin Durant dumb skinny
"Yeah and Durant pulled a Miami Heat Lebron. How about Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen joining us (Yes, I am aware ours is a bit different)? Players chase rings, always have, always will. People always get over it too.  KD has proven he's thin skinned and sensitive so I am sure his will take a little longer to shed because he made himself look stupid with his alt account shit but it will definitely eventually fade just like every other hall of fame caliber diva superstar in any sport eventually gets the respect they deserve for their play."
Kevin Durant is a cheat code in a totally different way that Steph Curry is
"Wasn't really anything to write home about but he was in a really bad place after that injury, and Drake helped him snap out of it in a sense.   KD talks about all of that in here: http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/presents-19505704/nba-playoffs-why-kevin-durant-sees-world-differently-now"
"Honestly when he was forced into the shot, I jumped up in happiness. Then - mid air - reality set in. Reality that Kevin Durant just shot a fade away 3 and no matter how many stat pages I view that forcing that shot is a win (a 180 fade away shot at that) I landed on my feet with a sad face ready to put my hands on the back of my head in disgust.   But damn was that entertaining"
"Kevin Durant, the only guy who complains about the long pieces."
Kyle Lowry on Kevin Durant isn't a matchup you want lol
"That’s the point. A damn good job still gets burnt by Kevin Durant. His NORM is being hot from the field. He just usually doesn’t assume high shot volume. When he does, he’s probably dropping 40+"
I've been following the NBA seriously for 3 seasons now and this was my first ever opportunity to see a game live. Oh my goodness what a game. Kevin Durant is a killer and the level of skill at an NBA level is monstrous  
Kevin Durant was shooting free throws in the 2nd quarter around the 2-3 mintute mark. Bell and Siakam were beside each other (to box out after the 2nd free throw) and then for some random reason they hugged each other.
"My god, /r/nba hivemind is insufferable.  [Look at their stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id1_select=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=leonaka01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id2_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id3_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y3=2019&amp;player_id3=duranke01&amp;idx=players)  Both Curry and Durant is averaging 5 more points per game than Kawhi. Curry has a TS% of .681.  And it's .618 for Durant. Kawhi is .574.  Both Curry and Durant has a much higher efficiency rating and win shares per 48 mintues than Kawhi. Both Curry and Durant has been doing this for years. Both Curry and Durant had better seasons than this. Both Curry and Durant won MVPs. "

Kevin Durant is good at basketball 
Kevin Durant is undeniably the greatest player on the planet. This was insane. Traps himself in a corner only to nail the turnaround game tying three like it's a lay up
"The top 8 has been the same as people reckoned it was a year ago.  Lebron James is the best player in the world.   Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are #2 and #3, order undefined.  Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook are #4 through 8 in undefined order.  So asking if any of those last 5 players are in the ""top 5"" overall is a tricky question, every one of them over the past year has been at a point where most people would put them in the top 5.   Right now, I would guess for most people it looks something like: Lebron, Curry, KD, then 2 of Kawhi, Giannis, and Davis, with Harden and Westbrook at #7 and #8 right now."
Kevin durant is some fucking box wine. Compared to kobe. 
"Damn.. Kevin fucking Durant is the man. He almost won that game all by himself against a deep fucking squad with Kawhi ""better than Durant"" Leonard leading them. "
Or Kevin Durant
"Not even mad at the loss, it was a fantastic game and Kevin Durant is really good at basketball."
"I might get downvoted for saying this, but Kevin Durant is a top 5 player"
"I'd rather face any team in the East in a series than Kevin freaking Durant, the 2nd best shooter of all time, and Klay Thompson, the 3rd best shooter of all time."
Kevin Durant could shoot an off balance fadeaway hesi pull up jimbo and it would go into the hoop of the ACC. You’ll know what I’m talking about if you REALLY hoop.
"I might get downvoted for saying this, but Kevin Durant is a top 5 player"
"I might get downvoted for saying this, but Kevin Durant is a top 5 player"
lol why you mad. Kevin Durant got so many calls. 
Kevin Durant is just mind-bogglingly good. He is an unstoppable force.
I hate Kevin Durant.... because he is so fucking good..
Kevin Durant is my daddy.
Kevin Durant can shoot the basketball 
" You: The Warriors are the best team in the league because they have Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, AND Demarcus Cousins.   Me, an intellectual: The Warriors are the best team in the league because have Jonas Jerebko. "
"What a great game, Kevin Durant was cooking out there but the defense from Kawhi and Lowry really led us to the win. Really hope this is a preview of the Finals."
"Hate to be controversial, but it would appear that Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard are good at playing the game of basketball. One might even go so far as to say that they're *quite* good.          Jokes aside, that was an amazing game! Hands down the best of the season so far. So entertaining the whole way through."
Why are warrior players not named Kevin Durant touching the ball 
Goddamn Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is very good
Kevin Durant   - One of three players in NBA history to score 25 points or more for 40 straight games in one season  - One of five players in NBA history to win the NBA scoring title in 4 or more seasons  - One of ten players in NBA history to average 30+ points per game for an entire season having started every game.  - One of fifteen players in NBA history to record 30+ points in 10+ consecutive regular season games  - 2nd place all-time for most consecutive playoff series averaging at least 25 points per game with 14.  
No it's not helping but it's dumb to talk about Kevin Durant like he can't single handedly destroy a team. He already destroyed a sport.
"I don't know if you know this, but Kevin Durant is really good at basketball."
Kevin durant ???? Are you watching the game ?
Kevin fucking Durant

Kevin Durant is good at basketball
kevin durant is not nice.
Kevin Durant is absurd
I dislike that Kevin Durant is good at the game of basketball.
Hate him or love him Kevin Durant is unbelievable 
KEVIN DURANT.
It's obviously a Kevin Durant account.   He said he doesn't like the Durantula name. Then he puts a Celtics flair on it. Perfect cover.
1. D Rose 2. kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry 4. James Harden 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Russell Westbrook 7. Anthony Davis 8. Giannis 9. Jimmy Butler 10. Lebron 
-Thought Beasley was going to better than Kevin Durant when he was drafted.  -I thought Kevin Love was going to bust hard.  -I thought Stromile Swift was going to be the best player in his draft. I basically thought he was going to be Shawn Kemp.   -I thought Odom was going to be Magic lite.   -After Carmelo rookie year I thought he was going to be on Lebron level and him/Bron would have a Magic/Bird rivalry.   -Thought Rudy Gay was going to be the best player in the 06 draft. I thought he was going to be a second coming of T-Mac. In the same draft thought JJ Redick would be a huge bust.   -Thought Yi Jianlina was going to be a Pau Gasol level player. I also thought Noah was going to bust hard.  -I thought Joe Alexander would be a Shawn Marion type player.  -and a lot of other wrong prediction.    
1. Kevin Durant  2. LeBron 3. stops reading 
"Right now I would rank them:  1. Stephen Curry 2. Lebron James 3. James Harden 4. Giannis Antekoumpo 5. Kevin Durant  I think that's the clear Top 5.  Then for the next 5, you have probably Westbrook, Butler, DeRozan, Davis, Kyrie, and Towns as the next group, and it's hard to sort out those players. Kawhi would probably be #5, ahead of Durant if he were healthy this year. "
Kevin Durant
"Nicolas Batum for Kevin Durant, who says no?"
"""Durant is allowing opponents to shoot just 38.8% from the field when he defends them - eighth-best in the league among players who have defended more than 200 shots.""  So he's defending both the perimeter and the key.  That's what we need him to do since we don't have a true center.  We need him to slack off a bit to help out.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/kevin-durants-defense-makes-warriors-scarier-2017-12  These numbers show he's shutting down opponents.  And he's number 1 in block shots?  Absolutely he's in the defensive player of the year contention.  "
"Well, yes, that is very likely. The last player not to do that was Kevin Garnett, but he at least had played on a team that had the best regular season record in the NBA and reached the Western Conference Finals in Minnesota.  These stars always leave smaller markets, even before LeBron that's been the case. I'm not saying he WILL leave in FA. I'm just saying that, look, OKC couldn't even keep Durant, him potentially leaving definitely presents a potential pitfall that they have to take into consideration. If NOP gets knocked out of the first round with only 1 or fewer wins in the series, and Boogie is leaning towards an exit, and the Celtics offer them Horford, Doncic, the Memphis pick, Yabusele, and some more picks, that very likely (&gt;30% chance) gets a deal done."
There are literally 1000 examples. just a few:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBPzLopf5rw   http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/03/klay-thompson-steph-curry-celebrate-3-early-steve-kerr-laugh  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/10/16/kevin-durant-makes-like-steph-curry-turns-upcourt-before-three-pointer-drops/?utm_term=.2c8ac5f12073  https://twitter.com/mospeights16/status/742114131302486020?lang=en  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUG91NYykzY  
I think any GM would take Kevin Durant over Lamar Odom.
"they won 40 games in the most difficult Western Conference in years, and his next best player was 50 games of Pekovic or Kevin fucking Martin. They were hardly empty stats. He posted a 0.25 WS/48, (there have been tons of MVPs with much lower WS), he was a +11 on-off, and all NBA 2nd team. There was a legitimate argument for Love being a top 5 player that year. (LeBron and Durant were really the only two players you could clearly say were 100% better.) He was right in that echelon with Blake Griffin, Paul George, young Harden &amp; Curry, DPOY Joakim Noah, and CP3.   Only 4 players have posted better numbers than '14 Love (26/12.5/4.4). Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Wilt, Elgin Baylor and Billy Cunningham. Kevin Love was the only player to not do it in 40-47 mpg. He played 36. He is also the only player to post those numbers since 1976. His 2014 season was absolutely incredible, regardless of how trash his teammates were. "
Early career- Paul Pierce Late career - Kevin Durant
"I dont care about this ""two way"" bullshit. Kevin Durant is simply a better player. I hate saying that. "
"I personally think it's Kevin Durant.  Even with his stats at the rim, he isn't as good on defense as Kawhi, but how can you deny someone that offensively gifted?! "
"&gt;Some podcast was saying how his ceiling was Marcus Smart lol. Might have been Lowe. That's when you know these bloggers are clueless.  Hey, you could do a lot worse than Smart, he's probably one of the best poor-shooting players in the league, his defence and passing match up with elite NBA players...Saying Dunn could develop into a Marcus Smart type player is essentially saying that he has all-star potential if he can learn to shoot.  Lowe is actually pretty high on Smart as well, so I would take the comparison as a compliment more than an insult.      Here's what Lowe's said about Smart in the past  &gt;Among the 353 players averaging at least 10 minutes per game, Smart ranks 340th in the NBA in field goal percentage.  &gt;Despite his shooting struggles, Smart ranks seventh in the NBA in traditional plus-minus at plus-156 for the season. He's one spot ahead of Golden State's Kevin Durant (plus-145). The Celtics do not win 16 straight games nor do they own the best record in basketball at 18-4 without Smart's efforts. ([source](http://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/21589757/nba-more-bricks-better-marcus-smart-celtics))    &gt;Smart's swing pass kicks off that sequence. When the ball gets back to him, Smart drives with a purpose: He knows he can toast Malcolm Brogdon, and that if he does, Marcus Morris will fade to the corner. A bigger guard who can run the offense provides crucial roster flexibility.  ([source](http://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/21771623/zach-lowe-10-things-like-including-chicago-bulls-nba)).  &amp;nbsp;  Lowe's put Smart on his favourite players to watch two years in a row    &gt;Marcus Smart, G, Celtics: The guard version of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist -- a maniac who plays all out on both ends, defends inside your jersey and snags offensive rebounds few at his position are even allowed to pursue. Seriously: You had better box him out, even if he's 25 feet from the rim. Stand upright and he's either sprinting around you, or blasting you out of the way ([2016](http://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/14924135/a-guide-most-watchable-players-nba))    &gt;For better or worse, you cannot take your eyes off Smart. He barrels through screens, snatches loose balls from rivals who grip them first, and outworks two and three opponents for improbable offensive rebounds. ([2017](http://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/19025784/zach-lowe-2017-marc-gasol-all-stars-featuring-nikola-jokic-andre-iguodala-more))   Plus Smart and Dunn are both 23, this idea that Dunn has a lot more growth left in him than Smart is crazy.  "
"Kevin Wayne Durant (born September 29, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has won an NBA championship, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award, the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award, four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, and two Olympic gold medals. Durant has also been selected to seven All-NBA teams and eight NBA All-Star teams."
[Here why don't you read about if from Steve Kerr himself.](http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-kerr-explains-stephen-curry-kevin-durant-pick-and-roll-2017-6) I'm done wasting my time responding to someone who doesn't want to think critically so if you have any other problems with what has been said just write to Steve Kerr and tell him he is wrong. 
"I thought giving up Monta Ellis and keeping Steph Curry would be the worst decision the Warriors would make.  I thought Kobe would have a lot more MVP awards.  I thought Kevin Durant would never join the Warriors.  I thought Andre Drummond would take over the Center position in the NBA And be the undeniably best Center for years to come.  I thought KD, Westbrook, and Harden would be the next Big 3 to win multiple championships.  I thought J. Okafor would be the next Tim Duncan.  I thought Kyrie Irving would fail and struggle without LeBron.  I thought Kyle Kuzma would play like a typical 27th pick. "
Loved Perry Jones. I always thought he just needed to get healthy and get a fair chance. Thought once he got some starting minutes he would have a breakout year and be a very poor mans version of Kevin Durant. He was pretty highly touted coming out of high school/college but never did anything.
"If I was to do awards now: COTY: Brad Stevens. His defensive schemes, great inbound plays and stellar system have lead to his team having the 2nd best record in the league in spite of them losing their best or 2nd best player to injury at the start of the season.  Runners up in order: Erik Spoelstra, Gregg Popovich  DPOY: Paul George. He mans the helm of the #1 defense in the NBA. Paul leads the league in deflections, and on top of that is averaging a good number of steals and blocks while maintaining good positional defense.  Runners Up: Steven Adams, Kevin Durant  Rookie of the Year: Ben Simmons. In spite of the 6ers slide in record, Ben Simmons has been the most productive rookie in the NBA. While other rookies (who will be runners up) have also had great scoring months, his level of consistency, play and versatility has been staggering. He's essentially making up for the 2016 draft being a letdown on his own and reminding us why teams tanked for him.  Runners Up: Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum  MVP: James Harden. Yes he's been injured. Yes Houston's record has slid without him. But its apparent when he's on the court that James Harden is at the helm of one of the best offenses, not just this year, but in NBA history. He is freakishly efficient, dominating all aspects of the offensive end of the basketball, and is showing notably improved defense. If he misses a lot more games then the race becomes closer, but for now he is the clear frontrunner in my mind.  Runners up: Lebron James, Steph Curry (in my biased opinion would be in the lead if he hadn't missed so many games but he missed too many at this point), Kevin Durant  Notable Leave Off: Giannis Antetokounmpo. Watching Giannis feels like his consistency game to game is too poor to give the award. In addition, his dropoff in production against good defenses is staggering. He feels like a case of good numbers due to usage and having the green light. I don't resent him for that, he's a great player and deserves to be recognized as such, however I think his eyepopping numbers are a bit of fool's gold. I personally like rewarding winning, and the Bucks haven't been that stellar thusfar this season. He's a great player, but he isn't in the conversation with the people above in my eyes for that reason.  MIP: Victor Oladipo. His leap in production has been amazing and its leading to wins. He's putting up career highs in all the major statistical categories and efficiency with his usage going up. Its incredible to watch.  Runners Up: I can't think of any  6th Man: I don't think there's a notable frontrunner in this category. I'm personally inclined to say Eric Gordon but I think he and Lou Will will both be off the list of possible 6moy because of how many games they start. If not them I think one of the Raptor's bench players should be rewarded because of how much they've improved, however I don't know who to choose. Poeltl maybe?"
"It's too bad KD didn't do a TV special. I would love to see it, in fact, I already can.. ""Kevin Durant: The Submission"".. smd Dub fans"
"You would be 100% right if KD didn't ball in the Finals. He was the best player on the court in that series, as evidenced by his FMVP. He hit a cold blooded dagger to seal game 3, the dude averaged the most points in the finals while also distributing and rebounding at an elite level.  Let's also not forget that Kevin Durant was out-teamed by LeBron James in his first NBA finals where KD ALSO dropped more PPG than LeBron [Source] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2012-nba-finals-heat-vs-thunder.html). Over the span of 5 years these 2 players have both beaten each other in the same,NBA finals THE SAME WAY (having the superior team) but recency has painted one to be a snake and one to be the NBA's golden child. You want a golden child? He's 40 years old and plays for the Mavs. Dirk is the only one to beat LeBron without multiple star players around him and a stud coach backing the team up."
Drake posted a picture... wearing a *Celtics LeBron James jersey* that shows off his *Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant* tattoos...   WHAT??
I don't know about Kevin Durant but the Real KD tho? The Real KD
"[Here's the article from Jan 2017](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18498479/crash-brothers-stephen-curry-kevin-durant-finding-their-way-nba), Strauss counted 56 possessions, resulting in 54 points. Don't really think too much of it, as Strauss said himself most were just KD slipping out, often for a long jumper. Basically very few advantageous short rolls/4 on 3 situations or forced switches. And that was all in the first ~2-3 months of KD joining the Dubs.   Definitely would be interesting to see this data updated. Reckon it's much more efficient these days. IIRC, they ran about 15-20 Steph/KD PnRs in game 5 alone"
"Then it makes this point interesting...[But, if they rewinded just about 3 seconds more, they would have caught an out of bounds on Kevin Durant. With the logic of the first play, where the play was rewinded to another moment, they could have called this while reviewing as well. The inconsistency is frustrating.](https://i.imgur.com/iODPCrI.jpg)"
"Interesting..  &gt; ""For those who didn’t watch the game, let me explain. The out of bounds call was made at the 1 second mark, when Curry hit the ball out of bounds. However, when the officials reviewed the call, they rewinded &amp; realized that DeRozan went out of bounds at around the 3 second mark.""   +  &gt; [But, if they rewinded just about 3 seconds more, they would have caught an out of bounds on Kevin Durant.

"True, but some players like Kevin Durant are specifically great due to genetics. If he was shorter he wouldn't be nearly as good."
"You need guys like Giannis/AD/Millsapp who can guard both the perimeter and interior. Unfortunately for the rest of the teams in the league, the Warriors probably have the 2 best guys in the league at that. Draymond Green and Kevin Durant "
"I'd have to say Kevin Durant is the MVP on the Warriors. Getting that +0 is difficult, he stayed at equilibrium, one of the toughest task in the NBA.. "
"I’m dying lol, [Drake is really on some different shit](https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/lookit/2018/1/9/16871522/drake-steph-curry-kevin-durant-tattoos) "
"Magic used to have these tweets where he would say something like ""This NBA season has been great. Kevin Durant he has been playing at an MVP level."" Then he would have a second tweet that would be like, ""Some other players playing like a MVP are Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, James Harden. More players like LeBron, Giannis and Kawhi have also been MVP worthy."""
"[Archival photo of Kevin Durant at the ACC, January 13, 2018](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/stranger-things-season-2-monster.jpg)"
"What a great game! The Raptors really wanted the win. Unfortunately, many questionable calls from the refs didn’t really help us. For example: on the last play, [Kevin Durant is out of bounds](https://imgur.com/wQeqvlu) . Nonetheless, I am proud of the boys for coming back from being down 27. This is the heart we need if we want to beat the Cavs in the playoffs."
Why they gotta run a Steph Curry/Kevin Durant pick-and-roll in both games against the Raptors?   Ban that forever.
"Kevin Durant is a punk, that is all. "
Kevin Durant is a ridiculous spider demon created in a lab to be the perfect basketball player.
In what world do you double team off of Kevin Fucking Durant? Oh that's right. In a world where he shares the court with Steph Curry. Shit aint right.
I am disliking this Kevin Durant fellow
https://pics.me.me/1-year-ago-kevin-durant-evolved-into-his-final-form-24673302.png
oh yeah we have fucking Kevin Durant lmao
&gt; Durant is still in consideration as well since he leads the league in blocks and will probably get the defensive player of the year.   I hate to say it but Durant shouldn't get defensive player of the year. He's been focusing too much on hunting blocks. The warriors play better defense this year with him off the court. They give up 108.6 per 100  and with him on and 105.2 with him off([nba wowy](http://nbawowy.com/#/dkg3zr8qed6)). He hasn't been defending that well outside the paint. This [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2018/01/02/draymond-green-is-wrong-kevin-durant-shouldnt-win-defensive-player-of-the-year/?utm_term=.d3f88798f0df) goes into it 
"BuT HeS NoT eVeN tHe BeSt PlAyEr On HiS TeAm  I hate when people say that like it's a fact. Curry is required, Kevin Durant is not."
2 rings in 3 years with once 50 win team with a shit coach. Add to it that he had Kevin Durant to add to that 2nd run. 
"No the reason to tank is to get that superstar player that can alter the face of the league. You tank not get Gobert, but to get Kevin Durant. Mitchell may be the superstar, but it’s still unknown. Gobert is great don’t get me wrong, but he’s not a player who can lead you far into the playoffs. Even if Mitchell ascends to that KD/Lebron/Kawai level superstar a pairing of him and Gobert will probably not win a championship.  In today’s league you need to have a couple of those guys. Gobert will never be that second superstar, he’s good, but not that good."
"Only loose order:  * LeBron James  * Kevin Durant  * Steph Curry  * Kawhi Leonard  * James Harden  * Giannis Antetokounmpo  * Anthony Davis  * Chris Paul  * Kyrie Irving  * Russell Westbrook  Honorable mentions, could see an argument for them to be in:  * DeMar DeRozan  * Jimmy Butler  * DeMarcus Cousins"
"Wait, are you saying that Michael Jordan, highest player efficiency of all time currently, man who was steals leader 3 years of his career, top ten in defensive rating four years of his career and a career overall 22nd in defensive win shares couldn't possibly hold Kevin Durant to 20 points in a game?  Michael Jordan, winner of the defensive player of the year award and 9 All-Defense awards.  You're saying that it's impossible he shaves 6 points (going by his average on Golden State) off Kevin's game?"
Jordan is not stopping Kevin Durant I'm not reading anything else.
"???  Don't get me wrong, I'm personally still on the fence about which team would win, but the 2004 Pistons defense is not nearly as collapsed as you're making them out to be.  They had the 2nd best defensive rating of that season for a reason, arguably the best once they added Rasheed Wallace. Isolations are something they experienced a large amount of as well as screens. They won in the playoffs 4-1 against the 2004 Lakers, one of the faster-paced teams in a league era dedicated to movement. They played against Prime Kobe, Shaq, Gary Payton (give or take, really) and Karl Malone. Those four represent four different ways to score alone.  I'd argue they'd take a game or even two from the Warriors.  And that's BEFORE you add Michael Jordan to the list. You've now turned a team with two great defensive players (Ben and Rasheed) into a team with three. Mismatches? Maybe Chauncey vs. Steph. Even then, a quick switch and you can Jordan or Tayshaun guard him. You can afford to put Tayshaun or Rip on the bench, further bolstering the team's production compared to the lackluster bench of the Warriors.  Michael Jordan alone requires defensive play willing to foul out of a game for him. He had outstanding court vision enough that a double team would be extremely risky with the Pistons players and he'd defensively restrict Kevin Durant enough to slow him to cap at 20 PPG at best, 15 PPG at worst. Plus, despite your '25 shots a game' assertion, you're talking about a man who showed that he could [shoot less and pass more](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01/gamelog/1991/) at the prime of his career when needed. Even then, the 2004 Pistons would have probably fared better as a team if they had someone who could score more consistently, since their biggest issue was almost certainly their volume. Statistically, the man was a better shooter, passer and defender than Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson during an extremely physical era in basketball. It wouldn't be hard to argue a case that he scores even more in this era.  I think it says a lot about the Warriors that I can say all of that and still be undecided, but it's ridiculous to think a sweep would be in place based of offensive/defensive comparisons of different eras. 2004 was much more team-based whereas current times is much more star-based. And 1992 . . . geez, I guess I'm getting to a point where I have to admit it was a different style of play altogether."
Did you just compare Kevin Durant to Melo?  Thanks. I needed a good laugh when I woke up this morning.
"Bruh they could get rid of Kevin Durant and still be favorites for the championship, theyll be fine"
"I believe Grant Hill had the opportunity to become the next great NBA superstar during Jordan's twilight if and only if he stayed healthy and his ankles were not shite.  But the answer is KEVIN ""THE SNAKE"" DURANT"
"I don't entirely disagree with your views, Towns is a transcendent offensive talent built in the mold of Kevin Durant with a frame more suited for a Garnett or Tim Duncan. That can change a team entirely. However, the impact Embiid makes defensively is just ridiculous. Our defense falls completely apart without him, but we're a solid-to-great defensive team when he's on the floor. His scoring's beginning to catch up, and it's not a rare sight to see him drop 25-30 a night anymore, which is why I give him the edge over Towns talent-for-talent, but yes, health is a major concern. If Joel can prove he can play 70 games a year, things could definitely change though."
"I was just saying the general consensus amongst a lot of NBA fans, not my own opinion.  Narrative plays a part and with Kevin durant going off in the finals with finals MVP only fed it. I doubt curry minds being 3rd anyway"
&gt;And teams don’t try and deny Kevin Durant the ball? the 7 footer who shoots 3’s at 40% and can dribble like a guard?  Curry is so great because player**s** have to deny him the ball rather than a player.   Not really too invested in this conversation since there's no possible way KD gets more coverage over Curry. Not even close btw.
"And teams don’t try and deny Kevin Durant the ball? The 7 footer who shoots 3’s at 40% and can dribble like a guard?  Mate any smart team treats them as equal threats with different methods for stopping them. The best way to defend Curry is to cover him and deny him the ball on the perimeter. The best way to defend Durant is keep him on the perimeter and stop him from getting inside. Now neither of these strategies are particularly effective since they are two of the three best players on earth but it is the best known strategy.   Stop saying my comment was wrong btw. We’re having a discussion about basketball with no real right or wrong answers, you’re coming of as petulant. "
Kevin Durant gets put in Slytherin 🐍
"There isn't a win-win move that makes the team better that another team bites on. There are 4 options Cleveland has in this situation  * Gamble on a Moneyball style move where you buy damaged goods and hope they perform (the Nerlens option, other players that fit this bill include Biyombo, PatPat, Pekovic, I think I'm illustrating my point so I'll move on)  * Pay even more luxury tax and try your hardest to move for a max contract C (DJ, Marc Gasol, maybe Dwight Howard? Not a lot of good options up this road)  * Age your roster even more by moving TT (one of your organization's better performing draft picks from the past decade) for a vet big man and a maximum of 1-2 more rings (ZBo, Pau Gasol, Tyson Chandler, Brandan Wright?)  * Try and pay a hit man to assassinate Kevin Durant. Even then KD probably blocks the shot because he does that now  I kid but there aren't a lot of good options at this juncture for Cleveland."

"They made the extra pass but the it was always Lebron starting the offense, either P&amp;R or from the high post.  Lebron can't play another way since he has no idea how to play off the ball, which to be fair is pretty reasonable since he's always been the player with the ball.  Any star on a Lebron-led will need to completely change its game to be a shooter waiting for the ball or setting a pick for Lebron, look at Wade, Bosh, Kevin Love and even Kyrie (he either had the ball in ISO or he was just standing like a shooter), now look at GSW Durant and Curry haven't changed their game offensively, yes they take less shots, but they work inside the offensive flow and that's something Lebron can't do."

It's really sad that fan forums tend to either take 8th man players and make them out to be the next Kevin Durant OR it's the complete opposite and really promising young players get absolutely shit on.  Why is it *always* one or the other?  I guess if you're a newer fan you trend toward homerism (unless your name is Tommy) and if you're an older fan you tend to self-flagellate.

"When they first teamed up that year, it really did seem like they ruined parity as everyone thought they would just run away with the trophy, and up till the 2011 finals it was looking true. Then they lost to the Mavs and their weaknesses were shown/exploited. Many teams actually took it to them and gave them tough series even if it was “their era” (Pacers and Celtics and almost Bulls if only Rose didn’t get injured in 2012 postseason).   Also the only team to have ruined parity is the Warriors AFTER ADDING KD. They were the 2nd best team and they added motherfucking Kevin Durant. "
"Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green"
"SAS would have been, but I was assuming Lebron isn't willing to pull a Durant.  Grizzlies didn't have the space without trading Randolph + filler.  It's close on if that would have been better (remember people thought Kevin Love was a top 5-10 player at the time).  However, the Grizzlies were a small market team and seemingly unwilling to spend to the degree Lebron wanted a team to be willing (one of the two conditions for Lebron to return to Cleveland was Gilbert had to be willing to spend whatever it took).     "
And you know I'm sure Kevin Durant being your teammate also helps. 
&gt; Lebron: 4.89 seconds per touch (highest)  &gt; Kevin Durant: 3.28 seconds per touch  hmmmmm 
"That's not an entirely fair stat to use. The league has a bunch of catch and shoot players, or a lot of people without the responsibility to run the offense.  Comparing forwards with at least 20 mins played per game and have shot creation responsibilities  Lebron: 4.89 seconds per touch (highest)  Tyreke Evans: 4.84 seconds per touch  Kawhi Leonard: 4.81 seconds per touch  Ben Simmons: 4.39 seconds per touch  Giannis: 3.29 seconds per touch  Kevin Durant: 3.28 seconds per touch"
"&gt;If you only look at counting stats sure, but Durant is a way more efficient player    In general? Yes. This season? No. Lebron scores more on significantly better efficiency.

"LeBron is the whole reason that the Cavs have so little cap space to do anything with. He basically forced them to resign his boys to stupid contracts that were much better for the player than the team.   Look at JR's production and salary. They don't match up. Fucking Lou Williams is out there making $7 million right now and JR is making double that on less than half the production.   Look at Tristan Thompson. The dude signed a 5 year, $82 million deal in 2015 while Kenneth Faried (a player than is easily as good as TT if not better) signed a 4 year, $50M deal in 2014.   And look you can point to the increase in cap space and all that bullshit, but end of the deal, LeBron in 2015/16 cared more about getting his friends payed than asking them to take deals that would match their production. He forced the Cavs to overspend by holding them hostage with stupid 1-and-1 year deals to maximize his own salary as well.   LeBron is easily the best player in the world, but even he can't do it alone. And now going out and finding cheapest/best available vet (a la D-Wade) isn't going to work against a Warriors team that is willing to have Kevin Durant take a paycut so that role players and the other All Stars can get their due.   If LeBron really cared about chips then he wouldn't be forcing his team to overspend just so they can keep his boys happy. "
"I value longevity, but I value it less for players I haven't seen (Wilt, Russell, Oscar). Wilt/Russell are dominant enough that I have to include them in a top 10, but I don't know if I care for Oscar or Moses as much as people on /r/nba seem too. I also don't adjust for era as much as other people do on /r/nba because I don't consider myself a great enough analyst/mathematician to do it with rigour.  2 FMVPs and 3 more rings and I think Steph is in the conversation. Especially given how he has changed the game and how his influence will be felt a few drafts from now.   Now, you may say Steph will be declining soon and the GSW are not invincible behemoths. I agree, I think they messed up a potential 5-peat and only this year and maybe the next are ""guaranteed"" rings for them. I also think it'd be extremely hard for Steph to get an MVP or FMVP with Kevin Durant on his team.  That is what I mean by having a chance -- he has to do something extraordinary. But he's in the conversation of guys who can make a leap to that level."

It can be argued that Draymond didn't even deserve to be an All-Star this year and it can also be argued that Klay and Dray only made the All-Star team because of Curry.  IMO Durant benefits from Curry more than Curry benefits from Durant.   Let's not forget the Cavaliers have Isaiah Thomas who was top 5 in MVP voting last year and Kevin Love who has been transformed into a role player who plays below his potential. It's not Curry's fault LeBron led teams don't play as unselfish as his team does.   If the voting is down to the wire between Harden and Steph, you can use Curry's team against him, you can use his games missed against him... But to say he shouldn't be anywhere near being in the MVP conversation? That's ridiculous.   Westbrook is ruled out according to your logic (on paper doesn't the Thunder's starting 5 look better when you think of them individually? Draymond and Klay are great because of Curry.)...   LeBron should also be out considering his team is like 4th in the East and he's playing the exact same way but slightly worst, a 4 time MVP is only winning another one if he somehow takes it up another notch. And being 4th in the East isn't that. (not hating on LeBron, just saying he's not doing enough as far as narrative, etc. to be top 2 in voting)  Giannis is like 7th in the East so he is definitely not winning it as much as I love him.   The clear front runner is Harden and he is well ahead of Curry. It's Harden's to lose. But if Harden slows down and even misses a few games while Steph kicks it up another notch like he's been doing then it could be closer than you think. Unless Harden get's injured (which I hope does NOT happen) then he's winning it. But to say Steph shouldn't be anywhere near being in the MVP conversation? RIDICULOUS. He's 2nd in MVP voting IMO. "

"  https://forums.t-nation.com/t/kevin-durant-bench-press/160244  You literally just said “KD isn’t strong, he’s a twig” which is an idiotic comment to completely and utterly dismiss his strength when all evidence points to the contrary."
"because the cavs gameplan was the same as the last two years, trap curry off of screens and make the other warriors beat you. the only problem was that this year we had kevin durant and not harrison barnes. it was easier for KD to step up because the defense was locked in on curry, curry was the better player and the first option for the entire playoffs"
Idk 2k still has kevin Durant as 6’9
Kevin Durant at 5 years old would get his ass whooped. 
"Kevin Wayne Durant (born September 29, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has won an NBA championship, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award, the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award, four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, and two Olympic gold medals. Durant has also been selected to seven All-NBA teams and eight NBA All-Star teams."
"1.	Lebron James 2.	Stephen Curry 3.	Kevin Durant 4.	James Harden 5.	Giannis Antetokounpo  6.	Anthony Davis 7.	Kawhi Leonard  I get it, Russ fills the stat sheet every night... But so do all of these guys. I'd understand putting him ahead of Kawhi because Kawhi has been out the whole year, so that puts him at 7th.  Westbrook fills the stat sheet just like the other guys, except he isn't nearly as efficient as any of them.  Russ also hasn't proven himself able to be a leader of a team. Even this year, Melo and PG joined him and before this recent win streak, the Thunder were hardly .500. Even then, if you actually look at who they have played over this win streak, it's all been straight trash teams! Last year he had a decent team and still the Thunder were only the 6th seed and didn't even make it out of the first round.  Look, I get it it! He scores lots of points, grabs lots of boards, and gets lots of assists. But he doesn't do it efficiently and he doesn't lead his team's to success. You put any of those other 7 guys in his same situations either this year or last and both years the Thunder would have a better record, and that's why Russ isn't a top 5 player."

Kevin Durant. 
"lmfao. Thanks for Kevin Durant, buddy. He was super instrumental in helping us win our second title in three years. I'm sure he's super excited to be out of that shithole town, and playing with a vastly superior point guard. But hey keep your head up - you guys are looking pretty spooky..Maybe if you get a legit small forward, and say, a bearded 6th man shooting guard to come off the bench, you can make a run. I definitely think you guys can make it past 5 games in the first round this year (gah that was embarrassing).. you guys should be good for at least 6. Who knows, maybe Russ will even get some of those super duper helpful triple doubles while you get trounced out of the playoffs in the first round.   There. Now I'm being condescending. My sunday was great btw.. have a great season!"
"This all star break is gonna be so awesome  Team Lebron, coached by Dwane Casey, starring Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook  Have we seen all these names being in the same sentence before this new format? "
"During the 2016 NBA playoffs, Russell Westbrook would take off all his clothes, fill one of the tubs with marinara sauce, get in and pretend he was a meatball during every halftime. Kevin Durant felt bothered by this, and it heavily influenced his decision to join the Warriors. Unbeknownst to KD at the time, Klay Thompson has an affinity for filling the tub up with maple syrup, laying around and pretending that he's a waffle. "

Oh and then just Kevin Durant sitting on the other side. 
Kevin Durant upset with role on warriors? 
"Lol dude, he's saying Curry is more popular than Kevin Durant based on all star votes. You instantly went in to full defend LeBron Mode. Haha. Chill with the hostility and Wikipedia seachs. "
"I think that's exactly aht /u/ctye85 is saying --- i.e., that Steph *wont* 'seriously challenge Harden.'   Even without the missed games, I just don't see how it's possible Steph can overcome the narrative of 'how can he be most valuable while playing beside Durant, who *might* be better/more valuable than him?'   And, even if you grant that Steph is the better and more valuable player, his candidacy is still crippled by the fact that his efficiency and scoring might suffer dramatically without Durant. It doesn't matter to voters that he's literally done it before without Durant on better efficiency: they can only evaluate what they see this year...and, this year, its clear that Steph is benefitting (as opposed to being hampered, or neutrally-affected) from the increased spacing they get by having Kevin Durant on their team.   I'll also add that Harden might not be the best candidate for MVP either, even though I think it's likely he'll win it this year.   I don't personally understand why Kyrie has been written out of the race -- is him pulling the Celts to 35-15 with Horford and Brad Stevens any less 'valuable' than Harden taking the Rockets to 34-13 with Chris Paul and D'Antoni by his side? Am I a homer for thinking DeRozan belongs in that conversation, at 32-15 with Kyle Lowry (playing not much better than Horford btw, if at all) and Dwayne Casey as his guys?   There are way too many good candidates this year for Steph Curry - who is playing *incredible* basketball, and who may in practice actually *be* the most valuable player in the league - to win the narrative over Harden (who people think has been robbed in the past, and who's playing better and winning more than ever before) or these other players leading teams to top 3 seeds (including Lebron, in that category) who are doing it without a second star of *nearly* the calibre of Kevin Fuckin Snakerant "
"I totally disagree about the Golden State opinion because of the personnel and the system they run. Warriors greatness are not based off of athleticism. They have a great coach who knows how to manage the star players minutes, and Kerr isn't afraid to give certain guys rest on any given day. The Warriors success comes from talent combined with system which resembles how the Spurs play basketball. They have shooters and usually when you're an excellent shooter, you last longer in the NBA. Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry's primes will last at least 5 more years.  Also if you look around the NBA, who are the actual threats to the Warriors? The Spurs are old. The Cavs are older. Rockets are older. OKC as a team is just as old if not older. The only threats in the same conference are the Timberwolves and that's only because of Wiggins and KAT. Jeff Teague and Jimmy Butler are around the same age as the Warriors core. In the East, it's a little more interesting. Celtics looks like the team that can reach the Finals every year in the near future and they'll most likely compete with the Bucks or 76ers. But that's only one team the Warriors will have to worry about since only one of those teams can come out of the East. Warriors got a very good chance to win the next 3-4 NBA titles barring injuries."
Kevin Durant is cute.
Calm down buddy. Kevin Durant is in the gym every day doing strength/conditioning. He isn't some uncoordinated 7 footer.
"Bro she's 5""6. [Here is a picture of KD besides Altuve who is the same height](http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/53f4fe166bb3f79660f7d186-800-801/kevin-durant-jose-altuve.jpg)"
Meanwhile Kevin Durant has recorded 10 in his entire career.
Kevin Durant is a 7ft tall male in his athletic prime. He would murder her.

"&gt;You do know that there are some societies that don't use base-10? It's totally arbitrary.  I'm going to stop you right there because it's clear that you don't know what arbitrary means.  The ideas of:  &gt;There are other alternatives so it is therefore arbitrary.  and  &gt;Not everyone does it so it is therefore arbitrary.  just don't hold water.  That's simply *not* what arbitrary means.  The fact that you seem to think it does is confusing.  I mean, do you apply this idea to other things as well or is it just to the base 10 system?  Let's try something.  In 2016, Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors.  He didn't *have* to sign with GSW, matching your standard that there were other alternatives.  Hell, there are free agents that sign with the *Sacramento-fucking-Kings,* matching your standard that other people did things differently.   So because their were other alternatives and because other people handled their free agency differently, by your definition, KD signing with GSW was ""totally arbitrary.""    Now step back for a second.  Does anyone *actually* try to claim that KD ending up with GSW was ""totally arbitrary?*  Of course not.  Now, why do you think that is?  Logically, it's because the definition you've set for what's arbitrary *isn't* the actual definition.    So now what?  Do you admit that the standards you set to label base 10 as ""arbitrary"" was wrong?  Do you try to argue that KD going to GSW actually *was* arbitrary?  Do you just start calling me names and making personal attacks against me?  Do you move the goal posts by introducing *new* standards?  I've got a good guess, but let's see how it goes."
There is. His name is Kevin Durant 
[kd himself will tell you that’s wrong and he has no reason to lie for Ingram and make him look better](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-says-brandon-ingram-is-further-along-than-he-was-at-that-age/amp/) 
It's only a difference of what Kevin Durant is averaging this year.
That's why his coach referred to Kevin Durant as the better player...
Kevin Durant missed Bus 1
"he was compared more as a worse version of brandon ingram, who was projected as a poor mans durant. so by transitive property, isaac is projected as a homeless prostitute's kevin durant"
"Curry is great, i mean i really have no reason to hate the guy, he's great on the court, great off the court. Him and LeBron are the best role models, no doubt.    &gt;&gt;&gt;   But we talking about individual players here, individual talent and skill. And guess what, like it or hate it, Kevin Durant is 7 feet tall with 7'6 wingspan, no offensive weakness, and now he's also a great shot blocker, due to that height, it's easy for him.     &gt;&gt;&gt;   Curry is the GOAT shooter, but he's 6'2 and fragile. He might be a player you will waste money on to watch him live, but he's nowhere near a better ALL AROUND player than Durant. Tall players just can do more and with ease, that's why Height is most important in basketball than in any other sport.   &gt;&gt;&gt;   You can be super skilled and elite all you want, but if someone's the same skilled or more, but way taller, yet quite fast and agile, the taller dudes will always dominate and win. That's basketball.   &gt;&gt;&gt;  LeBron is obviously the best player in the world, but Durant is still the  undisputed 2nd best. Curry might be the 3rd best, but truth be told, i'll even pick Giannis over Curry if i had the choice, to start my franchise. 6'11 super athletic small forward and a 2 way beast? Averaging like 30 even before developing a jumpshot? I mean that's like young Jordan and LeBron esque, both of them had no jumpshot in the early years, but somehow always kept on dropping 30. Giannis is the same, and once he develops a jumpshot, which he will, he has the highest chance at becoming the best in the world after LeBron. 100%"
for an entire year we had to hear about how the 2015 title was illegitimate because Kyrie and Kevin love were hurt and lost to the cavs a year later. Yet these same clowns bring up that 2015 title to discredit Kevin Durant. It's bullshit
Kevin Durant then Steph Curry
"Yeah. As Steve Kerr put it:  &gt;""Steph is one of the great players in the world. Two time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of the way he impacts the game. But, you’re talking about Kevin Durant at 6’11 protecting the rim, getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do. There’s a different level of impact that is actually possible for Steph and for KD.   &gt;Steph is my size. He’s literally my size. So, what he’s capable of is all based on his amazing skill. He can’t do anything about being 6’3 and a buck seventy-five. So, in the playoffs especially when you’re having to protect the rim and do so many different things. There has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you’re having these conversations about who’s the best player in the league. And that’s why Lebron is there, that’s why Kawhi is there, that’s why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force.”"
Probably Kevin Durant for one.
"&gt;After Curry, Thompson, and Kevin Durant on the Warriors who is able to put out scoring loads to keep up with the Rockets?   Everyone is entitled to their opinion but this is really something else"
It’s time for Kevin Durant to quit basketball and begin his Deo-Durant business
"Why he is playing  better than 2016, he is putting worse number in lesser efficiency and with much more help putting up 50/45/90 with Harrison Barnes is more impressive than putting 49/42/90 with Kevin Durant"
And this ain't the worst of it. The guy has Klay Thompson and Kevin freaking Durant in his back pocket for insurance. I think it's about time to stop pretending. There's no way the Warriors are losing in a 7-game series.
"Cmon you know its true. The Kevin Durant ""block"" is a foul too."
Is Kevin Durant the best player ever to be carried yet take all the awards?  FMVP last year...Apparently leading the MVP race..SAD!

Melo + PG for Kevin Durant  Felton for Harden
Yeah they really flipped the switch after 2016 they look like a completely different team. It’s almost like they added Kevin Durant and are just unbeatable on paper. 
I dislike OKC for how they treated Kevin Durant and Wanda.    Edit:  I also said publicly that  Carmelo Anthony was a bad acquisition for them and will sink the ship.  
THATS LITERALLY A SHITTY KEVIN DURANT AND HE ISNT EVEN THE BEST PLAYER IN THE NBA 
"No this season is about average w/ injuries.. just look at this article talking about the 2015 season, it was much worse that year:  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/6/6/8740725/a-list-of-every-significant-nba-injury-in-the-last-12-months  That was the year Paul George shattered his leg at Team USA. Then Julius Randle broke his leg in his first game. Kevin Durant broke his foot. Chris Bosh was out for the season with blood clots. Kobe and Melo were shut down halfway through the season. Jabari Parker tore his ACL. Wes Matthews and Brandon Jennings tore their achilles.   Even Lebron got injured that season and had to take two weeks vaca in Miami.   Then in the playoffs, Kevin Love got his shoulder dislocated by Olynyk, and Kyrie's kneecap shattered in the Finals. "
"I'd probably pick a starting 5 of:  Zara Pachulia, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry.  I'd watch how the warriors defend the warriors and go from there."

I think he'll be more Ryan Anderson than Kevin Durant
"I think the Wolves will eventually get out bid on Bjelica once we are firmly in the tax. I think he might find the consistency to become a successful second option somewhere. He is a great shooter with a lot of tools and some solid rebounding instincts. If he continues his new found success as 3 pt shooting jumbo wing, he might kind of end up as a really poor man's Kevin Durant. His biggest issue offensively is consistency, I think being in a starting role would help that a lot. He really needs to improve his defensive instincts though. Definitely his biggest weakness, ideally playing into a size advantage would be the best way to play him, further making his transition into small forward ideal."
"Paul outplayed Westbrook in games 1, 3, 4 and 6. The difference was Kevin Durant."
No he's not under rated. He's an all star. He just happens to play with Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.
"Kevin durant is already the best player in the league at this time. Lebron, trying or not, is playing some of the worst basketball of his career during this stretch. As for your question, Kevin durant will not ever surpass lebron unless he goes back home to the thunder and defeats the future dynastic boston celtics multiple times(this is all provided westbrook gets traded bc you can't win a championship with ball hog westbrook)"
"&gt;I don't think we can say for sure that Kyrie is better than DeRozan and Dame    That's funny, because he destroyed your so called 2 time MVP and won a championship. Yes he had LeBron, but everyone saw what Kyrie did in that series too, that was his first finals series as well, and he also sealed the deal. It was so bad, Curry decided the best team in the league with 3 all stars ain't enough, he ain't enough, they need Kevin Durant.. That's just sad.   Countless people would take Kyrie over Curry in a heartbeat, uncle Drew is way more all around when it comes to scoring. No offensive weakness. And you compare him to DeRozan and Lillard? That's just disrespectful. Kyrie already achieved everything than most players could dream of, and he's 25. They are not even on the same TIER as Kyrie and Curry. Stop being a dumbass "
"https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/749385924233093120?lang=en  Sources: Kevin Durant had been recruiting Horford to OKC, but Horford eliminated OKC with no assurance Durant/Westbrook staying long-term.  KD wanted to play with Horford, it was a factor and I quoted Horford who directly spoke with KD about ""seriously considering"".  And Simmons a top forword without his passing/playmaking? Ok... LBJ a top 2 player? Nope  GTFO wannabe hater. Al Horford is a 5 time all star and you can keep bitching with your ignorant ass. People who actually know shit know better."
Kevin Durant has not won a championship.
Kevin Durant has not won a championship.
Kevin Durant has not won a championship.
"In that scenario, I'm not assuming if OKC *could* beat the Cavs, I'm assuming they do. Just because this thread is about if KD has a shot at surpassing LeBron. That was it.   Yes, I think OKC in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016 *could* have beat the Cavs/Heat. They didn't.   If you look at who we essentially turned into PG and Melo (Serge and Reggie Jackson) then you could certainly make the claim that Sabonis and Dipo get traded for Paul George, that is, if Sabonis and Dipo don't ball out last year *because* Kevin Durant.   Assuming OKC wouldn't win in 2017 with the hypothetical lineup of Russ, Dipo, KD, Sabonis/Taj, Adams, then they could have potentially had a lineup of Russ, Robes, PG13, KD, Adams.   Pretty sure that team would be favorites against pretty much anyone.   Brooks could have been an NBA champion coach. It was certainly possible. They could have still gone with Billy D. So far he's been pretty good in the playoffs.     EDIT: I guess if you are asking me if KD can surpass LeBron by beating him with the Warriors, no. He will never be considered better than LeBron by winning with a team where he isn't clearly the best player. "
There's no way any team can come back from a 3-1 deficit against a 73 win team right? It's as likely as Kevin Durant joining a superteam.
"The Jalen Rose and Zach Lowe episodes gave me a lot of nostalgia for grantland, but I just cant do other episodes anymore.  I dont need Joe House and Cousin Sal in my life on a weekly basis and I definitely dont need 31 interviews with Kevin Durant."

DeMarcus Cousins (Team LeBron)  8. DeMar DeRozan (Team Steph)  **Reserves 1st Pick:**  Klay Thompson (Team Steph)
Yeah... Kevin Durant would never do that 
If only he had two of the most elite offensive players of the last decade in Paul George and Carmelo Anthony on his team. Just imagine.   Or even more ridiculous. Imagine if he had Kevin Durant and James Harden on his team.

The players are.  So if I offered the choice of CJ Miles and Billy King as your GM or Danny Ainge but no players, you'd choose Miles and King? After all, the GM isn't on the court.  &gt;One side has Simmons and Embiid. The other doesn't.  Simmons is great, Embiid (when healthy) is great. I think the Celtics can have comparable or better star talent considering their prospects (we've already litigated the judgment of players after rookie seasons) and their ample war chest. "
"They didn't add Durant **because** they weren't confident. If Kevin fucking Durant is available you try for it regardless of how you feel. They beat the Cavs the previous year &amp; they we're up 3-1 against the Cavs after a ""Durant-less"" 73-win season.   They got Durant because they could, not because they thought he was a necessity to feel confident vs LeBron..."
"To present the case for the Celtics, focusing exclusively on the positives of Boston:  -Boston has greater minds in the front office and on the sideline. Brett Brown is a good coach but Stevens has shown that he is top 3 at the absolute minimum with the potential to be an all-timer. Ainge hasn't made a bad trade in five years. Resources that end up in Boston produce more than they do in other teams.  -Boston has more sure things. Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward will both be back by training camp, and while both are coming off injuries we know what they are capable of at full strength (though we have not seen Hayward in Brad's system, so he could continue to improve his game as well). Embiid and Simmons are more unknowns, and while both could have higher ceilings than Kyrie or Hayward, the bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, especially when you factor in Boston's own group of young talent, including Brown, Tatum, and Rozier.  -The Celtics have more assets coming. The 2019 Kings pick (top 1 protected), the 2019 Memphis pick (top 8 protected, then top 6 in 2020 and unprotected in 2021), the Clippers 2019 first (lottery protected for a year then turns into a 2nd in 2021), plus all of their own first round picks moving forward make for a treasure chest that can be used to get a star like Ainge did with Kyrie last summer. Philly doesn't have the same war chest unless they're willing to move Simmons or Embiid.  -Players in the league are drawn to Boston. We were a free agency black hole for years, even decades, but in just the last 5 years (since we hired Brad Stevens, no coincidence) we've explicitly heard Kevin Durant, Al Horford, CP3, Gordon Hayward, and Kyrie Irving all sign with Boston, agree to be traded to Boston (I know Kyrie didn't have a NTC but I think he definitely back-channeled his intentions to Ainge), took meetings with Boston (KD), or openly thought about signing with Boston (CP3 in his video documentary). Casual fans might not appreciate that significance, but it opens the door to free agents, stars, and trade candidates in a way that the front offices of most other cities don't enjoy.    -Final argument: Role players have become star players in Boston (most notably IT) while fringe players have elevated their game (Monroe, Crowder, Turner), and players out of the league last season have become vital contributors (Shane Larkin, who was playing in Spain last season). There's a power to Brad Stevens that gives Boston an intangible but discernible edge in free agent acquisitions.  For all these reasons I have confidence that my Celtics will be in the mix for championships for years to come, which is not a disservice to the 6ers, who have their own bright future and will be battling it out with the Cs for years to come I expect."
"I know this place loves to shit on Kevin Durant, but I love how it never tells anything about anyone else or gives context.   - Kevin Durant has 47 games with 40+ points with OKC. He has won 34 of those (**34-13** record, good for 72% win, which is the same win% the raptors have, 1st in the east)  From those 47 games, theres **one** with sub 40% shooting.   - GSW vs Blazers: Durant has 40/6/6/2 on 57% shooting. The rest of the team shoots 26/57.   - GSW vs Clippers: Durant has 40/4/4/1/1 on **78%** shooting. He has -4 for the game. (Warriors lose by 19). Lou Williams scores 50. Only Draymond plays from the big 4 and shoots 1/9. The team shoots **24/61.**   - GSW vs Blazers: Durant has 50/7/6/2 on 63% shooting. Lillard has 44. The rest of the team shoots 26/63. Klay shoots 6/15.   - GSW vs Pelicans: Durant has 41/10/5 on 62% shooting. He has +1 for the game. Nick Young has -21 on 20 minutes. Draymond has 7 turnovers and 5 fouls, pretty much giving up the posession every other time down the court doing globetrotters passes.  "
"Bill Simmons: ""Kevin Durant is just as important to the Golden State Warriors as Stephen Curry"".  LOL."
KD also blatantly admitted to not heaving desperation shots at the end of quarters to protect his percentages a.k.a. actual stat-padding yet no one talks about it.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/1526943-kevin-durant-claims-he-wont-always-shoot-high-risk-buzzer-beater-shots.amp.html
Someone in this thread said Kevin Durant is a more efficient Carmelo Anthony. Please stop being ridiculous.

Kevin Durant has never won a championship 
Kevin Durant cracks me up when I see how hard he carries the ball. Modern day players would look like nerds too if they had to abide by the same strict rules. 
Kevin Durant will always be 10x the player lonzo will ever be. This convo is just stupid lol
"Watch Game one, Kevin Durant had the most open dunks I’ve ever seen in a finals game"
"&gt; they felt the need to add Durant in the first place   What are you talking about? Durant was a FA and they had max contract space why wouldn't they go after a top 5 player? You're acting like the entire year before Curry was doing interviews begging for another scorer to come there. They were 73-9 without Durant...they didn't ""need"" to add him, they wanted to add him because he's Kevin Durant lol ""Durant is only on the warriors for the finals"" is probably one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. It's an 82 game season with 3 series before the finals.  &gt;Secondly, after Durant got injured late last season in Washington there were lots of reports of the Warriors locker room being dead silent with everybody worried.   Because one of their best players had gotten injured...seriously?  &gt;Last of all, Steve Kerr said Cleveland forced the Warriors to change after 2016 and proved to them they needed more to continue to win championships (implying the Kd addition)  Man you're seriously just reaching. The warriors were able to get up 3-1 after going 73-9 and you're acting like they were shook to their core without Durant. They were literally the best team of all time and had an MVP player...they were fine. They had an opportunity to sign a top 5 player in the league, any GM would have done that. You're trying to draw a narrative that's nonexistent. They were literally 1 game away from winning 2 straight finals and you think they were thinking that they needed Durant to win. "
What about Kevin 'can't bench 185' Durant?  
"Right, lots of respect for Kevin Durant the champion. Overcame all the odds and adversity, really pushed himself even in the finals when they only had one more allstar than the other team after smacking all the West teams who had one allstar in comparision to the Warriors who made due with only four. Very impressive."
"Kevin Durant has won an MVP, championship, and finals MVP more recently than lebron. Let that sink in for you. "

I don’t really look at it, but I would assume he’s got a bigger lower half.”  * [This post](https://fansided.com/2016/11/22/body-parts-team-rudy-gobert-harden-lowry-durant-wingspan/) is ranking best and worst of every body part in the NBA. I was hoping for a longer list, but it's just Lowry best ([not at all in dispute](http://i.imgur.com/XoizyoS.png?1)) and Porzingis worst.   * I will say that in this [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgX28cmF-lo/?utm_source=ig_embed) and this [image](https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2017/11/03/lebron-james-cavaliers-reaction.jpg) of LeBron, I'm seeing size definitely but nothing super impressively shaped. But basketball shorts definitely don't always do much for your butt unless it's already great and Love looks similar in his. It's hard to say who has a size advantage because of the basketball shorts issues and there aren't a lot of photos of Love dressed casually from behind. "

Kevin Durant 
"I will judge him worse because he is held to a higher standard than Kevin Durant. The 76ers are also built for about the next decade, LeBron can just coast with them to titles as they all improve, while KD joined a team already in their primes. LeBron would join a team that just beat him (presumably going to finals) that are already stacked for the future."
"This is cool.  Part of it is abnormally high usage for a rookie.  I wanted to see how this stacked up, so I filtered by per game stats of 16+ pts, 6+ rebs and 1.5+ 3pts and limited it to players under the age of 25, just to see where that would end up and see some potential comps.

"&gt;Most athletic players today are only good at being tall.  You lost me there. Giannis has no skill? How about Anthony Davis? *How about Kevin Durant*? The game has evolved. You can't say that big men today are only good at being tall when a larger percentage of big men are hitting 3's. If anything, the opposite is true. "
hey that guy has the NCAA single-season PPG record for anyone whose first name rhymes with “Kevin” and last name rhymes with “Durant”
*see Kevin Durant*
Steph Curry/Lou Williams   Klay Thompson/Devin Booker  Kevin Durant/Tobias Harris/Brandon Ingram  Draymond Green/Julius Randle/Danillo Gallinari  DeAndre Jordan/Brook Lopez  lol?
"The difference between the two is the fact that there is one skill that is completely irreplacable on an NBA team: the ability to create offense with the ball in your hands in the half-court. If you can do that at an elite level, you are immensely valuable to a basketball team. Tatum will never have quite as much athleticism or length as Kevin Durant, but he can fill the same mold offensively as someone who can his shot off against almost anyone and be a huge threat both on-ball and off-ball.  There are just not that many guys in the league who can run a pick and roll, score efficiently in isolation, and be elite shooters off the bounce, especially at 6'9 with a 7'+ wingspan. Jaylen will always be a terror in transition and a great 3&amp;D wing, but he won't be a guy that you can give the ball to and trust that you'll get a great shot every time. You already see so many flashes of Tatum being a guy who puts up 20+ a night and makes it look easy."
And then imagine Kevin Durant Jr from my 2kMyLeague at 28/29
“Oh Kevin Durant? The guy who couldn’t beat the Warriors so he joined them instead? Yeah that guy is not on par with other legends of the game as far legacies go.”  - Someone 20 years from now.  Durant did something nobody else has ever done because it was without a doubt the biggest bitch move ever.
"even in this thread alone look at how players are perceived differently contemporaneously versus five, ten, fifteen years after their retirement. for example, the Kobe vs. Duncan. of course there were people on either side contemporaneously but in this thread people act like ten years ago everyone agreed that Kobe was better or Duncan was better. who's to say that in ten years the narrative on KD's legacy doesn't change completely?  in ten years imagine coming to an unpopular opinion thread where someone says that five-time FMVP, seven-time champion Kevin Durant made the right move going to the Warriors. what will his legacy be then? will having gone to the Warriors have been a bad move for his legacy?"
It's good he's not a dick like Kevin Durant

"&gt;	Nope, it does. how a player fits in the team is literally the biggest portability reason for picking a player.  When it comes to picking either Durant or Lowry, How a player fits with the team is important only for someone who doesn’t know about basketball. Everyone would pick Kevin Durant over Kyle Lowry. Only someone with no basketball knowledge and relies on one stat would argue otherwise.   &gt;	This is the first time you claimed to ignore team fit. LOL  No, this is just the first time you learned what the actual question was. I think dumbing it down for you helped, so you’re welcome.   &gt;	I would 100% take Lowry over Durant in Raptor’s current roster construction. Lowry has been better this year than Durant has been in his entire career.  HAHA omg you actually just said this, lmfao.   &gt;	So yes, just like the first time where you deleted every single fucking comment because it was clearly fucking wrong and i humiliated you.  To be honest, I’m actually incredibly surprised you haven’t edited your comments in this chain. Maybe calling you out scared you a little bit. But look, now I don’t have to delete my comments due to your editing.   &gt;	This is fucking stupid as shit since Durant is the far inferior defender AND is the far weaker playmaker.  HAHA and here you are expanding on your terrible hot take. Lmaoooo  &gt;	You asked me to pick one for my team despite not specifying my team’s need.  Because thats not the question i am asking, lmao. Im asking, if everything the same, who would you take? is that really so difficult for you to understand?? Its so simple, really.  &gt;	Furthermore, if you are going to stan Lebron   LMAO who’s talking about LeBron?! I never mentiomed lebrons name eve  once. You are all over the place here. Why would you randomly bring LeBron into this conversation? See now your throwing in extra fluff to deflect your illogical hot take that you would rather have lowry over Durant. Hahaha I take this as your concession, this was really too easy for me. I don’t even get how you turn to LeBron when you lose an argument, did he do something to you? Lmao  Better luck next time."
"&gt;	Once again, since you are unable to read, I will answer again buddy.  &gt;When there’s a team without a scorer, I take Durant.  &gt;If i need a great playmaker/defender, I take Lowry.  &gt;Who you take completely depends on team needs.  &gt;Literally, copy and pasted from my last comment.  &gt;Read. It helps  Again, all of this is completely irrelevant lmao I didn’t ask any question that would warrant these responses. You need to learn some reading comprehension.  &gt;Oh Durant.  YES, WE MADE IT. YOU FINALLY UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION. Finally, Jesus Christ, after all that word salad, you finally answer the question.   So even tho his RAPM, a stat that you have been spamming all over this sub, saying it’s the best and only stat you need, even tho Kevin Durants is lower, you’ll take him over Kyle Lowry. That’s all I needed to know, thank you for proving my point.   &gt;	Multi year RAPM gives Durant a huge lead.  Oops, there you go again with multi year fluff stuff when I specifically said I’m not talking about their career, just talking about this season alone. Answering questions that werent asked again, reading comprehension is imoortant here.  &gt;	You literally rephrased the question just now.

"&gt; My goodness all of that writing and yet you still couldn’t answer a simple questions lmao all that dipping and dodging and not even close to the question I asked.

Once again,  since you are unable to read, I will answer again buddy.  When there's a team without a scorer, I take Durant.  If i need a great playmaker/defender, I take Lowry.  Who you take completely depends on team needs.  Literally, copy and pasted from my last comment.   Read. It helps  &gt; Since RAPM is so important to you, looking at this seasons RAPM, if you were GM of a team and you get to choose Kyle Lowry or Kevin Durant, regardless of your team, who do you pick?  Oh Durant. Multi year RAPM gives Durant a huge lead.    &gt;Please stop dipping and dodging the question. I literally could not have made the question any more simple. Just answer the question.   You literally rephrased the question just now.   Do you actually have some issues? Seriously.     "

You know Kevin Durant was once a no-name bench player right?
"Since when are these considered spare parts:   Dwayne Wade: Finals MVP, 8x ALL NBA, 12x ALL STAR  Chris Bosh: 11x ALL Star, All NBA 2nd Team  Kyrie Irving: 5x All Star, All NBA, ROTY  Kevin Love: 5x All Star, 2x All NBA  Add to the fact that Miami/Cleveland has had one the highest if not the highest payroll every year. Spare parts? My ass.  Now look at Kevin Durant in 9 years in OKC:  Westbrook: 7x All Star, 6x All NBA, MVP  Thats it.  Just one guy. KD had no other All Star or All NBA Player besides Russ. He also played for an owner who didn't want to go over the tax until his 9th year in the NBA."
Rare pic of Felton holding Kevin Durant.
[Believe it](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12596449/kevin-durant-says-love-stick-oklahoma-city-thunder-whole-career)
"As far as I'm concerned that's still organic, trades don't upset the balance since teams have to give up good pieces to receive good pieces. It's not like they traded Kyle Singler for Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant has to at least make the list.....
Where's Kevin Durant?
"Because you're trying to objectively say ""this one Mavs title is more impressive/means more than the last three years for Golden State."" because...? Because what? Because the warriors have been too dominant? Because Kevin Durant joined? People love to hate the Warriors now that they've been so successful, especially with the addition of Kevin Durant. The core of the team was all homegrown, taking a franchise that was a joke and completely turning it around. I loved that Mavs team and was rooting for them like everyone else but it seems a bit much to say that one run means more than everything the warriors have done. Perhaps I'm being a homer, perhaps that's not what you meant, perhaps I've grown too used to people online hating the warriors for petty reasons. But yeah, seems like a bit much."
"Dame is a leader though. He takes control of the locker room and off the court the way Durant never did. He accepts his criticism and takes the failures of the team on his own shoulders.   Also kd wasn’t out there giving the players bonus checks for being under the cap to employees. Dame led in team in giving the trainers/staff that check because he views everyone from top to bottom as part of the team and part of their success. Kevin “I’m a 250 dollar shoe athlete” Durant is everything dame isn’t. He’s weak, a mental midget, and shies away from completion or adversity.   This is also coming from a fucking lakers fan who absolutely hates the Trail Blazers. I want them to lose every game but I respect the hell out of dame, he’s a damn killer on and off the court "
I just wanna point out Lebrons move to a 5th seed 47-35 heat team with an addition of Bosh is very different than Kevin Durant joining the best regular season team of all time 73-9 Golden State Warriors. I hope you can see that.

"&gt;talking about WHY he wants to stay and what he loves about the city and the challenge of it and pretty much repeating the same things multiple times a year.  i can link the many, many times KD reiterated the fact that OKC was the perfect city for him. Saying how low key the city is and how nice the people are fits his personality perfectly. the fact that its a small market town and keeps him out of the spotlight is something he liked about it too.   &gt;He also said he'd rather try and fail here than have to go somewhere else. Durant ever say that?  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14400898/oklahoma-city-thunder-kevin-durant-considers-career-los-angeles-lakers-kobe-bryant-epic  ""That's a dream,"" Durant said of Bryant playing 20 seasons. ""That's the type of career you want to have when you come into this league. For a guy to finish the way he wants to finish, more than half his life as an NBA player, that's an accomplishment in itself. *If he would've never won championships or MVPs, he still played 20 years in this league. It's amazing. Not too many people can say that*.""  ""But Kobe, he's done it, Tim Duncan's done it. Just as far as staying with one organization, when you win a title with them it makes it easier to ride it out, and that's what those two guys have done.""  ""I'm one of those guys that would love to stick it out with one team my whole career,"" he said. ""Kobe, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki type. That's awesome. But you never know what the future holds sometimes and how teams may feel about you after a while, but I love it here and I would love to get my jersey retired here."" KD implying   it was a lot more than just ""I want to spend my whole career here""  im not saying lillard is going to leave, but pointing out the things players say is not reason to believe them. I remember being in the same school of thought as blazers fans are in this thread. throwing out quotes from KD as proof that he would stay. most of us thought westbrook would be the type to leave because he wouldnt gush about okc as much as KD. "
Kevin Durant tho
"So LeBron has only played 4 more seasons than Kevin ""better scorer than LeBron"" Durant, but KD is already at least 6 seasons (151 games behind at 25 games a year) worth of 30+ pt games behind LeBron. I'm going to remember this the next time someone says KD is hands down the better scorer. "
"&gt;I think screen setting is really underrated between fans these days. Sure, its nice to have someone who can shoot and drive and do everything, but I'm not sure if KD could set screens at bigger volume. That shit's hard, everyone who played ball knows that, you get hit all the time  You're forgetting that this cuts both ways.  Who do you think gets more banged up and fatigued in this scenario: the screener who knows when, how, and where the contact will occur and is bracing for it, or the defender who can't afford to take his eyes off Curry for a second and often gets blindsided by the hit?  And of course, that's after the defender has already been catching a shit ton of screens from Draymond and Zaza.  Yeah Durant can't run it forever, but he just needs to run it enough that the defender is a dead man walking.  Then you have a bottomed out defender versus a mildly fatigued Kevin Durant.  The Warriors will take that trade 10/10 times."
"[This](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12596449/kevin-durant-says-love-stick-oklahoma-city-thunder-whole-career) article about KD wanting to stay in OKC is also littered with ""for now"" type of statements.   ""I love playing for Oklahoma City, man. There's just a certain level of pride that I have when I play with that Oklahoma City on my chest,"" he said then. ""So that's the only thing I'm focused on. Everybody knows that I represent where I come from that no matter where I play at, no matter what arena. But I'm just focused on playing with Oklahoma City. It feels like home now. That's where I am.""  I'm not saying Dame won't change, that the situation won't change, and that he'll be in a Blazers jersey forever. Shit happens in life. But he lives in Portland year round, moved his mom and brother out here, and embraces this city in a way I've never seen an athlete embrace Portland. He may not be a Blazer forever, but I believe that at this time in his life, he plans to stay in Portland for the rest of his career. "
"You can absolutely do it if you understand the purpose.  Curry's job as the screener is not to bodyblock the center so KD can blow by, it's to make his presence known and make the center make a choice.  Once Curry enters the equation the center has a choice: avoid Curry and double team Durant on the drive and let him kick it out for the most guaranteed 3 point shot of all-time, or stay with Curry and let your point guard try and defend Kevin Durant one on one.  Curry doesn't need to be a brick wall in the pick and roll, his offensive reputation plays much more havoc on the defense than his physical stature ever could."
"&gt; You said that lol you edit majority of your comments all the time to make things look out of context. That why I had to delete my comments. Notice people can see when you edit your comments.

You've been deleting your comment because i proved every single one of them wrong.   &gt; Would you take Kevin Durant or kyle lowry right now if you had to choose one of them right now for your team? With that quote from you.   Since you are not able to read, nor understand basketball in general.   I will help you out. Only in the regular season,  When there's a team without a scorer, I take Durant.   If i need a great playmaker/defender, I take Lowry.   Who you take completely depends on team needs.   Lowry has absolutely been more impactful than Durant.   &gt; Don’t give me “Durant has better rapm for his career” again because that’s not what I’m asking, pay attention.

Having Porzingis protect the rim means you have Boogie chasing Kevin Durant around when the Warriors use their small ball lineup.  Imagine a Steph-KD pick and roll/pop with Irving-Boogie defending it.  
"&gt; Dude you can argue to someone else that you’d rather Kyle Lowry over Kevin Durant lol don’t waste my time with that.    Once again your reading comprehension is absolutely fucking pathetic.   I am literally going to copy and paste what I wrote for you, 10 minutes ago:  &gt; Durant is the better player. His multi-year RAPM far surpasses Lowry.  &gt; However, Lowry has been playing more impactful basketball this season.  &gt; Answer that question: You think Durant is a better fit with the Raptors than Lowry? If so, your basketball iq is essentially the same as a 5-year-old's.  Holy fuck, I am actually CODDLING you to read the fucking comments you are responding to.   "
Dude you can argue to someone else that you’d rather Kyle Lowry over Kevin Durant lol don’t waste my time with that.
Lmaooo you’re the troll man. I don’t think anyone in their right minds would take Kyle Lowry over Kevin Durant. You would be a terrible GM. You need to change up how much you rely on that statistic. 
"&gt; What I’m implying is that no matter what team I have, if it came down to picking either Kyle Lowry or Kevin Durant for my team, I’m taking Kevin Durant 10 times out of 10.   Then you would be dumb. Seriously.  KD is the far better scorer, Lowry is the far better playmaker/defender.   Jesus Christ.... Wow.  Wait you think this Raptor's team fit better with Kd or Lowry?"
"&gt;	Well, it depends on the team. Are you seriously implying Durant is better than Lowry in EVERY possible scheme?  What I’m implying is that no matter what team I have, if it came down to picking either Kyle Lowry or Kevin Durant for my team, I’m taking Kevin Durant 10 times out of 10. "

"kevin durant. if he didnt get his 10 or 11 free throws a game he wouldnt be the ""amazing scorer"" he apparently is"
"Stephen cury , kevin durant and draymond are protected by referees in both ends of the court"
"&gt; Fair enough, how about we compare Kyle Lowry and Kevin Durant. Do you believe Kyle lowry is more impactful than Kevin Durant?   LOL yes.   Kyle Lowry is clearly more impactful for his team than Durant.   Every single impact stat outside RAPM claims the same thing, so now, what's your argument that it's wrong?   &gt; Do you believe Chris Paul is more impactful than Kevin Durant?  Yes. Paul has been more impactful in his minutes.   LOL BTW? You are continuously forgetting possession time.   &gt; Any stat that has James Harden ranked as the 41st most impactful player in 2018 should not be the only stat you look at. You have to look at all the stats in their entirety.  This is stupid as shit.   James Harden has always been overrated in increasing his team offense. Since January, Rockets has played far better when Harden was on the bench. You don't think that has anything to do with the fact that his RAPM is so low?   Also? Good time to mention: Other stats are just absolutely awful comparative to RAPM, as seen by that literal link.   Holy shittttttttt, If you are going to create an argument, read the actual discussion, please.   &gt; I’ve already poked holes in that theory, not gonna try explaining it to you again since you clearly don’t get it. You shouldn’t keep spamming a stat, especially a stat that you have no idea how it works. Even if it were the best stat available, which it clearly isnt, it still shouldnt be the only stat you look at. That just shows your bias and frankly, it’s just lazy.    So nothing. You have literally argued nothing against the fact that RAPM has the highest predictive rate of ANY stat so far. You clearly don't understand the stat either since you are completely forgetting possession time and roles played on the team.   You literally said RAPM was ""plus-minus"" when it's completely different from that.   Seriously, if you are not able to understand the metrics, why would you talk to me? LOL   &gt; You shouldn’t use words that you don’t know the meaning of. Just because someone points out the flaws in your argument and shows you how illogical your thinking is, that doesn’t make them a troll.    You are clearly trolling because I absolutely destroyed your horrific argument regarding Pau.   Once again, if you don't understand a metric, just study. It might be beyond your intellectual capacity, but at least you can try.    "
Not Kevin Durant
"Bruh you guys will be fine, other teams have bigger problems then ""Currys out and Kevin Durant is our best player rn :("""
"I didn't include OKC because I am under the impression that we are talking about the Warrior convincing Durant on taking a pay cut to sign Nick Young, but I'll give this a shot anyways.   The maximum amount Durant can get in the 2017-18 season is by signing a 1 year contract in the 2016-17 season, then signing a maximum contract for 35% of the cap in the 2017-18 season. This is because the ""Designated Veteran Extension"", or ""Kevin Durant Rule"", came about in 2017 Collective Bargaining Agreement. This means that he was only eligible for 30% of the cap in 2016-17 with only 9 years of experience before that.   Taking into considerations of the cap jumps, this means that the maximum contract Durant can get is actually the same contract that Curry has now, which is $34,682,550 in the 2017-18 season. This is still only a pay cut of $9,682,550, not more than $10 million.   Out of laziness and not willingness to do Durant's tax returns, I punched $34,682,550 into the OK tax calculator, and $25 million into CA tax calculator.   So, accounting for difference in tax, Durant makes approximately $11,417,286.06 with the Warrior after pay cuts vs. a maximum of $18,662,532.18 he can get by staying with OKC, thus losing $7,245,246.12 woot.   He lost approximately 38.8% of income after taxes, ouch.  "

Kevin Durant would like a word with you
Kevin Durant made the right choice in free agency. Was it a bitch move ? Yes. But no one talks about the other options he had. Boston didn't have Kyrie back then why would he go there. Miami had lot of bad contracts and he wanted to compete rightaway which could have happened there. Him joining spurs would have been more awful to the league than the warriors. Just imagine KD-Kawhi-Lamarcus and Pop. Imagine when lebron has durant guarding him and kawhi switches on to him in pick roll in the finals. That shit would have been nasty. But he was clearly friends with Draymond and had a lot respect for the way Curry was totally being humble about taking back seat to him and he LOVED the way warriors play. He clearly wanted to leave once Horford chose Boston and he knew there was no way he can play in a system with a lot of ball movement with westbrook and waiters at the helm. He should have called Westbrook before saying his decision to Draymond other than that I got no regrets with his move. It was a 'free' agency and he chose the team he wanted to play for. If the warriors had to trade iggy and klay in order have the cap space to sign Durant this situation would have been better 
I dont think The laker are that great of a FA destination. I dont get why La always gets consideration as a fa destination when half the time the free agent themselves  doesn’t even consider it ie lemarcus Aldridge or Kevin Durant.  Theirs a offseason players can just live in la during that time. People act like players have to play for the lakers  to live  their. 
"&gt;	So do you believe a stat is perfect?  No one thinks one stat can tell you everything. At least, no logical person that knows what they’re talking about. Remember, you’re the one spamming RAPM, claiming Jae Crowder is more impactful than Kevin Durant. Not me.  &gt;	You believe RW was BY far the best player last year?  Maybe we should check his RAPM.... LOL"
"It's not ""ridiculous"" to not be Steph Curry, no one really is. I'd say what's ridiculous is to expect that from Kevin Durant. He is what he is, he's good at many things. His weaker points are also well known, starting from the fact that he doesn't really have a good reaction to being doubled and, well, is a 7-footer with relatively good playmaking, not a real playmaker. Also not the best shooter ever... he's just not Curry, he's a bit strange fit in this team, but the results in the end are good if both play."
&gt; Kevin Durant is probably the best valued player in the league. You aren't gonna get better for cheaper.      Did you even read before commenting? He was literally talking about value. 
1. LeBron James 2. Dirk Nowitzki 3. Chris Paul 4. Dwyane Wade 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry  I think after that it remains to be seen who else makes the cut.

"&gt;LOL yeh except the fact that you are just a fan, and you have no say in anything, FYI.  Where did I imply that I had any say in anything that the Celtics do? I'm making a reasoned guess at our moves if LeBron signed in Philly, not delivering a press report.  &gt;The Eastern Conference has been trying to make moves for a decade just to get past LeBron, and everyone failed  The Celtics beat LeBron twice, in 2008 and 2010. They beat him so badly that he fled Cleveland to join a super-team.   &gt;They would rather take their chances in that super packed West, than get steamrolled by LeBron, AGAIN.  Gordon Hayward? Kyrie Irving?   &gt;Celtics wasn't going to beat playoff Bron and this dumb ass Cavs team in a 7 game series even with Kyrie and Hayward.  We can't know and unfortunately we'll never the chance to find out but I'd say Celtics in 5 or 6 based on how the Cavs have played thus far. Your hope that they'll improve is based on Love gaining thirty pounds again and Rodney Hood coming up clutch in the postseason.   &gt;Then Bron went ahead and destroyed Toronto and Boston, they couldn't even compete.  Lowry and IT were hurt for both those series. Do you talk shit to Spurs fans about how noncompetitive they were after Kawhi got hurt in the WCF last year?   &gt;Bron doesn't even respect Toronto and Boston, he owns them. Indiana deserves a lot more respect, because they are the only team that always gave him problems. Even when he was in Miami, Indiana was the only team ever that forced a 7 game series against Bron.  You mean like how the Warriors own Bron? Be real, if they get to the Finals are they winning a *game* against Golden State?   If it doesn't matter how much talent the Raptors or Celtics have, why do you think it will matter how much talent LeBron puts around him? KD owned him last Finals, then Iggy stripped him of the ball in his last chance to even compete in that series.   &gt;If that dude leaves this trash inconsistent team, and joins Philadelphia with Embiid and Ben Simmons, surrounded by all those crazy shooters and defenders, it's a wrap.  Yeah, every superteam works out perfectly. Just ask Dwight, Kobe, and Nash.    &gt;Y'all would need to get a Kevin Durant or Anthony Davis combined with Kyrie and Hayward to even compete with a Phili team including LeBron.  My top comment is about the Celtics getting Kawhi, wtf do you think I was talking about? "
"&gt;We'd make our own moves if this happened  LOL yeh except the fact that you are just a fan, and you have no say in anything, FYI. The Eastern Conference has been trying to make moves for a decade just to get past LeBron, and everyone failed, and quickly ran out of the East and landed in the West. They would rather take their chances in that super packed West, than get steamrolled by LeBron, AGAIN.   &gt;   Celtics wasn't going to beat playoff Bron and this dumb ass Cavs team in a 7 game series even with Kyrie and Hayward. History says it's foolish to judge them based on this series against Indiana.      Even last year, the hardest series for the Cavs was against Indiana, that was the only series where every game was close. Then Bron went ahead and destroyed Toronto and Boston, they couldn't even compete. Bron was drinking beer, spinning the ball like a globe then shooting in their face, being up 50 by half time etc etc.    &gt;   Bron doesn't even respect Toronto and Boston, he owns them. Indiana deserves a lot more respect, because they are the only team that always gave him problems. Even when he was in Miami, Indiana was the only team ever that forced a 7 game series against Bron.    &gt;   &gt;competitive series    You got to be the biggest delusional Celtics fan around here. If Bron of all people, leaves this trash inconsistent team, and joins Philadelphia with Embiid and Ben Simmons, surrounded by all those crazy shooters and defenders, it's a wrap. SWEEP CITY. Hayward and Kyrie will stop them? LOL That's adorable   &gt;    Celtics can't do shit to counter that, no matter what.. Y'all would need to get a Kevin Durant or Anthony Davis combined with Kyrie and Hayward to even compete with a Sixers team including LeBron. Otherwise, Goodnight LOL"
"Same thing happens to anybody polarizing. If you're a star, the positive attention you gain will eventually be loud enough to draw loud negative attention too. Read any thread hating on Russell westbrook (""ballhog, statpadder""), james harden (""no defense, not a leader, choker, etc""), lebron (""not jordan lmao, bad leader blah blah""), Kevin Durant (""can't carry, fake, snake, etc""), it's all the same shit, and it's not at ALL new.  Kobe got all of the same hate as westbrook. Jordan got tons of hate for being a shit team mate. Shaq got tons of hate for ""low effort."" KG and Dirk and Paul Pierce and Allen Iverson and Tmac and many other guys got all kinds of criticism for being ""great but not a guy that can carry you over the finish line."" It's funny because every season that applies to somebody lmao. "
This is Kevin Durant for me except we beat him one time
Kevin Durant is the best example. Made .7 threes per game at a 28% clip.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html
"I mean you could say the same thing about Klay Thompson. I don't think I've ever seen him ""create"" a shot but hes one of the best offensive wepons in the game.   Every player has different skill sets and a different utility. Love isn't a shot creator and nor are most players in the league. The ability to create shots for others and even for yourself is rare and sought after in the league. Love is an excellent 3 point threat and plays excellent defense. Loves most important responsibility though is rebounding and spot up 3's. Thats what hes good at and thats what he does.   To your point on matching up with KD, have you seen *anyone* match up well with KD? Generally shorter players are quick, able to shoot off the drible, and have excellent handles while taller players are slow and have less control over the ball and generally rely on teammates for shot creation. KD is singularly unique in that hes one of the tallest players in the league yet moves and shoots and has handles like a much smaller guard. No one can guard Kevin Durant. "
Kevin Durant has never thrown a self alley oop in the NBA finals. 
I haven't seen anyone in his class with better handles...he has one of the best crossovers I've ever seen from a HS player and I've been watching mixtapes for a solid 8 years   And it was Kevin Durant... 
"Players 22 or younger in NBA history who have scored 20 PPG with TS of 60+%: Adrian Dantley, Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, Charles Barkley, Bill Cartwright, Dwight Howard, Amar'e Stoudemire, Karl-Anthony Towns (2x, only player in NBA history who did it twice before their 23yo season)  Players in NBA history with 1500 points, 1000 rebounds, and 100 threes in a season: KAT (2x)"
"Until Kevin Durant stops being Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson forgets how to shoot, I don't care who they're playing aside from the Rockets. Warriors in 6 at most. Plus Kerr&gt;Billy Donovan so the coaching match up won't be the same as it is right now. "
*Kevin Durant disliked this*
Everyone needs help. After they blew a  3-1 lead in 2016 the 73 win Warriors called Kevin Durant from the parking lot for help because LeBron beat them. 
&gt;The irony is that they all love Kevin Durant.  Lol
“Kept the worst one” yes cause they asked Kevin Durant to pack his bags
"OKC doesn't just look bad right now, but hatred of Kevin Durant just decreased an entire percentage point"
hmmm wonder why Kevin Durant wanted to leave.
I live in Northern Cali and a lot of people here hate Lebron I think mainly for beating them in the finals 2 years ago. They say that he's overrated to hell and that he is a traitor to Cleveland for leaving to go to Miami. The irony is that they all love Kevin Durant.  None of them will admit their own bias either.
“Kevin Durant wouldn’t have needed a game-winner “- Skip Bayless 
"You referring to this quote?  ""Could you [take a discount]?"" Kawakami asked.  ""**I probably could, yeah**,"" he replied. Klay did say that it couldn’t be as big as the one Kevin Durant took. ""That much? I don’t know. I don’t make as much as Kevin off the court […]It’s a blessing whatever contract I sign, **I would definitely consider it cause I don’t want to lose anybody.**"""
"Lol don’t forget about the Warriors, especially Kevin Durant "

Kevin durant would be better imo
"LeBron:You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Dwayne Wade and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another player, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Kevin Durant, to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the NBA Title in June , you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Kevin Durant  KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try! So Dwayne Wade, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus my 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning. But then you take my 75% chance of winning, if we was to go one on one, and then add 66 2/3 per cents, I got 141 2/3 chance of winning. See Kevin, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you."
"definitely read that as ""cuddle with Kevin Durant"""
"He's listed at 6'9 but just about everyone knows that's not true, and he's come out and said so himself before.

Paul George - Call up the Sixers at the start of the free agency and say you would like to take their max salary slot.

Deandre Jordan - Sign with the Pacers. 
"*ESPN: "" Kevin Durant rips former team, says 'got [...] asses kicked by them' ""*"
"&gt; The problem is that nights like Game 1 vs. the Jazz are the rule for Durant and more like an exception with George. The past three games have been a good window into what separates George from someone like Durant—he's shooting 37.9% from the field and 31% from three, and while OKC's defensive breakdowns are not strictly George's fault, Ingles has exploded as the secondary scorer who makes the entire Jazz offense much tougher to handle. None of this is to say that George is anything less than a perennial All-Star. It's just telling that when OKC needs to be saved, George isn't faring any better than Westbrook.  &gt;If we're all looking ahead to free agency and what's possible, everyone should also be clear-eyed about George's limits. He has gifts that give him one of the highest upsides in the NBA, but the execution is uneven, and if you're counting on George to carry your team, the results will be underwhelming. Graded on a superstar's curve, his shooting isn't consistent enough for an elite scorer, his shot selection is all over the place, and his defense comes and goes as his responsibilities on offense increase.  &gt;George would be much better embracing a role that asks him to dominate on the margins. Clean up the shot selection. Play great defense. Get easy buckets in transition. Hit open threes. His best role in the NBA would be playing next to superstars as a rich man's Andre Iguodala, not a poor man's Kevin Durant.  &gt;That's where free agency questions enter the conversation. Does George appreciate what his ideal basketball situation is? How badly does he want to play in Los Angeles? And will the teams pursuing George expect him to be more Durant, or more Iguodala?"
"Zaza Pachulia, Joakim Noah, Russel Westbrook, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Tony Brothers and the Warriors."
"Lebrons shot is fine, but he's never been a 3 and D guy, nor is he a midrange savant like Lamarcus Aldrige is. Honestly, it's not necessarily that Philly needs more shooting, but rather that the court really can only hold one post player at a time. Simmons is dynamic and can distribute the ball and Embiid can shoot the three with enough space, but they play the best in the post and they currently take turns playing in the post.   Lebron, on the other hand, is primarily a post player. In fact, you could say that he uses his post play to get himself in rhythm for his three point shot. That's why players like Chris Bosh and Kevin love went from post playing savants to three and D guys after playing with Lebron. So to me, getting him is not only redundant but kills spacing. You'll get traffic jams, making the offense awkward and clunky.   Even if Philly got a non three point shooter like Aldridge, or Kawhi, they'd still be a better fit because they can rely on their mid range shots, rather than their stellar post play. Even if Philly can't get Durant, a player who can both shoot the three and is solid from mid range like Klay Thompson is still a better fit than Lebron and a solid choice."
"What if Kevin Love or Chris Bosh went to play with LeBron? What if Kevin Durant went to the Warriors?   You are silly with that shit, there are only so many shots. Pop would never run the LeBron/Lue offense. "
Rondo's not terrible at defending the post up. Granted its Kevin Durant but he was never bad at defending bigger guys in the post
"&gt; We have great fans here in OKC, that have truly embraced this team  Wait til you suck for five years and then we'll see. You were gifted a team with Kevin Durant that was a contender from year 2. Going to be very interesting to watch what happens when OKC can't get any free agents and is in the lottery for a long stretch of time."
Did you not see him get elbowed in the mouth yeasterday and stay on his feet and play with a bloody lip... probably not. I bet kevin durant wouldve gone out on a stretcher and a neck brace.
"His post Durant career is going to likely be two back to back first round exits.  When Kevin Durant was still on the team, bad decision making by Westbrook lost playoff games for the team almost every single year.  The amount of times Westbrook aggressively drove to the rim with his head down at the end of games while one of the best shooters in the history of the NBA stood open is mind boggling.  The amount of times he took way more shots than a way better shooter in Kevin Durant, was also mind boggling.  "
"Durant, Oden, Crittenton, Thad Young, Eric Gordon, OJ Mayo, Kevin Love, DRose, Beasley, Deandre Jordan, Anthony Randolph, Bayless, JJ Hickson, Donte Green, Jennings, Jrue, BJ Mullins,  Wall, Cousins, Favors, Xavier Henry, Lance, Kyrie, Josh Selby, CJ Leslie, AD, Austin Rivers, MKG, Shabazz Muhammad, Nerlens, Isaiah Austin, Steven Adams, Anthony Bennett, Rodney Purvis, Wiggins, Randle, Jabari, Aaron Gordon, Harrison twins, Noah Vonleh, Embiid, Mudiay, Okafor, KAT, Stanley Johnson, Myles Turner, Oubre, Looney, Simmons, Labissiere , Ingram, Brown, Diamond Stone, Malik Newman, Lonzo, Giles, Josh Jackson, Fultz, Fox, DSJ, Adebayo, Maker(obviously), Jarrett Allen, Bagley, MPJ, Bamba, Ayton,  Sexton,  Mitchell Robinson, Troy Brown, Lonnie Walker, Billy Preston, Barrett, Reddish, Nas Little, Bol Bol, Anfernee Simmons(obviously).  That’s a conservative list of guys I feel like definitely go. There’s be 2-3 more times this number in reality. Hard to guess the fringe guys however. "
A good idea for the Pelicans is to have Solomon Hill start over Etwaun Moore. Kevin Durant has a major height advantage over him.
Kevin Durant is the best player in the NBA.

"Hope you do, too! And hope you enjoy your constant and unrelenting thoughts about Kevin Durant!"
"Here's a breakdown of his argument:      * **Kevin Durant:** Is, and has been, the greatest scorer of our generation if not of all time. And he left to join the 73-9 Warriors. His game didn't even improve by that much, really. I'm not gonna shit on KD or say he coasted to the finals (he put in his fair share of hard work), but no shit his stats would improve.      * **James Harden:** *He was traded SIX years ago!* You really can't sit here and say ""2018 Westbrook is bad because James Harden was *traded away* 6 years ago."" Note, Harden didn't want out from OKC, he just didn't accept the 4 yr/42 mil deal OKC gave him.      * **Victor Oladipo:** This one can definitely be put on Westbrook, but remember that he himself said that he trained with Westbrook over the season and off season, and modeled his game after him. Oladipo has benefited from working alongside Westbrook, and I'm glad he's doing well.      * **Reggie Jackson:** First off, how well is Jackson playing now compared to the year he was traded away from OKC? Second, how the fuck are you gonna call Westbrook a bad teammate when *Reggie literally sabotaged OKC's team chemistry because he wasn't starting?* We all knew he would be a good PG, but he obviously wasn't gonna start over Westbrook.      * **Dion Waiters:** Dion got a 52 million dollar deal while he was in OKC. Stop pretending like it's somehow Westbrook's fault that Dion got his payday. And he got his payday because he balled out in OKC during the playoffs. Why are people forgetting that? If anything, Dion should be an example of how Westbrook elevated his career and got him to a 52 million dollar deal.      * **Serge Ibaka:** Had his prime in Oklahoma City and is another outstanding example of Westbrook elevating his teammates. Anyone who knew basketball knew that the WB+KD+Ibaka combo worked very well and had strong chemistry. *Not once* did Serge show any discontent with how Westbrook treated him. And again, it was because of how well he played in OKC that he got that deal with the Raps.      * **Enes Kanter:** How could you ever argue that Katner was hindered in OKC's system? His rebounding went up because he went from playing with the strong postman Steven Adams to the more mobile and versatile KAT. Nobody should be shocked that he's balling out in NYC. Also, note that him and Westbrook are still very good friends and he's never spoken ill of Westbrook.      * **Domantas Sabonis:** Was a very young and underdeveloped player in our roster, sort of like how Jerami Grant was to us last year. He was showing the same signs of strong play back then as he is now, and we fully expected him to continue his upwards trajectory.       At the end of the day, Tom Haberstroh (aka a reporter who wished he was on the level of Stein, Wojnarowski, and Broussard) is showing his severe lack of NBA knowledge here. He's taking players who'll all naturally grow and become better players as time goes on, and is using that to shit on Westbrook. He conveniently does this as the WB hate train is out in its fullest force, instead of saying this stuff back over the regular season. He's literally just riding the wave of hate and joining the circle jerk.      To prove this, let's say Jerami Grant walks this offseason because OKC cannot afford him (we're in deep luxury tax). Now assume he balls out and has 'his career season', in Haberstroh's words. In all reality, he's just progressing his career path and growing as a player, but idiots like this dude will find a way to shit on Westbrook for it. Because this is a very likely scenario that may just happen. We all know Grant is a baller and will be a really good player in the NBA one day.     So stop taking shit out of context and using it to kick OKC and Westbrook while we're down. It's cowardly and isn't really doing any good. Maybe, and just maybe, all these examples are a testament to OKC's suburb eye for talent and the ability to grow players into NBA stars. At the end of the day, we had to draft/trade for these players when nobody else would expect them to be big time, and OKC has been able to flip them for some great trades. Some of them are still around to prove that this isn't exactly a Westbrook problem either (ex: Adams, Grant, Abrines, Husties)"

We're all Kevin Durant alts on this blessed day. 
"What? There is no guarantees-a-win superteam with Golden State as they currently are. Our only hope for a semi interesting finals next year is if Lebron goes to a contender.   Let’s scream it from the rooftops again, because you knuckleheads are somehow underrating Golden State. Golden State had arguably the best team of all time. They won 73 games, they had the unanimous MVP, we debated whether they were better than the ‘96 Bulls (up until Lebron’s upset). **And then after that** they added Kevin Durant. This was a contender for best team of all time *before* Durant.  There is no team Lebron could join this offseason that is *in the same universe* as the one Durant chose. The best case scenario for us, as fans, is that Lebron goes somewhere that allows Golden State to somehow, possibly be beat in the playoffs. And even if Lebron goes to Philly those odds are still relatively slim. "
"Daily reminder that no matter what r/NBA thinks of him, Kevin Durant is winning at life. "
"""Russell Westbrook finally has backup and he's coming for Kevin Durant."" - this sub a week ago. "
Does that mean Kevin O'Connor is Kevin Durant?
"&gt; When Westbrook did the same thing, he changed his game up and broke one of the most ""unbreakable"" records in NBA history the next season.  What a tick.  What area of the weak spots of his game did he work on?  He went from being an elite rebounder for a PG to... even more elite, but with a ton of uncontested boards.  Efficiency, defense, ball-hogging (42% USG last year) and off-ball activity have always been Westbrook's weaknesses.  They might actually be WORSE now than ever before.  There is nothing Westbrook is doing better this season that he did after his first couple of years in the league.  He's the exact same fucking player -- teams know this and he struggles in the playoffs because they gameplan for it accordingly.  &gt;I'd argue that both of these rest with the coaching staff as much, if not moreso, than with Russ.  &gt;What can Russ do with this team realistically? Nobody on this team can shoot besides PG, and Adams is solid but not exactly an offensive monster.  Ah, the blame game.  Too predictable.  Nothing in the history of the Thunder has EVER been Westbrook's fault.  You know, despite him being the reigning MVP and leader of the franchise.  When WB pulls up with 18 seconds left on the shot clock and chucks a 3 when his team only needs a 2, that's ALL THE COACH'S FAULT.  THEY PHYSICALLY FORCED HIM TO SHOOT A 40 IQ POINT SHOT.  &gt;There's nobody reliable to give the ball to. Adams is only effective in the paint, so they basically have to hand you those points.  FFS.  Steph Curry would take those guys and have them playing dominant offensive basketball.  How many players need to leave OKC and then flourish before you understand that the talent is there, but Westbrook has such a tight leash on the offense no one can do anything?  By the way, I agree with you on George.  He's been great.  If only Westbrook would stop shooting more than a guy who's doubling his efficiency #s, maybe OKC would have a chance of getting out of the first round.  Westbrook routinely took more shots than Kevin Fucking Durant.  That tells you all you need to know about his mindset.  There's a really clear fucking reason why Steph and KD are laughing at him while he tries to get a triple double on the sidelines.  KD knows how fucking possessed with his own numbers Russ is.  &gt;Sure, we used to have other players like Oladipo and Harden etc. at different points, and we did utilize those players. Harden basically had to go, since he was ready for a starting job we didn't have room (or money) for.  And Oladipo just sat around on offense because he'd only get the ball with 4 seconds on the shot clock, and then suddenly be expected to take over the offense without establishing any rhythm or flow within the offense.  &gt;But with this team he has to be.   Yep.  Because it's always his teammate's fault.  Never the leader's.  Never the MVP's.  Nevermind the fact that the Thunder had 5-6 players at one point shooting over 50% in Game 4.  Westbrook's next ~30% shot is definitely better.  Because at the end of the day the narrative that his style of play is long-term destructive to a team will never, ever sink in with you.  No matter how many playoffs he loses.  No matter how many guys go to another team and suddenly look like all-stars.  Nope.  You're so far into the realm of denial that Westbrook could take 80 shots a game and you'd say, ""Well he's selfish but he's the best player so he should get to do whatever the fuck he wants to on a basketball court.""  Meanwhile, all the younger players on OKC never have a chance in hell to develop, then you blame them for playing sub-par basketball.  &gt;The supporting cast is weak as hell since Melo was such a bust. Losing Roberson was also a big blow to their defense.  Yeah, you're right, that refrain last year was the same.  That Oladipo guy fucking sucks.  I bet he'll never be a starter in the league."

Ray Allen old man...Kevin Durant reigning MVP at the time who blew a 3-1 lead to the team he joined.   It's a bad look stop warriors shitposting. 
"I saw Kevin Durant at a grocery store in Los Angeles a couple of months back. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
r/NBA is Kevin Durant alts
Kevin “Al Iaquinta” Durant
"&gt;Yeah but for all the shit Russ gets he really isn't the problem. The whole system there is the problem.   I was hearing this with Scott Brooks and Kevin Durant. Both of them are gone, now coach, new players, same old Russ, same problems.  The constant there is Westbrook, not the system."
"&gt;It's not as close as you think. Mitchell has a chance to be as good as year 7 Hayward when he's in year 3  LOL. Okay, I'm beginning to see what's going on here.  &gt;Hayward got to the line over 2x more than Mitchell, shot 33% better on threes (I don't mean his % was 33 percentage points higher), and did better in pretty much every statistical category when looking at per 36 or per 100.  Oh, so now stats are important? Interesting. You turned around fast on that position.  &gt;He also has the advantage of playing with a MUCH better PG; George Hill is washed, and Rubio has been excellent.  Oh my god this is hilarious.   So, look, here's the situation. You don't know what you're talking about. You signed Hayward, and got yourselves all hyperbolic about his greatness. Now you're looking for ways to diminish what Mitchell is doing because you don't like anybody saying Mitchell is just as good.  George Hill was good last year. He didn't play washed up, he made great contributions to our team.  Ricky Rubio is also playing great for us. Ricky Rubio being good for us now doesn't mean that George Hill played last year like he was washed up; he didn't. That is simply untrue. Something you conjured up from your imagination.  We are a better team this year than we were last year. We finished the last 35 games of the season at an 84% win percentage, (a 68 game win-pace). In 7 years with Hayward, we never had a stretch of games that approached anything like that. Mitchell is helping us accomplish this in a variety of ways. He's a better leader than Hayward was. He's a better scorer than Hayward was; he's more clutch. He takes over in the fourth quarter. He compels us to wins single-handedly at times doing things Hayward simply can't do. Those are a few examples of things stats can't tell you. You almost certainly wouldn't know these things unless you were a Jazz fan, but all of these things are true.  Now, as a rookie, Mitchell is having a bigger impact on games than Hayward did, breaking records, and doing things that a rookie hasn't done since *Michael Jordan*.  He's in a series right now against Russell Westbrook and Paul George, and he's clearly the best player on the court.  That is not ""maybe he'll be as good as Hayward in year 3"" good.  It is starting to become laughable that other people think they know more about Gordon Hayward's game, and better understand the impact he has on the court, than Jazz fans do. When did everybody start to think that Gordon Hayward was flawless and that it was crazy to think other players were at his level? Gordon Hayward is a great player. Arguably a top 5 SF in the league. And we loved having him. And you're going to love having him. We were devastated to see him go.  He's not Kevin Durant. He's not Lebron James. And by this time next season it will be clear to everyone: he's not Donovan Mitchell.  "

"who wouldn't wanna coach ballhogs like westbrook or melo?!  durant the ""snake"" left without appreciating westbrook. Enjoy ""sharing"" the ball in golden state Kevin. I personally guarantee he'll never win a championship."
"Plus, who wouldn't want to own a house that belonged to Kevin Durant?  You'd just have to clean out the snakes when he leaves"
"They had Martin for one year and it went great. They were outstanding...until they lost Westbrook to injury.  Also Martin was 29. That's the right side of age for a team that was in win-now mentality like they were.   They also got to keep Ibaka who was a good PF that offered their best option to compete against bigs in the West.     Which brings up another point: the Thunder didn't win a title, but bad luck also had a lot to do with it. Even if they kept Harden there is no guarantee the results are that much better. Westbrook missed a good chunk of 2013 with injury before tearing his meniscus in playoffs. It's doubtful they win title that year with Harden and Durant. Ibaka hurt in 2014. Durant missed playoffs 2014. Then in 2015 they nearly made the NBA finals.   Essentially the trade was Harden, Daequan Cook, and Lazar Hayward for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, Steven Adams, Alex Abrines, and Mitch McGary. For a cap-strapped team like the Thunder, having lots of young assets was a way to resign other key players and stay competitive for years to come, which they did.   I think the prevailing narrative on Presti and the Harden trade is rightly critical, but far too critical and makes it seems like he was clearly stupid for the decision. I don't think that's the case. "
"Maybe Jayson Tatum is the next Kevin Durant, but KD wasn’t leading his team to the conference finals his rookie year. I love Al Horford, but he should be the third best player on a championship contender, not the best. Who is the man who coaches these guys up, literally draws up perfect plays after timeouts? Brad"
Tom Marvolo Riddle is an anagram for Kevin Durant.
I don’t think the Bulls had Kevin Durant...  Also the Warriors were extremely lucky that the Cavs did not have two of their top 3 players in 2015 Finals. Lebron still won 2 games with Dellavedova as his main guy in that series. 
&gt; What if Portland drafted Kevin Durant instead of oden  What if Portland drafted MJ?
Kevin durant to the bucks confirmed then?

"The comparison I was making was how much of a team balance change it would take to equal Kevin Durant leaving the team with zero return. It is really messy, but what I meant to show was this was about the top 10% of a roster with guaranteed HoF talent leaving with zero return.  Didn't really come off as well as I hoped, but no big deal. What I meant was that you wouldn't see this reaction towards an MLB player because of the way the game is played. No player in the history of baseball could have as much impact on their team as any top-5 superstar in the NBA does."
"Who seriously expects any team to beat the 73 win team that added Kevin Durant? Give me a break. Nobody thought Cavs had a chance last year, just like we don't this year. Doesn't fucking matter. He gave us what he promised"

"What if Portland drafted Kevin Durant instead of oden  What if the okc owners would have paid the luxury tax to keep harden   What if Tim Duncan actually signed with the Magic   What if Portland wins the 2000 WCF, would the lakers have broken up ?  What if Nick Anderson doesn’t miss those free throws in the finals   "

"Sorry guys, I did not get a paywall and I do not subscribe:  ""One of the many peculiar things about being a professional athlete is that your colleagues know exactly how much money you make.   In the 10 years that he’s been an NBA role player, Houston Rockets forward Luc Mbah a Moute has never been paid as much as his peers. He’s earned less in his entire career than James Harden earned this year alone. As a free agent last summer, he was on the open market longer than most players before he finally signed a one-year deal for the veteran’s minimum salary, the least that any NBA team could offer. “Everybody could’ve gotten him,” Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni said, “and we did.”   He’s been so useful that it has since become clear Mbah a Moute was deeply misvalued by the league. To put it very simply, when he’s on the court, his team is better. And yet D’Antoni can’t fault other teams if they couldn’t understand why. “To be honest with you,” he said, “I didn’t know it, either.”   And what exactly was it that he didn’t know about Mbah a Moute?  “That he’s one of the best players in the league,” D’Antoni said.   Which sounds like an odd thing to say about someone who averages 7.5 points per game coming off the bench. Except he’s precisely the sort of player the Rockets knew they would need against the team they knew they would need to beat.   The Rockets and Golden State Warriors have circled each other like sumo wrestlers all season long, and now they’re colliding in the Western Conference Finals, a series between dominant, intelligent, carefully built teams responsible for many of the stylistic innovations that have defined the modern NBA. The Warriors are the reigning champions eyeing a third title in four years. You may have heard something about them. But the Rockets were constructed specifically to beat the Warriors, and they established themselves as the biggest threat to their budding dynasty by winning the most games in the NBA this season. They became good enough that Golden State losing is at least theoretically possible now.  This is a matchup with valuable players, most valuable players like James Harden, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, and one player who is crucially valuable in his own quiet way: Luc Mbah a Moute.  Every decision in basketball is a reflection of what NBA teams value and why. Because they’re constrained by a salary cap from spending indiscriminately—this is not baseball—they have no choice but to find value in unexpected places. And they win championships by doing more with the same amount of money. The embarrassment of riches otherwise known as the Warriors, for example, only exist because Curry was on a bargain contract until this season, at which point Durant agreed to his own sweetheart discount.   But it has never been more imperative to chase value on the margins in this era of talent consolidation across the NBA. There is a premium on effective, affordable players, and stealing a niche player on a minimum deal can be as important as picking the right star player for a maximum salary.   There was a simple reason the Rockets targeted Mbah a Moute, a 6-foot-8 forward who could guard anyone, after they paired James Harden with Chris Paul last summer. It was almost entirely because they were obsessed with the Warriors. They didn’t need to crunch the numbers to know they would probably have to play Golden State on their way to an NBA title—this being the Rockets, they crunched the numbers anyway—and that meant it wasn’t enough for them to merely improve. They had to improve in a way that increased their chances against the Warriors.   They were convinced that Mbah a Moute could help. Golden State’s small lineups feast on mismatches, but there is no team capable of starving them like the Rockets. And that’s by design. Houston can surround Harden and Paul with the versatile, interchangeable players required to switch on defense and survive against the Warriors—players like Mbah a Moute. In two games against Golden State, Mbah a Moute was positional silly putty. He defended Klay Thompson on 33 possessions, Durant for 23 possessions and Curry for 13 possessions, according to NBA tracking data.   Mbah a Moute, a Cameroonian who went to UCLA and bounced around five teams in five years before this season, was secretly good at lots of little things for a long time until those very things made him valuable.   He moved the ball, spaced the floor and was perfectly happy to guard the other team’s leading scorer. But one reason he was overlooked is that he did not shoot. He was good at not shooting, but not shooting wasn’t an option in Houston, where he’s been encouraged to shoot more than ever. “People thought I wasn’t a good shooter,” said Mbah a Moute, who is shooting 36% on 3-pointers this year, “but it’s because I was never really in a position where I could shoot.”  Houston saw the potential in Mbah a Moute that other teams ignored. It was not an accident that he signed there when he could have signed anywhere. “No, no, no—that one we went after hard,” D’Antoni said.  Rockets executives were on the phone with Mbah a Moute and his agent every day until he agreed to a deal. As he called around the league, general manager Daryl Morey heard so much praise about Mbah a Moute from coaches, executives and former teammates like Paul that he actually got worried. “It was almost too much raving,” he said. “I was, like, it can’t all be this good. It’s been even better.”  Mbah a Moute felt the same way as the Rockets. He was a little baffled at how badly they wanted him, especially because they already had P.J. Tucker, another undervalued wing player they prioritized last off-season.   “You just signed P.J.,” he said, “and I think we do the same thing?”  But what Houston realized was that it couldn’t have enough players like Tucker and Mbah a Moute.   “That made sense to me,” Mbah a Moute said. “I felt I could be a complementary piece of the puzzle.”   He was a positionless player before position became a dirty word, and when the game evolved, he took advantage of the ideas that have reshaped the league. Mbah a Moute was suddenly a market inefficiency. What he did was in high demand, and yet he was still available for cheap. That was all the incentive the Rockets needed to pursue him.   It worked out spectacularly well.  The Rockets set a franchise record for wins in a season. Their offense was more explosive than last year’s, when it was one of the most explosive of all-time. Their defense went from mediocre to elite under the influence of Paul, Tucker and Mbah a Moute, whose defensive rating was the lowest on the team.  He now finds himself in line for a richer contract because it turned out that D’Antoni calling him one of the league’s best players was positively D’Antonian: It may have sounded wrong, maybe even ridiculous, until it was right.  In fact, of the hundreds of player combinations that logged more than 1,000 minutes together, the Rockets had the single most productive two-man lineup in the NBA, a duo with a better net rating than even Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.  This pair that annihilated other teams: the likely most valuable player James Harden and Luc Mbah a Moute."""
They're mad because 2015 was asterisk season because Kyrie and Kevin Love were out and because 2017 was asterisk season because Kevin Durant made the softest move in NBA history
Westbrook had Kevin Durant for 8 seasons (with Harden and Ibaka as well for multiple seasons) and couldn't win. Had Paul George this year and didn't make it to the second round. Who did Dirk have?  To say Westbrook will ever be anywhere near Dirk is laughable.
"Kevin Love went to UCLA and had the ties, and honestly if Cleveland didn't trade for him might have gone there. Same with Westbrook (K Love's college teammate) after Durant left.   Paul George grew up a Laker fan, idolized Kobe and lives/trains in LA in the off-season. That rumor has been around since long before last summer. "
"I mean why can Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant be successful then in selling their gear when they're around as good as Leonard and they were in freaking Oklahoma City? No, just being in those places isn't going to instantly make you a charismatic player whose gear they'll want to buy. With stuff like Internet and all of that the location matters less and less, and it's more about how personable/funny you can be in commercials/interviews and stuff to make your things fly off shelves. Look at how Kawhi was in that recent Jordan commercial. They'e not portraying him as quiet dude who does nothing. They play off that, in fact, to make the commerical. "
I don’t even buy they have that much young talent. I’ve never heard of a future 6 man so lauded. Lonzo proved no one wrong with a baby Rubio season. And Ingram still isn’t kevin Durant. They don’t have one prospect that I like as much as Mitchell or Tatum. I like brown and Simmons more as well. There are guys in this draft I like more as well (Ayton and Doncic easily. Say lakers package Ingram AND lonzo for kawhi and get PG- who else is on that team?
Basketball Reasons time: Save us Adam Silver.  Klay is forced to sign a max deal. Steph is forced to be injured the rest of his career. Draymond is forced to play for the Kings. Kevin Durant is forced to change his name into Kevan Durango.
"I don't think you understand the situation properly.  Klay can take the extra $50 million and stay in the same location on the same team with the same teammates.  The only difference is that it saves the owners money in luxury tax.  **EDIT- From below:**   The 18-19 salary cap is projected at $101M at this point in time, let's call the 19-20 cap $110M.  Let's also assume the Dubs are going to resign Durant and he's not going to take as much of paycut like he said (say roughly 30M)  19-20 Season currently on the books:    | Player             | 2019-20        | |--------------------|----------------| | Stephen   Curry    | $40,231,758    | | Kevin   Durant     | ***30,000,000*** | | Klay   Thompson    | ??????         | | Draymond   Green   | $18,539,130    | | Andre   Iguodala   | $17,185,185    | | Shaun   Livingston | $7,692,308     | | Damian Jones | $2,305,057   |  With or without Klay, they're already over the salary cap and only have 6 players on the payroll.  They can go over the cap as far as they want to re-sign Klay, so they have no reason to drop him.  Then they have to fill out the other spaces on the roster regardless."
Why exactly is Lue getting fired? Is it because he can't beat the Warriors with Kevin Durant?
"I really wanna see a usg% breakdown for each team next to these graphs. While i'm sure we can predict who has a high usage for Houston and Cleveland, there might be some surprises  edit: some quick numbers  Unsurprisingly, Lebron(35%), Durant(31%), and Harden(37%) all lead their teams. The highest usg on Boston is Tatum at 25%.  Cleveland's top 3 are Lebron, Kevin Love (23%) and Jordan Clarkson (20.6)  Houston: Harden, Paul (27%) , and Gordon (20.5%)  Warriors: Durant, Curry (29%), and Klay (24%)  Boston, is expectably goofy in comparison. Each of the other three semi-finalists have 3 players with over 20% usage. The Celtics practically have 6, with Horford coming in at 19.7%.  Their top 6 are Tatum, Morris(22.7%), Brown(22.6%), Smart(21%), Rozier(20.8%), and Horford (19.7%)"
Kevin durant
"Derrick Rose - Lebron had no help either when they faced off in 2010.  Paul George - 9th in MVP voting. Definitely top 10 player.  Jimmy Butler - He was 25 years old averaged 22ppg in the 2015 playoffs and guarded Lebron.  &gt;Kevin Garnett - old, not top 10 when they played  &gt;Paul Pierce - old, not top 10 when they played   Yes but Rondo was in his prime and he was a top 10 player. He was 8th in MVP voting. He averaged 20 and 11 against the Heat including a 44 point game.  Jason Kidd -  2006.  Vince Carter- Really showing your bandwagonness and newness to the NBA. Carter was one the best players in the league easily. Carter wasn't always a 40 year old man.  Amare Stoudemire - The man once averaged 37ppg against the Spurs in the West playoffs. Show some respect you bandwagon.  Dallas 2011 was crazy probably the best run ever, but don't act like that's the norm to face Kobe, Durant, and Lebron in one playoffs. "
"The article is behind a paywall so:  “Klay Thompson’s professed dedication to the Warriors and the Bay Area isn’t just words. He said he wants to stay and he’s already taking the steps to do so.  According to multiple sources, Thompson and the Warriors have already engaged in discussions regarding a contract extension. If the sides agree this offseason, Thompson would not hit the free-agent market for up to another five years.  Signing an extension would significantly decrease the maximum Thompson could make — and save the Warriors millions in luxury tax penalties.  The most he could get in the first year of an extension is a 120 percent raise. With the highest annual increases allowed, that would put Thompson’s extension at four years and just over $102 million. Add the $18.9 million he is due to make in 2018-19 and Thompson is looking at a maximum five-year salary of $121 million should he sign an extension.  If Thompson were to play out his contract and sign a new deal with the Warriors before the 2019-20 season, the maximum he would be eligible for — based on current salary-cap projections — is five years, $188 million.   However, Thompson probably understands that the maximum is not really on the table. The Warriors would almost be forced to let him walk if he demanded a new deal averaging $37.6 million per year since Stephen Curry and, presumably, Kevin Durant would be making the maximum. Three maximum salaries — for players in their 30s — and luxury-tax penalties figure to be too high even for the Warriors.  However, if Thompson became a free agent and went elsewhere, he could sign up to a four-year deal worth $139 million. Adding next year’s salary and that’s $158 million he could make over five years.  The NBA rumor mill has the Philadelphia 76ers interested in Thompson, who would seem to be the missing piece for the burgeoning franchise. The Los Angeles Lakers are an obvious match for the SoCal kid. Several teams could use Thompson, which is why there is little doubt he could get the four-year max if he hits the free agent market.  But Thompson wants to remain a Warrior. And he has proven that by engaging in discussions that could leave at least $30 million on the table (over five years) to remain in the Bay through his prime.  “It would be hard for me to envision going anywhere else,” Thompson said in a profile by Bleacher Report.  What’s more, two sources said talks have included Thompson taking an extension with an average of around $23 million a year — which would come out to about four years, $92 million, nearly $50 million less than he could get on the open market — and puts his five-year total at $111 million.  The final numbers won’t be, and can’t be known until July as Durant’s contract status will impact Thompson’s extension. Of course, there is no guarantee the sides reach an agreement this summer.  But if Thompson does sign an extension, it would be his second consecutive team-friendly contract. Thompson signed a four-year, $69 million extension in 2014. That figure was an expectation of what his maximum would be under the projected salary cap. So when the cap turned out higher, Thompson was locked in, missing out on the four years, $73 million extension he could have gotten.  Thompson has said he cares more about his happiness than the extra money, and he is happy here. While many expected Thompson to want out of the Warriors, where at best he is No. 3, he sees the franchise as a place to spend his entire career.  The choice between $150 million in a place he doesn’t know or $110 million in a place he knows he loves — it isn’t that hard for Thompson, those close to him say. In the end, he is still set for life financially. And he still has a lucrative deal with China-based shoe company Anta, and other endorsements such as Chocolate Milk and Body Armor, to supplement his NBA salary.  Why not just play it out as a free agent and re-sign with the Warriors for more money, even if it’s not the max? No doubt, Thompson and the Warriors could find a number that is greater than $102 million but still below the max.   But Thompson hasn’t had a track record of prioritizing squeezing every dollar he can. Plus, he doesn’t really want a prolonged or contentious negotiation, or the stress that comes with his wealth of options.  Thompson likes peace. He likes easy. He likes what he has. An extension would get all this done, help the team and keep this train rolling.”"
"There is definitely more than 6 players better than Russ when it comes to who is more equipped to win a championship as a first option.   Edit:  (this a projection to next year meaning this will take in natural progression of young players/decline/etc))  In no particular order:   Steph Curry  LeBron James  Kawhi Leonard  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Anthony Davis  Giannis Antentokoumpo   CP3   Embiid   Jimmy Butler   Kyrie Irving  Found 11 players.  Two-way stars, typical elite efficiency shot-creators, etc are more likely to win a championship as the best player than angry dude who takes a lot of shots and gets a lot of 10s on box-score stats.    There's probably more to be honest, but I don't want to get too hot-takey.    Pre-butting some stupid arguments:  ""CP3 is a choker"" -&gt; He's one of the only players in the league who performs better than he does in the regular season and Westbrook has not gotten out of the first round as a 1st option with or without help.  He has absolutely been a better player than Westbrook is and is underrated.  Switch CP3 and Westbrook on the Rockets with OKC and Thunder beat the Jazz in 5 and the Rockets in 6.    ""LOL Kyrie Irving"" -&gt; Yeah, he's a player who massively picks his game up in the post-season.  I have Boston as Championship contenders next year with Kyrie as their best player so I had to include him.  If you switch Kyrie and Westbrook no way do I think they are championship contenders or as good as championship contenders at the very least.    ""Any arguments about Embiid"" -&gt; Was technically only his second year.  He's had limited practice and training time in his stint in the league as well as experience.  He should grow heavily next-year.  And I like his combination of elite defensive impact (especially at the rim, but some versatility), floor-spacing ability, and post-scoring over Westbrook's skill-set for a championship contender.  Philly might only be adding one more third piece away from being a championship contender as well.    ""Any arguments about Jimmy Butler"" -&gt; This one was tough and close to me.  I like Jimmy Butler's two-way impact over Westbrook on a championship team though.  He's had an injuy in the post-season and hasn't exactly performed up to par (same for Westbrook as a 1st option though) although the organization he was a part of was completely dysfunctional.  Maybe Westbrook should be above him, but still a lot more than 6 are above him.  "

It's worse because you can normally keep up with them for maybe a quarter or two.  And then you come back from the bathroom and you're down by 19 with Kevin Durant just checking into the game.

Does yahoo saying Kevin Durant signed with the Celtics count
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/mychal-thompson-says-warriors-will-make-a-serious-run-at-kevin-durant/amp/  Lmao there’s plenty of articles from back then. Here’s one article for you where Klay’s dad said the Warriors were going after Durant. This was published in May of 2015 a month before we beat you guys. But yeah keep believing that bullshit about how we went after KD cause of Lebron hahaha whatever helps you sleep at night I guess. 
Y'all are wild.  All-stars deserve max salaries lol.  Otherwise you're saying only what...ten guys in the league deserve a max?  Teams can afford two max salaries and afford a competent roster without going into the luxury.  Luxury teams/contenders can get three and go into the tax.  Any given year would have 45-75 max salaries.  It's just unfathomable that a team wouldn't want Paul George even at a max if they're seriously trying to contend soon.  Like what are you holding out for?  Kawhi Leonard?  Kevin Durant?
The Celtics had the best odds at Tim Duncan and Kevin Durant in those drafts.
Kevin Durant? 
Kevin Durant signing with Golden State
PG: Kyrie Irving ($10)  SG: C.J. McCollum ($10)  SF: Kevin Durant ($45)  PF: Kristaps Porzinjis ($25)  C: Willie Cauley-Stein ($10)
Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar don't make your top five but Kobe Bryant and Kevin Durant do?  I can't even...
- Steve Kerr is an overrated coach - James Harden and Kevin Durant  have caught up and/or eclipsed kobe as a player  -wilt chamberlain bill Russell  and most players that played before the 80’s shouldn’t be considered greats because  of the lackluster competition  - Stephen Curry is the greatest point guard of all time not named magic Johnson  
1. Jordan is an incredibly important part of basketball history if not the most important and that will never change BUT he is not a top 5 player ever.         1) Lebron goat         2) Wilt look up stories and just the history of what this man was. He was like Shaq with a real jumpshot. He was smaller but played with that same dominance down low. THEY MADE A NO DUNK RULE BECAUSE OF HIM         3) Kobe Bryant Jordan with a better 3 pointer Won 5 instead of 6 but went to 7 and played 6 more seasons.         4) Tim Duncan. He was the best player on one of the best dynasties in sports history for 20 years          5) Kevin Durant is the greatest scorer ever hands down. Plus s much better defender.  No one will ever impact the game like Jordan but that doesn’t automatically make him the goat.  2. James harden may ruin basketball if he wins a title. Everyone will start copying his idea of drawing fouls instead of making good shots.  I only read about half the posts so tag me if there’s someone who already said these things
"Yes a 34 year old Dennis Rodman who had gone batshit crazy after the year in San Antonio makes a team that much different and super than a Prime Kevin Durant or 25 year old Lebron, yeah ok you right."
Any shot is a good shot when you make it.  I think having Steph Curry around the 3pt line and one Kevin Durant anywhere else on your side of the court is better than crazy pullup threes. 
"I mean in terms of Kevin Durant going to the team that beat him in the playoffs. Of course you’re allowed to have your opinion on a free agency signing, I wasn’t saying you shouldn’t, just that I don’t you should be extra salty that he went to the team who beat him unless your an OKC fan"
"He might've had a better percentage year but he hasn't been pulling up from the logo draining shots like that. Rightfully so though because that's a dumb shot, even for Curry, when you got a Kevin Durant. "
KEVIN THE MINION DURANT
"LeBron isn’t viewed as great in hindsight unless he goes to Miami. Even if he did eventually win a championship in Cleveland without a “Decision”, he just would never surpass the other players.  Now for the really unpopular part, Kevin Durant will be remembered as a top 10 player and it would not be possible if he stayed with the Thunder. Very similarly to LeBron. The Warriors will keep KD and they’ll continue him and Steph rattling off chips or he’ll leave the team and do it for a different franchise. (Not necessarily the Thunder like LBJ though)"
Isaiah Thomas  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Kevin Durant  Rudy Gobert  Chosen strictly because of physical characteristics that might be fun for cartoon characters.  
"How am I deflecting? I have addressed everything you’ve said with examples and facts. I said you were right that they beat him the first time but I also provided the context of that defeat because context does matter. My point was without Kevin Durant the Cavs would have most likely been favored as the defending champs. I mean even Draymond Green said after the finals that the Cavs where a better team before they added KD. I brought up the warriors and how much firepower it took them to beat a full power LeBron James squad as an example of why I will never bet against lebron in the east until someone dethrones him because I’ve seen this same scenario play out year after year for almost a decade. Also I don’t really see this as an argument, more so a discussion. But we can just agree to disagree friend."
"One future HOF, and Kevin Durant"
Harrison Barnes is the same player as kevin  Durant 
"Kevin Durant going to Oakland was the best decision he's ever made in regards to his basketball career, see the double standard?"
I'm not a Warriors fan...  But I love Kevin Durant
"If we’re limited to these positions: Erik Spoelstra, Russell Westbrook, Klay Thompson, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Rudy Gobert.  If we can rearrange some things: Erik Spoelstra, LeBron James, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic."
Kevin Durant or Dwyane Wade.   You could also make an argument that Kobe (or Duncan) was never the best in the league.
You slow or something? The Heat wasn’t a proven commodity at that point genius. They struggled like hell the first year together and only started to really gel Year 2 and onwards. How is that anyway similar to Kevin Durant joining what was established to be the Best team in the NBA? They had already won a championship and were 2 mins of basketball away from another one. It’s no where near the fucking same. The Heat didn’t even make the playoffs the year before LEBron and CB joined.
"Kyrie's shown this year he can play in a system. Also, even in a team\-based system, having a player who can create in isolation is still very valuable. See: Kevin Durant on the Warriors"
"Except Draymond isn't suspended, Steph is healthier, and they got this new player named ""Kevin Durant"". "
"you should google ""Kevin Durant"""
"&gt; That’s arrogance to you?  Never said it was.  But its definitely multiple ""clap backs"" and pot-stirring.  &gt; I’m sure you’ll be the first to recognize that Simmons saying that MO other rookie caught his eye was more disrespectful, right?  Not at all.  He said no rookie caught his eye because he focuses on watching Top 5 players and not his peers.  The quote:  &gt; ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  Mitchell standing up for Ben is cool tho and indicates there's no actual beef."
"Let's be honest Kerr didn't know how to best adjust against Lebron. They beat him in 2015 when it was him vs the warriors and it went to 6, I would argue they lose in 2015 with Love and Kyrie healthy if you're going to 6 against Lebron and Delly. lost in 2016 after being up 3-1 then picked up KD and beat him in 2017.      Kerr is a great coach but he has the two time MVP, the greatest pure scorer/MVP, a DPOY, and the best 3 and D player in the league. It wasn't a matter of outcoaching Lebron, it was a loaded team.      Lebron is basically racing Kerr in a Honda vs a Ferrari. The one time their teams were equally matched they crashed and burned like no one ever has in a NBA finals, and then they loaded up with Kevin Durant."
"So the warrior, arguably the best team in the league.  Let me lay down some facts on you.  There are two rounds of 30 picks in the NBA Draft. 60 total picks.  The undrafted players count as being picked +60  Quinn Cook / 2015 Draft / undrafted Chris Boucher / 2017 Draft / undrafted JaVale McGee / 2008 Draft / 18th overall David West / 2003 Draft / 18th overall Zaza Pachulia / 2003 Draft / 42nd overall Nick Young / 2007 Draft / 16th overall Shaun Livingston / 2004 / 4th overall Andre Iguodala / 2004 / 9th overall Kevin Durant / 2007 / 2nd overall Jordan Bell / 2017 / 38th overall Draymond Green / 2012 / 35th overall Kevon Looney / 2015 / 30th overall Klay Thompson / 2011 / 11th overall Stephen Curry / 2009 / 7th overall  If you were to take the average picks of the 16 players on the warriors lineup you end up with 26.125.  The average pick on their roster is 26th in the Draft, solidly debunking your “have to have the best draft picks to make a solid team theory.”  If the warriors have proven anything at all it’s that you don’t need the best picks to be the best. You just need a group of guys to buy into the mentality of the organization. To believe in one another as well as having confidence in their own games. Look to pass first score second, which at times even backfires on the warriors because they make one too many passes in my mind. Instead of a strong finish at the rim to draw a foul.  There are a ton of solid players out there that are rookies from last year that are better than fultz and lonzo yet they were picked 1 and 2.  It’s not about media hype, or quality of draft picks. It’s about acquiring players that work well together. "
"Also context: The Mavs had just shut down the Kobe Bryant, who had won the last two titles, as well as Kevin Durant, who is possibly the most similar player in the league to Lebron James. Was it an upset? Absolutely. But I pulled up 15 other chokes that were bigger. Which brings me to my point: ""One of the worst"" is vague enough that it could still qualify."
"In no particular order:  1. Miracle on ice (led by some of the best hockey players in the world)  2. 2016 Warriors choking a 3-1 lead (Steph Curry, Draymond Green)  4. Chaminade &gt; Virginia (three-time national player of the year Ralph Sampson)  5. App State &gt; Michigan (Chad Henne and Jake Long)  6. Falcons choking a 28-3 lead (MVP Matt Ryan)  7. Buster Douglas over Mike Tyson (Tyson)  8. Rulon Gardner over Alexander Karelin (Karelin had an 887-2 record at the end of his career and won 3 straight gold medals, Karelin had not conceded a single point in the last 6 years)  9. NC State &gt; Houston, 1983 (Hakeem, Drexler)  10. Del Porto &gt; Federer, 2009  11. Giants &gt; Patriots, 2007 (Brady, Moss)  12. PSG blows a 6-1 lead to Barca (Cavani, Silva)  13. Brazil loses to Germany 7-1 at home   14. USA 1 - 0 England (1950 WC) (Stanley Matthews)  15. India &gt; West Indies, 1983 Cricket (Viv Richards)  All of those are bigger choke jobs than losing to a Mavs team that had just swept the two time defending champs, shut down Kobe Bryant AND Kevin Durant, and had two of the best defensive players in the league to go with a top 15 player of all time."
Exactly. Look at Kevin Durant this year or Lebron after Miami
Jayson Tatum is Kevin Durant.  Jaylen Brown is Andre Iguodala.  Ben Simmons is tall Rondo.  Joel Embiid is Yao.
end of an era.  I believe this leaves Kevin Durant and Jeff Green as the only remaining NBA players to have worn a Sonics jersey?
Jayson Tatum: Loyal Kevin Durant  Jaylen Brown: Michael Jordan  Ben Simmons: LeBron James  Joel Embiid: Aron Baynes

You play how the Cavs beat them in 16 inside out.  Capela is going to have to earn that paycheck vs Draymond.  Let Kevin Durant get his and try to limit Steph and Klay. And not hope the role players don't let the lights get too bright and knock down shots. 
"I'm pretty aggressive about this shit. There's not much I'd hold back if I could get Kawhi Leonard.  But we've arrived. We're here. It's too late now to talk about trading Tatum.   **Jayson Tatum is untouchable. He's the next Kevin Durant.** I think everyone knows it, too."
"Kevin Durant really deserves a lot more hate than he is currently getting for going to the Warriors. The fact that no players called him out publicly kind of irks me too but I understand why they wouldn't. The league is at a point now that i'd rather just give the Warriors the championship and either watch a Cavs-Rockets Best of 7 Series or just skip to the offseason so we can have Free Agency and Draft Blockbusters. I know parity in the NBA was never really prevalent but atleast in like 2012 when Lebron's Heat was the favorite everybody still knew the Tim Duncan Spurs, Big 3 Celtics and Young Thunder had a realistic chance of upsetting them  Maybe it's just my team being stuck in purgatory that's making me feel like this but i've never been so disinterested in the NBA in my life"
"Kevin Durant or James Harden just don't have that Aura of greatness that Lebron, Kobe and MJ had. "
"Rather than speaking strictly points (which isn't really that revealing of Jrue's individual defense because the Warriors can run a screen heavy offense to switch KD onto a mismatch and allow him to score), we can take a look at their respective defensive ratings for the 2017-2018 playoffs.   According to NBA.com/Stats   [Jrue Holiday Defense Rating](https://stats.nba.com/player/201950/)  DEF RATING = 104.51   [Kevin Durant Defense Rating](https://stats.nba.com/player/201142/)  DEF RATING = 99.7"
"The Cavs offense runs through LeBron. Every play is either for him to make an assist, score off a cut, screen, or use his gravity to set up a play either via cross court bullet or a hockey assist. Whatever it is LeBron has a part to play in it. Things get very predictable soon but the it works a majority of the time because he's LeBron.   However, vs the Raps the rest of his team showed up to play with a never-before-seen consistency, couple that with the incompetence of Casey to adjust on the fly and the result is a sweep. It's obvious that the Raptors gameplanned for Round 1 Cavs, but they played the Round 4 Cavs. I expect that the Celtics will expose a little bit of that over-reliance on LeBron, but winning the series requires you to match his production a la Kevin Durant style since there's no chance he's gonna get shut down."
"Kevin Durant wanted rings, but not have to be the main guy, or build anything, or deal with the media when he loses. So instead of losing he joined a 73 win team.   The rest of the warriors just wanted easy wins over lebron, and not have to grind out a 7 game series and potentially lose.   They think what they are doing will honestly go down as the best team ever. In my opinion it has backfired though and all of their reputations (for real nba fans) will always carry a (yea they won X amount of rings, but they needed to go sign a top 3 player to do it) A little similar to (yea hakeem won 2 rings, but jordan wasn’t in the league)   They will never be considered in the same sentence as mj’s bulls, or duncan’s spurs, or magic and larry’s lakers or celtics. "
I hope your formatting got fucked up and you don't actually think there's a debate between Tatum and a Kevin Durant 
"Warriors in 5, MVP kevin durant Cavs in 6, Mvp Lebron"
"Holy cow it was terrible when people were posting Kevin Durant quotes from the same Bill Simmons interview…not an interview with the author conducted for a written article, quotes from an actual podcast conversation, widely distributed and freely available..."
"That's an awful logic, you could literally use the exact same logic to argue Ricky Rubio vs Kevin Durant.  "
Kevin Durant going to the Warriors would have been just ridiculous... I mean could you imagine??
These have been observed to death:  Steven Adams and Jason Momoa Kyle Korver and Ashton Kutcher Tony Parker and Jesse Williams  But here are some more:  Jeff Teague and Stephen A. Smith Kevin Durant and Jamie Foxx
"If Kevin Durant slept with Ayesha Curry, what would the ramifications be?  I see this going one of two ways. Let's work through both scenarios.  First, Steph comes home from a long trip to the local Foot Locker. He's greeted to the sight of an elongated, legless, carnivorous reptile plowing his wife in the pastry maker. That's when he realizes, just as the prophecies foretold, Stephen Curry is a cuckold prince. He grabs his pacifier, curls up into a ball, and weeps. At that moment, Lebron James enters the Curry household, and then begins to spoon his son to sleep. The rest of the NBA is none the wiser.  In the second scenario, Stooph does not come home that night. When he next sees Ayesha, she tells him everything. Steph arrives at practice early the next day. When he enters the locker room, its just him and the servant.  ""You been suckin' them toes, boy?"" Stooph says.  The servant approaches. They kiss cheeks.  KD enters Bob Myers office.  He shouts, ""Myuhhh wife!"" while dressed as a crude recreation of Sacha Baron Cohen's character Borat, from the surprise 2006 blockbuster, Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.  Robert knows what he must do. He gets on the phone, and within moments, Otto Porter, Tomas Satoranksy, and a 2018 WAS 1st round pick are headed to the Bay. The return was less than satisfactory, for Kevin had announced (via his 7 Twitter accounts) that he was retiring at the end of the 2017-18 season, so that he could return to his roots, either on ground of some sort of forest or jungle, or inside of a glass box in a invariably edgy 14 year old boys room.  Ron Wallsley and Bradley Bealtrix Lestrange arrive at the airport to pick up their newest teammate/pet Kevin Durantbledore. They touch wands and restore peace within the fractured NBA.  Stooph and Ayesha stay together in this timeline.  (You have to read in Skips voice)"
"To beat LeBron in his new prime with better shooting and higher BBall IQ, you need a player who can guard him and force him to play defense the whole night, the only players in the entire league who can do that are: Kevin Durant &amp; Kawhi Leonard.  No one else is big enough and good enough."
"Kevin Durant is taller than 6'10"".  Delete this post."
"1) I didn't see anything about scoring ability you just said ""quite ahead"" in general.....yes as a scorer Booker is better right now. But even regarding that.....  2) I always am amused as to why people are SO confident if you ""put player X on a better team and his efficiency will skyrocket!"".....because history does not show it to be that easy. The volume stats often go down.....the efficiency though often doesn't just skyrocket like people assume  Paul George Kevin Love Chris Paul DeMarcus Cousins Eric Bledsoe Jimmy Butler Kevin Durant Carmelo Anthony are some ex in recent years of guys who all left to go to ""perceived better situations with better supporting casts"".....and yet only Bledsoes TS% went up in any kind of noticeable way after the trade. Several of these players actually saw a dip in TS. And the same type of trend is true if you look at guys like Andrew Wiggins who were supposed to get ""much better looks after the Butler trade""   It's really not as easy as just waving a magic wand and saying ""I will put player X on a better team and his efficiency will rise since I think he'll get easier looks"".   3) To go off this also people also probably don't realize Mitchell had a higher TS% in minutes last year without Gobert on the court or without Rudy AND Rubio......like I said just breaking down efficiency by how good your teammates are doesn't work   4) 3 of the best measure we have to evaluate shot creation are stats on drives ISOs and pick and roll ball handler plays. Mitchell is better in two of these 3 areas and also has a higher volume of plays on these play types   Look I get it we all love going ""but....muh eye test!!!"" And I'm not saying there's nothing to the idea that Booker does in fact look more polished.   But when you are using your eye test to say things there is a variety of data to suggest is overblown.....that can't be ignored. Eye tests are no different than data in that they have clear flaws. And ifs even harder to base arguments off ideas like ""I assure you Bookers efficiency would skyrocket on a better team"" when history shows its not nearly that simple"
When I first got into basketball which was around 05-06. My cousin had NBA live and 2k games. And he went with kobe and for some reason Carmelo Antony's hair seemed cool as fuck to me. I've never seen any type of hair like that where I was original from. So I was like okay cool this guy is for me. For about 4 years I was a big fan of melo. Then I stopped watching nba for a bit. I picked up NBA 2k12/13 and saw Kevin Durant. And just looked him up on YouTube and saw how his game was just a pleasure to watch. 
&gt; Reigning Finals MVP Khris Middleton   &gt; NBA journeyman Kevin Durant   &gt; Guard Lebron James Jr.  &gt; former NBA great Thon Maker  A++ for effort
"2027: Milwaukee Bucks general manager Jon Horst proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Giannis Antetokounmpo and the players on his new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Reigning Finals MVP Khris Middleton yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” NBA journeyman Kevin Durant gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Lebron James Jr. yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Antetokounmpo hit the locker room door, former NBA great Thon Maker was wheelchaired out from his retirement home shuttle and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"It's actually very competitive, if you take the long view. Previous tanking is the reason why Philadelphia got a win in the conference semifinals and Toronto didn't. There's nothing more competitive than setting yourself up to win by any means necessary.   When James Harden hooks a defender, or Pop makes everyone foul Shaq 5 times, or Kevin Durant goes to the 73 win team, we don't get to call their pushing the limits of the game ""uncompetitive"" just because we don't like them. There's nothing more competitive than a win-at-all-costs mentality that pushes you to do something unsavory like tanking. "
"His name was Kevin Durant. Now, it's Kevin ""The Snek"" Durant."
"*Specific categories do not necessarily mean the best at that aspect of the game (i.e., best rebounding lineup isn’t necessarily a group of the greatest rebounders ever, but rather the best overall lineup you can assemble with a focus on rebounding; the priority is who the best overall players are).

"Different folks use the term differently.  If you're just talking about a team being good, I don't think it is derogatory.  It became derogatory when Lebron, DWade, and Bosh all signed with the Heat, because all three were superstar players who were already leading their respective teams to playoff berths.  In order to compose such a team, the players have to take pay-cuts which some view as scamming the purpose of the salary cap system.  Similarly, the 2015-2016 GSW weren't considered a 'superteam' in a derogatory way, but the 2016-2017 GSW were, because they took what was already a championship team and added Kevin Durant (who was a recent league MVP and led his team to the WCF, and again had to take a paycut to make that transition work)."
"Waddell Stephen ‘Skyfucker’ Curry II  Klay Alexander ‘4/20 Chocolate Milk’ Thompson   Kevin Wayne ‘Slim Reaper’ Durant   Andre Tyler ‘Definition of BBIQ’ Iguodala  Draymond Jamal ‘Einstein’ Green Sr.    I could just choose the best players, but I’m thinking about how they would all work. Since this team plays so well together, it has earned them a nickname of ‘death lineup’. "
"Lmao dude, if you sag off Kevin Fucking Durant on the perimeter, Cavs will somehow lose that series in 3"
Kevin “The Snek” Durant
"The Kevin Durant interview with Bill Simmons was the worst this sub has ever been. This sub is so much better with this rule. I wouldn’t be mad if the mods made things even tougher tbh. I hate watching awesome plays get cut off ASAP for the karma race. I want a replay and alternate angle, I don’t need it .2 seconds after it happened "
Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard  -Kevin “hardest road” Durant
Kevin Durant. Durant. Durant. KD.
"I read your comment on mobile and replied when I got home, sorry that’s so difficult for you to process. Yes, I have been repeating myself. I’ve been telling you that your arguments are utter shit for over a day now, but at least you’re finally getting the picture.   We both know this is ending because you don’t have an argument for KD and you never did in the first place. That was clear as day when your LeBron narrative blew up in your face, but it’s real cute seeing you try to run away from it now. Come back when you have some actual facts about Kevin Durant being better than Larry Bird.   P.S. I spelled their names out for you so you wouldn’t get confused again and make some other player comparison instead. You’re welcome."
Even further - It's the Suns Gorilla doing all of this in a Kevin Durant suit
Kevin durant is clearly the free agent the Sixers are going after. Find a new slant
Kevin Durant would never do that
Also Kevin Durant is the greatest basketball player of all time and is an amazing person. 
"Injured guard Markelle Fultz yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Ben Simmons gave a look of pleasant surprise.

"2016, Kevin Durant. "
"Agreed. Kevin Durant is getting the hatred LeBron got in Miami and it's distracting people from his general magnificence. You can argue that he deserves it and he caused it but so many people tell LeBron haters to appreciate greatness yet they can't appreciate the greatness of Kevin Durant, one of the all-time great scorers and a Hall of Famer."
"The two things I listed above are exactly why he might not think Capela helps his title odds the way we or those on the outside might   Capelas exactly the type of guy prone to getting undervalued and people shouldn't just be assuming LeBron values players the way we and the media do at all just because he's a really smart player. Doesn't work like that.   Hell Kevin Durant a couple months ago said ""Capela shouldn't be talking all he does is just dunk off passes from other people his job is super easy"" completely devaluing him that's definitely not some opinion that he only holds either. And no despite his how he comes across on Twitter Kevin Durant is not stupid at all "
"I agree but LeBron has multiple all-defense 1st and 2nd teams awards under his belt. I'm just saying it's comparable.   When it's all said and done, I think everyone will remember LeBron coming back down 3-1 vs the 73 win Warriors and forcing them to add Kevin Durant just to stand a chance against him. That is like a movie script you call BS on."
Kevin Durant is the best scorer ever to grace the basketball field.    (I am not KD) 
"Kevin Durant IS Voldemort, don't you see?  1.	Voldemort speaks parseltongue. KD = snek. 2.	Voldemort has 7 horcruxes. KD has (at least) 7 burner accounts. 3.	Rearrange ""Tom Marvolo Riddle"" it spells ""I Am Lord Voldemort"". Rearrange ""Kevin Wayne Durant"" it spells ""Little bitch"".  I rest my case. The Slim Reaper = Voldemort. "
I'm Kevin Durant. And I'm the fastest man alive. 
"""how can you be this dumb?"" - Kevin Durant"
I agree with this. I however am not Kevin Durant. You can tell because I am seven feet tall and Kevin Durant is clearly only 6 foot 9
yeaaaah fuck Kevin Durant tho
I love basketball but I also love competition. I liked the warriors before KD. Fuck Kevin Durant 
"Kevin Durant is the greatest human being of all time. I know this because I am Kevin Durant, and I can personally attest that I am by far the best person to ever exist."
"He's a clown.....best will always be him ""Showing how Kevin Durant exposed Chris Paul's overrated defense in 2014?"". Oh really....you mean a 5'11 guy cant guard a 6'11 guy for more than a switch here and there lmao "
But Colangelo went and built this super young core of superstars in Philly with no help from anyone else.   He's grown with his franchise just like Kevin Durant grew with his home grown franchise in the Bay area. 
"Bryan ""Kevin Durant"" Colangelo"

Kevin Durant is the greatest scorer of our generation. Thanks for the table but you should look up how many scoring titles KD has. 
"Greg Oden, that dude was such an amazing prospect. He was the consensus first pick over Kevin fucking Durant, even after durant had one of the best freshman campaigns ever"

"Kevin Durant is a very close personal friend of mine. In fact we are in an alien soul bond as we speak. We have shared many sexual adventures on the coasts of Iberia.    But I have it on very good authority that Kevin Durant is a bitch. In fact he has told me on several occasions in the “anything goes” hot tub at the Four Seasons resort in Maui that he is a total pussy.    At night, he adopts needy children from run down orphanages and takes them to the Oakland zoo. He then breaks into the zoo, opens the anaconda pit, and throws these helpless children into the pits, laughing maniacally as they are devoured by the hungry anacondas.    Again Kevin Durant is a very close and intimate friend of mine, but again I have very reliable sources telling me he is feeding children to snakes. And that source was me, because I seen him do it."
"Steph's gravity, his ability to draw defenders and force them to cover so much space is unparalleled. Everything goes through him; he is the engine of the Warriors' offense. No knock on Kevin Durant. KD is the guy you can rely on when the game quagmires to get buckets in order to keep the team afloat and buy time for Steph and/or Klay to get hot. I love how they seem to complement each other in the Warriors' offensive ecosystem."
"- 8:42 Kevin Durant makes 25-foot three point jumper (Stephen Curry assists) 50 - 58  - 7:48 Nick Young makes 25-foot three point jumper (Kevin Durant assists) 53 - 58  - 5:54 Draymond Green makes layup (Stephen Curry assists) 55 - 59  - 5:21 Stephen Curry makes three point jumper (Jordan Bell assists) 58 - 61  - 4:29 Kevin Durant makes 25-foot three point jumper (Draymond Green assists) 61 - 61  I got this fiction from watching the game. KD finished the quarter with 10 pts, 4 less than Steph who was 3-10 in the first half with 8 points.   "
Fuck Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors.
Fuck Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors. 
"The only issue with pounding the offensive glass is the Warriors straight took TT out of the series last year by putting him in PNR's and getting him out of the paint. Once they did that, one of Cleveland's few advantages was gone. And it's gotta be Jeff Green on Durant, even if Kevin Love starts. Let TT come off the bench, he was completely ineffective as a starter last year against GS anyway."
"Good LORD this is a hot take.   Mike D’Antoni just coached a team up 3-2 against what is probably the greatest team of all time. Then his second best player got hurt and in both of the last two games, they went up big before their thin rotation (minus Paul) doomed them.   I personally thought there was absolutely no chance this series went beyond 5 games. After game 1, the Rockets were like 5:1 underdogs to win the series. The primary reason that the Rockets lost this series is because the other team had Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. The fact that D’Antoni took them to *a seven game series* with James Harden, Chris Paul, Clint Capela and Eric Gordon is absolutely bonkers.  If you’re judging by results, D’Antoni just coached one of the best series that I’ve ever seen. It is genuinely *shocking* that the Rockets were able to take this series to 7 games. No team has taken this Warriors team beyond 5. I very strongly doubt we’ll see the Warriors ever play another game 7. The Rockets might have even *won* if Paul didn’t go down. "
"Kevin Durant really fucked up our team lmao. Had KD not joined Golden State, I believe we would have won back to back, and Kyrie wouldn't have left. If we still had Kyrie, I would have some faith in this team. No one was complaining about help when we won in 2016 and steamrolled the East last year. "
Finally the cavs would have someone to clamp down on kevin durant and make plays when the elder lebron sits
Why? Second best player on either side is kevin love and kevin durant. This isn’t a contest
"I'm pretty sure Steve Kerr never said that. Here's why: Many articles printed that quote, which originally came from Marc Spears article in the Undefeated. However, when you go to the [original article by Spears in the Undefeated](https://theundefeated.com/features/golden-state-warriors-reigning-champs-are-headed-back-to-nba-finals/), that line has been changed to:  ""Apparently, Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni told Warriors All-Star forward Kevin Durant during Game 7 that his team would have won the series if Paul played. **But an argument can also be made that the Warriors could’ve won in five games if their veteran leader Andrew [sic] Iguodala was playing, as well**.""  Kerr's quote has disappeared from the original article, which leads me to believe that it was a false quote. Also, Kerr never calls Iguodala ""Iggy"" because Andre doesn't prefer that nickname.

Scott Foster is allowed to ref game 4 and Warriors presumably have full strength, within the first 30 seconds of the game both Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are ejected for arguing calls with Foster.

Kevin Love has his best game of the playoffs  Game 5: Back in Oakland, Warriors win a relatively competitive game 138\-94, LeBron has 30 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists but is no match for the Hampton 5  Game 6: Back in Cleveland and the NBA announces that Joey Crawford will come out of retirement to help Scott Foster ref game 6. Warriors start the game off with a big run and have an 18 point lead by halftime. Run continues in 3rd quarter and quickly grows to 28 point lead with 2 minutes left in the third. Just then, someone cuts the power to the TV studio and all of the cameras \- a full a TV blackout. Power resumes to start the 4th quarter and the game is tied and KD has been ejected, Curry &amp; Iguodala are both out with injuries. LeBron has 'historic' 4th quarter performance after Kevin Love leaves game in opening seconds of the 4th with his 12th concussion, Cavs win in a close one that ""everyone"" broadcasting the game agrees is one of the best games in NBA history.  Game 7: Back in Oakland Warriors are still without Curry &amp; Iguodala, but jump to an early 20 point lead. Cavs are without Kevin Love, LeBron plays every minute and despite a 40\+ point performance and a triple double, the shorthanded warriors have a 30 point lead going into the 4th quarter. Just then, the NBA officiating crew announces a glitch in the scoreboard and the scores are reversed, spotting the Cavs a 30\+ point lead with less than a quarter to play. Cavs win 128\-126, as Adam Silver hands the trophy to LeBron, he leans in and kisses LeBron on the lips for an uncomfortably long time. Camera cuts away to the NBA logo.  The End"
*G1 of the NBA Finals*  Kevin Durant &amp; Jeff Green tear off their jerseys to reveal 07-08 Sonics away jerseys. The format of the game changes from 5v5 to 4v4v2 (GSW vs CLE vs SEA) battle royale. Durant &amp; Jeff Green may shoot the basketball into either the Warriors or Cavaliers baskets and SEA will be awarded points. First team to 3 wins out of 7 games wins the series. GSW &amp; CLE will both relocate their franchises to Seattle should SEA win.
"&gt; And Trump isn't that interesting.  I don't know how you say that. He went from billionaire heir reality-TV star to president of the most powerful country in the world, with zero previous politicial experience. That alone makes him one of the most interesting political figures of all-time, American or otherwise. His tweets and antics are just icing on the cake at this point.  And how much Trump is hurting people is not the point I'm trying to argue, it's that being an interesting media-personality shouldn't necessarily translate to likeability, you know?  &gt; The NBA is one of my favorite sports because it's harder to hide all the emotions at play, which is GREAT since it plays into so many narratives... for practically every major guy that's come along in the NBA over the past 30 years, we have a good grasp of their personality on and off the court. It's an environment where expression is actually encouraged.  This definitely helped me understand your point better. And I for the most part actually really do agree with you. We watch sports purely for entertainment. And a big part of that is narrative. I'd much rather have players with any sort of personality traits (be it cockiness, insecurity, dorkiness, hustle, anger, etc...) than have them be a Joe Johnson. It adds a lot to the narrative. With that said, I really do like the idea of Kevin Durant's insecurity without necessarily liking Kevin Durant for being insecure, if that makes any sense."
"I really wanna get myself to hate every single Warrior player, but I respect Draymond's hustle and impact plays, and Klay and Steph just seem like such chill guys that it doesn't seem right for me to hate them. With that being said, fuck Kevin Durant."
"Aunt: I don't like Lebron, he reeks of desperation   Me: You must really hate Kevin Durant then  Aunt: Nah he doesn't really seem that desperate to me"
That sounds amazing. Kevin Durant will also return for his last few years left in the NBA. 
Why you responding to your own comment? Snek ass kevin durant 
“Kevin Durant is passing Lebron up as best player in the league”
Is this limited to Game 7?  I guess that's why I don't see Chris Paul elbowing Kevin Durant in the ass on your list.   Or the hundreds of fake fouls James Harden drew flopping over the course of the season.   
"It's just Kevin Durant, everyone else is coo"
"you think if you had to pick between klay, dray and kevin durant. Lacob would pick klay and dray? "
"Why are you and so many others trying to be a smart arse? We all know what he means and I agree with him. It's been a great season and post\-season and for it all to just end in what will most likely be either a sweep or a comfortable 4\-1 series, is sort of a anti\-climactic end to it all.  The second best player on 1 team is Kevin Durant, the second best player on the other team is either Korver or fucking Jeff Green. Lets give him a little bit of slack for saying he's struggling to get exited for the Finals."
"Looks like TheUndefeated edited their story without printing any kind of correction after every other outlet wrote up their own stories.

I don't get it man. There's people that think Bird is a better scorer and defender than Kevin Durant lmaoo
Apparently Tony Parker and Kevin Durant didn't get your memo.
"**Edit**: Nvm, looks like they must've swapped the article language, [because in this video from yesterday Spears is clearly reporting it was Kerr with the quote. No idea why they edited.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKUH4ex1USs&amp;ab_channel=ESPN) The whole thing is just bizarre. And Spears later tweeted D'Antoni claims he was telling KD to beat Cleveland. Marc might want to sit the next few plays out. (/end edit)  Before people go off criticizing Kerr, they should read the actual fucking article.   The quote is fake and Kerr would never call Andre ""Iggy.""  [Here is the actual paragraph in question:](https://theundefeated.com/features/golden-state-warriors-reigning-champs-are-headed-back-to-nba-finals/)  &gt;The Rockets were understandably emotional after losing just one game shy of the NBA Finals, with Trevor Ariza, Clint Capela and P.J. Tucker in tears. Apparently, Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni told Warriors All-Star forward Kevin Durant during Game 7 that his team would have won the series if Paul played. But an argument can also be made that the Warriors could’ve won in five games if their veteran leader Andrew Iguodala was playing, as well.  The Kerr part is completely made up, and even the D'Antoni quote has the word ""apparently"" and sounds like shit-talking during the game, not afterward. D'Antoni's been pretty gracious in his postgame interviews from what I've seen."
Kevin Durant is the best player to ever walk foot on an NBA floor 
"If you read the article you would know it was a direct response to the statement from D’Antoni. Stop being a willfully ignorant human, it's a bad look.   &gt; “Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni told Warriors All-Star forward Kevin Durant during Game 7 that his team would have won the series if Paul played. While unwinding long after the win with Morton’s The Steakhouse cuisine and a cold one, Kerr responded to those words by saying, “We would have won the series in five if Iggy played.”"
I want to see him win FMVP just so I can see how Kevin Durant handles it. 
https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/lookit/2017/9/18/16327672/kevin-durant-private-instagram-account-arguments-nba-warriors
"Well Kevin Durant is one of the greatest of all times.   He was BEFORE he went to Golden State.  If he continues to rack up rings and FMVPs, he’s absolutely going to be ATLEAST top 15."
"Kyrie and Kevin Love. Kyrie who lead the Celtics to a better record than LBJ lead the Cavs, and Kevin Love who averaged 25/13 before coming to Cleveland and sacrificing his game.   I know you want things to be easy on LBJ, but Durant made the correct decision. Westbrook does not play a style that is conducive with winning championships. "
"The year is 2021. Kevin Durant, his hands heavy with rings and coming off a fresh molt, decides to return to where he hatched. The new look Seattle Hornets hissss there way to a heroic five game first round loss! "
"Steph is the veteran most presence. He was a scoring guard along side another scoring guard, Monta Ellis. The Warriors still often played uptempo and acquired 3 point specialists but they lacked the all around talent to compete. This is when the team decided to ship Ellis to Milwaukee for Andrew Bogut, a promising young talent who IIRC was injured at the time, and rebuild through the draft by offloading some of their veteran assets.   Over the next few summers they drafted Klay, Draymond, and Harrison Barnes. As Steph and Klay began to solidify themselves core players the team went out and sought a veteran all star level talent, which they found in Andre Iguodala, who was signed as a free agent from Denver. Draymond was the unexpected star and late bloomer of the group that pushed them to another lever. His development into a player who can facilitate an offense and guard every position on defense meshed perfectly with their guards talents and Bogut’s skill set inside.   Iguodala was bought in as someone who could play small forward or power forward, facilitate an offense and guard every position on the floor. When Draymond developed it allowed Andre to focus more on what he truly excelled in and having Andre allowed Draymond focus on excelling at what he does now, being a PnR option and interior defender. This is when they win their first championship.   This combo, of Andre and Draymond, allowed the warriors to move on from Andrew Bogut, a cost cutting moves that, combined with a massive jump in cap space due to the TV deal signed a couple summers ago, resulted in the cap space clearance for a max level contract. With this space they bring in Kevin Durant, replacing Harrison Barnes who was not retained as a free agent.   E:  I’d also add that Klay, Steph and Dray all exceeded their draft position’s and most’s expectations."
"In 2013, Curry signed a contract that was regarded as risky at the time due his injury history. It was 4 years, $44 million. Turns out this was one of the luckiest contracts ever, as not only did they get a two-time MVP on such a sweet deal, it also left them cap space for other FAs. Before the 2014-2015 season, Mark Jackson was the head coach of Golden State. While they were pretty good in 2014 and 2013, they didn’t have a good system in place, and a lot of their plays were based on isolation (correct me if I’m wrong). After losing in 7 to the Clippers in the first round in 2014, the Warriors fired Mark Jackson and hired Steve Kerr. Kerr then implemented a motion offense based on spacing, off-ball movement, and passing. The difference was sudden, as the Warriors won 67 games in 2015, and 73 games in 2017. Curry was much more efficient and won MVP twice. Draymond Green also massively improved defensively in 2015 as well. After Harrison Barnes and Festus Ezili choked in the 2016 finals, the Warriors looked to Kevin Durant because of his driving ability and also because he’s Kevin Durant. Due partly to the Curry contract and also due to the cap jumping massively due to the new TV deal and CBA, Durant was able to sign with GSW, and they got rid of Barnes, Bogut, Ezili, and Varajao. And then now we’re here. "
Klay is not asked to be the primary defender on Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant for sure, dude's just a better player, plus after a few seasons you'll have enough collected snek skin to make custom boots for the whole team."
Think about how many people melted down online about Kevin Durant melting down online. That's some ironic business.
TIL Kevin Durant is the first player in NBA history to use free agency to choose a path most likely to result in winning a Championship. 
"Anthony Russell Russell James James James Jrue Chris Kevin Donovan Davis Westbrook Westbrook Harden Harden Harden Holiday Paul Durant Mitchell, of course."
the case with lebron is he stuck to his guns. Even after his team was falling apart he took the responsibility to carry them to the finals. That's what separates the stars from the regular players who gang up and form teams like golden state. You gotta make do with what you have. Kevin durant will never be a star regardless of the rings he has unless he chooses to show some leadership on another team while carrying them on his back. he's piggybacking on a played formula and he's just a number on the warriors team now. 
"Look, if you have a Gaussian with $\mu = 0.5, \sigma = 0.5$, the probability of obtaining an outcome of 0.2 or less from your random variable is 0.27  On the other hand, if you have a Gaussian with $\mu = 0.5, \sigma = 0.1$, that probability is 0.0013.   This is the very essence of the concept of high variance vs low variance  Kevin Durant, for all his faults and a tendency to choke, has always been a very low-variance scorer. He will get you 20+ points and rarely shoot below 30%.   LeBron James is the same way.   Same was true for MJ and Kobe back in the days (Kobe was probably the most variable player of them all).   Why is that? Because they have a reliable weapon. KD will shoot mid-range jumpers over everyone, MJ and Kobe had the turnaround jumper in the post, LeBron bullies his way to layups and dunks. Going further back, Kareem had an unstoppable skyhook, etc.  When you construct a team around 3s, FTs, and layups, you do not have that reliable weapon you can always go back to. The 3 is the most inconsistent shot in the game, FTs depend a lot on whether the refs will fall for your attempts to get them, or will call your BS and swallow their whistles, and layups are not that easy to get when defenses get really tight. And that inherently makes you a high-variance team, and especially so in the playoffs when defenses are ar their tightest and refs interpret the rules much more leniently. So the probability of obtaining those abysmal outcomes from time to time increases drastically, and particularly so in the playoffs.   Thus it is no surprise they end up happening.   Which is why the ""it's only one game"" argument is not really valid. "
Kevin Durant didn’t make the Rockets miss 27 threes in a row. 
Kevin Durant and brushing his hair 
"Just because you lose or you struggle doesn’t mean you’re not invincible. Why is that such a difficult concept for people to grasp? The Warriors won 73 games and added Kevin Durant. That ruined parity in the league. Even if they have an off game or two, even if they struggle and lose a few games, it doesn’t change the fact that they will never be an underdog. Look at Vegas.   So the Warriors struggled a few games and let the Rockets hang around. Big deal. Doesn’t mean they’re not the overwhelming favorite every time they step on the court."
"""Congratulations to the Golden State Warriors... and Kevin Durant."" As he handed him the trophy. The shade was beautiful. "
Said something like “congrats to the gsw and Kevin Durant” last night 
"That doesn't matter.   The Timberwolves are overrated, and it's a toss up whether they would beat the Bucks or the Wiz in a series.   Reread my comment on the Celtics which further supports the point I was making.   This last point is just wrong. A team as equally as good as the Warriors? You mean one with the best shooter of all time, the best 2 guard in the league, Kevin fucking Durant, and a top three defender in the league? Yeah, the East is a trash heap because there are no teams like that in the East... "
substitute James Harden with Kevin Durant \(re: his move to GS\) and you have the same logic :\)
"Warriors down 11 Curry contributes to 10 points. I'm arguing your point that ""Durant close the lead by himself"", because he didn't. Again all the plays before they tied. Curry was involved in 4 of 6 for 10 points. In what world is 9 points contributed more than Steph's 10? And it's not like the Rockets didn't score again the moment the warriors made their run. Durant didn't go on a 11-0 run by himself. After the Durant 3, steph took complete control of the game with his scoring instead of just playing making.   10:48 Kevon Looney makes layup (**Stephen Curry** assists) 45 - 56  8:42 Kevin Durant makes 25-foot three point jumper (**Stephen Curry** assists) 50 - 58  7:48 Nick Young makes 25-foot three point jumper (Kevin Durant assists) 53 - 58  5:54 Draymond Green makes layup (**Stephen Curry** assists) 55 - 59  5:21 **Stephen Curry** makes three point jumper (Jordan Bell assists) 58 - 61  4:29 Kevin Durant makes 25-foot three point jumper (Draymond Green assists) 61 - 61  Did you forget your own claim? Again, quoting you "" Closed Houston’s 10pt lead in the third by himself"" this proves that he didn't. The only play missing in the entire run was a Draymond tip shot off his own miss. "
"at the time kevin durant was the best free agent available...:of course warriors would pursue him. considering the options available at the time for kd, warriors was the best team pursuing him.   thats what happens when you are an all star u get to pick where u wanna go.  i dont think the warriors pursued anyone big besides durant. also keep in mind before durant warriors wasnt a place people wanted to come either.  it only the last 4 years warriors is an actual place big names would consider comming"
Kevin Durant rightly deserves the hate for wrecking the Western Conference but Lebron needs to continue to get hate for wrecking the Eastern Conference.
Look what you made me do starts playing   BAW GOD THATS KEVIN DURANT MUSIC! 
"It is the exact same. It is Lebron James playing on the exact team Kevin Durant has played on the last 2 years. No one would be mad at it at all. It’s not about the league being uncompetitive or any of that bullshit, it’s people believing in phony ass rivalry shit and acting like any NBA player actually cares about that. "
"I think this is kind of the point. Kevin Durant is a genetic freak of nature who has worked incredibly hard to get where he is. He's one of the top...what? Five? Three? Basketball players of his generation. He'll likely be statistically among the greatest of all time when his career is over.   Beyond that, off the court, he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars. He can live like a king. He's one of those rare people who, if he wished it, could live a life as close to ""Hakuna Matata"" as it is possible to get.   But instead, the guy wakes up and probably checks his social media accounts - real and fake - obsessively. He's pretty obviously still not comfortable with the public perception of his move to Golden State, and what it's done to his perception of HIM. From league darling to something less, at a minimum.   Why does he care what anyone thinks about his move to Golden State? Why is he creating fake social media profiles to dog on Westbrook and pump himself up? Why is he STILL ashamed when people talk about him leaving OKC?  I'm not sure KD is a bitch as much as it is he's got some issues. I know, I know. Armchair psychologist and all. But ever since he joined Golden State, and especially since he got outed on social media, he's been so weird about picking fights and getting heated on the court as well. Like he's trying exxxxxxtra hard to prove he's tough and unafraid. He made a bitch move, but I don't think that makes him a bitch. I just think he needs to be talking to someone.   My worthless .02."
Lebron can do all that and it won’t even be close. Warriors in 4. Fuck Kevin Durant
"PG: Magic Johnson SG: Frobe Bryant  SF:  Kevin ""The snake"" Durant  PF:  Dirk Nowitzki  C:   Hakeem Olajuwon    All I smell is mismatches with this death unit. Running a 4 out with a spaced floor, letting magic run the pick and roll with hakeem if the team doesn't help they'll have to find a way to stop the inside chaos of the 6'9 and 7'0 gaurds. You bring a man in well Ill kick it to frobe, dirk and or the snake. keep scrambling from ball movement youll have a 6'2 on one of my 7 footers or a big man on frobe. Lights out, fuck your face, games over, rocky top.  "
Then TAKE Kevin Durant 
Kevin Durant took 17 of those 
Calm down Kevin Durant
"The Warriors needed to sign Kevin Durant because they needed to make the finals every single year, sure, that's true. But I don't want to watch a sport where the same team makes the finals every single year, so fuck that.  I can't believe 2 years later journalists are still pulling this ""defend the warriors"" BS  "
Chris Paul  Michael Jordan  Kevin Durant  Kevin Garnett  Kareem Abdul Jabbar

Warriors go 73-9 led by Jordan Bell and Kevon 'Kevin Durant' Looney
You mean when Kevin Durant balled the fuck out?  Game 3 Curry couldn't buy a shot to save his life in the 4th.  Where KD hit 3 three's in a row to win a game they didn't have a lead in once the entire time.  He's the second best player on that team lul
Steph was the reason they closed the gap...  10:48 Kevon Looney makes layup (**Stephen Curry** assists)	45 - 56  8:42	Kevin Durant makes 25-foot three point jumper (**Stephen Curry** assists) 50 - 58  7:48	Nick Young makes 25-foot three point jumper (Kevin Durant assists) 53 - 58  5:54	Draymond Green makes layup (**Stephen Curry** assists)	55 - 59  5:21	**Stephen Curry** makes three point jumper (Jordan Bell assists) 58 - 61  4:29	Kevin Durant makes 25-foot three point jumper (Draymond Green assists) 61 - 61  3:58	**Stephen Curry** makes 22-foot three point jumper (Jordan Bell assists) 64 - 61  3:29	**Stephen Curry** makes two point shot 66 - 63  2:52	**Stephen Curry** makes 26-foot step back jumpshot 69 - 63  2:11	**Stephen Curry** makes 28-foot three point jumper (Draymond Green assists) 72 - 63  Steph had a hand in nearly all the points in their run...He basically took control of the game by himself with a bit of help from KD.
"It was an equivalent of blowing a 3-1 lead. Put it this way, if Kevin Durant played soccer he would have permanent residency in Panama City by now."

"Kneeling doesn’t affect the sport for shit, Kevin Durant fucked up the parity of the league"
Reminds me of the time Cris Carter said Kevin Durant had a harder job than LeBron James
"1. Lebron 2. Kevin Durant 3. Steph Curry 4. James Harden 5. Russell Westbrook.   The first 4 for obvious reasons, Westbrook because the dude averaged a triple double for the whole season!"
"&gt; You can’t say gis long 2’s helped his eFG&amp;#37; bc his at the rim was good, **these are separate things.** One hurt his eFG&amp;#37; and the other helped it greatly. His open shots at the rim had more to do with the attention LeBron and Wade got but he deserves credit for finishing at a high rate (though that was expected of a player his caliber).   The bolded part is the most important thing, because it shows how fallacious your reasoning is. An offense is a function of the whole of interdependent parts. In other words, an offense is greater than the sum of its parts. Mid-range shooting and shots at the rim are not, and can not be separate things.  Here's a thought experiment that proves it: Imagine the 2011-2014 Miami Heat without Chris Bosh but with Andre Drummond, is the Heat offense better or worse? I would dare anybody to argue that replacing someone with a mid-range game as refined as Bosh's with someone who literally cannot make a shot outside the paint makes an offense either the same or better. Why? Because while mid-range shots are the most inefficient shots **in a vacuum** they create the potential to warp the defense in ways that allows an offense to get more efficient shots. This is why Bosh is so important.  Bosh's pick-and-pop is a nightmare to defend because you simply can not leave him open from the mid-range to the 3-point line. If Bosh couldn't shoot, you would just leave him and blitz LeBron. [See](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Af90ftn5q8) for yourself. The play at 18 seconds is a great example. LeBron has the ball at the top of the key, Haslem sets a high screen, and Kevin Love literally never even looks at Bosh. 4 Timberwolves defenders are so scared of LeBron driving, that Bosh gets a 3-point shot so wide open it might as well be a layup.   You seem to literally not understand the concept of gravity. Gravity is not just about making shots, it's about the *potential* to make shots. Steph Curry is such a pain in the ass even when he's not making shots precisely because he requires so much attention. Game 3 of the NBA Finals is a perfect example. Curry shot 1/10 from 3, but it didn't matter because his gravity is still warping the defense. It's the reason why Steph saw 40 double teams during the NBA Finals and Durant only saw 2. You simply can never leave Curry no matter what.  Bosh and Wade's mid-range game and LeBron's driving and passing are mutually reinforcing aspects of the Heat's space-and-pace offense. If you leave Bosh or Wade, they feast from mid-range. However, if you pay too much attention Bosh or Wade, then LeBron and Wade feast at the rim."
"And this is the problem with max contracts. In what world does it make sense that Kevin Durant and Harrison Barnes are paid the same? If you got rid of the max, superstars would get valued way more than they are, and if they wanted to do the whole superteam thing they’d feel it in their pockets (and more importantly than financial impact is the ego/pride of what you make, something I think people overlook when they go “why doesn’t so and so just sign for very little and make it up in endorsements”)"
Win a title without Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant doesn't have actual fans lol.
"“I’m crazy about winning, just not obsessed with winning championships...”  If OKC missed the playoffs, his argument sticks. If OKC were the 6 seed and couldn’t even make it to the Warriors, his argument mostly sticks. If OKC play the Warriors and get swept like like an Oklahoma tornado, his argument almost kind of still sticks. But OKC went up 3-1 against the Warriors and imploded behind the talent of Kevin Durant and so his argument DOES NOT FUCKING STICK.  They won plenty of games. They made great playoff runs. They HAD ALREADY GONE TO THE FINALS but Kevin Durant “couldn’t win with those cats”  as he famously stated in the whole burner account fiasco. All he wanted was the easy road to a championship. He used fucking burner accounts to rationalize to 12 yr olds the softest move in sports history."
"As a Cleveland native: G, H, and I  G: give me Brad Stevens or Steve Kerr or Greg Popovich for Ty Lue AND $35 mil in cap space. Wow.  H: bring back one player from history in their prime, I feel like I can cop out here and take our one season with Shaq and use his prime for 3 straight seasons.  I: trade Kyle Korver for Kevin Durant. Have to pull a player off the Warriors if given the chance."
"So, as important as size is in basketball, almost no one ever makes a greatest players of all time list based solely on height and weight.  Size can be trumped by creativity.  But being a creative player is not nearly as important as having skill.  Think Kevin Durant and Steph Curry; Steph has flashy handles and an exciting shot, but Durant is far more consistent but oh so boring of a player with little to no flavor in his game.  Now when it comes to injuries, most players are expected to rest and heal up.  It's rare for players to be able to play through adversity and injury and make it look like another day at the park.  Essentially, playing through injury and digging deep can greatly bolster a players reputation, or hurt it in Wilts case(great player, not hating, just pointing out facts).  But size, creativity and playing through injury are not requirements to be an NBA player.  If they were more important to people, then Isiah Thomas would have had no place in this modern Era and Durant would not be considered one of the greatest players alive.  So while I use those variables to measure a player, they take a lower priority than the other 4.  Stats.  I was originally going to make this the most important variable, but the more and more research I did, the more I found skill to be a more accurate means of determining a players overall success than stats.  Records get broken by specialists  or sadly get cut short by injury, Larry Bird being my example as one of the greatest 3 point shooters ever skill wise but will be surpassed stats wise by people of lower overall skill.  And while skill is probably the best way to determine the greatest players, there are still quite a few people to sift through.  And the ones at the top of the top pile that truly stand out employed mind games and were utilizing psychological warfare. Words, stares, clutch shots, media quotes and other various methods were used to break an opponent of equal skill and create a separation.  The smartest players are more often than not the ones winning against players of equal skill.  And then finally the truth about life.  You can have all the skill, but the person doing research and creating a deeper knowledge base will almost always triumph.  The smarter player will get it done faster, with more effiency and make it look simple.  But you need a reason to get out of bed, to fight through that nagging injury, to deal with the media and fans.  As soon as Kobes passion was gone, none of what he attained mattered anymore.  What was the point?  That fire had driven him to that point where few had ventured before, and to continue forward into unknown territory.  And leaving to play baseball and driving fast cars does not exactly scream consistency, but 11 championships in 13 years while holding yourself back to let other shine is what the greatest player does.  Day in, day out.  There's plenty of teammates Jordan didn't want.  But Russell is the kind of guy to bring them in, find out what they do best and implement that into the playbook.  That and when I stand next to his statue in government center, my head only goes up to his elbow, and I'm over 6 feet tall....."
https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/03/kevin-durant-says-part-of-decision-to-sign-with-warriors-was-validation-from-my-peers/
"I'm a biased Cavaliers fan, but yes, I think it does add a little bit to their legacy. You have to remember that our two star players were both injured in 2015, and even though it took seven games to beat the Warriors two years ago, we still beat them. They went out and got Kevin Durant to compensate for LBJ."
The thing you're missing is that the warriors would be a different team without Durant. It's not like they would just have the exact same roster they have now except no Kevin Durant. They would have other players.
Are your friends unaware that this warriors team won 73 games in a season then added Kevin Durant?
"And this year, Kevin Durant again confirms that he can state public decisions that annoy pretty much everyone except for a population living in a part of California."
Is anyone else tired of hearing people whine about Kevin Durant 
https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/12/25/golden-state-warriors-vs-cleveland-cavaliers-highlight-game-news-kevin-durant-nba-lebron-james/  http://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=17729294  https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2017/06/08/paul-pierce-kevin-durant-lebron-james   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/has-kevin-durant-snatched-the-best-player-in-the-nba-crown-from-lebron-james/
Some guys enjoy larger success outside of the NBA. Jimmer is Kevin Durant in the Chinese basketball league. Why would he *ever* want to pass that up? 
"Players and media members who are mainly ex-players often have the worst takes. Evidence: My boy, Paul Pierce, who's sadly a terrible analyst, after last year said Kevin Durant was the best player in the league and better than LeBron after last year's Finals. And he wasn't the only player to share that opinion. It's the fallacy of so many ex-players that believe that the best player in the league is simply the best player on the best team.   I'll give you somebody whose opinion I respect above all others mainly when it comes to basketball and that's Bob Voulgaris. He can kind of be a dick on Twitter, but that dude's really fucking smart. "
"2015, he had help, in name of Matthew Dellavadova, that help out of nowhere and lasted 3 games. His other 2 stars injured. 2017,GSW signed Kevin Durant to beat him, Cleveland signed DWill1 and DWill2.  "
"Let's compare starters and reserves  Golden State:  PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: LeBron James  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Draymond Green  Bench:  PG: Shaun Livingstone  SG: Nick Young  SF: Andre Iguodala  PF: Jordan Bell  C: Javale McGee  USA:  PG: Russell Westbrook  SG: James Harden  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Paul George  C: Anthony Davis  Bench:  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Jimmy Butler  PF: Gordon Hayward  C: Joel Embiid  Sure, Golden State will probably win the starters matchup, but unless they play all 48 minutes, their reserves are gonna get slaughtered."
"I mean, I don't see why not because as we all know, the Lakers roster next year will feature LeBron, Paul George, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins, Kawhi, and hell, Kobe and MJ will probably come out of retirement just to play for the Lakers. And also, Pop gets to leave that dumpster fire of a city in San Antonio, and instead, he gets to live in Los Angeles, the greatest place on Earth."
"Curry is 6'3"". He doesn't take many closely guarded shots, his game is based around going around screens and trying to lose defenders.  Kevin Durant on the other hand is 7 feet tall. "
"Blowing a 3-2 lead while having the defending champs on the ropes, as a #1 seed, with the MVP and home-court advantage stacks up nicely.  And you won't get Kevin Durant after! "
"Because a 50/50 chance at either landing the next Kevin Durant or busing out of the league completely is well worth a high 1st round pick.    Half of 1st round picks bust anyway.  At least MPJ is as sure of a thing as you'll find from a raw skills perspective, so it's really just the injury risk you're assuming."
"&gt; After retiring a few years ago, Nash became a player development consultant for the Warriors last year, helping mostly during practice sessions. He’s worked with Stephen Curry on his shooting, and Kevin Durant on his scoring moves.  &gt;Nash wasn’t present at the ring ceremony a few weeks ago, so coach Steve Kerr decided to personally give him the championship ring himself—shirtless for some reason. Nash posted the above image with the caption, “Want to thank everyone who came out and for all the support. Go Dubs.”  https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2017/10/25/16550504/nba-warriors-steve-nash-championship-ring  "
Kevin Durant  /s
My top 10 List. This is a post 2005 ranking because thats when I have full recollections of nba memories  1: Lebron James 2: Kobe Bryant  3: Tim Duncan 4: Steph Curry 5: Dirk Nowitzki 6: Kevin Durant  7: Chris Paul 8: Kevin Garnett 9: Steve Nash 10: Dwight Howard
no one can guard Kevin Durant
"for a second i thought you were kevin durant, but your username confirms you're not him.   these are normal sized collars "
"If you consider these the same then I can't even debate with you. LeBron going to a Miami team that wasn't great. It had Dwayne Wade and added LeBron James and Chris Bosh. They had no idea how it would turn out.            Kevin Durant joined a team that had gone to back to back finals, had already won one of them, broke the single season win record, had 3 top 15-20 players already and their best player was coming off back to back MVPs. The team he had down 3-1 and then couldn't finish off. So they add the second best player in the world. Now they have 2 top 5 players and 4 top 20 players. We knew the outcome this finals 2 years ago.             I get why he did it but he lost any chance of ever getting the respect that LeBron and Jordan have. Hell he doesn't even deserve the same type of respect Curry deserves. He is a great player but he will never be in the conversation as those other guys because his legacy is built upon joining a team that didn't need him and trying to take credit for what was already going on for 2 years without him. A historic team before him so he didn't raise them up from nothing he simply just climbed on for the ride."
Kevin Durant has more championships and MVP’s than Myles has wins. 
Lebron didn’t join a 73-9 who would’ve won a championship without him. Miami would’ve been a 4-8th place team probably if Lebron didn’t join them. They would’ve been no where near as good if LBJ didn’t join them in 2010. No one is mad at GSW for winning. The issue is strictly that Kevin Durant joins a team OKC with Durant almost beat that didn’t even need him the last 2 yrs. He cheated his way to a championship.
"/r/NBA: ""I'm not obsessed with Kevin Durant"""
I respect Kevin Durant the basketball player. I don't respect Kevin Durant the competitor. He's a grown man who can do whatever the fuck he wants as long as he's fine with the consequences. My main issue is that he wants to have it both ways. You can't make a move like that and still expect people to believe you are a hardcore competitor. Just own the fact that you were tired of almost winning and wanted to a surefire path to a championship.
I've said this before and I'll say it again. Kevin Durant played for the Oklahoma City thunder an organization that consistently put a team together for him to compete with. Okc had a core of kd Westbrook ibaka and harden for a couple years before the thunder traded away harden which was a mistake. But that organization continued to put pieces together to compete and they did. They made the wcf almost every year besides the 2 years kd and Westbrook were out. Fast forward to the 2016 playoffs. The thunder went on a historic run which culminated in them being up 3-1 against a 73 win team. KD proceeded to jag away the final 3 close out games. If KD can play well to close out those games he gets back to the finals to play a Cleveland team that I think he would've beaten. Then in the off season this man signed with the team he was just up 3-1 on and it leaked that he had burner twitter accounts where he was trashing his teammates. Listen if kd wanted to leave an organization that consistently put him in the position to succeed time and time again that's on him but to join the 73 win team you were bout to beat who were also 2 minutes away from a championship is soft as shit and by far worse than bosh wade and bron joining up. Lebron James played for the cavs who from 2003-2010 did not put talent around lebron to be successful. They gave him the corpses of shaq and Antwan Jamison. Chris bosh played in Toronto during there let's drink bleach days. Wade had won a championship his 2 year in the league but was finding difficulty winning anything the following years. Individually they couldn't get past the Celtics who were the top dogs in the east. Together they did struggle to beat the Celtics and ran into trouble with the pacers. The decisions of kd and lebron are not the same. Kd played with an MVP and 6th man of the year. Lebron has fuckin mo Williams.
"The point is the team was not a championship team prior to the acquisitions and was not a complete team. They joined, figured out a play style and fought for 2 championships. Kevin Durant didn’t fight for shit, he joined a team that was already about the level Miami was at with a 73-9 season, championship and a bunch of all stars. THEN, kevin Durant decides to just hop on board for an easy championship that was gonna happen with or without him. This move eliminated any chance at a competitive series creating a power house no one had ever seen before. It’s just not the same thing. I don’t even hate the warriors, I just don’t like KD and his decision. It frustrates me as it has made Basketball boring to watch. Now we just have to pray some other team forms some ridiculous team that in all other instances we would despise, but because of the warriors, we will root for to provide us at least with a competitive championship series. Meanwhile, every other team not named these two need not worry about the regular season or post season because it is a forgone conclusion they simply won’t win it all. Wake me up when something changes; Warriors 2019 until I’m proven otherwise. Will be awesome to listen to sports analyst try and sell us on why this is not the Warriors year as they reach for silly theories to get viewers. At least I got Barkley to tell me it’s Warriors 100%. "
Do we give credit to Russell Westbrook for the emergence of Kevin Durant and James Harden? 
You really thing Kevin Durant is as valuable to the Dubs as he would have been to a team like the Celtics?
&gt;Kevin Durant slithers away
"Meanwhile, I have wanted Joe Thomas to Kevin Durant away from us so he could be in the playoffs for years lmao. Hopefully Garrett doesn't suffer the same fate for loyalty."
&gt;12 playoff games is plenty to evaluate peak  I think there's a greater sample size showing that Kevin Durant does whatever he wants vs Kawhi and has always been the better player.   Kevin Durant's postseason averages vs Kawhi Leonard head\-to\-head: **28/7/4 on 50\% fg  (19 games)**
Myles Garrett vs Kevin Durant for UFC 226 ? Book it Dana !
"We went from Dorrell Wright, to Harrison Barnes, to Kevin Durant. Thank you based god"
"Kevin Durant said on Jimmy Kimmel he’s not going to Golden State, the fact that Vegas has GS odds above SA and Toronto is just to get quick money. "
"LeBron: My decision, and it's final, will be announced right here and right now. I would like to declare, to all who are present, my final decision concerning the matter you are all interested in. It has taken me much time to deliberate on this serious issue which will bring order to the chaos. Without further adieu, I have come here to give you all the outcome of my cerebral contemplations. It is before you, that I stand to utter these words which will shake the very foundations of our sport. Lo and behold, for we have come unto the end-times. I have descended from the mountaintop and bring the wisdom of the ages not only of this world, but all worlds. All times and all dimensions are known to me now and in nearly every universe, I have suffered failure and defeat. All but one universe. One timeline. There is a pathway to success. There is only one way. In time, you will come to understand what I have done.  **LEBRON SNAPS HIS FINGERS**  *Steph Curry fades away*  *Anthony Davis fades away*  *Klay Thompson fades away*  *Victor Oladipo fades away*  *Kyrie Irving fades away*  *James Harden's beard fades away*  *James Harden fades away*  *Brad Stevens fades away*  *Michael Jordan fades away*  *The kid who dunked on LeBron at the Nike camp fades away*  *Gregg Popovich fades away*  *Skip Bayless fades away*  *Kevin Durant slithers away*   WHAT HAVE YOU DONE LEBRON"
"We use averages from a single playoff series to determine finals MVP, which immensely shapes how we view legacies (see Kobe vs Shaq).  12 playoff games is plenty to evaluate peak. I'm not debating playoff body of work.  I believe, when healthy, Kawhi is a more valuable playoff performer than Kevin Durant. That's not to take away from the amazing player KD is. Kawhi has simply shown he can get to another level. "
&gt;Kevin “The ~~Servant~~ **Serpent**” Durant  FTFY
"A lot of people on this sub think Kevin Durant will be top 10 when the curtain falls on his career. Not me tbf, but there are people.  Personally I would not have Kobe top 10, but that is my personal consideration.  A fairer way to think about it would be to think in percentiles. Being a top 10 all-time player is less impressive when you are being compared to 100 players vs. When you are being compared to 10,000.  Controversially I also do not think LeBron is a top10 all-time player. He is top1 in terms of both talent and longevity, but in many of his choices, competitive spirit and teamplay, things that weigh heavily for me, he is not even top100 all time and for me that disqualifies him from a top10 listing."
"He say he is the best player in the world but has too many turnovers, does too much work to try make up for the other guys deficiencies. Probably isn't the best player in world I think Kevin Durant surpassed him as the best player in the world last year. It might not show up in the stats."
"Durant is Cell- He needs the strength of others to become powerful. The Warriors (Androids) were absorbed by him to reach his perfect form (2x FMVP). He doesn't need to run with Dr. Gero (rhymes with 0) anymore.   Westbrook is Dr. Gero- his fellow androids (16/Harden, 17/Ibaka, 18/KD) stabbed him in the back and left him high and dry.  Isaiah Thomas- Garlic Jr.- Small, but when he turns it on, he becomes a tough fighter. Isaiah can also be Android 15.   Kevin Love- Vegeta- He broke his shoulder (arm in DBZ, close enough) in a tough battle against a long haired individual, always overshadowed by his more powerful comrade, has a celeb wife, comes in clutch to help LeGoku in the movies.  Draymond Green- Dodoria- dirty fighter, jacked dude, 3rd or 4th strongest in the Frieza force.  CJ and Dame- Gotenks- when they combine their powers, they are one of the most dangerous fighters in the league. Individually, they're both talented and young. But also like Gotenks, they haven't beaten anyone of late.   Yamcha/Tien- Your teams 12th man in rotation  "
And to be (un)fair we also have someone named Kevin Durant. Stephen Curry actually played well in the Finals...he had only one real no-show in game 3.
"You had some good takes editted them with some context and minor changes:   • Goku: Lebron - athleticism OP, in the league since he was 18    • Gohan: Kyrie Irving , see Lebron   • Vegeta: Kobe, see Lebron    • Goten: ~~Steph Curry~~ not born yet    • Jiren: ~~Kevin Durant~~ Prime Duncan.

Kevin Durant sounds like a type of snake
Nuggets have the best record against Warriors besides the Rockets in the NBA lmao. There is nothing Kevin Love can do on defense that Jokic can't. Jokic's problem is geared towards rim protection than it is on switches. Nuggets were actually a good defensive team with Millsap on the court. Draymond and Durant would help hide Jokic defense. Curry is basically useless against Bron and Cavs couldn't exploit that match up because of help defense. So yes everything you said was wrong. I didn't get exposed. Your lack of basketball knowledge got exposed. Dorks on this subreddit like you think its easy to disect the game and say oh they will just put Jokic in the pick and roll he wont even be able to play! Disregarding all the other defenders on the court.   Edit: Why are OKC and Lakers fans so defensive about Westbrook and Kobe and overrated them? They are both chukers. Westbrook will never bring a ring to your city. You should be praying your gm trades him. He is awful on defense and you will never have an elite offense unless you get another Durant on your team. Shooting 40 perfent from the field is unacceptable. I don't know why you guys are happy with a player shooting so poorly in today's efficent NBA. If be pissed if I was you. He was inefficent with arguably the best scorer ever. That is unacceptable. You guys should have higher standards.
"It was fourth quarter, with less than ten seconds left and Golden State was down by 2. T h e arena was so loud, that Steph couldn’t hear his own thoughts.  He calmly walked the ball up the court and saw Russell waiting for him at the half court line, watching him intently with his eyes. Once Steph reached half court, he quickly passed the ball to Kevin and once Kevin touched the ball, every fan in the arena instantly booed.  ""CUPCAKE! CUPCAKE!” everyone chanted in the stands. Kevin calmly dribbled the ball and watched as his former teammate, Andre Roberson, checked him.  After passing the ball, Steph ran straight through the lane and took a screen from Draymond. Russell bumped into Draymond and then hurriedly moved to catch up to Steph, but this was enough space to give the sharpshooter room.  Kevin dribbled the ball to the top of the key and Andre followed. He gave him a quick in and out with the ball and then passed it to Steph once he saw him open. Steph caught the ball in the corner behind the three point line and quickly released it in the air. Russell moved to contest the shot, but was too late.  The clock was running down as the ball sailed to the basket. Steph had landed and watched as the ball moved in the air. He closed his eyes and silently prayed that the ball would sink in the net. When he heard the buzzer go off, he opened his eyes and saw the ball rattle in the hoop. The whole Warriors bench stood and watched. BUZZZZZ!!!!!  ""WOOOOO!!!!!” Steph yelled excitedly. He raised his arms in the air as Thunder fans booed. The team was running onto the floor to hug him and celebrate the game winner. Thunder players were shaking their heads at the sudden lost and standing in disbelief. Steph continued to stand confidently as Kevin was the first to reach him. He put his forehead to Steph’s and yelled.  “YEAH!” Kevin yelled out loud. He brought a hand to Steph’s head and smiled. Steph looked in his eyes and smiled, too. At that moment, Steph focused solely on Kevin and wanted nothing more than to kiss him. Kevin was leaning close to him, so Steph leaned up and kissed him.  It went silent in the arena, every fan either stopped cheering or booing and watched as Stephen Curry kissed Kevin Durant. "
"You listed 26 retired players, but I'd...   REMOVE:  Scottie Pippen, Steve Nash, Bob Pettit, Dirk Nowitzki, Karl Malone      ADD:  LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Chris Paul"
"I can actually explain this. He did a podcast with Bill Simmons, and Bill said that he really loved Mikal Bridges and thinks he's great, but Kevin Knox is 3 years younger, and Bill said that he thought Kevin Knox should develop past what Mikal Bridges is in 3 years.  It was pretty spotty logic, given that some players don't take a further leap from what they are, and some older players do take further leaps, and all indications from the advanced stats are that Mikal is an elite wing prospect (his advanced stats are better than Klay/Kawhi/Butler/George, etc., best college stats for a wing archetype since Durant).  But this is almost assuredly just a result of KOC eating up Bill's logic on that podcast and then updating the draft guide.  Bill also said that they should just update the draft guide non-stop, and just add a new point to the end of it, so that also probably fired KOC to go make some change to it. "
"I agree. Cool names are ways destined for greatness. Kemba walker. Now that's a name.   Kawhi Leonard,  James Harden, Kevin Durant. The list just goes on my rookies are Lonzo ball and Jayson Tatum and Donovan "
Tony Allen was also the last person to shut down Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant: hahahaha..... but seriously tho...
Kevin Durant is from Washington DC. [The Washington DC baseball team is Walgreens](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/WEV8STM). KD retiring to go play baseball confirmed.   Looks like we might have been comparing the wrong player to MJ. 
"&gt; We don't know what Cuban was doing behind the scenes  Didn't Cuban dismantle the team for the next season? From 2012 onwards the Mavericks have basically been perennial 8th seeds with no chance of making it further. They squandered the last of Nowitzki's years without properly building for the future, so now they are in full tank mode. As long as the Nuggets and Timberwolves stay competitive, the Mavs will probably not go to the playoffs before 2020.  &gt; for LeBron to look for players that can help get the team   Yeah, that's not the problem. What makes him look bad, and what caused the reaction from Barkley, was talking about it in the media, as if that is solving anything. That is the discussion you have with your front office and coach, not with the media. The Warriors had a pre-season where they got Kevin Durant. But the Cavs had the same pre-season. What did they get then? At least this past season the Cavs got new pieces and then traded them, so they did something."
Are these players all committed?  KD declined before [because of the Paul George injury](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2014/11/03/kevin-durant-admits-injury-to-paul-george-was-the-reason-he-withdrew-from-usa-basketball-team/).  Has he changed his mind publicly?  
I've only been really watching since 2014 tbh so heres my list in order:   Kyrie Irving   Kawhi Leonard   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   LeBron James
&gt;For the final possession in some sets? Yes. What's Kevin Durant when Steph has the ball late in the game? Or what is Steph when KD has the ball late in the game?   Players that demand a ton of attention off the ball due to their shooting ability...
"' ""The trick is to say your prejudiced against all races."" - Homer Simpson'  - Kevin Durant"
For the final possession in some sets? Yes. What's Kevin Durant when Steph has the ball late in the game? Or what is Steph when KD has the ball late in the game?   There will be some sets where Bron is put as the roll man and Simmons as the initiator. Or Embiid will get the ball in the deep post and Bron turns into a spot up shooter. Every team with more than one star (aka every championship team ever) puts their stars into less than perfect roles because as a whole it will make the team better. If the Sixers get Bron the same will happen. 
Kevin Durant and James Harden.  Don't know if anybody knows that they were on the same team though.
"I was in the mystic canyons of Southern Carolina, it was a humid day, about 96 degrees with a fog that could peel an onion, I thought to myself ""I could go for a good ol' Taco Bell Taco"", I ordered a Plain Taco with only doritos and beef on it, as I pulled up to the drive thru payment center I realized I had forgotten my wallet, when the cashier handed me my Taco I cried and tried to explain what had happened, luckily he showed me mercy, little did I know thanks to Kevon Durant and Kevin Looney I could have gotten TWO free tacos. Alas."
"Not sure I do either, just realistic dates of last game played. Is the jab in OPs post from yesterday - ""draft Kevin Durant""?"
Jordan won a finals guarded by 6'6 HOF Clyde Drexler. Jordan actually outplayed his rivals and beat them.  Lebron gets outplayed by them and hands them Finals MVP's. Two years in a row he has gotten outplayed by Kevin Durant and lost to him.  Guys are BENEFITING from playing Lebron. Worry about being better than KD first before comparing him to the GOAT.
"Right which is why I only rate the trade as of now. If your using a Chrystal ball and saying “anything can happen” then you also can’t argue that Marcus smart is less valuable than Kevin durant, because there is an off chance that he scores 80 a game next year.  We can only use the info we know and as of today it looks like a complete steal. Maybe it changes in the future, but I can’t see the future."
"On the flip side. Let’s talk about..  #A List of Things Your Team Hasn’t Done More Recently than the Seattle SuperSonics.   Make the NBA FINALS. That is, if your team didn’t have Jeff Green or Kevin Durant on it. "

"His job is not to talk specifically about on court circumstances.  His job is to talk basketball.  He got in trouble with mj for a similar thing.  He gave his honest opinion about mj as an owner. Lebron went to the media and said he needs another play maker because the team needs more help. He gave his honest opinion about lebron not wanting to compete in the nba. Maybe that's not true.  It doesn't matter.  Its certainly basketball related.  It's not like calling him a bad father or a liar.    Also, its not even uncommon for players to take criticism like that.   Kevin Durant took a lot of heat from just about everybody for being perceived as someone who doesn't want to compete.  Lebron took it personally, but it was definitely a job related criticism.  "
"You have a point when you say that they might be better with more shooting in the death lineup, although I'm not sold on how easy it would be to change their style of play on offense. They nearly lost in 2015 because they needed more playmaking and David Lee stepped up on a few crucial possessions. That being said, now that they have Kevin Durant, maybe they don't need as much playmaking from their bigs."
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Lebron James  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Anthony Davis   6 Man: Joel Embiid   And then you'd have to get lucky.   Edit: Also wtf dude you just changed your lineup on us?
"I agree with your general sentiment. It is ALWAYS good to have more offensive weapons than not, regardless of situation.  With that said. An effective 3 shot would not have been as effective back then as it is today. Mostly due to handchecking. Especially against the dirty ass Pistons. Who would still undoubtedly clobber Mike on the 3pt line.  I'll copy &amp; paste from an old  comment I saved.    &gt;So in 2004-05 the league introduced new rules to curtail hand-checking, clarify blocking fouls and call defensive three seconds to open up the game. The results were immediate. Before the change, the MVPs were Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett, defensive stalwarts. After the change, the MVPs were Steve Nash and Dirk Nowitzki, known more for their perimeter offense than their defense.   &gt;And perimeter players have won every single MVP since the change -- Nash, Nowitzki, Bryant, James, Rose, Durant, Curry, and Westbrook. The rules opened up the perimeter game and that's the way the league likes it.     https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6r89te/can_someone_explain_the_obsession_with/dl341q0"
"&gt; All titles with Kevin Durant have an asterisk attached to them  By that logic, all Lebron's MIA titles have asterisks next to them "
All titles with Kevin Durant have an asterisk attached to them. They've really only won a single finals so they need 3-4 more titles.
"&gt; If you want 75%-80% ... of Draymond the list is a lot longer than those guys.  I'm very curious to see your list. I'll tip my hat to you if you can name 4 guys who (1) can approximate Green's passing, defensive versatility, and shooting, and (2) might be available for trades or might sign a contract that works under the salary cap (i.e. Giannis doesn't count).  Harris replacing Klay is a stretch, but I stand by the other Klay comps and by my claim that **replacing Green would be very difficult.**  With regards to replacing Draymond, the hardest part is replacing his playmaking. Here's a list of the 18 players 6'7"" or taller who averaged at least 3.5 assists. Keep in mind that Draymond averaged 7, so the bar here is very low.  * Ben Simmons * Al Horford * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Joe Ingles * Draymond Green * Lebron James * Kevin Durant * Nikola Jokic * DeMar DeRozan * James Johnson * Marc Gasol * Khris Middleton * Nicolas Batum * Jimmy Butler * Brandon Ingram * Blake Griffin * Caris LeVert * Tomas Satoransky  4 of these guys are either on Draymond's team, unavailable superstars, or are Draymond Green himself.  * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Draymond Green * Lebron James * Kevin Durant  10 of these guys are either not big enough to play small ball center or clearly don't have the talent to anchor an elite defense.  * Ben Simmons * Joe Ingles * DeMar DeRozan * Khris Middleton * Nicolas Batum * Jimmy Butler * Brandon Ingram * Blake Griffin * Caris LeVert * Tomas Satoransky  That leaves us with the following 4 players.  * Al Horford * Nikola Jokic * James Johnson * Marc Gasol  I don't think Gasol at this point in his career has the mobility to guard perimeter players, which is required in the Warriors defense. Jokic is a hard maybe. I don't think he's good enough defensively, but he might also belong on the list of unavailable superstars.   Therefore, the only two players who could potentially replace Green's skillset who might also be available are Al Horford and James Johnson. However, if you're going to trade for Al Horford's $29 million contract, you might as well keep and pay Green, so that's a moot point. **The only real option is James Johnson.**"
"discarding logic? you have given no proof as to why he made his decision  from everything i have read, he stated that he wanted to pursue his own happiness in life and it was not just basketball related  that is literally making the decision to have a less stressful life  http://www.realclearlife.com/sports/kevin-durant-explains-left-oklahoma-city-golden-state/  &gt;Durant prioritized himself, chose to pursue his own joy, not his sense of obligation to millions of strangers  hows the fantasy life for you, kevin?  edit: https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/features/kevin-durant-had-to-blow-up-his-life-to-get-his-shot-w445344  have fun in the *fantasyyyyyy worlddddd*"
"I call Kevin Durant ""Kevith"" now, occasionally. Same with Jordith Bell."
"It's crazy that people have forgotten how good that Thunder team was, and how shocking it was that Miami completely dominated them in the Finals.   OKC won at a 58 win rate in the shortened season. They swept the defending champ Mavs. Then they completely manhandled a really, really, *really* good Lakers team (even with Kobe averaging 38 ppg in the last 3 games). **Then** after going down 2-0 to the Spurs in super close games (who would make the next two Finals and win one of them with one of the best teams of all time) they won 4 straight and headed into the Finals on fire.   OKC was favored in Vegas. They were favored in the media. They were favored by popular opinion. Kevin Durant was already a superstar averaging 30-5-5. Russell Westbrook was turning into a superstar, and James Harden was exploding in the Conference Finals.   Miami really fucking struggled that same playoffs. They went to 6 in the second round against the Pacers with baby Paul George and Danny Granger (who shit the bed hard in the playoffs). They went to 7 in the Conference Finals against Boston, and would have absolutely lost that series if Lebron James did not have one of the greatest game 6's of all time.   Miami was **definitely** not *heavily favored* against the Thunder. The Thunder were being called a new dynasty, while Miami was looking liked a failed dynasty with their second disappointing playoffs in a row. "
"Lonzo would absolutely be a franchise changer for the Hornets at the very least in terms of ad revenue and ticket sales (something that's of utmost importance to a small market team like them). Who knows how good he'll end up being, but he was a very good player this year outside of his shooting (and almost all rookies are poor shooters - Lonzo actually shot better from 3 this year than Kevin Durant did as a rookie).   Again though, you need to compare this to the Hornets with Kemba (who missed the playoffs *in the East* again this year) and compare that to what the Hornets would look like once Kemba likely leaves next summer. Getting Lonzo would be *huge* for Charlotte. "
I remember when Kevin Durant was our biggest free agent signing
"Yeah, you could really argue that Spain are the Warriors 3-4 years ago, and Barcelona is the Warriors with a Kevin Durant (Messi, Suarez, whoever you want to choose here).  Belgium = Rockets is also good. Who would you compare Brazil to then? "
"Would you rather have Kawhi Leonard or the combined powers of Kevin Durant, Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan with Isaiah Thomas’ defence?  Seems like the answer should be pretty clear."
"&gt; Charles was right, the Cleveland Cavaliers were the champions at that point! They had won with Kyrie and Love together. And Lebron asks for another ""playmaker""?   They won with Kyrie and KLove on a last minute shot in game 7 with Draymond getting suspended and Curry not 100%..... and then the warriors added Kevin Durant. You don't think Lebron was in the right asking for a little more help? Lmao"

"Yo bro be honest with me man, are you Kevin Durant?  "
Player b is kevin durant. Still working on A  Edit: Player a is dwyane wade If youre looking at window of those specific years it is really tough
"Player B is 100% Kevin Durant. Can't think of anyone else that could be.  No idea who player A is, but KD's stats are much better"
"I used regular season only cuz point was to more or less show which players protect their 3-point percentage more by deciding not to put up 3's. In the playoffs, that kind of goes out the window.   Players | Attempts | Made -------|--------|---- Stephen Curry | 15 | 1 Carmelo Anthony | 3 | 0 Dwyane Wade | 9 | 0 LeBron James | 4 | 0 John Wall | 6 | 0 Dirk Nowitzki | 2 | 0 Chris Paul | 3 | 0 Paul George | 6 | 0 Russell Westbrook | 2 | 0 James Harden | 7 | 0 Kyrie Irving | 1 | 0 Giannis Antetokounmpo | 1 | 0 Damian Lillard | 2 | 0   Anthony Davis | 1 | 0 Kevin Durant | 6 | 0 Kawhi Leonard | 0 | 0  So yeah... not really a huge game-changer. "
"Those stats are kinda the point tho. Amazing stats, but those stats are more in line with a Kevin Durant or even a Dwayne Wade. Dwade's stats for this same time frame would look remarkably similar lol KD's stats for the last 5 years would probably shit on KObe's. I neve hear either of those guys mentioned as Goat. So those stats are not like jordan, not lebron, not kareem, etc.    Kobe is the 2nd best SG of all time. But if it wasnt for his similarity in STYLE to Jordan, or his 3 rings hand  delivered from Shaq, he wouldnt be regarded as high as he is by fans. I specify by fans bc on any media list that comes out hes almost NEVER listed in the top 5 and many times he's outside the top 10.   The media has it right. Its just the fans who cant let that emotion get out the way"
"MICHAEL JORDAN, THE GREATEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME WITH 6-0 FINALS RECORD 😂   (took 6 years to get to the playoffs and a lot of 1st round sweeps 🤣 )  Apparently for Jordan fans, they say it's better to lose and get swept in the early rounds of the playoffs than in the finals 🤣  MJ has 6 finals appearances out of 15 seasons.   1984 lost 1st round 1985 lost 1st round sweep 1986 lost 1st round sweep 1987 lost 1st round sweep 1988 lost ECF 1989 lost ECF  '90-'91 Finals Bulls (1) vs Lakers (3) Lakers starters: Vlade Divac, AC Green, Sam Perkins, James Worthy, Magic Johnson (last season)  '91-'92 Finals Bulls vs Trailblazers Trailblazers starters: Clyde Drexler (all star), Terry Porter, Jerome Kersey, Clifford Robinson, Danny Ainge  '92-'93 Finals Bulls vs Suns (JOHN PAXSON WINNING SHOT) Suns starters: Charles Barkley (all star), Kevin Johnson, Dan Majerle, Richard Dumas, Danny Ainge  '93-94 Jordan retired, Bulls' record 55-27  '94-'95 Rockets Champs, Jordan came back before the playoffs.

"Kevin Durant is happy, he can finally sleep in till 9."
"Yes, there are skilled big men but most are just way bigger than everyone else and not very impressive.  I agree with Kevin Durant when he said Shaq was just bigger than everybody else and had no skill."
"Kevin Durant: ""I'm the most hated player in the league.""  Demarcus Cousins: ""Hold my beer."" "
"So you’re saying we’re very close to Roman Reigns spearing Kevin Durant, all the while complaining that he should’ve defeated Brock Lesnar?"
"when the new TV deals kicked in a few years ago there was a huge spike in the salary cap, around 25 millions dollars. That's what allowed the Warriors to add Kevin Durant to their team. Adam Silver proposed cap smoothing, which was spreading that spike over several years so as to avoid the KD scenario, but the Players Association said no"
"When the cap went up a fuck ton due to the new TV deal a couple years ago, it's because the players union demanded the increase to all happen in one year rather than a gradual increase across a few years.       Thus, we live in a universe where the Warriors suddenly had enough cap room for Kevin Durant. "
and lebron slapped that drafted team all around the court.  only through flukes of history that have dropped into their laps have they become unbeatable.  it's not exactly savvy to sign kevin durant with the free money from the cap spike.  or to just happen to be around when an all-star center decides to take 25% of his market value for no apparent reason.
Steph Curry and Klay Thomspon = Splash Bros  Kevin Durant and Boogie Cousins = Smash Bros
"This is fucking dumb. There is already a third splash brother, IT'S CALLED KEVIN DURANT! Did everybody forget?! Et tu Steph?!"
"He made the bed, now he lies in it.   Though I would like to point out: Lebron may have started the player agency era. but Kevin Durant brought it to a much, much worse level. "
"This is the year 2100.  Technology has allowed humans to live for 1000 years.   The NBA Champion, for the 87th time, is the Golden State Warriors.  At the age of 112, Stephen Curry is the oldest man to win an NBA title. The near-immortal cyborg lineup of Steph, Klay, Draymond, KD, and Boogie is currently the oldest ever starting lineup to win an NBA title. On the bench are Andre Iguodala, Steph Curry III, Klay Thompson III, Draymond Green III, Kevin Durant III, Demarcus Cousins III, Gianluigi Buffon, and Tom Brady. Steve Kerr, now 75% robot, is the first cyborg to win 1 million games."
"Yep, this was before Kevin Durant made the weakest move in professional sports history, deciding that he didn't want to compete anymore and just wanted to coast to victory. "
"There's no ""should"" in the NBA. Players make the decisions they think are best for themselves. Believe it or not, Kevin Durant worked plenty hard to win his rings even while playing for the Warriors."
"B/c I'm realistic. The boys are too young right now. Depth matters less and less in the playoffs. We can give 'em a run. But Tatum, Kyrie, Jaylen, Gordon just can't match up with Kevin freakin' Durant, Steph fuckin' Curry, Klay ""go nuclear when I feel like it"" Thompson, Draymond ""mouth breather"" Green. We have to hope for chemistry implosion and hope Brad can integrate everyone in smoothly this year. Then we could have a group that loves playing with one another versus a group that's getting tired of each other's shit. That's the only way the Celtics win."
Hold your horses my friend. Cousins could legit destroy this GSW team.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2748319-demarcus-cousins-looked-for-kevin-durant-after-ejections-had-to-be-restrained
"But what rules did Sam break? Silver has no problem as long as it’s in the [rules](https://www.google.com/amp/thesportsdaily.com/2018/06/20/adam-silver-warriors-worked-within-system-to-get-kevin-durant-html-h1p1/amp/) . Sam saw a broken system and used it, Warriors did the same thing.  so it’s either all okay or none of it is okay. Sixers had the Colangeos forced on their franchise for trying to build through the draft FOR 3 YEARS. Stern stopped CP3 from joining Kobe. Silver has allowed a team of 4 all stars add another after having a sweep in the Finals. It’s a joke.  Is one team purposely losing as damaging to a league then having the league already know whose going to win the finals in July? I mean come the fuck on."
"Fuck you Kevin Durant, such a fucking pussy"
"I mean how do you walk into the Warriors locker room as Andre Iguodala, a good player in your own right, see Draymond Green, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Demarcus Cousins, and Kevin Durant sitting there, and not think ""This is fucking stupid""?"
Kevin Durant does 
""" *queef queef queef* ,"" Kevin Durant said about his new teammate DeMarcus Cousins to The Undefeated"
2x Finals MVP Kevin Durant is still not a splash Brother lmao 
&gt;  “always been superteams”  They could have been fucking right off. You dont go 73-9 albeit Cavs win the ship (yay)....then add Kevin Durant.  And oh hey.....they add what a top 5 center who can shoot 3s now.  I would say its a joke at this point but its far too hysterical. I really need someone to explain baseball to me or hockey (which i actually like watching).  Shit is over for atleast another 3 years. Atleast my team just got sent to the realm of mediocrity with just....JUST the best player in the world leaving. 
"Enough is enough! I have had it with this Warriors dominance. Adam Silver needs to fix this mess before the league becomes even more lopsided. It's not even fun anymore to watch the NBA when you know your team won't win anything important. The fact that Kevin Durant can take a paycut to help out the dirty owners and keep his dirty and unfair team alive. He's a dirty filthy snake that's only success has been to latch onto a 73-9 team and completely RUIN the NBA!!! Kevin Durant could have gone to any other team and it would have been fine but NOOO, he had to take his dirty talents to a team that has already proven to be dominant. I want someone to start a go fund me page to stop this nonsense! Maybe if we raise enough money, Adam Silver and the NBA will have to do something about these snakes and this unfair game!"
Fucking Kevin Durant man. 
"I’m sorry to say this but with technology how it is now...no one will be saying this. We already give shit to Kevin Durant and his rings, permanent asterisks. He will go down as a bitch forever..but boogie...boogie isn’t even a bitch at this point. He’s a straight up, std filled street hooker. Boogie is lil Kim. He straight up got fucked by Sacramento, fucked by the pelicans and decided to get in bed with the warriors.   In 10, 20, 30 years everyone will still remember that KD is a bitch and boogie is a lil Kim hoe. "

Fuck Kevin Durant for starting all this. 
"Idk, ask Kevin Durant"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Kevin Durant. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched the Slim Reaper in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Durant's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SF ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Durant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Durant in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Durant is better. You might be jealous of Durant's two rings, or jealous of his status as the one of the greatest scorers in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Durant isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Durant talk to the adults. Fair?"
"I don't follow the NBA, but I do read about it occasionally. I can probably name 20 current NBA players. I know all 5 of the Warriors starters.  Just to see:  Steph Curry  Kevin Durant  Draymomd Green  Demarcus Cousins  Klay Thompson  LeBron James  James Harden  Chris Paul  Giannis  Michael Westbrook   Eric Bledsoe   Kyrie Irving  Dwight Howard   Blake Griffin   Derrick Rose  Delavadova   Ersan Ilyasova   Paul Perkins?   Kevin Love  That guy with the unibrow  The European who Michael Rappaport freaked out about when the Knicks drafted him   Lavar? Ball  Swaggy P?   Kawhi Leonard    "
"Im sorry, but this is not about a good culture. Kevin Durant showed people you can sign on for a guaranteed ring even if you are MVP caliber talent, and now the game is broken. If your team cant lose games, there is never a reason to fight or be unhappy. Thats what your ""good culture"" team is, a guaranteed ring that people sign on to be a part of, because at some point the only metric of success became rings."
This year in the NBA Finals it’s Kevin Durant vs. Steph Curry for finals MVP.
 All nba team...  PG: Stephen Curry (1st team)   SG: Klay Thompson (3rd)   SF: Kevin Durant (2nd)   PF: Draymond Green (2nd)   C: DeMarcus Cousins (2nd) 
"I really loved the Warriors pre Kevin Durant and even after Durant I sort of rooted for them as a California team but thought they had made the league boring. Even with a long rehab Boogie would be ready and knocked off rust before the playoffs and made the championship a forgone conclusion. Shit even if curry or Durant was out for the playoffs I would still favor the Warriors against the rest of the league.  This is just overboard, like an embarrassment of riches."
"Steph Curry - 2x MVP 5x allstar  Klay Thompson - 4x allstar  Kevin Durant - 1x MVP 9x allstar  Draymond Green - 3x allstar, 1x DPOY  Demarcus Cousins - 4x allstar   Their starting 5 only has a combined 25 allstars 3 mvps and a dpoy. I don't see what the big deal is"
"He removed all doubt and excitement from the 2017 finals and 2018 finals.  He made all the games leading up to the finals less interesting because they had no significance to the finals.   He cheapened the accomplishment of winning a finals.  And he opened the door for future superstars to take 10 cents on the dollar to join super teams that are impossible to defeat. And today Demarcus Cousins joined GSW for 5 mil when he could have gotten 4 or 5 times that easily from another team.  Kevin Durant has made hundreds of millions of dollars off of basketball fans. And he just ruined the sport.  Yeah, it's easy to hate a guy for that."
when the warriors were dominant without kevin durant. that was a fun team. i enjoyed watching them because they drafted all of their players and suffered years of mediocrity before becoming good.   but i would expect you to remember the warriors before KD joined 
"The warriors could lose former mvp Kevin Durant and gold medalist and all NBA all star DeMarcus cousins and still have the same core team that broke the record for best regular season of all time. The best team of all time plus durant and cousins. That's where we are at right now.   Late 2000s werent really like that. Where would the Lakers and Celtics of the late 2000s rank in today's NBA? They wouldn't really have a shot at beating that. And then there's the tanking epidemic that bloomed over the past ten years that's making the NBA even worse. To some extent yes, the NBA had less parity than other sports like nhl, mlb, NFL where you felt like you have a chance if you make the playoffs, but this is absurd.   Remember we are ten years removed from an eight seed beating a one seed in the west and six or so years removed from the single super star Mavs beating the super team heat. What would that be equivalent to today, the wizards beating the warriors? I don't even know, but I do know that whatever the modern day comparison would be it isn't fathomably possible. I know that the finals has only been a little more predictable than in other leagues up until the past couple of years when it has become a foregone conclusion. Though I guess this year it is a question who will be swept by gsw."
"For reference the Warriors were the best regular season team, then added Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins. Lol."
Just fucking disgraceful. Kevin Durant two years ago and now this. I guess I'm glad LeBron left now so I don't have to give a shit about what a joke they've made if the NBA. 
"They took a historic team, upgraded Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant and Javale Mcgee for DMC.   What in the fuck? Whatever happened to basketball reasons?"
but it just pisses off everyone who didnt get Kevin Durant because of a stupid ass cap spike   Fuck this organization and fuck that cap spike 
The Warriors are an All-NBA starting lineup from the 2015-16 season.  PG: Stephen Curry (1st team)  SG: Klay Thompson (3rd)  SF: Kevin Durant (2nd)  PF: Draymond Green (2nd)  C: DeMarcus Cousins (2nd)
"Even then, would a starting roster of Ben Simmons, Reddick, Kawhi, Davis, Embiid beat a starting line up of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Demarcus Cousins?"
"He can’t veto signings. Only trades can be vetoed. I fact silver said of KD’s signing and I quote, “Just to be absolutely clear, I do not think that's ideal from the league standpoint For me, part of it is designing a collective bargaining agreement that encourages the distribution of great players throughout the league. On the other hand, I absolutely respect a player's right to become a free agent and, in this case, for Kevin Durant to make a decision that he feels is best for him. I have no idea what's in his mind or heart in terms of how he went about making that decision. In a way, the good news is that we are in a collective bargaining cycle, so it gives everybody an opportunity -- owners and the union -- to sit down behind closed doors and take a fresh look at the system and see if there is a better way that we can do it. My belief is we can make it better.”"
Kevin Durant actually destroyed the league. When I saw the boogie news I thought I was having a fever dream for a second.
Fuck Kevin Durant too
when kevin durant went to the warriors I laughed at the people that said they were boycotting the league. Im legit ready to not watch this stupid shit. the fuck is this
The Warriors didn’t draft Demarcus Cousins or Kevin Durant. 
"Kevin Durant- ""I'm the most hated man in the NBA.""  DeMarcus Cousins- ""Hold my beer."""
Because kevin durant is a splash sister
"If you had said 2 years ago that a lineup of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Demarcus Cousins would exist outside of the Allstar game no one would've believed you."
"It’s not, DMC just tore his Achilles and his future is uncertain. Why not sign a 1 year prove it deal, take his time getting healthy, and get a ring.  Kevin Durant was in the prime of his career. If DMC was fully healthy I’d agree with you "
John Tavares will fulfill all your Kevin Durant-hatred needs.
"r/nba : ""Kevin Durant made the biggest bitch move in NBA history by signing with the Warriors.""  Cousins: ""Hold my headband. """
S/O to Kevin Durant for taking less money which led to this.
KEVIN DURANT BROKE THE NBA
"Steph Curry  Klay Thompson  Kevin Durant  Draymond Green  Boogie  That's a legit big 5. An Olympic team lineup. This is so, so very fucked up. "
"DeMarcus Cousins is a pussy.   Fuck this league, literally the biggest collection of uncompetitive bitches to ever grace the earth.   Fuck the Nba, Fuck the Warriors, and Fuck ~~Kevin Durant~~ DeMarcus Cousins"
Congrats Boogie you became the new Kevin Durant.
Steph Curry  Klay Thomspon   Kevin Durant   Draymond Green  DeMarcus Cousins 
Steph Curry  Klay Thompson  Kevin Durant  Draymond Green  DeMarcus Cousins    What the good lord fuck
"Oh for sure, last week a few of us were talking after the runs and he was saying how he doesn’t get how it’s hard to guard Kevin Durant because you just need to not let him be comfortable and get a rhythm. And playing and talking has helped me a bunch with basketball in high school and college"
 If you’re going to have such bad skin you better play like Kevin Durant. 
Who the hell said Kevin Durant on the Warriors wouldn’t work? Lmao
&gt;or Kevin Durant on Warriors wouldn’t work  literally who said this? 
"Kevin Durant, March 2010:  ""I’m good in Oklahoma City. I love it here. I like going outside and seeing the neighbors and they say, ‘Hello.’ They make me cookies and give me Skittles. There are cities you may not get that.”"
Unless you're Kevin Durant
"""I want to annihilate them... *calls Kevin Durant after game 7*  Like I said, annihilate.""   *evil smile*"
“I want to retire in OKC”   “Kevin Durant: My Next Chapter”
that’d be kevin durant
Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant as a package deal
"First Kevin Durant with a home in LA, and now AD  Lakers confirmed getting AD and KD with LeBron   Then Lakers get Kawhi too  "
&gt;The uniforms are generic and ugly.    &gt;This is why Kevin Durant left.  
I don't even want to begin to list the things I'd do to get Kevin Durant on the Knicks 
"I don't see why the Lakers would trade for Kawhi this summer, when he is a free agent next summer. Ball, Ingram, Hart, and Kuzma is a good set of young role players that can carry as Lebron gets older.   Why sacrifice that when you can sign him next summer? And if you can't get him, then go after Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving, etc. "
"Kevin Durant will join the Sixers next year, after the Warriors lose to the Lakers and the Sixers lose to the Celtics."
"Top ten players in the East:  1) Giannis Antetokounmpo  2) Kyrie Irving 3) Joel Embiid  4) Ben Simmons 5) John Wall 6) Kemba Walker 7) Kristaps Porzingis 8) Bradley Beal 9) Gordon Hayward 10) Kevin Love  Top ten players in the West:  1) LeBron James 2) Kevin Durant 3) James Harden 4) Russell Westbrook 5) Stephen Curry 6) Anthony Davis 7) Kawhi Leonard 8) Karl-Anthony Towns 9) Jimmy Butler 10) DeMarcus Cousins  That’s a pretty big difference, all the way down the West is better than the East."
"I never understood it: I always liked Lebron, his teams never had any rivalry with the Lakers yet during the Heat era lot of dumb Lakers fans hated him so much.   I hated Kevin Durant for OKC destroying the Lakers for a few years."
"I love Kyrie, I think he's the best isolation scorer in the NBA (except maybe Durant). I just think that the defense Kawhi brings is so valuable and I've always been pretty low on Cavs Kevin Love. "
i called it   here = https://np.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/8u2lpj/milwaukee_bucks_10_potential_veteran_minimum_nba/e1c3nd5/  got Lebron James and Lance stephenson right though got Kevin Durant wrong 
So much success in 10 years the thunder have had on their roster  Kevin Durant  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Victor Oladipo  Paul George  Carmelo Anthony 
[Kevin Durant] My next chapter desu
"**NARRATIVES**  2007 - LeBron cements himself as one of the greatest, being the best player in that Finals at age 22. Tim Duncan losing hurts his greatest PF of all time status.  2011 - LeBron winning a ring was expected, but removes the narrative that LeBron is a choker. Dirk again loses in the Finals, probably finishing his career without a championship. As LeBron played worse than D-Wade, D-Wade would probably end up winning Finals MVP which would hurt LeBron's GOAT status.  2012 - Kevin Durant is now discussed as the best player in the league? LeBron, D-Wade, and Bosh are still healthy and in their prime at this time. In real life 2012 Kevin Durant played amazing, it was James Harden who played horrible in the Finals. Narrative of Kevin Durant and Westbrook ""carrying"" their squad past the Heatles.  2013 - Tim Duncan gets his revenge with their revamped motion offense that won them the chip in 2014 in the real time line and almost 2013 as well. First back to back Finals losses for LeBron James. Hurts his legacy on GOAT status.  2014 - LeBron is now 2-1 vs Tim Duncan in the Finals. Don't think Duncan would be considered GOAT PF as he finishes his career with only 3 rings. LeBron in this alternate timeline ties the real LeBron with a total of 3 rings.  2015 - First back to back championships for LeBron as he leads his team without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love vs the upcoming Warriors. LeBron nearly approaches GOAT status at this point, winning a chip without his two best players, something Michael Jordan hasn't done.  2016 - Actually expected as they faced a 73 win Warriors team. Doesn't hurt LeBron's legacy and can arguably help his case for GOAT, as he took the ""greatest team of all time"" to a seven game series.  2017 - ""The greatest team of all time"" upgraded themselves with Kevin Durant -\_- But LeBron at this point earns himself the title of GOAT as he defeats the Warriors with Kevin Durant in 5 games. Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry have their legacies ruined.  2018 - LeBron thought 5 games was too merciful and to crush all the doubters (Skip Bayless), LeBron sweeps the Warriors this time around in 4 games. LeBron even handicapped himself by sending Kyrie Irving to Boston. The Warriors roster will definitely be gutted, with the core of Draymond, Klay, Curry, and Durant all having their legacies permanently stained and going their separate ways.  At this point in time LeBron is 6-3 in the Finals with 5(6) Finals MVP's. D-Wade wins it in 2011.  **FOR G.O.A.T**  6 Championships  5 Finals MVPs  9 Finals Appearaces  Sweeping Spurs Big 3 at age 22  Beats 2015 Warriors without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love  Beats upgraded Warriors with Kevin Durant in 5 games  Sweeps 2018 Warriors without Kyrie Irving  **AGAINST G.O.A.T**  D-Wade ""carried LeBron in 2011"", as D-Wade won Finals MVP  LeBron lost in 2012 to a young Thunder team while LeBron, Wade, and Bosh were healthy and in their prime  Lost again in 2013 to the Spurs, as LeBron lost back to back Finals which never happened to Michael Jeffery Jordan.  Losing in 2016 puts LeBron at a total of 3 Finals losses, where Michael Jordan is 6-0.  **CONCLUSION**  LeBron would definitely be the GOAT in this alternate timeline."
Que that Kevin Durant loyalty tweet 
"Fuc them the only people that wouldn't be happy for us are our enemies, the same ones that we're talking shit about us as soon as we stopped winning and shitting all over kobe.     Edit: added ""are"" instead of ""is"" remember your grammar kids! Oh and never ever do what kevin durant did! "
You forgot that he got the Spiderman Meme wrong. It's not about dudes pointing fingers at each other because someone is at fault. It's that there's confusion because you're looking at a mirror image.   E.g. Brandon Ingram meeting Kevin Durant. 
1. Lebron 2. Kevin Durant 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. James Harden 5. Steph Curry 6. Anthony Davis 7. Russell Westbrook 8. Giannis  9. Chris Paul 10. Joel Embiid 11. Kyrie Irving 12. Damian Lillard 13. Paul George 14. Boogie Cousins 15. KAT 16. Klay Thompson 17. Demar Derozan 18. Jimmy Butler 19. LaMarcus Aldridge 20. John Wall  That's my list.
"Not sure if anyone has brought it up before, but isn’t it crazy to think that at one time James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook were all on the same team?! "
Why isn't this post receiving the same criticism Kevin Durant got for joining the warriors?
"I'm sorry, but just because Kevin Durant went to the Warriors and that pissed off the neckbeards of reddit, doesn't diminish who he is as a player and what he accomplished. Still a lot of story to be told on Kevin Durant."
"My Personal List, if everyone is healthy:  1) Lebron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Steph Curry  4) Kawhi Leonard  5) James Harden  6) Anthony Davis  7) Giannis  8) Russell Westbrook  9) Paul George  10) Chris Paul  11) Jimmy Butler  12) Damian Lilliard  13) Joel Embiid  14) Demarcus Cousins  15) Kyrie Irving  16) Kristaps Porzingis  17) John Wall  18) Demar Derozan  19) Victor Oladipo  20) Gordon Hayward  The Porzingis pick is going to be controversial but I've seen Gobert in some lists and Porzingis is statistically (i.e. BPG, BLK%, FG% allowed at rim) just as good as him as a rim protector. Add on 22 PPG scoring and I think, if we're talking fully healthy, he's top 20. I think by the time he comes back from his injury, he'll have worked on his conditioning and he'll cement his place on the list."
"Die Hard Gilas Pilipinas supporter and proud Filipino here. I'm just embarassed not only with how the brawl turned out, but our team is trash.  Our pro league (PBA) is a soft-ass league struggling with ticket sales because it's livestreamed on Youtube, the big money teams get away with one-sided trades and end up with lottery draft picks every year even after winning seasons.  Our college leagues mess up our young players' development because of schools keeping them for 5 years all in the name of being ""student athletes"" but actually some schools just make the US NCAA's amateurism requirements look like a joke because our college basketball programs are that desperate to one-up each other.  I flew all the way to Seville and followed the team at the FIBA World Championships in 2014 and it was a proud moment for us in the country, but ever since then I noticed how goddamn arrogant those people involved in the federation have become. Our coach is under the illusion that he's any good because he's been using the same, very predictable dribble-drive offense since 2013 and takes most of the credit for the wins and throws players under the bus for losses. He was briefly replaced by a real world-class coach for  FIBA Asia and the Olympic qualifiers only to end up coaching the school of the federation's biggest sponsor. Andray Blatche is far from the beast that he was at the FIBA Worlds in 2014 and here we are in 2018 and this brother thinks he's Kevin Durant.  You can talk shit about our basketball, bring up borderline racist shit about our height, and how much of a pussy our players are for ganging up on one guy on the floor then take a fucking selfie... but there's no need to bring up politics here (tangina, mga Pinoy din kayo eh). This is about 13 guys getting ejected in a game where 9 of them came from our team because they didn't know how to deal with getting their asses whooped before some sheila fucker started playing dirty. No excuses."
"Let's test that theory, are there any former Thunder fans who became Warriors fans because Kevin f'ing Durant joined the Warriors?"
"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden, Giannis, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Joel Embiid, Chris Paul, Kyrie Irving is a good start and probably in some order the top 11.   Then you have guys like Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Demarcus Cousins, Karl Anthony-Towns, Demar Derozan, Victor Oladipo, Kristaps Porzingis, Damian Lillard, John Wall, Nikola Jokic, Ben Simmons, Rudy Gobert, Gordon Hayward arguably top 20, it gets very debatable here.  That should give you a good base. "
"1. LEBRON JAMES  2. KEVIN DURANT  3. KAWHI LEONARD (HEALTHY)  4. ANTHONY DAVIS (HEALTHY)  5. STEPHEN CURRY  6. JAMES HARDEN  7. RUSSELL WESTBROOK  8. GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO  9. PAUL GEORGE  10. KYRIE IRVING  11. JOEL EMBIID  12. JIMMY BUTLER  13. DAMIAN LILLARD  14. CHRIS PAUL  15. KLAY THOMPSON  16. NIKOLA JOKIC  17. KARL ANTHONY TOWNS  18. DRAYMOND GREEN  19. BEN SIMMONS  20. KYLE LOWRY  You can argue rankings from 5 and beyond, but top 5 is solid."
"Because the team Kevin Durant played for OKC was actually winning the conference finals, then he tucked tail and joined the team that beat his- making it highly unlikely anyone could beat em.  Lebron is joining a team that is not established with multiple all stars and multiple championships.  If LA wins a title it's not going to be like KDs at all. "
"Because the Lakers with Lebron are essentially Cleveland Western Conference version, unless and until they get Kawhi or someone comparable. Even if they get Kawhi, they'd be at about Houston's level and not better than Golden State.  Kevin Durant joined a team with another MVP on it already, which forced the Warriors to lose nothing important.  "
"No one said he wasn’t a good guy. Lmao Kevin Durant has a ton of burners which is a fact. The joke was hilarious, stop being so butthurt"
"After this situation with DeMar and the Raptors, I think Kevin Durant is owed an apology.  Dude got drafted by Seattle and was told the team would stay there and build a new arena - NOPE.  Ends up in small market OKC.  Proceeds to watch the front office fuck up the James Harden situation.  Has difficulty getting along with Westbrook, but admires the comradery of the Warriors.    Makes a business decision in which he owns the leverage (1+1 deals) and gets to play where he wants and he's the bad guy?    "
"But Kevin Durant has no loyalty, right guys? ^(right guys?)"
So speculation that Kevin Durant gave up because he made a decision as a free agent VS year long saga of leaks from Kawhi's camp to kill his trade value and abandoning his teammates while they were still in the playoffs.  I'm sure your LeBron fandom makes you a very unbiased observer.
Kevin Durant : « I went from one of the loved to the most hated player in the league »  Kawhi Leonard : Hold my beer ...
"""*Look at all these awards I keep winning... do you love me now?*"" - Kevin Durant"
A: Isaiah Thomas  B: Kevin Durant 
"&gt;You don't see how weird it is to tell a person that makes soft drinks that he shouldn't work for Coca Cola?    LOL uhh.. are all y'all warriors fanboys got this much low IQ? How the fuck you can compare other businesses with sports? But then again, if my team was winning, i would be delusional too and not give a fuck about anything else, so i don't blame y'all  &gt;   Bottom line is,  Durant joined the 73 win team LeBron fucked in 2016, and then he used that team to finally win a series against Bron. The same 73 win team that Durant choked under pressure when him and OKC had a 3-1 lead in the WCF.. But he choked and lost, and then he joined them, just like that..   &gt;   I don't give a flying shit that he left OKC. Almost everyone knew he'll leave. But leaving for that team? And he ain't even just a ordinary player. Dude s the 2nd best player in the world, but i never seen someone that talented be so fucking insecure and weak minded, that he felt like joining the team that he choked and lost to, would be a great ""career move""..   &gt;   Of course he has 2 FMVPs and 2 rings now, as i said, he ain't no ordinary player. You put the 2nd best player in the world in a 73 win team who already had 3 other all stars, of course he'll shine and they'll be a dynasty.   &gt;  But the fact that Durant could stab Westbrook, his running mate for so long in the back and just join the same team they both battled against and was up 3-1, the fact that Durant could just lose all his self respect, and end up joining the enemy that he almost beat, that's the thing which fucking boggles my mind.  &gt;  It's quite unreal. Yes, NBA has no loyalty. Owners suck ass. Players should take control, and LeBron as everyone says, started that path for everyone else, but he didn't just join any team.. He joined the team that he fucking choked a 3-1 lead to.. He could have just joined any other team, or make his own superteam somewhere else, but he legit joined the only team that guarantees him a championship, even if he chokes again. He just wanted 0 risk, and 100% reward. That's ok if you are David West, but he ain't David West, he's Kevin Durant.  But too bad  &gt;  So don't even fucking try to compare that shit with anything else. Durant is still the 2nd best player in the world and an elite of the elite talent, but he's also a snake, a coward and weak minded insecure being, who'll never get the ""respect"" from almost anyone in the world. If Bron started to decline, KD had the chance to take the crown from him, but now, that snake will always be inferior to Bron. That's really sad, but it is what it is"
"&gt; You gotta risk getting your feelings hurt by your team or else you’ll be considered a snek.   Who is really considered a snek for leaving outside of Kawhi/Durant/LeBron during the first decision? It's not about a player leaving, it's about *how* they leave.   Kawhi forced his way out after an injury that couldn't be confirmed, didn't support his team in the playoffs because of 'rehab commitments' in NY (yet still found time to go to an LA Dodgers game), hid from spurs representatives any chance he could get, and tried to strong arm the Spurs (who by all accounts *are* a good organization) into trading him to LA.... but only talked to the spurs through his fucking uncle and the media lol.   LeBron decided he wasn't going to be able to get it done in Cleveland (which is fine... it's Cleveland lol). Instead of just announcing it a normal way, ~~he televised his decision live while in his home town of Akron, Ohio.~~ He announced he was going to leave to form a super team in south beach Miami would later have the ""not 1, not 2, not 3..."" speech. It was a bitch move at the time, however by going back to Cleveland (and fulfilling his promise) he erased that negative stigma that was attached to him.  Kevin Durant decided he was going to leave to join the team he couldn't beat (plus a team that was 73-9). He made one of the most uncompetitive moves I've ever seen in sports. If he goes to any other organization in the league (outside of CLE at the time), the blowback is minimal. He's thought of as a snake because instead of finding a way to beat the guys who knocked him out, he joined and called it 'the hardest road'.   I mean, who else has really been considered a snek for leaving? I don't think anyone really cares so long as you don't do it in a dickheaded or cowardly way. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯   Edit: Forgot the decision was Connecticut, not Akron. My b.  "
"These people think Kawhi cares that Redditors are speculating dumb shit because he hasn't publicly spoken. He's a young multi millionaire not named Kevin Durant, he doesn't care about all the shitty speculation about him. "
It's obviously Kevin Durant
Everyone understands the business of basketball on both sides the Problem with Kevin Durant was never that he left it was the circumstances in which he left. Same with Lebron anyone angry that Lebron left a team who refused to give him any help is stupid he had to right to do what he wanted.  Most people were angry with the fiasco which was ''The Decision''. And the anger with Kevin is that he ruined the power balance of the league going to a 73 win team that he only 2 months prior lost a 7 game series too.
Anonymous NBA player aka Kevin Durant
Nah man. You absolutely CANNOT be upset about anything in sports. This is serious god damn business. How dare you not support Kevin Durant making a power house into the greatest team ever.   **It’s his right to be happy!!**  But not yours. 
"Okay, Kevin Durant "
"LeBron is the O N L Y O N E in the last 5 years that's come here.  Kevin Durant ""wants to play in LA"". Didn't happen.  Cousins ""wants to play in LA"". Didn't happen.  Aldridge ""wants to play in LA"". Didn't happen.  And besides, what've the Kings done lately?"
&gt; I hate that KD ruined the NBA’s competitive balance  Damn shame we don't have parity like we had during   *checks notes*  * 2000s Lakers / Spurs dynasties  * 1990s Bulls dynasty  * 1980s Lakers / Celtics dynasties   Curse that Kevin Durant
"The Curious Case of Kevin Durant. No amount of justification will ever put that case to rest. Some will always hate him for that move, while others will begrudgingly admire the skills and the rings."
"""Its no fun when the rabbit has the gun"" - Kevin Durant 3:16"
"Westbrook actually means more to OKC than Demar does to the Raptors. Westbrook is a MVP in his prime who held the city down after the evil Kevin Durant joined up with the greatest team in history after being up 3-1 against them. Westbrook's value is also sky high, and you could only really trade him for other superstars (which wouldn't happen). If Westbrook got traded, OKC fans would cease to exist."
"I didn’t say you’ll be way better off. I’m saying you could be better off. I’m also saying every damn report a year ago was that Paul George wanted to be a Laker, and now he’s in OKC on a long term deal.  So you make the trade for Kawhi, hope the team finds some magic, and that he stays. Have some fucking confidence that your team and your city are good enough for an elite player to want to be there. Don’t trade Demar for Kawhi? Ok then who?? Tell me what fucking trades are out there? Demar for Kevin Durant? Demar for James Harden? How about for Anthony Davis and an unprotected first round pick? "

[Woj] Kevin Durant is suffering from dysentery. 
"That's not even true though. Looking at the last 4 seasons, the addition of Kevin Durant barely lowered Steph's played minutes per game, usage, or shot attempts per game. This year Steph was on par with unanimous MVP Steph, he just missed like 30 games."

"Kevin Durant is a very strong individual. He's also great with kids and respectfull to women, and doesn't use any burner accounts."
"Soo, hypothetically, Most NBA fans hate Kevin Durant based on what? Because most of r/nba hates Kevin Durant? Yes, my counter point to the original comment was I don’t see how OP could say as a matter of fact that most NBA fans hates KD without any basis. "
Nope. Here’s my personal top five:   1. Kevin durant   2. Number 35 on the warriors    3. @kevindurant   4. @KDTrey5   5. quiresultan
Uh you have Kevin durant lol
"Okay, so I completely disagree with this entire comment, since you clearly have your head so far up Lebron's ass. So let's look at only the objective points the OP has brought up.  &gt; Yeh, because he was like Prime Shaq right? Real game changer. Even Javale McGee was with the Warriors longer and did more for them than Bogut. Fuck off   Bogut was the most impactful defender in NBA according to every single defensive impact available. it's hilarious that you are trying to ignore this:  http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2016/sort/RPM/position/5  Rapm also gave Bogut a huge lead.   &gt; Don't lie. He wasn't injured, just old, and worn out, but he was still great.  Nope, he was most certainly injured:  https://www.si.com/nba/2016/06/16/warriors-andre-iguodala-back-injury-game-6-nba-finals    So he was worn out but was injured in the early stages of game 6?   &gt; Yeh, this also shows you are one big imbecile. Green hit Steven Adams in the nuts, in the WCF. That was a clear cut blow, and he should have been suspended right then and there, but the league for some reason gave him another chance, and let him go with a warning. But dude did almost the same thing to LeBron of all people now, so he was suspended. I mean, he got suspended because he can't keep his hands and legs off of people's nuts. That's not ""bullshit"" kiddo. Stop being so delusional  Wow. How biased can you be?   Green hit Adams in the nuts, that is a completely different scenario from the event that transpired.   Lebron James used his arm to drop Green, the contact is made as Green gets up while Lebron **STEPS OVER** Green.   There's no possible way that was flagrant.   &gt; Why? Because he sucked ass? He sucked ass in 2015 as well. Then in 2017 and 2018 Durant covered him. But stop with the injury excuses just because he got locked down by Kevin Love and got outplayed the entire series by Kyrie. FYI, Kyrie was the one that was coming off a damn surgery, remember? Have you ever even played sports IRL? Nobody in the post season stays 100% healthy. So just fuck off with the excuses.   Wow. Sucked ass coming from a Lebron fan whose favorite player had choked in multiple occasions.   But let's go over it. In 2015, Curry apparently sucked ass. Wow.   Curry averaged 26 with 58.5% TS with 5 rebounds and 6 assist. That is sucking ass? Whew.   This is far higher than Lebron's average efficiency in the finals, but yes, this is ""Sucking ass""    Here's the problem, if Curry wasn't injured, how come he couldn't speed past slow immobile bigs in 2016 but could blow past the same player every year after that? Curry was smoking Love and TT in every finals outside 2016. Are you seriously arguing Curry's injury wasn't impactful? He had zero quickness.  &gt; This literally makes ZERO sense. At the end of the day, GSW had their 2 time MVP, 3 all stars. Curry and Klay was playing, and Draymond only missed ONE game. Andre was good, Livingston was good, and everyone of them played. Again, Bogut wasn't prime Shaq. Don't use that as an excuse   'Let's ignore Green's suspension, Curry's injury, AI's injury, and Bogut's injury!""   Let's not use context at all!  So yes, let's completely ignore the part where GS had to give minutes to a below average center defender because Bogut was injured.  &gt; Yeh, that's called ""momentum"", it happens when a team is making a comeback. GSW should have known better, they made the same comeback against OKC in WCF, and OKC crumbled. Then Durant decided to join that team instead, now that's the softest and most cowardly move in NBA history. But it is what it is  Wow, just wow.   You think it was ""momentum"" that gave each player on the Cavs a huge efficiency boost as their best defenders went down? Just wow.   &gt; Um, last time i checked, that same team won 73 games.. Are you saying just because Draymond missed ONE game, and fucking Bogut was out in the end, they were not the 73 win team? That team literally would have been the greatest of all teams if they didn't lose to Bron in the finals that year. And now, kids like you saying ""oh no, they were not a 73 win team, because Andre fucking Bogut didn't play"" LOL fuck outa here kid. You are just embarrassing yourself  Impossible. The way Steph was injured, that team had zero chance at becoming their regular season form. Especially now that AI got injured, AND Bogut, the most impactful defender in the league, was injured.   &gt; That's not saying much, but you love context? Here's a fucking context for ya. Bron was shooting 50% and above from the field regardless, while carrying the whole fucking playmaking duties as well. So fuck your delusional ""context"".    Fun fact!   When AI or Green was on the floor, Lebron's efficiency was below league average.   Carrying the whole playmaking duties? Really? Kyrie was absolutely dominating the ball when Warrior's defense went out.   Kyrie held the ball just as much as Lebron and was even more dominant in isolation.   Some more context for OP, point differential shot down when Kyrie was sitting on the bench in the nba finals  &gt; No it wasn't. Dirk was a GOD that year, no doubt. His one and ONLY great season. But he was surrounded by great pieces as well. But the Heat team that Dallas faced in the finals, was just newly formed and had chemistry issues. The Heat's starting Center was Joel Anthony. That team basically had 3 great starters, and just a non existent garbage bench. So that 2011 title was certainly not better than the 2016 one, where a 73 win historic team was destroyed, and a 3-1 comeback was made as well. Too much unrealistic shit happened in 2016 that will never happen again. So it's not even close. Bron's 2016 title was far greater  So first, this user is now claiming that season was Dirk's ""one and ONLY great season"". According to him, he was surrounded by great pieces despite RAPM estimate putting them far weaker than the Heat.   You know what's really funny though? You refused to admit Lebron choked hard in 2011, wow.   Wow. Just wow.   &gt; That's literally not saying much, because a 73 win Warriors team was also a far greater team to face than the newly formed Heat team with no chemistry or identity. 2012 Heat was a totally different monster, LeBron realized he's LeBron, and everyone had chemistry by then. So that's different   Yeah try again. RAPM, the best stat in the world, had a stronger differential between Heat and Mavs vs Cavs and Warriors.   You are really taking things out of your ass.  &gt; Really? So you wrote 8-9 horse shit comments, and then ended with this? That's just sad. LeBron literally had the block of the year, and arguably the greatest block of all time, which kept the score TIED, and then Kyrie's shot was actually a meaningful winner, because that score was tied. LeBron was carrying the whole offense, as usual. Scoring, and especially playmaking. Kyrie was the point guard, but he doesn't know shit about playmaking.   This is really funny. Not only are you taking shots at Kyrie, who hit the most clutch shot of the year, and who was more efficient with the same volume, but you are completely forgetting the part where Lebron missed. almost. every. single. defensive coverage in the half court.   Green's highlight for that game:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxA35eWJ4Ms  Green dropped 30+ because Lebron had no clue how to guard.  &gt; Your username says Im pretty real, but instead it should say Im pretty fucking delusional. You are by far the worst type of bias, delusional, disrespectful and imbecile hater that i have ever seen on this sub. Congrats kid, you played yourself. Delete your account fool  This is awful lol.  You are nothing more than an avid Lebron stan attacking pure stats."
"Kevin Durant, that's 6"
&gt;people are getting good with photoshop nowadays imagine [this](https://www.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/12/05/golden-state-warriors-forward-kevin-durant..jpg)
"Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant has won the Muhammad Ali Sports Humanitarian Award, given annually to an athlete whose leadership ""has created a positive impact on their community through sports."" The award was handed out as part of the fourth annual Sports Humanitarian of the Year Awards in Los Angeles. The awards were presented by ESPN and sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Kevin Durant won the Humanitarian Award for creating a positive impact on his community through sports.   Just over a month after leading the Warriors to their second straight NBA title, Finals MVP Durant was saluted for his off-the-court efforts. In 2012, while with the Oklahoma City Thunder, he started the Kevin Durant Charity Foundation, which aims to ""enrich the lives of at-risk youth from low-income backgrounds through educational, athletic, and social programs."" Earlier this year, he committed $10 million to a local chapter of College Track, a program that helps disadvantaged students attend college, in the Maryland town in which he grew up. Additionally, Durant donated $1 million to tornado victims in Oklahoma in 2013, and he has built basketball courts throughout the world for low-income youth.  Doug Baldwin of the Seattle Seahawks, John Cena of the WWE and J.J. Watt of the Houston Texans were the other finalists for the Ali award. Also recognized Tuesday at The Novo at L.A. Live was the U.S. women's hockey team, which was named the Sports Humanitarian Team of the Year, given annually to a group ""that demonstrates how teamwork can create a significant impact on a community or cause."" Last year, the women's national team staged a two-week boycott of the IIHF World Championships as it sought improvements from USA Hockey in several areas, including wages. The sides ultimately reached a new contract, one that improved annual compensation for players, including performance bonuses, and laid out ways that they can promote the women's game and assist development of its lower levels. The Anaheim Ducks, Boston Red Sox, and Major League Soccer's Chicago Fire were the other finalists.  Others winners Tuesday night were:   The WWE won the League Humanitarian Leadership Award for leveraging ""the power of its brand and platforms to help address important social issues worldwide, providing support on issues including diversity and inclusion, education, military and providing hope to critically ill children.""  Clothing company UNIQLO won the Corporate Community Impact Award for outfitting all the players in Street Soccer USA's sport-for-social-change leagues for homeless youth.  Multiple sports leagues and/or governing bodies -- including MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL, NHL, USTA, WNBA and WWE, as well as the Women's Sports Foundation -- nominated athletes, teams and corporations who are transforming lives and uplifting communities. The finalists, chosen by an independent panel, were named last month.  Net proceeds from the awards benefited the Stuart Scott Memorial Cancer Research Fund at the V Foundation. ESPN also gave a total of $1 million to the charities of the nominees and winners.  Some $1.8 million will be distributed to the community as a result of the awards."
"Kevin Durant wins 2 more with Golden State to complete the Four-Peat.   KD then goes to the Lakers to win one with LeBron who is quoted as saying ""playoffs are such a waste of my time, I'm trying to make 2 Billion dollars by the end of the year.""  In 2021 KD opts out of the Universal Contract (currently known as a 1 year contract plus 1 year player option), and moves to the newly created Seattle Supersonics. He wins two chips for the team that drafted him.   A million Redditors cry out as they die from the mental whiplash. "
"By all accounts, Kevin Durant is a good dude.  Still a bitch though. But a good dude"
At least you're not Kevin Durant 
"josh ""kevin durant"" hart"
"I think you can put another more traditional big in and have better defense .   How about    Jordan Lebron james Kevin durant Anthony davis  Olajuwon/ Shaq   You get similar amount of 3pt shooting, a truly long lineup. Better shot blocking. Your 3 pt shooting maybe a lil low but at that point just switch in steph curry."
It’s true. Kevin Durant delivered. Bron got outplayed by Jason Terry lol. 
"""Durant from three... IT'S GOOD! KEVIN DURANT FROM DOWNTOWN"""
"And so what should he do? Let Westbrook and PG walk, and start tanking like the other 10+ teams who are still stuck in a cycle of mediocrity? OKC is in the best position possible considering Kevin Durant left them for GSW. You seriously need to stop being an arm chair GM lol"
Kevin Durant is probably the worst person I’ve ever witnessed.

"Listen to the Hoop Collective podcast with KD and Beasley together, talking about how they came up together as chiodhood friends and teammates.   For me, the comparison hung in the air the whole time: Beasley with every bit the talent and physical gift that KD got, but apparently only a fraction of the work ethic and determination.   Which is not necessarily something to harp on too hard. It sounded like he never had anyone to guide him as much as KD's mom did.   And, even if he has grossly underachieved, relative to his basketball potential, he has earned $30M in his career so far. He's not even 30. So it's pretty silly to call him a failure, unless he ends up squandering his fortune.  https://player.fm/series/the-hoop-collective-1203972/dinner-with-kevin-durant-and-michael-beasley"
because the nba is has been fucking trash for 2 years becuase kevin durant is a pussy
"...i don't see you're comprehending how your logic fails. Yes the score starts at 0 but Kevin Durant is still Kevin Durant and Lance Stevenson is Lance Stevenson. One of them has the skill level to be a 2x finals mvp, mvp, etc the other does not. Your logic makes it sound like each game is up for grabs and everyone is equally skilled. "

No. Kevin Durant did.
Don't take this out of context. Kevin Durant just brings more to the table as player than stephen curry.

How many damn burner accounts Kevin Durant has...And there is only one KD. His name is Kris Dunn.  
Most would hope Kevin Durant stayed at OKC and never won a ring because they don’t give a damn about Kevin Durant. 
Doesn't Kevin Durant rebalance the equation though?
"&gt;The Lakers were a great defensive team last year, despite having nothing to play for  Great is an overstatement. They were above average, but not top 10.   They added LeBron, who hasn't been very good defensively since the year they won the finals, Lance and rondo who aren't great on that end (especially rondo) and javale who was unplayable against Houston because of his defense. He was playable against Cleveland because that team just wasn't very good.  &gt;Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett didn't play together until the year they won the championship.  Ray Allen, KG, pierce and rondo were easily better individually and cohesively than literally anyone on this roster not called LeBron.  &gt;Curry can guard basically anyone other than Lebron?? You think Curry is fine guarding Ingram or Kuzma???  Like for one possession on a switch? Yeah that's not bad with the help defense around him. It would only happen like two or three possessions a game GS usually doesn't switch with Curry they do a weird switch in the PnR but then back switch off ball and get curry away it's clever.   The vast majority of the time he'd guard Lonzo, which he is fine for.  &gt;And curry cannot defend lonzo fine. lonzo can easily use his speed to blow by him and he will torch curry on pick n rolls.  Completely disagree here. Curry will hold up perfectly fine against Lonzo defensively, especially with how well that team defends as a unit.  &gt;Also I don't agree the warriors are better defensively  I mean they literally are but ok.   What's your reasoning for this? In the playoffs the warriors are just incredible defensively when they all lock in. Especially when Dray and Iggy turned it up once the regular season was over.  &gt;The Lakers dont have anyone like that who will be getting many minutes  Lol yes they do. Javale and Kuzma would get torched on switches vs Curry or Durant. You seem to have this notion that Kuzma is a good defender...he's bad. Like not at all good.  &gt;The death lineup is not what it used to be with Draymond and Iggy not shooting 3 as well and Iggy getting older  Once the playoffs started it was right back to being incredible. Houston had no answer for it and got torched in those minutes til Iggy went down.  &gt;The only one way players on the lakers are KCP, solid 3 and D, and Mo Wagner, 7ft 3 point shooter.   I would say KCP is one of the few two way players. He's passable on both ends. Solid 1/2 defender and he won't hurt you offensively, tho he won't wow you either.   Kuzma is one way, javale is one way especially against golden state, imo rondo is one way he just isn't a good defender anymore, Wagner is one way, Lance is one way (he hurts spacing with shooting splits of 42/28/66, and he makes *a lot* of bone headed passes)."
"You're missing the point. Him playing PF in-game doesn't matter. He didn't have to make a roster change. He starts at the 3 every game. Lebron joining the Celtics would have to either make a roster change for his SF spot or start at the 4 every game, going out of his way to fit in, unlike KD. Bottom line is the Lebron/Celtics argument when referring to Kevin Durant is illogical. Kevin Durant nor the Warriors had to make a single change roster-wise unlike what the Celtics would've had to do to get Lebron on their roster."
"I think Embiid is a very realistic dark horse for MVP next season, especially considering the case against other notable candidates.  Hear me out... voter fatigue and a general aversion towards superteams are very real and determining factors when it comes to the MVP voting. As a result, players such as James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, and Kevin Durant can likely expect diminished support amongst MVP voters in the immediate future.  An equally significant factor to winning the MVP award – barring some sort of statistical anomaly, such as averaging a triple-double – is team success, and very rarely does the MVP come from a team that finishes with &lt; 50 wins or outside the Top 4 teams in their respective conference. Subsequently, the case for players such as Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard, and Karl-Anthony Towns becomes somewhat less conceivable for the 2018-19 season.  Therefore, the likeliest candidates remaining are LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, and Joel Embiid... I think it’s a given that LeBron will be the consensus preseason favorite to win his 5th MVP award, but if the Lakers fail to live up to their already lofty expectations and Kawhi/Kyrie are unable to overcome lingering injury concerns, I believe it is completely within the realm of possibility that a healthy Joel Embiid averages 25 ppg and 12 reb while anchoring Philly’s defense and leading the Sixers to the 2-seed in the Eastern Conference... Thus, rendering him the 2018-19 NBA Most Valuable Player.  (For what it’s worth, my second dark horse candidate would be Donovan Mitchell. I think it’s very possible that Utah could nab the 3-seed in the West while Mitchell builds upon his incredibly impressive 2018 playoff run, in which he averaged 24 ppg 6 reb 4 ast.)"
"Surprised there’s not more love for #3  I think Embiid is a very realistic dark horse for MVP next season, especially considering the case against other notable candidates.  Hear me out... voter fatigue, recency bias, and general aversion towards superteams are all very real and determining factors when it comes to the MVP voting.

Why the Warriors will be 2018-2019 NBA Champions  1. Steph Curry 2. Klay Thompson 3. Kevin Durant 4. Draymond Green 5. DeMarcus Cousins 
"I would 100% take prime Kevin Durant over Kobe anyday, because if you throw Durant onto that Lakers team with Shaq, that's a guaranteed 3 titles, maybe more because Durant's ego wouldn't have gotten in the way as much as Kobe's. That being said, Kobe 100% is greater all time, period. Unless Durant leaves the Warriors and joins a shit team, winning them at least two rings. "
Kevin Durant
Clearly 37 year old Ray Allen = Not Perkins. I never said he was bad but that he's clearly not Kevin Durant in his Prime. Did Ray Allen win MVP in his late 30's? Don't make up fake bullshit arguments I didn't make
"Yeah any GM who doesn't try their hardest to improve their team gets fired. Imagine Meyers holds a press conference: ""I'm sorry but our team is too good. Because of the crybaby fans of other teams I'm opting not to sign Kevin Durant."""
"I'm going all-Warriors for this one, even though it might not be the *best* fastbreak lineup, it'd be one of the most entertaining  PG: Steph Curry  SG: Mitch Richmond  SF: Chris Mullin  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Draymond Green  you let Draymond grab the rebound and he's coming down able to hit some of the greatest spot-up shooters in the game, or hit any one of those guys on a cut"
"Yo MyLeague sucks, but you’re talking about MyGM, which sucks even more.  The reason MyLeague sucks is because it’s way too predictable. They tell you everyone’s potential, everyone hits their prime from 25-27, and while you can adjust sliders, they only change what kind of predictability you want (do you want your prospects to go up 3 overall every year, or a different number?)  The free agency is abyssmal. You can put contract negotation difficulty up to 100 and still sign Kevin Durant every offseason if you have the space. The salary negotations are idiotic. They either decline your offer from the jump (allowing you to re-offer slightly more until they accept) until you offer them just enough, and then it’s like a 95% chance they sign with you. There is no such thing as convincing veterans to play for less money and no need to overpay young players with high potential.  The logic behind MyLeague makes it unplayable. The only reason people think it’s a decent mode in any shape or form is because the other game modes are so much worse."
"Kawhi Leonard, oh wait.  Isaiah Thomas, oh wait.  Kevin Durant, oh wait.  Craig Sager, oh wait."
Kevin Durant 
By all means tell me which of these all stars from 2010 you would put below Wade and Bosh and how they're not in the middle.   You're the only one blatantly distorting facts for the convenience of your bandwagon.   Lebron James  Kevin Durant  Kobe Bryant  Carmelo Anthony  Derek Rose  Dwight Howard  Kevin Garnett  Tim Duncan  Steve Nash  Dirk Nowitski  Paul Pierce  Allen Iverson  Amare Stoudamire  Deron Williams  Pau Gasol  Jason Kidd  Chris Paul
"Are you acting like he didn't get criticized for this move? His former teammates still won't speak to him because of it, and Celtics fans still hate him despite his major contributions to the championship a few years before.   Aside from that, I like how you completely ignore the fact that Allen was *37 years old* at the time, not even close to being in his prime. Are you saying 37 year old Ray Allen is somehow comparable to peak Kevin Durant? Why don't you make this post about Barkley joining the Rockets, that's a hell of a lot more similar.   You also ignore the fact that the Celtics had been publicly shopping him around in trades for a couple seasons, which makes the decision to leave on his own a lot more understandable."
Which of these would you put below Dwayne Wade in 2010? Because I'd put him smack dab in the middle.  Lebron James  Kevin Durant  Kobe Bryant  Carmelo Anthony  Derek Rose  Dwight Howard  Kevin Garnett  Tim Duncan  Steve Nash  Dirk Nowitski  Paul Pierce  Allen Iverson  Amare Stoudamire  Deron Williams  Pau Gasol  Jason Kidd  Chris Paul   
"https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/07/08/kevin-durant-goes-hollywood-movie-role-shows-a-different-side/  &gt; Q: How closely do you follow his career these days? And what do you think of his move to the Warriors?  &gt; Gray: I will forever be a huge basketball fan, especially with my family being such big fans as well. I associate Christmas more with the teams that played each year than what gifts I received.  &gt; I’ve been rooting for KD since the film and was hoping he could bring the Thunder their first title in OKC. He came up pretty close a few times. The other day when the news dropped, I got a bunch of hilarious tweets (the memes made from the movie are pretty funny too) about “Thunderstruck” and his decision.  &gt; I understand it’s hard for OKC fans, seeing how impassioned and supportive they were. That entire city loves and seemingly worshiped KD and the Thunder players. But I think he has given them so much and is really searching for that ring.  &gt; And how many players, if given the opportunity to play for the Warriors (best NBA record all-time) with the best shooting backcourt in the NBA (which will open up way more shots for KD) would say no to that?  "
Why would they even bother trying that? It's like the Grizzlies trying to sign Kevin Durant

"What makes the 2011 Dallas run so unique as opposed to other championships? Just take a look at the roster they had. Outside of Dirk Nowitzki and Tyson Chandler, they had a bunch of role or below average players on their roster. I know they also had Jason Kidd and Jason Terry, but both were at the end of their careers (I know J.E.T is still somehow in the league). No disrespect to Barrea or Shawn “Ugliest Free Throw” Marion, but who are we kidding? You don’t think you’d win a championship with a team of DeShawn Stevenson, Corey Brewer, Brian Cardinal, Steve Novak, Ian Mahinmi, and Alexis Ajinca on your roster.  The Dallas Mavericks 2011 team was a team that played so well with each other and the cards played out perfectly. This wasn’t a KD, Klay, Dray, and Curry or LBJ, Wade, Bosh superstar team, no. This was a team that won 57 games and *ran* through the Lakers lead by Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Derek Fisher, Lamar Odom, and Metta World Peace. A team that, just a year prior, had won the championship. Ran through an Okhlahoma city team lead by Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Kevin Durant, Prime Kendrick Perkins, James Harden, and Thabo Sefalosha. And, to top it all off, ran through a Miami team of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh that was said to be a ‘superteam’. I remember it like it was yesterday, where even when the Mavericks were down 15-20 with 5 minutes left in the quarter, they managed to make a comeback.  A team that had just won its first championship and what does Cuban decide to do? He let’s go of Barrea, Chandler, and signed the headcase that is Lamar Odom who didn’t even want to play for Dallas. And ever since that year, the Mavericks FO has been surrounding Dirk with worse and worse talent, until recently, right as he’s about to retire…"
"It’s hilarious this idea that the fans despise the warriors for doing what’s necessary to win. The warriors did what everyone should’ve and tried to go after Kd . They developed   Steph , Klay , draymond  as well. What we aren’t happy with is Kevin Durant taking the easy way out "
"Agree with this.   1/2. Lebron/Curry 1/2. Lebron/Curry 3. Anthony Davis 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antekoumpo  Pretty definitive Top 6. I won’t put Kawhi there after this past season, but he would also be in this group if he returns to pre-injury form.  Ignoring Kawhi, I would probably go Butler 7th, Westbrook 8th, but I could see the case for Chris Paul over him. "
Lebron deserves a statue in cleveland more than any basketball player deserves a statue anywhere. Except maybe kevin durant in a serpentarium
"Kevin Durant.  Snake fits on any team.  One of the best scorers of all time.  Elite from 3, midrange, at the rim, in the post.   Top 5 in assists per game for a non-PG.  Top 5 in blocks.  Can switch onto PG and Centers.   Most versatile player in the league. PERIOD.  Also has proven to be an assassin scorer and clutch shot maker on the biggest stage."
"1. Anthony Davis (I think he is almost there now, if the Pelicans can replicate the success of late last year this won't be a fringe opinion) 2. James Harden 3. Kevin Durant (but in decline of course at this point) 4. Joel Embiid 5. Giannis  I think Embiid will play Giannis due to better defense and a better PG to feed him shots. I won't rank Kawhi until we see him play again at an elite level, he definitely makes the top 5 if he is great this year. Ben Simmons has a chance of making the cut too if he gets a halfway decent jumpshot.  I just don't see LeBron being top 5 in 3 years personally, obviously I could be wrong. I still think he will be all-nba level though, just on a lower team. I think Curry will be in decline by this point enough that he won't be top 5 either. Westbrook was the hardest to leave off for me, I definitely think he will still be in the mix for top 5 in 3 years."
"Yeah, why would he want to play with Lebron when he can team up in Brooklyn with Butler, who will do all the dirty work and not care if Kyrie takes over the offense, and Kevin Durant, who will agree with Kyrie on his conspiracy theories. "
"&gt;For me, a Celtics fan, I would definitely want Kevin Durant the most. His versatility, defense, scoring prowess would fit very well with out team.  Also, taking him off of Golden State would be a twofer.  "
Kevin Durant gilded this comment lmao 
Kevin Durant is literally the only all-star that has left him  also did you forget what happened with John Wall this season?
My buddy &amp; I had a massive argument one day over Greg Oden vs. Kevin Durant before the 2007 draft. He was 100% that Greg Oden would be a HOF and would pick him #1 ten out of ten times. I was on the Durant side of the fence thinking Oden already looked 35 and had only a few years left in him.   I remind him of that a lot.

Yeah he's got money already, but -30 million between then and 2020 is a weird way to describe securing the bag"
"Let's destroy this awful argument;)  &gt; Point to where I said Kobe got open looks. I said Shaq was the center of attention and priority one for the defense, and teams were built around stopping him.  But I can give you heaps and heaps of film where teams were fixated on trying to stop Kobe. What game plan are you talking about? Like I said, It's always one playing hard double against Shaq; this has always been the case.  Almost every playoff highlight of Kobe's features heavy dosage of horrible spacing and tons of defensive fixation. To a point where you can watch two-three players follow Kobe in a possession.  &gt; That's retarded. Yes, Shaq was not an efficiency juggernaut like a Curry or a LeBron, grinding big man ball is less efficient than guard or wing play, but he was a fucking dominant force and it's absurd to suggest Kobe was hurt by playing next to him just cuz he clogged the paint.  Is Cuz a word? lol  Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? Shaq is one of the least portable superstars ever. He has no ability to move without the ball and dominates only one portion of the floor. Dude, are you suggesting he's actually portable compared to Kobe? Are you actually trolling? Wait, you know what's even more hilarious? Shaq was relatively average in PnR as well lol.  So, outside Shaq's individual brilliance, how come most players saw stagnation, even inefficiency when coupled with Shaq?  That stuff is why portability matters. Unless Shaq is paired with a Ray Allen or Kevin Durant he is going to obstruct the imprint his wing will have...an alternative way to conceptualizehis stiffing of the offense blunts the otherwise (presumably) additive effect of talent stacking (as indicated by whatever +/- metric you are using). We see it over, and over, and over again. There is too much overlap in the areas of primary expertise and not enough off-ball elevation that can't be found at the exact same level in a role player. When paired with O'Neal Kobe/Flash/Penny's playmaking is de-prioritized in favor of Shaq's post-passing and, because they aren't spot up giants (Penny being the best of the three) their giant step back in productivity does not correspond to a rise in efficiency. Because of where he sets up defenses can still trap whenever the wing and Shaq are on opposite sides and not have to worry about Shaq fading to the far corner for an open jumper. When they penetrate he's a great big body to have as an off-ball finisher but he isn't special or GOAT-tier in this regard...guys like Deandre, Tyson, and pre-injury Bynum provide just as much if not more synergy when used as a P&amp;R partner and off-ball finisher (heck, just watch one of the 1st 35 games of the 2008 Laker season for confirmation...the league wasn't ready for it – he rocked a 127 ORTG off Kobe lobs and dumps).     &gt; The 90s East was not horrible like the 00s East or 10s East. I also never said it was more ""impressive"", I brought up Shaq turning 3 teams into championship contenders to counter your bullshit claim Kobe is more ""portable"" and ""there's no discussion"".  LOL no.   Magic's route to the finals featured total opposition SRS of around  6.6. Their best competition was the decent Pacers. They played a bad Celtics team and a Bulls team that got a rusty MJ. He was also given some incredible supporting cast as well.  Lakers is clearly a given; one of the most dominant players ever while wearing this uniform.   Heat? Shaq was given such wide open looks from wade, was missing most clutch situations (Missed around 40% of all close games in the playoffs that year), AND was incapable of playing a fundamentally sound defense. Dude, this is a clear example OF HIS LACK OF PORTABILITY.    Probably a good time to mention considering you seem to lack the actual knowledge to have a decent conversation:    Portability does not mean, at all, that one player is better than another; KD is probably the most portable player I have ever seen and is so much more portable than a guy like Lebron James. Is KD better than Lebron tho? Fuck no.   It's just another piece to the puzzle.   &gt; Literally cannot literally. Really struggling with words, at least when they're not analytics buzzwords.  Sure, so what does cuz mean? lol  &gt; Never denied Shaq's defense, just not letting you gloss over Kobe being a sub-50% true shooter in 02.  Once again. when adjusting for positional average efficiency, their difference is around 3%. Not really that huge of a difference. LOL.    &gt; You're actually the one fixating on efficiency, citing tons of modern analytics about an era before analytics dictated strategy. I imagine you think Barkley was better than Shaq?  .......I used efficiency to highlight how Shaq actually deflated many of his teammates' output. All data supports this, and efficiency is one of the easiest ways to prove it. How else should I prove it? LOL  When have I ever claimed this: ""citing tons of modern analytics about an era before analytics dictated strategy.""? Dude if you are unable to understand the most basic concept, why are we having this conversation? Positional TS is essentially average ts for each position and difference between a 2 and a 5 is almost always around 3%.  "
"Are those numbers lineup-adjusted? Are they performance-adjusted? Did IT’s replacement deliver a comparable performance? Did the guy IT was guarding have a significantly better performance in that time?  You’ve given me on/off numbers, and not even with a large sample size at that. Going by on/off splits alone, Giannis is the best player in the league. 2017 Westbrook is one of the best seasons of all time. Kevin Durant is actually a pretty average player. It means fuck all."
"Curry and Durant are insanely underrated, especially Curry. If you look at the advanced stats, just look at the number of players with a better season than Curry or Durant's peak to figure this out.  **PER**  * Players higher than Curry: Wilt Chamberlain, Lebron James, Michael Jordan * Players higher than Durant: Wilt Chamberlain, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, David Robinson, Shaquille O'neal, Russell Westbrook, Dwyane Wade, Tracy McGrady, Chris Paul, and Kareem Abdul Jabaar.  Curry Rank: 4th, Durant Rank: 13th  **TS%, &gt;20 PPG**  * Players higher than Curry: None * Players higher than Durant: Stephen Curry, Charles Barkley, Amare Stoudemire, Kevin McHale, Adrian Dantley  Curry Rank: 1st, Durant Rank: 6th  **WS/48**  * Players higher than Curry: Kareem Abdul Jabaar, Wilt Chamberlain, Lebron James, Michael Jordan * Players higher than Durant: Kareem Abdul Jabaar, Wilt Chamberlain, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, Al Cervi, David Robinson.

Curry Rank: 4th, Durant Rank: 15th  In addition to these stats, Curry has the 2nd highest +/- in NBA history in 2015-2016 (only behind 2015-2016 Draymond Green), but has the higher +/- per 48 minutes in NBA history for his 2016-2017 season.  RPM has only been around since 2013-2014, but Curry has the 2nd highest in that time in 2014-2015, behind only Lebron James' 2015-2016 season. Durant is the 12th player in terms of best RPM seasons.  It seems pretty clear that Curry is in that Top 3 group with Lebron/Jordan, while Durant is pretty safely in the Top 15 players going by the advanced stats. "
"sign Kevin Durant, problem solved"
"Likely All-Star Starters East: Kyrie Irving, Oladipo/Beal/Simmons/Wall, Kawhi, Giannis, Embiid  Likely All-Star Starters West: Stephen Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis  Let's say the captains are Giannis vs. KD with Giannis getting more votes, the draft may look something like this...  Giannis: LeBron  KD: Steph  Giannis: AD  KD: Kawhi  Giannis: Harden  KD: Embiid  Giannis: Kyrie  KD: Oladipo/Beal/Simmons/Wall  Thus, my very early all-star prediction is:  Steph, Oladipo, Kawhi, KD, Embiid  vs.  Kyrie, Harden, Giannis, LeBron, AD"

I also can't believe how you blatantly mis-represented my argument to make it look worse in the OP. Get some help bud.   close Team 1:  PG: Chris Paul SG: Klay Thompson SF: LeBron James PF: Larry Bird C: Hakeem Olajuwon  Team 2:  PG: Steve Nash SG: Michael Jordan SF: Kevin Durant PF: Shawn Marion C: Shaquille O'Neal  Everyone is in their prime."

Kevin Durant was real active this afternoon 
"i personally think this team can top the wins in a single season record and be favroties to win it all. then the following sweason one kevin "" KD The Serpent"" Durant joins them theyll be a lock to win"
"Melo didn't get the wind knocked out of him. He was just expecting a foul on a bone headed jab-step drive that amnesiac toddlers could predict coming. Durant, a skinny twig, had his arms wide out and Melo shouldered/elbowed KD in the gut. If anyone should have their wind knocked, its Kevin. Melo is a dumbass. I feel if he was ever so slightly less skilled, shorter, smaller, and strong, he would be in the Nick Young category of players.  I don't even think Melo with his exact skill-set at 6'4 would be in the league."

Kevin Durant and Twitter
Youre better off just letting Jrue Holiday handle a Kevin Durant or Paul George type at the 3 like they did last year.  https://on.nba.com/2AwUxMw  Randle can handle some more power based players like Giannis or LeBron(who are 4's) for stretches but you start asking him to cover 3's like Paul George or a Jimmy Butler and it's just pushing things too far. Jrue Holiday aint a great option but he's better than Randle as a primary on ball defender on those guys. Randle's switch D also low key showed steady decline after a super hot start to last season. And let's not even start talking about him trying to chase guys around like that off the ball through screens and off ball actions.   What putting Jrue Holiday on a big wing does is it induces a lot of post up type possessions where that wing tries to utilize his size advantage. These combined with the many mid range shots that come out of such mismatches aren't inherently efficient shots: if Kevin Durant is going to make an absurd amount of htem like he did last year in the playoffs you just have to live with it. It's a far better hill to die on than letting Durant just get to the rim repeatedly. 
"Kevin Durant, a backbone   (If this gets upvoted enough he might respond to me at 4am drunk off hard cider) "
"Yeah, here I'll show you some.

Lmfaooooooooo  Maybe the fact that he has Kevin durant and klay Thompson drawing attention
"Kevin ""Boromir"" Durant"
"Kevin Durant is insanely sensitive, I'd wager most of us share this sentiment, even Warriors fans"
Kevin Durant is a snake
"Kevin Durant is only two inches shorter than Kareem and can do infinitely more with a basketball in his hand. It seems with Kobe you either think he’s one of the very best or you think he’s overrated, so that argument won’t get us anywhere. Duncan’s greatness has a lot to do with being in a great system and playing for the best coach in history. Wilt’s numbers are diminished by the competition he played against. Lastly, I really don’t understand why KD and Kobe wouldn’t be above Hakeem. Hakeem was incredible but Kobe has 5 rings, 81 point game, and the Mamba mentality and again KD is comparable in size with the great big men but completely outclasses them in skill."
"Awesome work. Props for putting so much work into this.   One thing though, I think your DNN for 2014 might be mislabeled, as all of them have the predicted and actual as Kevin Durant, except for DNN which lists LeBron James but points to KD. Just wanted to point that out in case it's a mistake, but great work nonetheless! "
"As time continues forward more and more players will find their position on these rankings slip as new players come along. Larry Bird is an all time great, yet Kobe has five rings and is the closest thing to Jordan basketball has ever seen. Kevin Durant may not be a popular inclusion on these lists yet but when his career his done I think he will have earned his seat the table. That man is seven feet tall with guard like handles and a killer jump shot. I just feel like KD is a newer upgraded version of Bird. Shaq at his peak was the most dominant player in history. If Shaq’s attitude was better and he kept himself in shape I would say he would leapfrog Kareem into the top 5. Kareem’s longevity is what makes me put him over Shaq."
I’m actually Kevin Durant so doubt it

"I mean, if I could find the comment, I would certainly link it.  But it was in an Askreddit thread about celebrities - which gets posted every week and thus, is impossible to sort through.  If you don't like it that, how about a more credible KD story?  Unfortunately, ESPN/True Hoop deleted the article so we only have an ancient excerpt that was posted on a Blazer forum right before the 2007 Draft.  https://www.basketballforum.com/portland-trail-blazers/365213-nick-young-gators-nice-guys-durant-jerk.html   &gt;We start playing, and everyone's just goofing around, jacking up threes, until someone blocked one of KD's teammate's shots. To be fair, the guy who got his shot swatted sucked. They got super-intense, and the next time down the court, KD started posting me up all serious-like (I was the tallest player on my team, and therefore was the most 'qualified' to guard him). All of a sudden he spun towards the basket, but not before slamming his pointy elbow right in my eye. After dunking on us, he yelled 'don't talk s--- if you can't back it up' (that was heavily edited). I quipped, 'Isn't it past your curfew?' I'd like to say that I led my team to an upset victory, or even I j'ed a 3 in his face, but no. He single-handedly dominated us, literally with his teammates watching, as he would block our shots or steal the ball, and then drive into the lane and slam it home. (Scouts say he's skinny, but they wouldn't say that when they see him barreling toward you, as you debate for like half a millisecond if you're gonna take the charge before you run and duck. He's a big dude.) Needless to say, we didn't score another point. After that game, he didn't say anything, and just stormed off the court and out of the gym, probably feeling good about himself by dominating a bunch of out-of-shape frat guys. That's my personal experience with Kevin Durant.   Of course, we don't know what happened exactly - if it happened at all - but it does sort of line up with the passive-aggressive ""true personality"" that KD seems to be bragging about recently as opposed to the nice guy image generated by the NBA and ESPN.  "
"I truly wish I could.  There's so many Askreddit celebrity threads (like once a week) that it's almost impossible to find it again.  But here's leftovers of an ancient ESPN article (2007) that also showcased KD's passive-aggressiveness from back in the day.  I say ""leftovers"" because this article has now been deleted from ESPN (which tends to happen on news sites).  https://www.basketballforum.com/portland-trail-blazers/365213-nick-young-gators-nice-guys-durant-jerk.html  Thus, the only thing is an excerpt that was posted on a forum.  &gt;We start playing, and everyone's just goofing around, jacking up threes, until someone blocked one of KD's teammate's shots.

"I believe people have greater expectations of picks below #1 so in most cases the drafted player underachieves. There are of course exceptions but I think it hold true for the most part.  For example, you might think that the #2 pick should be pretty damn good and expect some MVPs. I mean, how much difference can there be between 1 and 2?  Since the lottery started in 1985 there has been one - Kevin Durant. In the history of the NBA (since 1955-1956) there have only been 5 MVPs drafted at number 2.  My expectations for #1 is MVP, #2-3 is First Team All-NBA, #4-5 is All-Star, #6-14 is career starter,  and after the lottery I'm hoping for a career role player at best.  Looking quickly at the draft history I think only about 50% of the top 5 picks and then maybe 50-75% of the remaining picks reach my expectations."

"Outside of Love, who disappeared in the playoffs, and Lebron, who did the Cavs have? The roster was a disaster. They still almost won game 1 of the Finals despite this. Saying the Cavs were more talented than the Celtics is flawed as well, because outside of LeBron the Celtics had the better players.  Kevin Durant is the more complete scorer, sure. But he can’t control a game the way LeBron can, and that’s just one reason why Bron is universally considered the best in the world."

But I can use misleading arguments too. You only won in 2017 against the Cavs because you added Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant 
It’s too bad Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team that had been to back-to-back championships to get his two rings and that respect is something that continues to allude him.  All his time  with Golden State has proven is that he’s less likable now than before.  
"I wouldn't play in a poker game where after losing one hand, one guy just gives all his chips to another guy and then says they're playing as a team now. I also wouldn't want to be the guy that gets given the chips.   Games are only fun when it's an even playing field. Kevin Durant disagrees with that fact. "
"&gt;Kevin Durant a better pure scorer than Kobe  By the end of his career, he'll be the better player than Kobe. Not only does he score more than Kobe, but he's more efficient as well. "
"&gt; Nobody said he’s better on most teams, who said that?  I know you didn't say that. I'm saying that. Almost every team in the league would be improved with the addition of Gobert. There are plenty of teams that would be hurt by the addition of Cousins. If you put him on the Rockets, they'd be worse because of the downgrade in defense, and he wouldn't make their offense more efficient; he'd just take shots away from CP3 and Harden. Same goes for a lot of teams.  &gt; Kevin Durant fits better on the warriors than Lebron would, but Lebron is definitely the better player  I agree with this, but the difference is that Lebron raises a team's floor more than Durant raises their ceiling, but Gobert raises a team's ceiling more than Cousins raises their floor."
Kevin Durant. Gonna go down as a top 5 all time player when it's all said and done.

At one point, our sources say they shook hands and the night went on without any more drama.   &gt;It could explain why Tristan and Draymond (and their reps) have been silent about the incident -- they don't want to wreck the peace they just made.   "
"Marcus Smart-Josh Richardson-Kevin Durant-PJ Tucker-Clint Capella  All switchable, a lot of hustle, several players capable of getting close to double digit rebounds, and 3 rim protectors. "

"I’d argue the most important skill for a modern big man to have is shooting nowadays. But it’s tough. See Deandre Ayton getting drafted higher than JJJ, and Mo Bamba   Nobody said he’s better on most teams, who said that?   The quote said   &gt;Cousins is a better basketball player..but Gobert is EASIER TO FIT ON MOST TEAMS  Which is something I’ve said countless times Throughout this argument by the way    Kevin Durant fits better on the warriors than Lebron would, but Lebron is definitely the better player"
He can do whatever he wants. Your argument is he shouldn't respond to inferiority because he's a basketball player and they're not. Are you an inferior human to Kevin Durant because he's good at basketball? Are you not worth his breath? 
"I'm not a Golden State fan and I genuinely enjoy Kevin Durant as a person and a player. I think watching GSW is purely iconic basketball in the making. I enjoy being able to look back and say that I was able to witness one of the historically great teams that have ever been assembled, no matter how long their run lasts. Sure, I would love for KD to chase another path (Knicks?) after 3-peating in the Bay and spawn more parity throughout the league, but the Warriors are too fun for me not to enjoy. "
"Phony Kevin has one MVP award, real Durant 0."

" While the actual details are still fuzzy and the real truth may never be revealed, there was reportedly an altercation between Tristan Thompson and Draymond Green in July, nearly two months after their on-court flareup during the NBA Finals.   Fox Sports 1's Jason McIntyre had been alluding to a fight in LA between NBA players for about two weeks and the initial report, revealing the names, came from the gossip and entertainment site Bossip.   The one thing everyone can agree on at this point is that Thompson and Green were both at a private after-ESPY's party hosted by LeBron James at Delilah restaurant in West Hollywood on July 18.  That's when things get distorted, as multiple outlets are sharing different accounts of the incident.   From McIntyre:   Jason McIntyre ✔ @jasonrmcintyre  · 31 Jul Replying to @jasonrmcintyre Finally this story is out there and I can say what I’ve heard about Tristan Thompson punching Draymond Green 2 weeks ago   Jason McIntyre ✔ @jasonrmcintyre Draymond went up to apologize to Tristan for what happened after G4 of the finals. TT said ‘nah man’ and Draymond tried again, ‘come on, I didn’t mean it’ and then WHAP, Tristan leveled him with a punch. Draymond didn’t go down.  1:18 PM - Jul 31, 2018 1,896 2,201 people are talking about this Twitter Ads info and privacy Bossip, perhaps exaggerating details for impact, said Thompson connected with a ""two-piece.""  Late Tuesday night, Marcus Thompson, who covers the Golden State Warriors for The Athletic, wrote his own account of the altercation, citing multiple sources with knowledge.    According to Thompson, the Cavaliers center attacked the Warriors bad boy ""out of nowhere,"" with one cited source labeling it a ""sucker punch"" and another calling it a ""face mush.""  ""To be honest, it wasn't really a punch. It was more like a shove.""   Apparently the two players were separated by James and Kevin Durant before a full altercation could happen, being reminded that they weren't on the streets or a basketball court and this was a private party at a nice West Hollywood establishment where that behavior shouldn't be tolerated.    From The Athletic:  ""The party continued with Green and Thompson co-existing without issue, laughing and partying the rest of the night. 'Man, that wasn't no fight,' one source said. 'It was much ado about nothing.'""  OK, great. Much ado about nothing. We can all move on, right? Apparently not.   A segment of Cavs fans seem overjoyed about Thompson's willingness to confront Green and are actually throwing him a parade, which is scheduled for Oct. 13 at 3:10 p.m.  The date coincided with Thompson's jersey number and the time is a play on the Cavs rallying from a 3-1 deficit in the 2016 NBA Finals.   And yes, because Cleveland fans are apparently obsessed with organizing silly parades for the most ridiculous reasons, there is an official event listing on Facebook, with some already announcing their plans to attend.    The July incident obviously boiled over from June. Thompson got ejected for his role in a minor on-court scuffle with Green at the end of the overtime period in Cleveland's Game 1 loss. It all started when Green taunted Thompson before the Cavs center shoved the ball in Green's face before being separated.   Then after Game 4, as players were greeting each other following the Warriors' sweep, Green refused to shake Thompson's hand, ending the series on a sour note. At Golden State's victory parade, Green explained why he didn't give Thompson any respect, saying ""Tristan, we ain't cut the same.""  The NBA regular season can't get here soon enough. "
Kevin Durant
" Answering this question comes with a lot of caveats and contextual explanations lol. Assuming the starting 5 is at the absolute peak of their powers and we are drafting for a season with the goal to go 82-0 and a championship played in today’s era of ball my starting five would be:  Lebron  MJ KG Klay  Kawhi   Now I know you are probably laughing at Klay and Kawhi but this is only for one season and they are at the absolute peak of their powers for that whole season. So think Kawhi 2015/2016 and Klay shooting 45% from 3, scoring 22ppg and playing great defense. I think Klay gets criminally underrated on defense and should be on the all defense team for the past two years at least.   My criteria for having a player considered for the team was the following: 1. Versatility on offense: need to be able to be at least a threat from the perimeter (not necessarily elite) and be able to create your own shot (again not elite just be able to get a bucket if you need two points with the shot clock running down) 2. Elite defender: need to be able to guard at least 3-4 positions, play great man on man defense, have good size (players like Steph or Kyrie were excluded because they could be bullied on defense if needed)  3. Good to great basketball IQ: not every player needs to be the most cerebral player of all time but they need to be smart enough that late in crunch time they won’t cost us by making a bad play  When choosing a player I tried to pick defenders that had the best mix of all those qualities. After I determined my individual player criteria there were certain things from a team perspective i felt were needed to assemble the greatest team of all time...  1. At least 2 all time play makers. This is where Lebron and MJ come in. Two of the best overall players and play makers of all time. As we have seen in the current NBA one star is not enough. You need at least two elite guys who can run the show. I don’t think much explanation is needed here as to why these two guys are the first two off the board. At their peak both played defensive player of the year type defense (MJ winning the award, Lebron runner up) and are two of the most efficient and athletic overall play makers of all time.  Runner ups: Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant  2. At least 2 great shooters. This is where Klay and Kawhi come in. Klay is maybe the best catch and shoot shooter of all time. His off ball movement is incredible and he does not need the ball to be effective which is important with a team of stars. He scored 60 points on 11 shots which is incredible. Now Kawhi is not the level of shooter as Klay but in his best season he shot 44%+ from beyond the arc and 87% from the line. That level of shooting with his absolutely elite perimeter defense will do. Both of these guys play incredible defense and in their best shooting years were close to all time shooters.  Runner ups: Kevin Durant, Larry Bird, Scottie Pippen I think with this potent of a team the extra play making KD brings over Klay and Kawhi is not worth more to the team than Klay and Kawhi’s great perimeter and man to man defense and especially not Klay’s ability to instantly get hot with minimal touches. With Bird I just don’t know if he would quite have the athleticism to be as elite in today’s NBA. On the flip side of Durant i don’t think Scottie’s more elite defense than Klay over compensates for Klays absolutely lights out shooting on a team where all the other guys are playing elite level defense.   3. A “big man” who can shoot, play perimeter defense if switched onto smaller guys, and who can shoot free throws. I wanted some size, rim protection and rebounding on the floor so that my team couldn’t be bullied completely or had the option to play some bully ball if needed. KG fits all of this criteria. He had a mid range jumper that was automatic, played all world defense and could hit free throws. Someone like Shaq could be a liability shooting 50% from the line and also not having a great outside shot. This one was tough and I think Duncan might be as good of a fit given being on an all time team. But KG just had the perfect combination of athleticism, basketball IQ, defensive prowess and offensive versatility that coincided with the today’s game. I just tried imagining Duncan getting caught in a switch on the perimeter against a guard and pictured KG doing much better.  Runner ups: Hakeem Olajuwon, Tim Duncan, Shaq, Bill Russell.  This team is definitely more skewed towards the newer generation of players (although I did consider players across multiple generations) partially because these are guys I am more familiar with so I can speak to their games better and also because this is under the assumption that we are playing in today’s NBA. "
"&gt; Not Just the Men, but the Women and Children Too  - Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant and there’s no debate. His shot is absolute butter and his handles are good yet not too fancy to almost be too much. 
I'm starting to think Kevin Durant has to be trolling everyone.
"Kevin Durant is a top-notch bloke, wouldn't drop in on the cunt."
"Yes, and the average height in the NFL is 6'2""  That's a HUGE difference bio-mechanically.   It's way harder to be ""built like a linebacker"" when you're Kevin Durant. "
Kevin Durant
"I mean, how bad do you have to mess up to not make positive plays when surrounded by one of the best 2-way guards in NBA history, the hands-down best shooter in NBA history, and for the past 2 years a player the caliber of Kevin Durant, one of the greatest pure-scorers (not to mention a hugely improved defender) in NBA history.   I'm not saying you are wrong, and I agree Draymond is a terrific glue-guy for a NBA championship caliber team, but do we really think he would have the 4th highest win percentage (if this is actually even the correct stat, seems wrong but idk tbh) if he was on another team? I just think his skills are useful, but are amplified hugely by the talent surrounding him."
"Anyone else remember the ""Kevin Durant is the nicest player in the NBA"" commercial? Can't wait for them to reboot it."
Kevin Durant trying his best to destroy his legacy and bond with the fans... 
Kevin Durant and emotional security
"Yea, too bad that Kevin Durant, the small forward on the *Golden State Warriors* never won a championship the last two seasons  I forgot who won the championship and FMVP the last two seasons, can you enlighten me on who did?"
lmao i'd be ecstatic to have kevin durant
"Before the all star game, a video of AD is leaked of him butt naked and getting slapped on the ass by prominent people in the NBA such as Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, LBJ, and Adam Silvers and him sticking his tongue out  This goes viral on IG, worldstar, Facebook, and MySpace and people are forced to see Anthony Davis getting his asses slapped by big black men in the locker rooms"
I love Kevin Durant and actually have his Warriors jersey.
"Just so we're on the same page, which scenario is more likely:  Trump takes a break from being the worst president, puts on a Kevin Durant suit, and fucks up the NBA to get back at LeBron James?  Or Kevin Durant takes a break from being a snake, puts on a Trump suit, and fucks up the World to get back at the haters on twitter? "
"Kevin Durant is a cool, real bro. I hope people get to know the real him. ~~- KD~~"
"Kevin Durant needs to find some new people to hang around that are better influences. His business manager, Rich Kleinman is an asshole, and his spiritual guide, Carl Lentz is a prosperity bible jackass asshole. If Durant would stop trying to emulate assholes, he would probably be more likable. "
"Kevin ""The American ~~Caboclo~~ Brazilian Kevin Durant"" Durant *  "
"Kevin ""The American Caboclo"" Durant *"
"&gt;one of the best super teams of all time  no team in nba history is better than a team with  stephen curry, kevin durant, klay thompson, draymond green all in their prime and an elite defender still in andre iguodala  didnt mention boogie b/c he hasnt played with them yet but yeah this is the most talented team in the history of non-international basketball. let's acknowledge that."
Kevin Durant: My next chapter... Being Bruno's backup in Houston
they offered wade 2 for 40 and he walked because they didnt offer it before they met with kevin durant of all people. boohoo. look at kawhi. even tim duncan almost left and kobe requested trade. dirk is like the only guy that actually wanted to be in one place the whole time and sacrificed to do it. curry is probably playing somewhere else at some point. not because he hates gs or anything but shit just changes over the years
"With Kevin Durant! 2016 and 2017 are completely different teams man. Kevin is literally the difference maker. There's no way, Cavs lose in 5 with them not having Durant. It likely would have been another game 7 series in 17 without Durant. "
"What's questionable, is why didn't Kevin Durant get called for hitting Lebron in the face in game 5 in 17. Replay clearly shows Kevins hand touching his face during the shot, ref looked at it and didn't call it. So I mean, that was literally worse than stephs."
"Well, OKC got trounced in those finals, and I'm skeptical that they would have won against Cleveland that year as well. Hell they lost three straight to the team that lost three straight. At least by the transitive property, it doesn't look good.   And I think it's important to note three things:   1) That Kevin Durant was the best player on those teams, and he was quite easily the second best player in the league until Curry went nuclear.   2) That we know the Heat were more concerned about Durant and Harden than Westbrook during those finals  3) That Westbrook was a *huge* reason they lost that WCF series. And the popular narrative during the KD-Westy years was that Westbrook held KD back. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who remembers that Fresh Prince gif and how accurate it was."
Curry also benefits from having another all time 3PT shooter next to him and Kevin Durant 
except they absolutely do play around with listed heights and weights....don’t you remember that whole “how tall is kevin durant” kerfuffle?
"Well, using your logic, Kevin Durant is the greatest player of all time. Best player on the best team ever. And ""better winner"", he had KD with him. Wilt had trash until he was old."
"Not according to Kevin Durant.  Edit: Durant's own words:  &gt; “[Kobe is] the greatest of all time. His skill is second to none. Him and MJ are neck and neck as far as skill,” Durant said. “Kobe is the top two best ever in just having skill, footwork, shooting the 3, shooting the pull-up, posting up, dunking on guys and ball handling. Kobe and Jordan are 1 and 1A."""
Look at the West now. Bron is out west plus the rockets/warriors/Jazz/spurs you tell me who Russ can play with and win a ring with if he couldn’t do it with a prime Kevin Durant 
The Morris twins are fucking assholes.    I like Kevin Durant. He's a good person. 
"Kevin Durant, i've never been a huge fan of snakes."
"Before Celtics fans comment, heres all the players that I believe are better than 1× Allstar, 0× everything else, Gordan Hayward. I will go from team to team, not rankings.  1. Kyrie Irving 2. Al Horford 3. Jayson Tatum 4. Kevin Love 5. Kristaps Porzingis 6. Andre Drummond 7. Blake Griffin 8. Kemba Walker 9. Joel Embiid 10. Ben Simmons 11. Victor Oladipo 12. John Wall 13. Bradley Beal 14. Kawhi Leonard 15. Kyle Lowry 16. Giannis Antetoukoumpo 17. Khris Middleton 18. Nikola Jokic 19. Steph Curry 20. Draymond Green 21. Kevin Durant 22. Klay Thompson 23. Demarcus Cousins 24. James Harden 25. Chris Paul 26. Clint Capela 27. Jimmy Butler 28. KAT 29. Mike Conley 30. Marc Gasol 31. Russell Westbrook 32. Paul George 33. Steven Adams 34. Lebron James 35. Brandon Ingram 36. Anthony Davis 37. Damian Lilliard 38. CJ McCollum 39. Devin Booker 40. Demar Derozan 41. LaMarcus Aldridge 42. Donovan Mitchell 43. Rudy Gobert  Thats 43 players. You dont have to agree with all of them, but theres no way that Hayward is better than 18 of these guys and claim ""top 25 player"".         "
Kevin Durant
Fuck Kevin Durant for being a big fat phony.
Kevin Durant saved the NBA.  
Bro these are not even bad shots for Kevin Durant 
"Fuck it I'm going nuclear.      Kevin Durant is clutch and should be applauded for joining a team that failed, and has brought them to success.  His star will shine brighter in GSW not only because he's the best basketball player on the team, but because he has triumphed through the adversity that was his former team.  His public image is tarnished only by haters whom he is right to publicly correct regardless of the means, because they know less and are fundamentally basketball illiterate.."
Okay so what's the argument for Melo being better than any of these 10 guys [I got from a random ranking](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2768443-ranking-the-top-50-players-in-the-2018-nba-playoffs#slide17):  * Lebron James * Kevin Durant * James Harden * Steph Curry * Russell Westbrook * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * KAT * Chris Paul
"I know the Warriors lineup is addressed in the OP, but it's ridiculous to think about  * Steph Curry * Klay Thompson * Kevin Durant * Draymond Green * **Wilt Chamberlain**  Beyond disgusting"
Kevin Durant is the greatest basketball player in the world.
"The fact that this gets so many replies says a lot.   Or maybe it doesnt.    Either way, fact is: Kevin Durant made a business decision with Andre Iguodala in 2015 to join the warriors. Iguodala was the first to break the good news on twitter (before KD even met with OKC). When Iguodala threatened to leave last offseason to get paid, guess who stepped up and gave him a part of his own salary? I dont care how much you all hate on this shit. Its just a theory for a reason. "
So... Kevin Durant
"Bruh don’t edit the best part! Thanks for the link, that was hilarious   &gt; **(3)** If Kevin Durant wins an NBA title for the NY Knicks, he will gain 11 rings. However, as seen above, Durant has -4 rings and if he were to remain at -4, then win for the Knicks, he will have 7 rings total. This number is subject to change based on Stugotz altering the ""-4"" current total as seen recently when Stugotz adjusted the number from 0 rings to -1 rings to -4 rings. Another interesting note is that Stugotz has also said, If the Warriors won a championship playing 3 on 5 Kevin Durant would have 1 ring. I am unsure if this means he would gain +1 ring, and therefore be down to -3 rings total, or whether it means if they win a championship 3 on 5, he would be at (positive)+1 rings total (thus winning 3 on 5 would give him 5 rings). Stugotz... wtf ya doing man. This KD shit is too confusing to keep track of. I have had to edit this 4 times now."
Kevin Durant
"&gt; You could say the same those same exact things about Kevin Durant when he first got to Golden State and wasn't fitting in with their offense. That's an issue with playing style, not someone being a ""cancer""  Did you ever hear Durant refused to run a play?"
"So this is the issue I have with this type of stuff... ok let's take this report at face value and say Dwight wasn't always running the plays, and wasn't setting hard screens..How does that make him a ""locker room cancer""??  You could say the same those same exact things about Kevin Durant when he first got to Golden State and wasn't fitting in with their offense. That's an issue with playing style, not someone being a ""cancer""   Why does it always have to become a personal thing with Dwight? "
"A: Kobe Bryant, 2008-09  B: Michael Jordan, 1996-97  C: Kevin Durant, 2017-18"

"Oden was supposed to be the next Shaq or Hakeem or Russell. He was taken ahead of Kevin fucking Durant! By the time Wiggins' draft rolled around he was no longer getting that ""next LeBron"" hype. He wasn't even considered the best player at Kansas. Embiid was supposed to go ahead of him until he got hurt."
Kevin Durant is this subreddit if we were 7 feet tall and had a killer jumper but he gets endless shit here. 
"For real lol, you're taking our 47-win team from last year, replacing Danny Green with DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Anderson with Kevin Durant."
which inevitably resulted in KEVIN DURANT
Kevin Durant will be top 10 all time
"It’s arguable to whether his performance is worse in the finals. He is marginally worse statistically, but you also have to take into account that the finals is theoretically the most difficult series.  And yes, Curry’s finals TS% is historical, obviously as it’s the 2nd best ever, behind only his teammate Kevin Durant.  TS% historically takes a giant dip in the finals, but Curry has maintained his to be pretty close to his regular season and overall playoff numbers. "
Kevin Durant is the greatest scorer to ever live and years from now no one will care about his snake-ness as much
Kevin Durant made the best decision for himself nothing wrong with that
Kevin Durant made the NBA better by signing with the Warriors.

Kevin Durant didn’t have the help he needed to win in OKC.
"yeah, nothing says ""i want to lose this game and join the opposition"" like scoring 7 straight points for your team in the last 2 minutes of a game 7. was it some elaborate plan? was he trying to keep it close so that people wouldn't suspect that he didn't want to win?  if you think professional athlete kevin durant wanted to lose the 2016 WCF and made an active effort to do so, then you are stupid. im sorry."
"Nope.   Shooting Spread has Kobe among the best in his prime.   Next: First they are not that close, considering kobe is shooting better with far more volume:   Advanced stats show that between 2006 - 2011 (during which Kobe won back-to-back titles) Kobe attempted more Field Goals from more locations on the floor than any player in the league. He also was the 3rd most efficient from scoring at the most positions on the floor, behind only Steve Nash and Ray Allen.   Kobe Bryant has the highest spread value in the NBA (table 1); Bryant’s value of 1,071 indicates he has attempted field goals in 1,071 of the 1,284 shooting cells or 83.4% of the scoring area  These Spread visualizations reveal a player’s basic shooting tendencies, but tell us nothing about potency. Shooting skill requires more than just attempts; the best shooters in the league are able to make baskets at effective rates from many court locations. To describe the spatial potency of players we created a metric called “Range,” which is a count of the number of unique shooting cells in which a player averages at least 1 point per attempt (PPA). PPA varies considerably around the court. As anyone who has ever shot a basketball knows, the probability of a shot attempt resulting in a made basket is spatially dependent; some shots are easier than others, and some players are unable to shot effectively from most court locations. Range accounts for spatial influences on shooting effectiveness. It is essentially a count of the number of shooting cells in which a player averages more than 1 PPA; we chose PPA over FG% because it inherently accounts for the differences between 2-point and 3-point field goal attempts.  By dividing this count by 1,284 and multiplying by 100, we generated Range%, which indicates the value of 406, indicating that percentage of the scoring area in which a player averages more than 1 PPA. Steve Nash is ranked first. He has a Range he averages over 1 PPA from 406 unique shooting cells, or 31.6% of the scoring area. Ray Allen was ranked second (30.1%), Kobe Bryant (29.8%) was third, and Dirk Nowitzki (29.0%) was fourth    Player Spread % 1. Kobe Bryant 1,071 83.4% 2. Lebron James 1,047 81.5% 3. Vince Carter 1,005 78.3% 4. Joe Johnson 992 77.3% 5. Rudy Gay 983 76.6% 6. Antawn Jamison 965 75.2% 7. Andre Igudola 962 74.9% 8. Ray Allen 952 74.1% 8. Kevin Durant 949 73.9% 10. Danny Granger 948 73.8%  Player Range % 1. Steve Nash 406 31.6% 2. Ray Allen 386 30.1% 3. Kobe Bryant 383 29.8% 4. Dirk Nowitzki 373 29.0% 5. Rashard Lewis 354 27.6% 6. Joe Johnson 352 27.4% 7.

Danny Granger 331 25.8%  Second: Lebron is close to being average, but in terms of strict numbers: Lebron is below average in every category except the paint.   For example 3 point average is 35%, while ft% is 76%. Close, but still below average.   "
&gt;Curry has like the 2nd best finals TS% for guys 20 point guys playing in multiple finals behind Kevin Durant.  Am I misinterpreting this?
"&gt; I said it was a fair question to ask I didn't provide my opinion about what I thought the answer to the question was.  You also said why it's a fair question to ask. You said it's fair given how he played.  &gt; Did it affect his performance?  Don't jump there, no one was asking.  &gt; I mean yeah I don't think RW can carry a championship team but I don't see how that's relevant to the discussion we're having about kevin durant.  How he played, performance is your basis, yes or no?"

People that buy NBA jerseys aka NBA fans are buying Warriors, Steph and KD jerseys. Kevin Durant may as well be hated by Non-Warriors fans. Fact is a large chunk of NBA fans are Warriors and KD fans.   You claimed yourself that if KD relied on popularity he’d lose his livelihood. Then you switched it up, into he’s popular, but hated. Bruh this KD is a persecuted minority bullshit is dumb. He has haters. But he also has dudes that love him. "
Can you photoshop Kevin Durant onto Jennifer's body?
I sometimes think about Game of Zones and theorize what it might be like if our current population did live in some sort of medieval time period of knights and warriors and which NBA player might still be legendary. Like LeBron would be a monster if was raised a Spartan warrior. Kenneth Faried would be some warlord King with his mindset and body.   Kevin Durant would hopefully get fucked by like Steven Adams using some comically large boomerang or something but its fun to think about
"  (1) If Westbrook wins a championship and beats Kevin Durant along the way in the playoffs, Westbrook will have won 2 championship rings.  (2) Kevin Durant has -1 rings (negative 1 rings). ACUTALLY AS OF 4/11 DURANT HAS -4 RINGS (WE WERE NOT PROVIDED AN EXPLANATION ON WHY THIS IS - ALSO, HE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE THE FIRST PERSON TO END THEIR CAREER WITH -10 RINGS)  (3) If Kevin Durant wins an NBA title for the NY Knicks, he will gain 11 rings. However, as seen above, Durant has -4 rings and if he were to remain at -4, then win for the Knicks, he will have 7 rings  (4) Kevin Durant's dagger in Game 3 did not count, because none of Durant's stats count. KD's official statline last night was 0/0/0 and the Cavs blew the Warriors out by 40.  (5) Anything Kevin Durant has done with the Warriors is not in in the personal record book  ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/DanLeBatardShow/comments/8qd7x5/i_finally_decided_to_properly_formatedit_the/))"
"Kevin Durant forever lost my respect with that move. It really just shows that he’s not a hard worker and would rather take the easy road than actually work for his championship, which probably would have happened the next year if he had just stayed on the thunder."
Kevin Durant is also still loved by many casuals. Still sells shoes and jerseys. KD jerseys are the third best sellers. Now tell me dudes want another man’s name on their back and don’t even like him? Stop it. He is polarizing. And I just gave you evidence.   Edit: KD is 4th not third now. Still. 
"Curry has like the 2nd best finals TS% for guys 20 point guys playing in multiple finals behind Kevin Durant.  He has shit bed in individual games in the finals, but has historically been one of the best finals performers in NBA history."
Lmaoooooo. Kevin Durant is still popular as fuck. He’s just polarizing. 
guess who else is a 2nd option on a championship team? Kevin Durant.
"Wait, are you telling me James Harden, Russell Westbrook, *and* Kevin Durant were on the same team? "
"Steph curry is a player with a great prime, but bad start. It can be notable steph's efficiency is his best attribute. I still consider Pete over steph. Pete deserves more respect for what he did on the court. Curry is a 5x all star with great effeciancy. He really hasn't earned his title as an all time great. He had about two years of being front and center then he became KD's wingman (Kevin Durant on the other hand being a player better then Curry) 2015, 2016 being them. Currys longevity is something to question considering his early injury history, however likely curry will find himself when it's all said and done as a top 5 point guard if he continues his current success. The 5th greatest point guard is likely where he will land whilst also being one of the greatest pure shooters ever. Solely based on accolades of course. "
I don't know what to believe about Kevin Durant.  
Yeah but how many of them are Kevin Durant?
"Full Story :  On Tuesday, Bloomberg hosted the second annual Players Technology Summit in San Francisco.  Andre Iguodala's business partner, Rudy-Cline Thomas, moderated a Q&amp;A session with Kevin Durant and his business partner/agent/close friend Rich Kleiman.  Before asking any questions, Cline-Thomas shared the following personal anecdote:  ""Remember 2017, you just lost to the Warriors -- no 2016, you had just lost the Warriors, May -- you and I get together after the game. I thought I was just gonna focus on not talking about basketball, and you wanted to focus on talking about Silicon Valley -- asking me how it was out here.  ""You had been following what Andre and I were doing, how it was being surrounded by all these CEOs, innovators and entrepreneurs. And I was like, 'Wow. First and foremost, like yo -- this dude just told me he's about to sign with the Warriors, right (laughter). So, I was like I'm not gonna tell anybody, didn't tell anybody whatsoever, didn't want any rumors to get started...""  Innnnnnteresting.  Cline-Thomas then asked Durant when he started thinking differently about his business opportunities.  ""Probably about 2015, I had got hurt. Basketball had always been my world ... it stopped, and I had to think about other parts of my life and what I was interested in ... it was rough because I didn't know what I wanted to do or what I liked or what type of person I wanted to be ... I started to hear about Andre and more guys around the NBA -- especially that play for the Warriors -- that took advantage of the opportunities of being in the Bay Area.  ""So throughout that whole year, me and Rich were talking about investing in companies and what I like to do outside of ball. Then I (saw) you and just all those questions came out at once and I was basically telling you I was coming to the Warriors (laughter).""  Does Durant still pick the Warriors if Golden State wins the 2016 title?  Remember that during the 2017 Finals, Draymond Green told ESPN's Zach Lowe: ""If we win the championship, I'm like 99 percent sure we don't get him.""  About 20 minutes later, Cline-Thomas asked Kleiman what he has learned from Kevin Duran over the years:  ""Well I just learned that he told you in May, before free agency -- which is hardly factual, which we'll have to clear up with Marc Spears and everybody here (laughter) -- no way did that happen, but cool... (laughter).""  It's funny that Kleiman mentioned Spears (who works for The Undefeated), because in late June 2016, one of Durant's longtime friends told Spears: ""His decision is 90 percent made. It would take an amazing sales pitch to change it.""  The assumption was that Durant was 90 percent sure he was going to re-sign with the the Thunder.  That was not the case.  One other nugget from the summit:  One thing that jumped out to me from yesterday's Player's Technology Summit: @richkleiman was talking about Kevin Durant and said, ""When he retires in seven years..."" (so 6 more years with the Warriors and then one last hurrah with the Thunder...............? ha)"
G - Steph Curry   G - James Harden  F - Lebron James   F - Kevin Durant  F/C - Anthony Davis 
Those two girls names? Steph Curry and Kevin Durant
"There's not that many comments, dude. It's not hard to prove. Seriously. Ctrl-F KD or Kevin Durant, you're attacking something that isn't there lol    Edit: what is even happening "
"Cj is lunchin. Ironically he should’ve said this about Kevin Durant. Steph is top 30 for sure. But idk about 15. This is Kevin Durant’s burner account btw.  If we’re talking all time, then you have to look at individual dominance, and individual dominance in their era. Steph Curry did not make first team all nba last year, or second team. He is not considered the best player in the nba. It is debatable as to whether he is the best PG right now( I think he is). Steph isn’t even the best player on his team, the goat KD is.  Is Steph Curry currently more dominant, than these players in their prime: Jordan, Kobe, Lebron, KD, Shaq, Magic, Bird, Wilt, Kareem, Russell, Robinson, Olajuwon, Duncan, Moses Malone, Karl Malone? I don’t think he is. And the rings argument is stupid now. Any of these players put on the 2014-2018 warriors in their prime, would win several championships."
It's news because the entire rest of the league has self control whereas Kevin Durant has the restraint of a 12 year old which explains why he feels the need to attack fellow children I suppose 
"There are only 17 player seasons (by 9 players) in the 3 point era that have a PER of 30 or more, and McGrady has one of them. For at least that one season, he put up an all-time great stat line. And, from a non-stat perspective, he was a big wing player who had a well-rounded game, could shoot, drive, get to the line, and pass. That Orlando team was pretty bad other than him and they won 42 games, and lost in the first round in 7 to the Pistons.   The 30 PER one-timers are him, D Wade, Curry, Anthony Davis, Westbrook, and David Robinson. LeBron and Jordan both have 4, and Shaq has 3.   If you expand the search to 29.5 PER to catch near misses, you get Durant, Harden, another Shaq season, and two more Jordan seasons. If you expand it to 29.1, you get two more LeBron seasons, two more David Robinson seasons, one more Jordan, and one from Kevin Garnett. "
"Yeah I'm genuinely surprised there are people that wouldn't even consider him top 15... If you have a player that needs to be double teamed at *half court* to leave Kevin fucking Durant open in the finals, how is that player not argualbe for *at least* top 15 if not higher... "
"It must be a cool feeling to be Kevin Durant. In the back of your head, you know that if any of the 7 billion people on Earth challenged you, you could score on literally EVERYONE with ease. "
"Congrats, you found the exception that proves the rule.  Amare was not even the best at his position, much less a legitimate MVP candidate.  Nevertheless, he did get some lower place votes.  Allen Iverson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Russel Westbrook etc have all won MVPs during their scoring titles.  Then look at people like Chris Paul who definitely had an MVP caliber season earlier in his career but wasn't really considered."
"a.) 3 point field goals are worth more points than 2 point field goals. Being good at that is one of the things that makes Curry so special.  b.) Curry has averaged 25 or more points in all four of the past four playoff runs. Why are we pretending like Curry isn't a volume scorer, or that other guys are averaging 40 points a game?  c) This point is way overstated. Adrian Dantley, Bernard King, Reggie Miller, and maybe Charles Barkley (even that's a stretch) are the only retired guys that Curry would have any realistic shot of slipping behind. Someone like Bernard King only has a 28 game sample compared to Curry's 90 games already (even Dantley, who is narrowly behind at #2, only has 73 games).   The most likely people to pass up Curry in this regard are his peers, with Kevin Durant being the most likely to do it. "
LeBron James  Kevin Durant
Game 1: Curry Game 2: Curry Game 3: KD Game 4: Curry.   Curry outperformed Kevin Durant in these finals.  You have to look at every game to decide FMVP; you can’t just look at one game (game 3) and say Durant was the best player on the warriors in that series. 
"Yeah, Steph plays with KD (Kevin Durant). KD's not that well known either but he once made a podcast with Bill too and has kinda become a cult classic since then."
When Kevin Durant made that 3 over LeBron in the Finals.   They went through so much adversity and everyone doubted them 
Where does this one rank? https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2017/09/19/remorseful-kevin-durant-feels-terrible-twitter-incident-disappointed-myself/682654001/
We are ALL Kevin Durant on this blessed day :)
Throwback to when Kevin Durant forgot to sign into of his alt
"&gt;	Undeniable Best Player on championship team  Unless you meant this to only apply in the two seasons you described above that (2x MVP, 73-9, etc.), this is false. Arguably yes but definitely not undeniably with Kevin Durant on his team.   EDIT: Didn’t notice the singular vs plural “teams” on the next line. "
Kevin Durant 
"You gotta be trolling. In 2015, while Iguodala was playing stifling defense on LeBron, Steph was breaking the Cavs’ backs with threes. While it might not have been the most efficient, Curry hit the threes in the perfect times during the game (especially 5 and 6) to kill the Cavs’ momentum. In 2016, Curry wasn’t even healthy, he was rushed back in the Houston series and played at about 60-70% of himself in that Finals series. Kyrie took advantage of Steph’s injuries and took it to him, and you’re not even factoring how difficult it is to guard Kyrie PERIOD for ANYBODY. And in 2017 Steph played a similar role as in 2015, hitting the momentum killer and backbreaker shots while Durant, who’s one of the few players better than him dominated the series, which I’m pretty sure you’re not gonna wanna do too much when you have a weapon of KD’s talent level. 2018 was much better for him, as he was able to dominate a lot more and was a lot healthier, as you can tell as he attacked the basket and played solid defense against LeBron especially considering how much size he was giving up. Curry practically had Finals MVP won this year until Kevin Durant put up that amazing Game 3 performance and the triple double in Game 4."
"If you say so, Kevin Durant"
Steph Curry   Klay Thompson   Kevin Durant   Draymond Green  Joel Embiid
"In 16-17, Melo shot the highest percentage from mid-range of his career and was statistically an equal spot-up shooter to Klay Thompson, Kevin Love and Kevin Durant."
"Hint : it's similar to your Kevin ""Snake"" Durant one"
" &gt;10. Five days after firing coach Dwane Casey following a sweep at the hands of the Cavaliers, the Raptors send out a tweet congratulating him for being named a finalist for Coach of the Year. 9. Bulls forward Bobby Portis clocks Nikola Mirotic in the face during practice, breaking multiple bones in Mirotic’s face. In the aftermath, most of the Bulls seem to take Portis’ side. With Mirotic out, Portis gets a significantly larger role in the Bulls’ rotation. Mirotic returns to the lineup in early December and the Bulls go on a seven-game winning streak fueled by the Bulls outscoring their opponents by 39 points in the 86 minutes Portis and Mirotic share the floor. 8. Jason Kidd gets fired by the Bucks and then tells anybody who will listen (though he told Ramona Shelburne first) that Giannis Antetokounmpo tried to save Kidd’s job. 7. LeBron James essentially stages an on-court strike for the entire month of January in an (ultimately successful) effort to get half his team traded. In the final game before the trade deadline, LeBron chest-bumps Cedi Osman and Tristan Thompson while celebrating a game-winning shot … but snubs Isaiah Thomas, who is traded the following day. 6. J.R. Smith gets suspended by the Cavs for throwing a bowl of soup at assistant coach Damon Jones. 5. Kevin Durant, who is definitely not sensitive and/or Mad Online, gets caught operating multiple burner Twitter and Instagram accounts. Durant states, among other things, that he didn’t like the Thunder organization or playing for Billy Donovan. He also says the roster in Oklahoma City featured a bunch of bums (and Russell Westbrook), explaining, “Kd can’t win a championship with those cats.” 4. Shortly after a tension-filled game featuring Chris Paul’s return to Staples Center, it’s reported that the Houston Rockets utilized a purportedly secret tunnel to confront the Los Angeles Clippers’ Austin Rivers and Blake Griffin. The reported plan involved sending Clint Capela to the front door of the Clippers locker room as a distraction while Paul, James Harden, Trevor Ariza, and Gerald Green sneak around the back. Several NBA players claim the tunnel isn’t actually secret, but nobody cares because calling it a “secret tunnel” is funnier. Updated reporting indicates that Paul and Harden were peacemakers and that Tarik Black—not Capela—went to the front door of the locker room. Again, nobody cares because the other version is much funnier. 3. In late September, San Antonio announces Kawhi Leonard will be out for the entire preseason with “right quadriceps tendinopathy.” The Spurs issue vague statements about his progress throughout the first two months of the season before he finally returns to the floor in mid-December. After nine games, the Spurs announce he’s out indefinitely. ESPN then reports a rift between Leonard and the Spurs, stemming from Leonard’s reliance on outside medical opinions. As Leonard spends more time away from the team, conspiracy theories emerge about his alleged unhappiness in San Antonio and every person in America fires up the trade machine. Tony Parker, meanwhile, tells the media his own quad injury was “100 times worse” than Leonard’s, and Gregg Popovich repeatedly answers questions about his star’s status by saying that Leonard’s “group” will decide when he can play again. 2. No. 1 overall pick Markelle Fultz suffers a mysterious injury—or does he????—that robs him of the ability to shoot. Videos (like, dozens of them) surface of Fultz shooting free throws and jumpers with a janky-ass form that looks absolutely horrifying, and Fultz becomes the subject of endless internet fascination as people debate whether the injury is real. Fultz sits out every game from Oct. 25 through March 26, all the while continually taking strange-looking jumpers (including a session in which he strictly shoots with his left hand) in front of media members who film him continuously. Almost immediately upon his return, Fultz breaks his teammate Joel Embiid’s face. 1. Spurred by an anonymous tipster, the Ringer puts together an exhaustive case which suggests 76ers president of basketball operations Bryan Colangelo operates five burner Twitter accounts that he uses to: disparage the performance of his predecessor in Philly (Sam Hinkie) and successor in Toronto (Masai Ujiri); criticize Sixers coach Brett Brown; telegraph the trade in which the Sixers moved up in the draft to pick Fultz; criticize Sixers players drafted by Hinkie such as Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, and Joel Embiid; disclose private medical information about Okafor; and engage in gossip about Embiid’s off-court exploits. As of this writing, internet sleuths have decided some of the accounts may have been operated by Colangelo’s wife."

"10 is Kevin Snake Durant. Nice, lol"
Let me tell you about the time I saw Kevin Durant at a grocery store in Oakland.  
"I did and it does not change what I said. A highlight video is nothing compared to watching him play since he was drafted into the league. We had highlight videos showing Thon Maker as the second coming of Kevin Durant, but that is not true either. Dwight has not had a consistent post game since he came into the league.   I do not base my opinions about players based on narratives on this website. It is based on my 30+ years of watching and playing basketball.  It is the reason that I realize the narrative that you only should shoot threes and layups was correct."
Also Caviera is a woman just like Kevin Durant
Only whiny edgelords think the blame lies with the Warriors.  The blame lies with Kevin Durant and his soft ass decision.
When did I say that ? All I said is Kevin Durant joined a team that was in the finals and 1 game away from winning. LeBron joined a team that wasn't in that position 
"&gt; In 2010 Lebron had bad spacing. And that's why in the playoffs against a good defense he struggled. He got bounced in the 2nd round by Boston in 6. He shot only 44% FG and 27% 3FG with a medicore 55% TS.  Kevin Durant shot 43% from the field and 28% from 3 in 2016, and he blew a 3-1 lead. "
"I got a different message from the article, but I'm guessing he's talking about this one. [Take from it what you will.](http://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kevin-durant-i-thought-championship-would-fill-void-but-it-didnt/)"
"Iggy, David West, Livingston, Matt Barnes, Javale McGee ?   Outside of McGee those are all high IQ great NBA players.   Then they had Ian Clark, Patrick McCaw and Kevon Looney who are all promising players.    Regardless Steph Curry and GSW were changing the way the game was being played and thought of then Kevin Durant joined them after losing to them in the WCF. He was OKC's main guy, he lost to the GSW. Then joined them. That is the coward move.  Lebron running into Boston with 3 all Stars and a more than proven Rondo and wanting to level the playing field feels much different. "
"&gt;There aren't any more burner accounts, but it appears Kevin Durant is still using social media to defend his move to the Golden State Warriors.  Didn't you hear? Apparently there aren't any more burner accounts, which is totally definitely true."
"Kevin Durant is a 28 yo guy who happens to be incredibly tall and good at basketball. He's not some philosopher of some sort who doesn't have time to respond to mere mortals. Also, he has lots of free time apparently lmao"
"ok, gonna do a joke here. hang on. ok, got it. well, mayhaps they already play the all-star game with smaller balls, on account of kevin freaking durant, who has tiny balls, because he is impotent and infertile."

"You can't compare the two at all. The reason why its differnt is because kawhi was injured!!! Theres nothing else to go by on, hes been out for a year. Kawhi was hooping in the playoffs Its not like he had 1 big game and now hes the best in the world. He was leading his team up by 20 against the best shooting team in nba history. It was him &amp; the genius of pop blowing out the warriors. Then when zaza hurt him you saw what happened. He had the same effect as lebron, take him out of that team and now the team is borderline useless.   Also let me ask you something. Who was the focal point of the spurs offense in 2014? If you know anything about spurs basketball you should know that answer and just not assume he wasn't and just a glorified role player.  Kawhi is the best two-way defender in the league. Way better fit then KD, He can absouletly lockdown ANYBODY in the league.The lakers have a pass 1st point guard in lonzo, 2 scoring emerging stars in Ingram and Kuzma,a talented young bench and lebron. Add a scottie pippen type player to lebron then you already have the Defense,length and toughness to beat GSW.  Kevin Durant isn't an elite level defender. Yes hes a good paint protector with his block timing. But just a above average on-ball defender.  He was getting exposed when Cp3 or james harden was running pick and roll iso.  And exactly you cant compare the two because kawhi has been out. You can't stack up against the two because kawhi hasn't played since he got injured. Thats like saying ""I'll take D'Angelo Russell over kawhi"",What has kawhi done over the year. Its unfair to comepare an injured player to a healthy one."
In before this gets locked.... this is my opportunity to drop a message to humanity..... here we go: Kevin Durant pees sitting down. 
Kevin Durant and arguing with random people on social media  name a more iconic duo 
Kevin Durant was apart of their defense.
"&gt; could have been  Possibly but I don't recall seeing any signs of his shooting being that good. At 6' 7"", he was a tough matchup for any team at that position. But at 6' 10"", I don't think we ever saw anyone do what Grant Hill was looking like he was going to be able to do. While not a great shooter yet, I think we were looking at a Kevin Durant type player but with a more aggressive move to the basket. Like LeBron. Not quite as physical or strong though. But a player that we had never seen before. But it really is tough to say.  "
"I mean it's not like he's shouldering the weight of the defense primarily to himself. Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are also both elite All-NBA defenders. I whole-heartedly think he's just a slightly above average player reeking the benefits of the system he's in.   The 90s Bulls team has only 3 HOFers, and Rodman took a few years despite absolutely destroying rebounding records. So if a player like Rodman barely made it, how can we even consider Draymond a potential HOF candidate? Rodman had the same number of rings, and was leaps and bounds ahead of Draymond in how important he was to that team. At this point the Warriors are less of a dynasty, and there's four players who have arguably had bigger roles than him (Klay, Curry, Durant, and don't forget finals MVP Iggy). All Draymond has done in the playoffs is kick dudes in the nuts, get a shit ton of technicals, and cost his team a championship by getting suspended like an idiot."
LeBron didn’t join a team that was already a historic contender. They created a brand new core that had not played together. Kevin durant joined a core that had proven they could win a ring and win 73 games. Kevin durant ruined the league 
"Kevin Durant is absolutely one of the most socially engaged players, even to the extent that it hurts his public image. As a whole, current players (besides Kawhi) are more communicative with the fans than ever before. It's not just you."
IMO Kevin Durant cares too much about what people think. He pretends he doesn't. But deep down he knows those titles he won are tainted. Why else would he argue with people about the move to GSW all the time? You can tell he's easily triggered.
Kevin Durant is so sensitive. 
Kyle Korver is a shooter. Kevin Durant is a scorer.  It generally depends on how they score (mostly off of jump shots? shooter. Varies their repertoire? scorer)
I remember when Kevin Durant got bored and joined a flag football team for a game. He had like nine interceptions or something absurd. It makes sense when you think about it; just imagine trying to throw a ball past him.
This has nothing to do with my post.  Kevin Durant played better than Lebron James in both the 2017 and 2018 finals. FACTS.
"Lebron James career PPG: 27.2  Kevin Durant career PPG: 27.1  Technically speaking, Lebron is scoring (ever so slightly) more than KD.  You seem to be arguing efficiency which is something else."
"I usually go your route, but something came over me. He's trolling hard. I lost my absolute shit when he said ""but dad, Kevin Durant has 6 rings, and James Harden has 3 rings and 6 MVPs"" OMG  pure trolling, he should collect a pshycho check"
"Suuuuure its the traffic, not the kevin durant schedule. ;)"
"The third time I ran into Kevin Durant I was working at the old arcade off route 67 back home. Man I loved that place - mostly locals with their families or groups of kids coming in to check out the old Atari machines or play Snake. Felt like a real community, you know? One day, must have been in the summer because I remember it being so hot the pizza delivery actually got hotter just sitting outside, this rusty truck pulls up and a 7-foot-tall string bean gets out and claims he's here from ""corporate.""  So I tell him that I didn't hear anything from corporate saying that I should be expecting someone to swing by. He just shrugs and laughs at me and pops open his trunk. I ask him what he's here to do and he takes off his sunglasses and turns to me and says ""tech support"" and pulls a huge toolbox out of his trunk and starts walking towards the arcade. His hands are full so I offer to help carry stuff, but he insists on taking it all inside alone. About 5 feet from the entrance his wallet falls out of his pocket and lands on the ground in front of me. A card had fallen out of the wallet so I pick it up and look at it, and it's just a bunch of random usernames and logins, possibly up to 50 of them, with passwords next to them. Flustered, KD snatches the card out of my hand and storms into the arcade.  I follow him inside but he turns to me and tells me ""don't worry about this I got it."" Suspicious, I walk out and resume eating my scalding pizza in the dusty parking lot, but I keep an eye on him. I notice that he's going to every single machine and unscrewing the control board and typing something in. At one point, a bunch of kids show up and try to head inside to play some games, and KD shrieks at them and locks the door, flipping the OPEN sign to CLOSED and snarling.  About two hours later, KD finally emerges and says ""all set, thanks boss"" and walks towards his truck. I quickly shuffle inside and take a look at a few of the machines. Horrified, I immediately notice that every single one of the top scores on every single machine has been edited to say ""&amp; KD"" at the end. Billy &amp; KD, Pauly &amp; KD, Deb &amp; KD...every single one..some of those scores had been there for 20 years!  I run out to KD and scream at him ""YOU DIDN'T GET THOSE SCORES, YOU PIGGYBACKED ON SOMEONE ELSE'S SUCCESS!!""  He rolls down the window of his truck and looks me dead in the eyes and says ""in 20 years nobody will remember how I got those scores, they'll just count the wins"" and drives off into the distance. That was the third time I ran into KD."

*Why Kevin Durant Doesn’t Worry About Being Top 10 All-Time*
that kevin durant “didnt want to win” against the warriors in 2016. actually the dumbest fucking taken ive ever seen legitimately defended on here
"Kevin Durant is better at scoring, shooting, and defense.  "
I thought it was Kawhi...and Paul George.....and Kevin Durant....and Russell Westbrook. 
Kevin Durant is a better scorer
"Regardless the actual difference, the sample size is way too great for it to fall in the margin of error. You can actually calculate the statistical probability that Kobe Bryant just had a FG% ~5 points less than Kevin Durant's with something called a T-test.   The T-test tells you the value of *P*, which is the chance that there's only a difference because more of Kobe's shots just ""happened"" to rim out.   Because a T-test factors the sample size, and the sample is gigantic in this case (10,000+ shots, easily), then *P* would approach zero, i.e; the fact that Kobe's FG% is less than KD's is because Kevin Durant is ""signifigantly"" more efficient than Kobe. Note: the word ""significant,"" in statistics, literally means ""not due to chance;"" it doesn't mean ""large.""   So across a 10,000,000 shot sample size, even a 0.2 point difference in FG% is significant.    I'm not trying to argue Kobe vs KD I'm just telling you how statistics work because I'm a statistics nerd. In a sample of 30 shots (i.e. A single game), then sure a 5% point difference might be ""insignificant,"" but I fail to see why we'd only look at a single game to determine who the more efficient scorer is when we have a larger sample... their whole careers.   "
Kevin Durant
"This offseason has really revealed how little people watched in the 2k era, calling Kevin Durant a better player than Kobe Bryant, the Allen Iverson threads, and shit like this.  "
And then Kevin Durant and Paul George snuck into DPOY talks...lmaooooo
Kevin Durant did nothing wrong and I actually believe that. 
Fuck you and Kevin Durant ho
"You’re not entirely wrong in that AD doesn’t match up well with their style of play, but Kevin Durant didn’t fit our scheme either. AD would absolutely put Houston over the edge, he immediately gives them an offensive big man that can team up with Clint to dominate the interior.   As far as the “worst“ fringe player I can think of to put them over the edge, I’d say Paul Millsap. He’s gonna be another guy who spaces out the floor excellently, and while I don’t think he changes the game dramatically I think Houston would have a good chance at taking the series in 6 or 7. "
"you can honestly say that about anything involving following professional sports; hate's not a bad thing. There are things that should be hated. Within the context of professional basketball, Kevin Durant is a fair target. "
Didn't you know Kevin Durant has a personal responsibility to preserve how you like your viewing product
and Kevin fucking Durant 
"Yeah, where you can clearly hear Kevin Durant say, ""You're upset. It's okay, I get it."""
Kevin Durant and the Warriors
I love Kevin Durant; he's a top 5 favorite non-Laker for me. The KD hate on this sub is pathetic.  Lakers make the second round.  Magic would be in the GOAT conversation if he wasn't forced to retire early.  Advanced stats are ridiculously important and anyone claiming their fucking eyeball can understand the intricacies of a basketball game needs to check their ego.
Saying Kevin Durant is a legitimately bad person for joining the Warrirors. At the end of the day it's just basketball.
I love Kevin Durant 
It's easy though. I have:  1. Artis Gilmore   2. DeAndre Jordan   3. Cedric Maxwell   4. Tyson Chandler   5. Stephen Curry   6. James Donaldson   7. Adrian Dantley   8. Reggie Miller   9. Charles Barkley   10. Kevin Durant
"Did you watch the thunder in 2014?   Not trying to call you out but maybe the memory is hazy. Kevin Durant played some of the best basketball in his life without said MVP caliber teammate. Westbrook was injured for a huge stretch and Kevin Durant actually elevated his game. Check out what he pulled off when Westbrook was injured.   So ima repeat it, Kevin Durant was just better with less help. "
I just don't see how you can defeat the best teams and coaches in the NBA when they are defending one of your players this way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgrHaE1MjI  Even Kevin Durant couldn't overcome it.  Then there's the issue of foul shooting.
Kevin Durant is overrated  The bucks are not finals contenders this year  The lakers are going to be bad and Lebron is going to regret signing there halfway through the season.  Superhero movies are ruining cinema
"They put all their eggs into the LeBron basket, instead of focusing on developing young talent.  Sure, they signed LeBron as a free agent instead of trading for him, but there are still costs to doing so.  Obviously there are also benefits, we'll see whether the benefits outweigh the costs.  I thing the biggest test will not be this year but next, when they try to attract another top player like Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard."
It's bordering on mental illness how *obsessed* some people get with the Kevin Durant hate.
Kevin Durant
KEVIN DURANT IS MY DEAR PERSONAL FRIEND;  I KNEW HIM SINCE HE WAS IN HIS MOTHER'S WOMB
"&gt;/r/nba, Kevin Durant, love/hate relationship  name a more iconic trio. "
"So where do you put him between: Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony (he's ass but he's at least able to coast on popularity), Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, and Joel Embiid?"
&gt; He said “WELP STEVEN ADAMS TO OKC” and Kevin Durant replied smh to the fan for shitting on Adams before seeing him play ball.  idk if we can assume that the fan was shitting on Adams.
"Not to mention none of that is Adams fault, and I’m pretty sure Kevin Durant or his agent could have called OKC and talked with just about anybody in the franchise whenever he wanted to drop a wtf bomb."
Look at the tweet from the guy. He said “WELP STEVEN ADAMS TO OKC” and Kevin Durant replied smh to the fan for shitting on Adams before seeing him play ball.   This sub is such an anti KD circlejerk it’s crazy. You people don’t even bother looking at the tweet as long as you get a reason to shit on Durant. Bunch of fuckin idiots here 
"The title is wrong... should be ""How Russell Westbrook Limited Kevin Durant...""﻿"

"here are the formulae:      Likelihood = 1/(1 +exp(-(-13.6 +0.376*GameScore +5.56*Series win)))      Odds = Likelihood / sum( total likelihood )      *Notes: in the game score formula, replace rebounds with 0.59*ORB%*MPG+0.25*DRB%*MPG.       This approximates the standard weights in the original formula very well.       For the years where offensive and defensive rebounds are not tracked separately, use 0.4*TRB%*MPG.       Then add the “playmaker” boost: 0.45*AST%^0.5*USG%*MPG.  apparently he modified the 2018 formula to incorporate [DRE (Daily RAPM Estimate)](https://fansided.com/2015/02/23/introducing-dre-a-hopefully-better-simple-metric/), so you're right that it won't add up there, but it's not an egregious outcome - [Curry did get 36% of the actual vote.](http://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/nba-finals-2018-wins-mvp-honors-kevin-durant/2fw1346jdwvv1qus4vmpciqqc)"
"You think Kevin Durant is better than Kobe Bryant all time?  *Please.*  Prime Kobe destroys Durant as a ball-handler/passer/play-maker. The recency bias around here is insane. Did everyone forget how awful and uncomfortable Durant looked in the 13/14/16 post-seasons whenever he was asked to handle the ball and create as the lead guy? He's hidden this narrative being on a team where he doesn't need to do that.  Seriously, there's a reason that prime Kobe beats Durant in EVERY impact metric we have available (RAPM, CORP, On/Off, WOWY) despite Durant's superiority in the box-score. No, Durant hasn't surpassed Kobe yet. The fact that such a consensus believes that he has, IMO, is a symptom of how over-reliant we have become on individual scoring efficiency as a measure of player performance. Individual scoring efficiency is important, and to be as absurdly efficient as Durant at such a high volume is more impressive still. But there are other aspects to the game, and I don't think they're given enough weight in many of the discussions here.  Part of the reason that individual scoring efficiency is so focused upon is that every ""advanced"" box score metric relies heavily on it. But since they have different names, people often site them as if they are giving different results. For example, Durant's advantages in TS%, PER, Offensive Rating and Win Shares all tie strongly to Durant's scoring efficiency advantage. Thus, citing each of them individually doesn't strengthen the case much IMO, since it's repetitive."

"That was also before they got Kevin fkn Durant. Does Golden state win the series again HOU w/o Klay? That's a good question, but there were wayyyy too may factors that influenced that series wrt to injuries that you can't really be sure. Klay is definitely valuable, and without him, GS and Hou are pretty much equal, but even without him, GS and LAL are really no comparison. "
Are you in the crowd that believes Kobe &lt; Kevin Durant?
"I feel like the only Rings that dont actually count are Rings that you get when you are close to retirement joining a team that is already good if you were a superstar before, or if your in your prime and you join a super team like Kevin Durant. I would say Lebrons rings on the heat count because before he went there they werent a super team, they only had Wade, but when Kevin went to the Warriors they were already the second best if not the best team in the league. "
"Why is that the question?  Kobe is a better *player* than Durant.  If you think scoring is the only thing in the equation then Kevin Durant is better than Magic, Bird, Shaq and everyone else not named LeBron/Jordan?  "
"lolwat. How is Durant below 50% in 2017 and 2018?     2017    |||Shoo|Shoo|Shoo|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|FG%|3P%|FT%|MP|PTS|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|GSC| |1|Kevin Durant|.556|.474|.927|39.7|35.2|.698|8.2|5.4|1.0|1.6|2.2|30.3| |2|Stephen Curry|.440|.388|.897|37.7|26.8|.619|8.0|9.4|2.2|0.0|3.8|24.1|  2018    |||Shoo|Shoo|Shoo|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|FG%|3P%|FT%|MP|PTS|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|GSC| |1|Kevin Durant|.526|.409|.963|41.3|28.8|.654|10.8|7.5|0.8|2.3|2.3|26.9| |2|Stephen Curry|.402|.415|1.000|40.6|27.5|.560|6.0|6.8|1.5|0.8|2.8|20.1|    If it's simply based on game score, then why the hell is Dirk at 60% in 2011 when he had a 16.6 game score to Wade's 22.9. Why is Curry at 62.4% for 2015 with a 17.9 game score when LeBron had a 24.6. Curry has two teammates much closer to his game score(Iggy 13.6, Draymond 12.9) than he was to LeBron's. If it's simply due to winning the series, then LeBron should get very little percentage in 2017 and 2018 as well. And Durant's game score margin over Curry in both years was greater than Curry's over Iggy and Draymond in 2015.     KD posted the 2nd highest game score in NBA finals history in 2017 and the 10th highest of all time in 2018. And yet compare his MVP% with the other 6 highest finals game scores for a title winner     1. 00 Shaq 30.6 99.8%   2. 17 Durant 30.3 43.1%   3. 02 Shaq 30.1 88.5%   4. 93 Jordan 29.6 96.2%     5. 91 Jordan 29.4 93.8%     6. 87 Magic 28.3 94.7%   7. 01 Shaq 27.4 91.5%    8. 18 Durant 26.9 48.4%    Isiah Thomas with 83.4% in 1990 with a 20.1 game score. Laimbeer finished at 13.8(-6.3%) and Dumars 13.0(-7.1%). Additionally Drexler, 21.3(+1.2%) had the highest game score of either team despite losing the series and Porter finished at 15.3(-4.8%).    Meanwhile in 2017 KD was at 30.3, Curry was his closest teammate at 24.1(-6.2%) and then you have to go all the way down to Klay at 10.6(-19.7%). LeBron finished at 29.6(-0.7%) and Kyrie was the only other player above 15 at 18.2(-12.1%).    So how the hell is Thomas at 83.4% while Durant is at 43.1%. Even if it's proportional, Dumars and Laimbeer combined for +33.8% over Thomas proportionally and Drexler had the highest GSC of the Finals while losing the series. Meanwhile Klay and Curry combined for only 14.2% above KD and KD had the 2nd best game score in NBA Finals history   "
"&gt; What if you're a choker?  Statistically Kobe is atrocious in the clutch, so not a great argument for him  &gt; What if you're not a good playmaker? an average defender? Is Kevin Durant a better player than Magic Johnson? There's more than efficiency in most people's all time criteria.  Well obviously that stuff is up for consideration. That's a given, I thought you were saying that being a more efficient scorer doesn't matter if you have more ""skill"" to score, which is nonsense imo"
&gt; How does it not? How would it not mean that?   What if you're a choker?  What if you're not a good playmaker?  an average defender?  Is Kevin Durant a better player than Magic Johnson?  There's more than efficiency in most people's all time criteria.

I was basically begging him. I was like 'Yo, this would be nice.'

To see if I would fit.**  &gt; Then once I sat down with these guys, everything that I wanted to know about them they kinda showed me. **But we don’t have to talk about it though because they didn’t get the job done and they came after me and who knows what would’ve happened.**  &gt; **""But I guess you could say I’m glad that they lost.”**  There's no fucking way he joins the Warriors if they won in 2016"

"The Rockets didn't give Paul a five year max either despite retaining his bird rights. Money wasn't the breaking point for Chris Paul. The Clippers may have been offering a four year max (like the Rockets did) for all we know.  So you have to blow a 3-1 lead to a 73 win team and be considered a superstar who is the best player on his team and join the team that you lost to be labeled a quitter. That is such specific criteria that can only possibly apply to Kevin Durant and no one else.   Kevin Durant is the most disliked player in the NBA today. Would you disagree with that statement? Westbrook is not receiving more blame than Durant. The dynamic flipped the moment it was announced he signed with Golden State.  &gt;OKC was still a legit title contending team with a great supporting cast. It’s not something you ever see.  because his circumstances are unprecedented. There has not been a single superstar in NBA history who had the *opportunity* of Kevin Durant in the 2016 offseason. The cap spike, the blown 3-1 lead followed by another blown 3-1 lead of a 73 win team with an opening at SF, a top five player just so happening to become an unrestricted free agent when nearly every team has max cap space is something you never ever have seen before.   "
Exactly I think everyone is just trying to accept Kevin Durant but you don't have to be butt hurt to admit he's soft and his rings do have a negative context with them. 
FUCK Kevin Durant but if you mean to tell me that MJ is a better scorer than him then your a brainwashed espn follower. Durant is the greatest and most efficient scorer of all time. If my life was on the line to stop a player I’d rather have a crack at MJ than KD
"If you still take issue with what I'm saying, how about you read this quote from the man himself:  &gt;Steph Curry is the face of the franchise, and that helps me out, because I don't have to,” Durant said. “I don't want to have to be the leader. I'm not a leader. I'm bad at saying, ‘Stand behind me and follow me.’ No. I'm one of those guys that's just like, ‘Let's do this shit together. Let's just work everybody together. I don't mind being on the front line with you, but let's come and do it together.’ That's my way of leadership.

"I saw Kevin Durant at a reptile store in San Francisco one year ago. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “hsss? hsss? hsss?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to slither out the doors with like fifteen Chocolate Snakes in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical interference,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by hissing really loudly."
"This game doesn't get talked about enough. It's the difference between this Warriors dynasty winning 3 chips in 4 years with the presumption of a 4th already laid on them and being 50% in Finals series with serious doubts about the title favorite this year.  It changes Chris Paul and James Harden's legacy from possibly the two greatest players never to win a title to contention for greatest championship backcourt in league history (I'm assuming they also defeat the Cavs, maybe a big assumption given Houston's injuries/fatigue this series... But man, this gets even crazier if Houston wins and LeBron manages to beat them in the finals...).  Suddenly, the Rockets are the new powerhouse, the Warriors become, not arguably the greatest dynasty in the modern NBA, but one of the biggest disappointments... Wildly successful, but regularly getting beat on the biggest stage.  Are we asking ourselves if Kevin Durant was bad for the Warriors if 3 or 4 of those shots fall? If it's time to trade Klay for another playmaker? Who knows?!  And it all came down to a ridiculously flukey Game 7 where one of the greatest shooting teams of all time couldn't crack 16% from downtown.  This is arguably one of the 10 or 15 most important games in NBA history given how much it could have changed the league's narrative, how close it was, and how weird the deciding factor was."

Not to mention the fact that every picture of Kawhi hes surrounded by like 4 raptors coaches lol"
"Lol LeBron had Kyrie and Kevin love. You acting like these players are bums. Durant was against LeBron, Bosh and wade. And only had Russ. Who had injuries as well. "
"&gt; So you think it’d be better if he spent his whole career never winning just so he could “have a backbone?”   No, he could have just tried to win in OKC  or if he really didnt like Russ, he couldve tried to win with literally any other team in the league but the already stacked team that just knocked him out after he blew a 3-1 lead.  Kevin Durant literally deserves 100% of the criticism he gets, and he's the most butthurt one on this planet about it."
&gt; What I don't get is why KD would want to go to another superteam  Because he's Kevin Durant...
"Kevin Durant was drafted in 2007 and he was the second pick and I'd take him over Wade. Chris Paul was drafted with the 4th pick, I think he has an argument over Wade too. Then you got Harden and Curry in the 2009 draft which were both non number 1 picks.   "
I think we all need to start signing our posts with our names.  \-Kevin Durant
"&gt; Frank and Kobe are da same height as LeBron, who is the same height as Kevin Love, who is the same height as Kevin Durant.  fixed"
OKC trading away James Harden and losing Kevin Durant due to ownership incompetence.
"On the Durant tweet:  context:  &gt;Spoke to a source today who confirmed Kevin Durant will be a LA Laker next year.   &gt;“Just like LeBron planned his move LA a year or more earlier, #KD is doing the same right now.

"""confirmed that Kevin Durant will be an LA Laker next year"" Man this season hasn't even started and we're confirming where superstars are gonna go next year"
The NFL list is: 1) Aaron Rodgers 2) Matt Ryan 3)Kirk Cousins 4) Jimmy Garrappolo 5) Matthew Stafford 6) Derek Carr 7) Drew Brees 8)Andrew Luck 9) Khalil Mack 10) Alex Smith  The NBA list is:1) Steph Curry 2) LeBron James 3)Russel Westbrook 4) Chris Paul 5) James Harden 6) Blake Griffin 7) Gordan Hayward 8) Paul George 9) Mike Conley 10) Kevin Durant   Its NBA players and its not even a question.   
Kevin Durant would join the NFL players what you talking about
Khalil Mack vs Kevin Durant lmao what you think 
Kevin Durant is taking the hardest road. Gave up 3 peats to join LBJ try to win a championship less Lakers in x years.  The Hardest Road

Lakers Rumors: Kevin Durant is considering joining LeBron James and the Lakers to form the greatest duo in NBA history while becoming the face of the Laker franchise after LeBron retires #LakersRumors #KevinDurant #LeBronJames  &amp;#x200B;
"Kevin Durant is a more intelligent basketball player than Lebron?  I don't think that is true. He arguably has somewhat better shot selection (quite arguable, IMO), but it's almost to his detriment. He has been known to refuse to attempt half-court heaves because of concerns that the misses would hurt his efficiency."
KD is a snake  &gt; Kevin Durant will be joining the Lakers next year  Well the black mamba is a snake. Welcome Kevin Durant to our snake team! Team Snake! Hisssss 🐍 🏆 
"Uh dude the FO is a huge factor, the cavs in 2017 was virtually identical to the their 2016 team even though their biggest threat added Kevin Durant. They played through a huge chunk of that season without a backup point guard and a back up big. This led to TT being played a ridiculous amount of minutes which was probably responsible for his knee flaring up, now he’s a shell of his former self( though lue didn’t help by allowing him to play through injuries). This also led to guys like Lebron and Kyrie playing too many minutes in the regular season. Had the cavs FO done the smart thing which would be trading love(after a terrible finals performance) for a package of highly capable role players that can defend and shoot the 3 then perhaps they would have been able to compete with GS. Also some of the contracts they gave out really hindered their ability sign quality FAs( you can blame Lebron all you want to but it was ultimately their decision to bow down to his every command, the Heat didn’t allow themselves to be pushed around but the cavs did)   If the cavs had a well run FO similar to the Celtics they would be in a much better position. And this was just me being kind because there are tons of other things they failed to address for example they knew the cavs had one of the worst defenses in the league and they did nothing to try and improve it, they had no foresight especially since they knew that they were a lock to see the warriors again.   A great FO matters, nobody wants to play for an organization that is incapable of understanding and responding to the needs of the team."
KD is a snake  &gt; Kevin Durant will be a LA Laker next year  KD is just misunderstood
so he should just go to the most well-run organizations?  are you the Black Luka Doncic or are you a slimy Kevin Durant?

"Alternate title: Klay Thompson fucks beta Kevin Durant into submission, forces him to join team after humiliating him in front of his family. "
Klay is like the perfect modern NBA player.  It's kinda crazy that the team with Steph Curry + Kevin Durant relies on him so much.
Kevin “The Big Slither” Durant put i to bed.
"&gt; So your lame ass going by ""u/wexted"" now huh? Haha whats up punk, it's u/AbstrActivities from r/nba. Remember me? Me and the guys used to run ya team at the WCF before finals. Sorry you were just punk lil b***h. I can see not much has changed. Remember Kevin Durant the girl you had a crush on? Yeah I put a ring on that ass . I make over 400k a year and drive a Rolls Royce Phantom. I guess some things never change huh punk? Nice catching up. SMH. Pathetic..  "
Well at least you get  to see him play one last season. Manu gave no warning and god dammit I wish I watched more San Antonio games just for him. I didn't watch much of him in the playoffs because thanks to Kevin Durant I knew who was gonna win

We drafted Greg Oden over Kevin Durant. We signed Meyers Leonard to big money and let Ed Davis walk. We are not a free agent destination.  We got swept by the Pelicans. Mostly hurt about not drafting Durant though... or Jordan.
Kevin Durant

Stephen Curry/CP3  Klay Thompson/Harden  Kevin Durant/Baylor  Draymond Green/Malone  Dwight/Ewing
"Rodman is a pretty good seller, man. That finish to the match though. I guess you could make it come off as Mailman not knowing tag team wrestling rules, but still lmao. At least let him take the pin and not DDP.  It's still mind-boggling to me how the Jazz and Bulls let them do this, and even take bumps. Even if it's a month after the Finals ended. What makes it crazier is that they're superstar players. This would be like if Kevin Durant and Kevin Love decided to join a match at Summerslam this year."
&gt; has save GS multiples times in big games  Sure but is that because they needed to be saved or because they knew Durant could save them?  &gt; No team that replaces Kevin Durant with Harrison Barnes is half as good.  I am of the opinion that the 2015 Warriors played better relative to talent than the 2018 Warriors
"That makes sense, but Durant is the single most automatic scorer in the league and has save GS multiples times in big games. No team that replaces Kevin Durant with Harrison Barnes is half as good."
"Man, we took a team with Steph Curry and mother fucking Kevin Durant to 7 games. We'd toast that older squad. "
"Depth is horrendous. Better this year (we got Austin Rivers, a good attacking guard, Jeff Green, a DC Georgetown native who has a lot of experience but is very streaky, and drafted Troy Brown, who should be pretty good).     We don’t have much leadership. Our coach, Scott Brooks, couldn’t do too much with Kevin Durant, Westbrook, and Harden in OKC. He did enough, but seems to plateau in the playoffs. I love John Wall and think he’s a top 4 PG in the league, but there doesn’t seem to be as much unity and rallying around his leadership as I’d like.    Dwight Howard should hopefully be an upgrade over Gortat, and I’m excited for Kelly Oubre’s development. I think he’s our defensive anchor. Otto Porter is very overpaid IMO, but hopefully he’ll demand the ball more and be a bit more of an offensive focus.    I think this is our season. Wall relies on his athleticism, which isn’t a forever kind of quality. He and Beal have played together for 4-5 years now, and their chemistry won’t get better. He and Dwight should be able to run the pick and roll pretty well. But if nothing happens this year (goals are ECF and 50+ win season), then I think the team moves Beal, Wall, or both during the off-season. "
Man the amount of salt towards this man. This is true. Kevin Durant is indeed on pace to become the greatest scorer in nba history
A little bit different situations 1. In baseball one player doesn’t make as much of an impact as in Basketball 2. While Edwin Encarnacion is a great baseball player Kevin Durant is the second best player in the league while EE isn’t even top 10 3. Toronto was clearly on the downturn and wasn’t gonna be contending whereas if KD stays in OKC they are at least in the WCF the next year again
Paul George and Kevin Durant
I mean it just depends on the situation.     Kevin durant couldnt win a championship without joining a team that was already capable of doing it without him.   Charles Barkley Stockton Nash Malone etc are all all time greats who couldnt win.    Hell lebron James cant win right now.     The problem isnt westbrooks playstyle. Its talent.     Warriors arent out there outsmarting people or winning because of playstyle.    They just have way more talent than any competition.        So yeah if westbrook had 3 more alll stars on his team sure he could.
"When did Lebron lock down Kevin Durant? Durant scored 30 ppl on 65 ts%. I don’t know specifically what it was with Lebron on him. Perhaps that tells a different story, butv I’ve never seen that. I also don’t remember  Lebron being Durant’s kryptonite ever, but it would make sense that it’s harder to stop a more experienced KD.  Perhaps your bias against KD is clouding your view here.  "
"All this board becomes is garbage posts about Kevin Durant, then."
"Not really. He's been an amazing player for a while, just didn't get his due, and his team and coaching staff were not up to par. He was small and skinny, and similar to Conley, didn't put up a lot of shots, so casuals weren't in love with him. Sadly for Conley he's stuck in a super small market playing 80s basketball while he's one of the best point guards of the decade. At least Curry got a modern coach and good teammates at some point.    Player|PIPM| :--|:--| Devin Booker - 2017/18|-1.3| DeMar DeRozan - 2017/18|+1.5| Stephen Curry - 2011/12|+2.1| Kyrie Irving - 2017/18|+2.3| Stephen Curry - 2013/14|+5.5| Mike Conley - 2012/13|+5.8| Kevin Durant - 2016/17 (GSW)|+5.9| Russell Westbrook - 2016/17 (MVP)|+6.7| Stephen Curry - 2016/17 (KDs 1st year)|+8.8|  Curry has always been extremely underrated. He was seen as a ""shooter"" early on, while he was already an MVP level player under Mark Jackson. His boxscore stats have never been *extremely* impressive a la Russ, but they were still very good. Curry casually averages almost 7 assists for his career, while playing alongside David Lee, Monta Ellis, Stephen Jackson, Jarret Jack, etc, and under Mark Jackson. The Warriors were 12th in ORtg in 2013, which says enough of Jacksons coaching.  Curry is the ultimate plug and play guard. He fits **every team**, and contrary to popular belief, he's an average defender, and sometimes even a good one. He doesn't have Durants height, but he's smart, quick in the passing lanes, stays in front of his man and stays focused.  ------------  If Player Impact Plus Minus doesn't work for you, Curry has been at the top of RPM since it was created. 6th in 2013, and 1st in 2014, top 4 **at least** since then.   He just never got the credit he deserved until he averaged 30ppg, since there's people that still believe Harden should have won MVP in 2015 (lol)  Something similar happens to Draymond, where his alltime great defensive presence is undermined.  Meanwhile KD for some reason is though of as a good defender, and people think Klay is prime Sidney Moncrief, while he's very average on the defensive end.  "

"Your list of players is too old. Take a look at how many players north of 31 are the best at their position in past years... Usually, it's all guys in the 24-30 range. Like, this past year...

PG: Chris Paul (23)   SG: Kobe Bryant (30)   SF: Lebron (23)   PF: Kevin Garnett (32)   C: Dwight Howard (24)  It's really only MVP level talents that remain at the top of their position into their 30s... Guys like Duncan and Lebron. ANd even then, there's a good chance a major injury or a pile of small injuries will slow you down enough that you fall out of that top echelon in your early 30s. "
People on this subreddit talk down on fans making fun of other teams because their own is worse and now people on the subreddit are talking down on fans that make fun of other teams because their team is... better?  Rivalry between teams fans is fun. Yankees/Sox series aren't fun just because the games can be good games but because the fans hate the other team. If it was all left out on the court there would be little to no room for banter. It's like the only person you can still make fun of is Kevin Durant smh.
"&gt;The face of the best team in the league and on a journey to 3-peat,   Durant might be not be a likable guy, but this is a basketball question/issue, not a personal one..

Kevin Durant..   &gt;   &gt;2x MVP in his prime.  LMFAO that's cute. Don't even go to career accomplishments.

Kevin Durant
"&gt;  Kevin Durant just outplayed him back to back finals and the warriors whooped him  Durant hasnt outplayed shit in a toilet. And 5 players with 4 all stars ""whooping"" one guy does not make him worse. them needing to add an all star after choking so hard in 2016 should honestly make him better."
"&gt; But Kevin Durant just outplayed him back to back finals  KD had 28.8/10.8/7.5 on 52/40/96 whereas Lebron had 34/8.5/10 on 52/33/84. It isn't as though KD stomped him.   &gt; [A]nd the warriors whooped him.  Wanna switch Lebron and KD and see what happens?  &gt; D is a top 3 defensive Big in the game while averaging almost as many as LeBron  As many what? Skittles? Ford Escapes?  &gt; [A]nd elevating his team the way LeBron does in a much harder conference.   Lebron led a team to the finals at *age 23*...  &gt; LeBron is a bad defender now.  Bullshit. *You're* a bad defender now.  &gt; Steph Curry actually makes his teammates better by the spacing he brings and his facilitating ability.  Lebron averaged over 9AST/game last season. Is that *not* facilitating?   &gt; LeBron makes his teammates worse by his iso ball.  See above...  &gt; And 15-16 showed he can be better than LeBron offensively.  Ok...  &gt; Harden is better than LeBron in the regular season, and consistently.  Profound analysis there. I'd start your dissertation w/ this. "

"If the Knicks get KD then we can talk (Although that would undercut any argument about Kyrie being ""the guy"" in New York). I'm not convinced that getting to play with 30 year old Jimmy Butler (he turned 29 today so he'd be 30 by the time the 2019-20 season started) coming off two more years of Thibs minutes is as appetizing as the New York media likes to think it is.   &gt;He'd be the guy who saved the Knicks, leading the team with KD  It's really hard for me to see how you can spin Kyrie and KD teaming up as ""Kyrie leads KD and Knicks to a title.""   &gt;I think Kyrie cares about that. It sounds silly, but I think that'll be something he thinks about when he makes his decision.  I think this is completely media-driven with no basis in reality. Tatum was the leading scorer on the Celtics in the postseason and him and Kyrie go party at clubs together (they also attend Duke games together), but we're supposed to believe there's some lingering resentment? That Kyrie will hate being overshadowed by Jayson Tatum and so he'll go play with Kevin Durant? I just don't see any scenario where all of Kyrie's supposed goals are met by going to New York.  "
"2078: The Warriors have ascended into Eternal Nirvana.

"Yeah, but the 3+ all-stars thing didn't really become a thing until the Celtics in 08. And that's my point. LeBron lost to a team with really just one absolutely elite level player in 2011 (Dirk). The Western Conference in Kobe/Shaq days was a bloodbath. Spurs, Suns, Blazers, Kings, etc. all had great teams. Jordan had to face the Jazz (Stockton and Malone), the Magic Lakers, Drexler's Blazers, the Payton/Kemp Sonics, etc. The 2 stars vs 2 stars thing was more evenly matched back in the 90s and early 2000s. The Celtics broke it, LeBron exacerbated it, and let's not even bother talking about Kevin Durant. "
"&gt; He played significantly more at the 3 than the 2 last season  I mean this is factually incorrect.  He was a shooting guard in every lineup that he played in last year and his entire career so I have no clue where you are getting that from other than height...like Kevin Durant isnt a big.. OG Anunoby was the Raptors SF. On defense, Demar guards the worst offensive threat 2 or or 3 like most team's offensive 1st options with physical versatility do (see Lebron, Harden, etc). OG, like most versatile defensive anchors, just takes the tougher matchup.   &gt; he's not a primary initiator  Again this is factually incorrect. He's led the Raptors in USG% each year under the Lowry/DeMar era. Especially last year where Lowry took a more off ball role. And because Lowry is such an elite off ball catch and shoot 3pt threat, it made sense to run the offense primarily in the hands of DeMar. As someone who watched the team, it was 60/40 DeMar initiating the offense.   Again, for guards, the average TS% is lower than the league average. 53-54TS% is typical so DeMar at 55% TS% is an efficient volume threat that puts intense pressure on defenses and opens up the floor for others when hes on ball"
Where does Kevin Durant get his haircut.
"If anyone here is familiar with PID control, theres 3 coefficients used: **Kd, Ki, and Kp**. AKA **Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and Kristaps Porzingis**. AKA KNICKS 2019-2020 ROSTER."

Kevin Durant bitchslapped the Thunder and then shit on their faces. 
"Serge Ibaka yelled ""There you go!"" Kyle Singler gave a look of pleasant surprise. Cameron Payne belted ""We got a fucking squad now."" And before Kevin Durant hit the locker room door Steven Adams hugged him &amp; said ""stop being a fucking wanker mate"""
They'd have to win 73ish games. People forget the Warriors are under performing in the regular season for the talent they have. They were a 73 win team and they added KEVIN DURANT. There is no reason why they shouldn't be winning 70 games AT LEAST every year.

The Mavs take a 3-2 series lead over the Lakers behind the resurgence of Dirk Nowitzki. Game 6 in LA against the Mavericks, Lebron James drop 75 points and makes up for past demons.  The Lakers make the Finals. The Raptors meet them there. The Raptors win in 7. Lebron James is named FMVP. Kawhi Leonard stays in Toronto. Anthony Davis joins the Lakers. Kevin Durant joins the Mavericks."
"Yes, everyone's going to be rooting for that scrappy, gritty, LeBron James/Kevin Durant Lakers underdog story."
"Alright. Kevin Durant's best scoring season he averaged 32ppg. Allen Iverson's best scoring season he averaged 33ppg, oh look at that Iverson was a better scorer than Durant.  Get the fuck outta here. You consider everything, their whole careers, all the information that is available."
Picking your own nickname seems like a very Kevin Durant thing to do so it's not particularly mind blowing to me.
KEVIN DURANT 2020
"What's even more mind blowing is that upon dismissing Slim Reaper as a nickname, KD suggested an alternate preference:  The Servant  &amp;#x200B;  [http://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/10474968/kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-wants-called-servant](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/10474968/kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-wants-called-servant)"

Always take the easy way out. -Kevin Durant
&gt; I don't get the hype for Ingram at all. Seems to me he's just another guy.  He has very similar tools and body type to that Kevin Durant fellow while turning 21 about a month ago
"For sure. His Kevin Durant pick might be validated by KD in 2013-14, but that's still years off. Chuck's picks were... unconventional, to say the least.  Steve Kerr ended up winning it all, with 29% to Reggie Miller's 26%. Kevin McHale had 15%, Chuck and Kenny had 13%, and Chris Webber only got 4% of the vote."
"If Kevin Durant had come out and said, ""It's gonna be tough having everyone give us their best night in and night out"" and had left out the part where he tried to make it sound like all other decisions he could have made would be easier than playing for the Warriors, sure.   And KD continues to be out of touch to this day. It's not like he said this and then elaborated on what he meant. He's sticking to his guns. Dude can't figure out what he's doing to make people not respect the way he's winning.  And who cares if he feels the pressure? KD could retire tomorrow and the Warriors would still be contenders. "
"He also led the league in PER (Player Efficiency Rating) 30.6, second was Kevin Durant 27.6, 3rd Kawhi 27..6, 4th Anthony Davis 27.5, 5th James Harden 27.4, 6th LeBron James 27.0. Other metrics he led the league in: Value over replacement player, offensive box plus/minus, as well as box plus/minus, and assist percentage. Contributing to your argument though is that he had one of the highest usage rates of all time and recorded one of the all time highest missed field goals.  I don't know how Russ' rebounds would have changed playing in the 90s, I don't know of a player at the point guard position that you could objectively compare his athleticism to.  "

"1) They recently changed draft lottery numbers to deter teams from tanking  2) Teams tanking lose money certainly, they literally are betting on themselves  3) For every Allen Iverson there is an Anthony Bennett. For every Kevin Durant there is a Darko. Giannis, PG, and Kawhi were all drafted in the teens. More of a crap shoot than anything when trying to pick between the 4th ranked 19 year old and the 12th ranked 19 year old.  4) Teams like the Kings and TWolves have had loads of high picks the last ten years, look how that turned out."
Kevin Durant /thread
"I'm still not sold on Ingram - I don't see the superstar potential.  I don't disagree that he's the five tool equivalent player of basketball - he can shoot, dribble, has length, etc.  But to me, that makes his ceiling Lamar Odom.  I don't see the next Kevin Durant.  I really hope I'm wrong though."
"You guys keep saying you had injuries but so did everyone else. OKC lost Roberson. Chris Paul missed time. Kevin Durant missed time. Ingram missed 23 games Steph Curry missed *31 games*.  Jimmy Butler. Rudy Gobert. Kawhi Leonard. And on and on it goes. All these teams still made the playoffs and were significantly better than the Lakers despite key injuries. Plus, it is highly likely Lonzo and Ingram get injured and miss more games this year that's just how injury prone players are. Without Lebron you'd be lucky to win 35 games again considering how the bottom teams in the West got better (Phoenix and Dallas)."
"undoubtedly the best 3 year span of drafting  2007 draft: Kevin Durant at 2  2008 draft: Russell Westbrook at 4, Serge Ibaka at 24  2009 draft: James Harden at 3"
"This narrative is tired.  Yes, they go hard at Curry, and in the NBA, most of the time, good offense beats good defense anyway, so when he's the primary target, he's going to get beat a lot.  It's not because he's *bad*. It's because if your options are a recent DPOY in Green, one of the most elite wing defenders in Klay Thompson, a 7-footer who moves like a guard in Kevin Durant, and one of a bunch of other players who are all bigger than Curry and mostly also good defenders... you're going to target the 6'3"" guard."
"I honestly don't hate curry and Thompson, it's Kevin Durant, he's a snake, a true beta, he lost to the Warriors in the conference finals and then after losing because he couldn't win with his own team , he jointed the enemy, it's pathetic, goes against the competitive spirit "
"When people compare Westbrook to Steph, I just tell them to look at the shooting percentages. Then they tell me “ but Westbrook has way better stats” I then tell them to look at the usage percentage and turnover rate. Steph is in a different league to every other player not named Lebron James and Kevin Durant. "
"Others have said this, its more about effort and an aggressive attitude more than anything else. He is so laid back and he rarely gets angry or shows a ton of emotion. That makes people think he doesn't put in effort, when in reality he does. Wiggins is definitely not living up to his hype, but the shit I just read from these other comments is just ridiculous.   ""Some people are just content with being average instead of striving to be the best version of themselves"" This is said about a basketball player who is one of the most athletic in the NBA, who can drive past most other players in the NBA. He is legitimately one of the best at doing a post spin move ever, absolutely doesn't have the finishing or handles, but that is improving.   ""He's lazy, doesn't hustle back on defense, his heart isn't in his plays, gives up easily, is beaten out by players with inferior physical skills, but more dedicated drives."" LOL, Wiggins is almost always the first back on defense and is one of the Wolves best defenders. This is the same r/nba circlejerk bullshit that gets repeated over and over until people believe it. Wiggins historically is a negative defender, since the second half of last year he has become a positive man defender, just watch him play and its pretty obvious.   ""When you watch some guys you can tell they are their just for a paycheck , i don’t watch Wiggins so idk if that’s the case but i think that’s what they mean"" I dont watch Wiggins but I'll throw out my opinion. Worthless.  ""It means he doesn't put in the time like a Curry or LeBron. Those guys' lives are dedicated to their bodies and spending every bit of time they can to improve and get an edge. That is the gold standard of professionalism in the NBA, and every player will be held up and compared to guys like that when it comes to work ethic."" Classic case of causation vs. correlation, just because Curry and Lebron are amazing doesn't mean they train more than others or ""put in the time."" Wiggins is making over $30 million a year, if you are accusing him of not practicing you better have stats to back up your claims or admit this is bullshit you spewed cause you were bored browsing r/nba like me.   ""He doesn't really apply himself"" Same can be said about this comment.   ""He's a draft bust going after money. I would be okay if he was something like Carmelo or Dwight Howard that he had actual decent skill to back up the want for serious cash."" Has Wiggins lived up to his potential or his hype? No, I don't think many people would claim that. But is he a bust? Hell no, he is becoming an above average all around defender and we are all hoping his shot continues to improve. Besides that, ""At 22 years and 349 days, Wiggins is the sixth-youngest player to hit that mark (6,000 career points). Those quicker than him were LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady. All Hall of Famers and certainly not bad company.""   So many of you make this case that Wiggins is undeserving of even playing in the NBA, that the Wolves should just start Tyus instead, or some bullshit like that. It honestly makes me think that many of you have never played basketball in your life. Im not talking college or even high school, like you never even shot hoops with friends or played a pickup game. If you have you would know that the freakish athleticism that Wiggins displays every single game is deserving of patience and makes his potential so much more than average.   I hope you all get someone in your life who judges you as you judge Wiggins.   "

Kevin Durant and losing shoes name a better duo
"Atlanta: Anthony Davis because his brow reminds me of the eagle from the Muppets and eagles are bros with hawks.  Boston: IT. The guy is already a little annoying leprechaun.  Brooklyn: Kawhi because he's an ice cold gangsta.  Charlotte: Michael Beasley. Get it?? ROFL bad puns.  Chicago: Dwight ""The Minotaur"" Howard. Seriously, have you seen the size of that guy?  Cleveland: Need a squeaky clean hero to lead the charge? Look no further than Gordon Hayward.  Dallas: Kyle ""The Kid"" Korver and his six-shooters. Bang Bang!!  Denver: Kyle O'Quinn. He looks like what I imagine a gold miner from the 1870s would look like.  Detroit: Butler. He just strikes me as a car guy.  Golden State: Adams and Baynes. Waaaaarriors!!  Houston: Jeremy Lin, the only guy smart enough to play b-ball and work at NASA.  Indianapolis: Klay Thompson. It's always the quiet nice guys that drive like maniacs.  LAC: Wade/Melo/LeBron.

Miami: Horford because he's just so damn hot!  Milwaukee: The Morris twins. Throw a set of antlers on them and you got a couple of moose (plural form).  Minnesota: Ingram. He looks like a half-transformed Teen Wolf already.  New Orleans: Boban Marjanovic. It's all about that beak.  New York: Westbrook, he's probably the only guy that has a pair of stylish knickerbockers already.  OKC: Embiid because everything about that go is so bloody loud.  Orlando: Porzingis. If you already believe in unicorns then you might as well believe in magic also.  Philadelphia: Devon Booker. He's already part of the 70's club.  Phoenix: Doncic, the rising star of this draft class.  Portland: JR Smith and Nick Young because you know they blaze.  Sacramento: LeBron. But wait, he's already on the Clippers?!? Doesn't matter, peasant rules don't apply to Kings.  San Antonio: Joe Harris because he's an amazing player that plays good basketball and deserves to be the 6th Man of the Year. Enough said.  Toronto: Kevin Durant. Moves fast? Check. Killer attacks? Check. Will eat your babies? Double check.  Utah: Lonzo Ball and Dame so they can broaden our musical needs.  Washington: Rondo. Wizard hat. Picture it. Perfect. "
"&gt; Look at the teams the Cavs and Heat have lost to over the yrs. Except for KD, none of those teams had great shot creators.  Oh boy. There's a lot of wrong here. First of all, put some respect on Dirk Nowitski's name. In his prime, and during the 2011 playoffs especially, he could get a decent shot in the mid to high post with his turnaround jumper literally whenever he wanted. It's silly to say he wasn't a great shot creator. More importantly, they lost that series because Lebron choked, which was independent of the system they were running.  Second, the 2010 Celtics team had a sub-par offense, ranking 15th in offensive rating. They beat the Cavaliers because they were more talented. Mo Williams shot poorly during the playoffs, and they gave 23 minutes per game that series to a Shaquile O'Neal who was utterly washed up.  Third, they lost to the Spurs in 2014 partially because of excellent shot creation by Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, and Manu Ginobli (each had 35% or less of their 2pt shots assisted), and partially because Dwyane Wade's body was broken down.  Fourth, Steph Curry is one of the best shot creators in the league. He runs off of a lot of screens, but he can take anyone [off the dribble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3Onh4kNAOo). NBA.com doesn't have the numbers for the 2015 season, but in 2016, he was in the 94th percentile for isolation efficiency both in the [regular season](https://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/?Season=2015-16&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=PlayerFirstName*E*steph) and the [playoffs](https://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/?Season=2015-16&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;CF=PlayerFirstName*E*steph). More importantly, the Cavs didn't lose because their system was inherently flawed. They lost because their second and third best players got injured and couldn't play.  &gt; Btw, that usage rate you quoted for Kyrie is a 20% range. If that was a decrease, that alone is enough to want to leave.  What a disingenous way of framing the numbers. Did you really think that would slip past anybody? First of all, every player's usage rate fluctuates from year to year even without adding another superstar. For example, Demar Derozan went from 34.3% usage in 2017 to 29.6% usage in 2018.   Second, he got plenty of touches while playing with Lebron. It's not as if he always got above 31% without Lebron and always got below 26% with Lebron. He had *one season* where his usage rate was 26%, which is still pretty high. The two other years, his usage was 29.5% and 30.8%, which is a superstar usage rate. For comparison, Steph's usage rate with Durant was 30.1% and 31.0%. This means that Kyrie (who is worse than Curry, by the way) got almost the same amount of touches as another top point guard playing with a great forward. Most importantly, **in the 2017 season, his usage rate was higher than Lebron's!** 30.0% to 30.8% Kyrie had *nothing* to complain about as far as touches go.  &gt; LeBron has always had stamina problems. Those problems haven't gone away...he played off the ball on defense and gives no effort.  Not really. He's only really stopped playing defense the past 2 seasons. He was on the All-Defensive Second Team as recently as 2014. In 2017, his health wasn't great (only played 74 games, which is low for Lebron). In 2018, he didn't have much of a choice but to rest on defense because after Kyrie left and Isaiah Thomas failed to recover from his injury, and Dwyane Wade left, Lebron was the only player who could create offense. It wasn't by design.  &gt; Your response suggest the only offensiveoption is for player A to drive and players B and C to spot up and wait for a shot.  I'm responding to your comment in the other chain here. I didn't literally just mean spotting up. Even if the other players are coming off a screen, cutting to the basket, or rolling after setting a pick, it still makes sense to put the ball in Lebron's hands as much as possible, since he's a far superior passer to Love or Bosh. It's also a myth that the Cavs had this incredibly stagnant offense. They were [13th in frequency of screens used](https://stats.nba.com/teams/off-screen/?sort=Time&amp;dir=1) and [9th in cuts](https://stats.nba.com/teams/cut/?sort=Time&amp;dir=1) this year. Granted, they were 25th in use of the roll man, but that's because Kevin Love isn't that great of a roll man, [ranking only in the 59th percentile](https://stats.nba.com/players/roll-man/?CF=PlayerFirstName*E*kevin:TeamNameAbbreviation*E*cle) this year and the [22nd percentile](https://stats.nba.com/players/roll-man/?CF=PlayerFirstName*E*kevin:TeamNameAbbreviation*E*cle&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) last year. It makes sense that they ran a lot of isolation plays because they ranked 9th in isolation efficiency as a team.  &gt;You fail to understand that the Cavs (ie LeBron) built their roster specifically to play this style and fired Blatt because he didn't agree. If you believe that the Cavs wanted to play a different style but were forced into LeBron ball due to their roster, I shouldn't even be responding.  In 2018 they were *absolutely* forced to play have Lebron dominate the ball due to their roster. In the prior years, they could have ran more stuff off the ball, but they didn't need to. Their offense was great and they won a title (they might have won 2 if not for injuries) with that style. In 2017, The Cav's offensive rating in the Finals was 114.6, which was elite and would have been just behind Houston for 3rd in the league. The problem was they (like all teams) had no defensive answer for Golden State's firepower. Running Kyrie off more screens and setting up cuts for Love wouldn't have prevented Durant from dominating in the Finals. "
Are you roziers dad doing damage control or something? Pulling a kevin durant eh?
"Ben Simmons  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounpo  Kristaps Porzingis  Rudy Gobert  I call this the ""What the Kings think they will be"" team. "
Surprised [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BnZ_wpiCMAEwgm-.jpg) isn't the pick used for Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant happened. And yes they are 
"Eric Gordon is an absolute bull dog. HE has a reputation of playing no defense from his time in NOP which at the time was fine but he's come along way since he's decided to give a shit on that end.   His off ball defense is still questionable but as an on ball defender he's a legitimate above average defender.   They would ask him to be able ot take on anybody for stretches of time, from 1's all the way to [LeBron James](https://on.nba.com/2O9eL5s). There was a game in particular in late March vs Detroit and Blake Griffin where they asked him time and time again to switch onto him and he [did every time and held up well](https://on.nba.com/2OdnHXK). In the playoffs [him on Kevin Durant ended up being a total non issue](https://on.nba.com/2Obxvl5)  One of the biggest reasons Hou's switching scheme works is because of how many guards they have who are quite comfortable routinely having to take on bigger players. They aren't mismatches.  "

"I think it was at Henson's request, but still, never should've happened lol. I remember something about Henson wanting to be the next Kevin Durant."
"maybe not ever, but this has been a situation for quite a while now.

"Yes he has. Did you watch the playoffs before Kawhi went down to Zaza? He was destroying and toying with teams. He was playing like the best player in the world. He was money from 3 and controlled the pace of the game. He was crazy good against the Grizzlies and was the best offensive player on the floor on a court that had Lamarcus Aldridge, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson playing.   Now, while that's a ""sample size,"" I would say its a pretty damn impressive one. And its not enough to move him over Steph, Durant, or Lebron.....I would say he is easily better than everyone else on the least except Harden. But if I have to pick an offensive player in the playoffs I'm taking Kawhi over Harden. Assuming he's back to his normal self"
"Oh I am 100% on the Curry is underrated train. Like everyone knows he’s is ridiculously good but I don’t think everyone quite understands how ridiculous he really is. Even with KD on the roster the entire offense revolves around the defense having to pressure Curry as soon as he crosses half court. When other teams are willing to give Kevin Durant the chance to beat them so they can double and triple team Curry to try to take him out of the game, that should tell you something."
"1. Cap smoothing isn't dead forever.  There might be more motivation to get it done in the next negotiation period. 2. It's just as likely that someone's eventually going to get the absolute best end of the stick.  After all, the most visible effect of the lack of cap smoothing this time around was a 73-win team signing Kevin Durant."
Harrison Barnes as your third leading scorer wouldn't lead to the dominance you've seen now. Kevin Durant upped the ante for Golden State. 
"If Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant both decided that they really want to be MVP this season, I don't think it would be out of the realm of possibility of the Warriors to get to 74 wins this season.  Outside of the Curry/Durant Warriors (which was a unique situation), I would think the 8-74 becomes more likely. "
"But how much ""mileage"" does he have, exactly?  In butler's 7-year nba career, he has logged around 15,000 minutes at the age of 29  Now, Kevin durant is 30-years-old and has played 29,000 minutes in 11 years  Is that a lot of mileage     "
"LeBron and Kevin Durant. That 2016 Warriors team was on their last legs until Durant decided to join up. Now that LBJ is in the genesis of slowing down and Durant might leave next summer, you could be seeing more parity. "
If this post were made 8 days earlier:  Damian Lillard/JR Smith/Jayson Tatum/Kevin Durant/Nikola Jokic  Also I start JR and Tatum for 2 seconds before I sub in Klay Thompson and LeBron James.

"There's a very good chance that Kevin Durant would sign for Seattle in free agency, so we would need to keep enough cap space for him. Even if Durant himself didn't sign, you'd want to have enough room for at least one max contract anyway.  That said, we could still afford Paul Millsap if we didn't take on too many other high contracts."
Kevin Durant is always the most disappointing player.

"A brief explanation:  &gt;!The player is Zaza Pachulia. The first two lines reference an earlier part of his career. During the 2008 playoffs, he was elbowed by Kevin Garnett. Later in the series, he said his famous ""Nothing easy! We're going to game 7!"" line. The second two lines are about his second highest-profile injury in 2017. In a game against the Wizards during the regular season, Marcin Gortat, the Polish Hammer, threw Zaza Pachulia out of the way to get a rebound. Zaza landed on and injured Kevin Durant, who ended up sitting out most of the season.!&lt;"
"I mean, nobody will ever know. Just like how JJ Barea is not 6’ and Kevin Durant is taller than 6’9 but that’s how they’re listed. Unless they get officially remeasured, we won’t know. "
"It always evens out in their favor. They could be without Curry but happens if the Rockets are without CP3? Lol look at their roster. It's still Kevin Durant surrounded by all-stars.  Look at their history of injured opponents: Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Kawhi Leonard (twice!), and Chris Paul. Look at those names it's ridiculous."
Not draft Michael Jordan or Kevin Durant
"without reading any replies,  a. James Harden  b. Anthony Davis  c. LeBron James  d. Kevin Durant  e. Stephen Curry  f. Lillard?  g. Kyrie Irving  h. Russell Westbrook  i. Paul George or Kawhi.

"Well he had a lot of quotes last night.  Good article is [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com/amphtml/sports/kevin-durant-feels-love-nbas-return-seattle-032654404--nba.html)  ''I thought it was very fitting I came here representing the whole city,'' Durant said.  I think he feels a bigger connection to Seattle then he did with OKC. Just my personal opinion though"
**Kevin Durant wants to know your location**
"Assuming no injuries...  Guy with most free throws is probably **Harden**, assuming the rest of his game checks out (plenty of three's, etc)  Guy scoring between 25 and 30 points per game with a high number of assists yet relatively low three point percentage is almost certainly **Westbrook**  Guy scoring between 25 and 30 points per game with a high field goal percentage, and high assist AND rebounds is very likely **LeBron.** bonus points if he happens to be at 27/7/7  A guy with a ton of three's at the end of the year, along with a ridiculously high free throw percentage, strong two point percentage,  and fewer turnovers than Harden is **curry**  Guy who has stats kinda similar to LeBron with fewer assists and fewer three's is probably **Giannis**, especially if he's averaging more blocks per game than the guy you ID as LeBron  Anyone who is over 25 ppg+ with extremely efficient scoring, lots of three's, and lots of blocks with more than 5 assists and rebounds per game and over 85% free throw shooting is going to be **Kevin Durant**  At this point it should hopefully be pretty easy to identify the two premier offensive big men, each with 25ppg+ and very efficeint scoring: **Anthony Davis** versus **Karl Towns**, based on their three point numbers and fouls committed, they should be easy to identify one from the other. AD will be at or near the top in blocks as well  Sorting by three point numbers and looking at the top 5 players with three pointers made should help identify **Klay Thompson**, assuming the rest of the statistical profile lines up as reasonable (i.e. not too many assists, efficient percentage, roughly 80+% from the line, and a very high percentage of his shots coming from three point line proportionally)  **Damian Lillard** will have somewhat similar numbers to Curry, with less efficiency, lots of three's still, etc. If there's confusion with Kyrie, the guy with fewer free throws but higher overall two point percentage will almost certainly be **Kyrie Irving**  Very high rebounds with bad free throw shooting and plenty of blocks is likely to be **Andre Drummond**  Andre Drummond with less scoring will probably identify **DeAndre Jordan**  There are a couple other guys like Blake Griffin or Steven Adams you'd probably identify, but it could get pretty tough after identifying the people above."
"If you're a superstar then you make the playoffs even with trash. Check what Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Giannis etc. were doing at that age. Kyrie is just another Devin Booker."
Kevin Durant
"LeBron does not make 1st All-NBA team  Guards: Steph Curry or Kyrie Irving, James Harden Forwards: Kevin Durant, Giannis, Anthony Davis"
Fuck Kevin Durant

"I don't want to like him, I don't hate the Warriors, I hate KD. Before he got traded there, I was hyped for the Warriors to break the season record. Their 25+ game win streaks was amazing to watch, because it was such amazing basketball being played. I'm a basketball fan first, before I'm directly a team fan, they were amazing. I was hyped when they lost, but I was immediately looking forward to the next season to see what they were going to do, and to see part 3 and who's going up 2-1.   Kevin Durant ruined that. He then gets there, acts like people are supposed to love him for making a team that was literally just historically hard to beat, basically impossible to beat. Then he lies all the time saying, that it's a hard decision, starts all this attitude and trash talk, the burner phone (obviously to this day still insecure, to be a keyboard Warrior defending himself), and the list goes on. Not to mention him saying this is how he really is, when it's literally never been like this since what he was in high school and college? So no, I don't want to like KD, seeing him in this jersey, was in my mind a ""stop it."" KD robbed us of what would have been two really good finals for 17-18, and actually seeing the Warriors face adversity again. The league got better in 16-17, but it didn't seem like it because of that one move.   That's just me though."
Klay Thompson - Seth Rollins  Draymond Green - Dean Ambrose  Kevin Durant - Roman Reigns
Someone needs to make sure that Kevin Durant didn't get pregnant. 
I fucking hate Kevin Durant but that shit was awesome. I saw the Storm win a WNBA Championship. That city goes hard for basketball and they deserve an NBA. 
Kevin Durant plays for the Golden State Warriors. He was drafted 10 years ago by the now defunct Seattle Supersonics. The Warriors were playing a preseason game in Seattle. As a show of respect he wore the Seattle jersey of Supersonics legend Shawn Kemp. 
He should've worn the jersey of Sonics legend Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Kawhi, Anthony Davis, James Harden maybe? "
"same height as durant, durant is 6'11 but only listed as 6'9 to play a different position  [https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/)"
He should have worn a Kevin Durant jersey.
He's clearly Kevin Durant
"You do realize that Kevin Durant loves Seattle and would do whatever it takes to play there again, right?"
"You do realize that Kevin Durant and the rest of the NBA players give zero fucks about his supposed ""reputation"" and he's going to continue to play where he wants for whatever money he wants, right? The only people who thinks he ""owes"" anything to matter zero to him and the league."
"Kevin Durant has me so torn sometimes. I hate the move he made, but I’m born and raised Seattle and he’s given us so much love over the years. "
Kevin durant is 30. It ain’t happening.
&gt; Kevin Durant is better than him at everything else on a basketball court  Lmao like what?
"Durant is already the greatest offensive player of all time (check Ben Taylor's work on the subject). Curry can't become the greatest offensive player of all time, and Kevin Durant is better than him at everything else on a basketball court, so he can't become better than Durant."
What if Kevin Durant signed with the Supersonics?
"From an unbiased perspective, Kevin Durant is already more dominant in terms of scoring than Kobe was. If he put up the amount of shots Kobe put up, I can guarantee you he would be able to score at the magnitude Kobe did. He can score in the same variety of ways as Kobe but he is more efficient. However he will never be near Kobe's level of playmaking and defensive intensity. KD's defensive is actually overrated af. When it's all said and done, KD has a chance to be the best scorer ever. But his legacy will never surpass Kobe's which is what people usually rank greatness with.   Curry will never surpass Kobe as Kobe was way more all-round than Curry. Curry surpassed Kobe in shooting 10 years ago though. Curry will end up like Duncan, a great teamate and winner who is underappreciated for his intangibles and will likely end up lower on people's all time rankings.   "
"That was such a classy move by Kevin Durant.    Not just the jersey, but giving a shoutout to the Storm as well."
it actually is - he took more half court heaves last year than kevin durant has in his entire career - some guys care too much about their percentages   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7d6b19/remarkably_amazing_irrelevant_stat_of_the_year/

"If you listen to it enough times it starts to sound like a song and the chorus is ""fuck Kevin Durant"""
"So... Westbrook being a 31% shooter from deep and still chucking more than KD when they were teammates is also the fault of the coach?  You think an NBA coach is going to want a terrible shooter like Westbrook to shoot contested Js more often than *Kevin Durant*?  Even the newest fresh faced assistant coach out of a DII in the middle of nowhere could walk onto an NBA court and it would take them all of about 2 seconds to realize who should get the lion's share of shots on that team.  There's not a single coach in the league who's that fucking stupid to think it should even be close to 50/50.   Westbrook is, though."
"Kevin **Durant**  Ivica **Zubat**  Nikola **Milotic**  Iman **Swampert**  I'm sure there are more, but that's all I can think of."
If KD wanted to get Donovan fired and wanted to stay in OKC he would’ve said fire Donovan or I’m out. You think Presti would’ve chosen a mediocre coach who’s his friend over Kevin Fucking Durant? Lol. Instead he just straight up dipped while shit talking everyone on Twitter behind their backs
Clearly Russ is apple. He's got the flash and the gimmick and the people that love him LOVE him and they can't shut up about him. He's apple. He's a Mac. He's an iPhone. Golden State is Google. You can do anything you want with Google. That's why Kevin Durant left. He knew he needed to have more features than a big screen and no headphone jack.

"Kevin Durant said when he was a kid he wanted to play for the Raptors cuz he loved the jerseys and VC, haha"
Lebron DOES NOT get the benefit of the doubt as a 34 year old putting on the performance he has been so far. 2018-2019 rankings IS NOT based on previous exploits. It's about what's been transpiring so far.  &amp;#x200B;  adjust this list.  &amp;#x200B;  1. stephen curry 2. Anthony Davis 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Kevin Durant 5. Giannis 6. Lebron 7. Harden 8.

"Best player in the league certainly goes a long way toward being the most valuable player in the league. Leading the league or being close to leading the league in so many statistical categories certainly goes a long way toward being the most valuable player in the league. Literally being the most valuable player in the league - being the player that would cost the most to obtain because you're the best player in the league and because you're the best or close to the best in so many statistical categories - certainly goes a long way toward being the most valuable player in the league. Being the highest grossing player in the league in terms of endorsement money and gate receipts when his team plays in opposing buildings and the additional revenue generated by bringing him in certainly goes a long way toward being the most valuable player in the league. All of those combined make him definitely the most valuable player in the league.  You know what should have no bearing? Team wins. Being the best player on the best team in the league in no way makes you the most valuable player in the league. Kevin Durant is the best player on the Warriors. Does Kevin Durant make them the best team? No, they're the best team in the league without Durant. But look at the Cavs - they were in the Finals four straight seasons. Are they going to the Finals this year? No, they're a lottery team.   That's your MVP. A guy who can literally take a lottery team to the Finals is your most valuable player. There is no valid argument to the contrary.  The NBA has moved to their current MVP process because they don't want the same guy to get the award every year. That's the only reason why it's judged the way it is. It's the most interesting storyline award, and nothing more."
"Yeah jesus christ this whole deal with KAT is so stupid.   He put up 25/12 on 18 FGA his 2nd year, at 20 years old.   Most comparable year I can remember would be 20 year old Kevin Durant who put up 25/7/3 with 19 FGA.   21 year old KD got an extra 1.5 FGA and managed to put up 30/8/3.   21 year old KAT got his FGA *REDUCED* by 4, to 14 per game (same as his rookie year) but managed to increase his efficiency even more and put up 21 ppg.   This year, somehow KAT's usage managed to get reduced *again*. Despite being one of the most efficient scorers in the league he got his FGA reduced to 12 per game. 2 lower than his rookie year.   Honestly it's just ridiculous, if you have a 20 year old putting up a hyper efficient 25/12... why on earth wouldn't you build around them? "
"Saying that player X deserved to be MVP instead of LeBron because they got more votes is tautological.  Here's the real breakdown:  2007-08 - LeBron was more individually impressive than Kobe (more of an ... MVP?) but his team win total was worse, therefore he didn't win.  TEAM WINS.  2010-11 - Rose won as the highest scoring player on a team that won with defense.  LeBron was an anti-hero in his first Miami season so of course he couldn't be given the award.  NARRATIVE REASONS.  2013-14 - Kevin Durant (or his mom) was the legit MVP this year.  2014-15 - Steph is legit.  2015-16 - Steph is legit.  2016-17 - Westbrook wins because of the BS triple double NARRATIVE REASON.  Harden was better than Westbrook and should have won it.    2017-18 - Harden deserved it.  So when the dust settles I agree with OP that LeBron wouldn't have won the last 10 MVPs.  But of the 3 incorrectly awarded MVPs 2 of them should have gone to LeBron (Harden should also have another one).  LeBron should have won 6 MVPs, not 4.  The last 11 seasons should have been 6x LeBron, 2x Steph, 2x Harden, 1x Durant."
Yes you do. He still plays defense but it's on and off but the narrative is one sided. Anthony Davis never runs back on transition defense and nobody is posting clips of him failing to run back. Kevin Durant repeatedly failing to close out on Trevor Ariza in Game 5 of the WCF and there is no discussion of it.
"so, we can use transitive property and circumstantial evidence to have relative certainty how tall NBA players are.  for example, look at Shaq/Wilt/Ewing: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DO3tRcwXUAAuoRh.jpg:large.    Here's Shaq/Dwight: http://leadindianews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/shaq-dwight-howard.png.

Unless all this listed-height-number-fudging is truly a 100-year-old conspiracy by all basketball players ever"
"Who won the 2014 finals again? Oh yeah it was Kawhi not KD. Who was the finals MVP too? Oh yeah... it was Kawhi. Who won DPOY back-to-back in 2014 and 2015? News flash.... it was Kawhi. To me, an actual fan who watches the game, believes KD is being both disrespectful and outrageous when he said what he said. You all may not think so but I beg to differ.  Do you think the Spurs could've beat the Heat without their Finals MVP? Did someone else deserve that reward aside from Kawhi? Definitely not outrageous and disrespectful KD  People called KD out on it and he changed his [tune](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/oklahoma-city-thunder-san-antonio-spurs-kevin-durant-kawhi-leonard-paul-george-032516)"
"Starters:  G Kyle Lowry  G Klay Thompson  F Kawhi Leonard  F Kevin Durant  C Krisraps Porzingis  Bench:  6 Karl-Anthony Towns  7 Kyrie Irving  8 Kevin Love  9 Kemba Walker  EDIT: Added KAT, removed KOQ"
I think this Kevin Durant guy could be pretty good.  Trae Young has the most insane stats on a bad team 3rd team potential.
"Zeller is listed at 7 foot, 240 pounds. Kevin Durant is just about the same. If he wore slimmer clothing and told people in the offseason he worked on his three point shot could he fool enough people to get a chance playing the 3?"
I think I remember him getting a lot of slack for the  'system player' comments and then him back pedaling on those comments later on. I doubt it was misconstrued.  EDIT: [Here](http://www.espn.com/blog/okc-thunder/post/_/id/1349/kevin-durant-isnt-taking-back-what-he-said-about-kawhi-leonard-three-years-ago) is the ESPN article. 
Kyle Lowry  Klay Thompson  Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant  Karl-Anthony Towns   
"Even though hes playing like one, I think the fact that he plays with Kevin Durant is something held against him in the MVP race "
Ok...I don't know how to explain this to you....Kevin Durant is the best player on the best team in the league. He's going to average something like 28/8/5 on insane shooting numbers (again). His team is going to win 70 games. He's going to be first team lol

"I don't want to cite any specific stat, especially DPRM, when arguing against Durant's defensive abilities without providing a bit of analysis as well. Defensive stats do a pretty terrible job of actually showing how a player performs on that end when looking at them by themselves. However, they can do a good job of giving an idea of how a player is doing when you combine it with seeing what the player is doing on the floor.  All of the talk about Durant's defense last year was focused primarily on how good of a rim protector he'd become (he also regressed at around the halfway point). He definitely 'improved' statistically, but according to this [WaPo article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2018/01/02/draymond-green-is-wrong-kevin-durant-shouldnt-win-defensive-player-of-the-year/), he actually rebounded at a much lower rate on defense and allowed many more 3pt attempts and makes than in his first year with the Dubs.  Here is their snippet about that:  &gt;Now that Durant is focusing more on blocked shots, his defensive rebounding numbers have declined from 11 per 100 possessions last season to 8.8 per 100 in 2017-18, his lowest rate since 2013-14. On top of that, he’s not locking down opponents on the perimeter as well as he has in recent years. Opponents are taking 40 three-point attempts per 100 possessions with Durant as the primary defender this season, hitting 38 percent of those shots. Last season they managed 34 three-point attempts per 100 possessions with a 32 percent success rate. Only seven other players defending at least 300 possessions this season have seen a larger share of three-point attempts against them.  They don't even mention how much of a benefit it is to have one of the GOAT defenders on your team in Draymond Green. He's just so fucking good on help defense. Remember [this play](https://gfycat.com/EssentialCheapAsianpiedstarling) from last year?  I'm sorry, but I just don't see how KD is anywhere close to the same level of defender as Kawhi or Draymond."
"It’s another term for noob.   If I have 20 shots, I’m going to give them to someone who can maximize the opportunity.  3&gt;2.   I think your age is showing, having a player who can’t give you 3 points for any of his possessions hasn’t been a sound strategy since 2012.   Not only do I not think you know what efficiency means, I know you don’t.    It takes him 24.3 FGA per game to average 29 PPG.  Last year it took Kevin Durant 18 FGA to average 26.  I’m not using his percentage this year because his 3 point shot is clearly rusty and will improve dramatically as the season moves on.   Now does it make sense to you?   If it doesn’t I cannot help you.   I think I’m insulted by the fact that you’re wasting my time with this argument.  This is the most simplistic argument I’ve ever heard.  How do you not know what TS% is. "
Thats nothing.  You ever see what's said on here about a basketball player by the name of Kevin Durant..?   People out here wishing injuries.
Devin Booker on stilts and Kevin Durant would be a pretty cool combo 
I'm sure using Make insert whatever great again is going to appeal to Kevin Durant. 
"Man, fuck Kevin Durant."
"In my 2K season, Kevin Durant won MVP and MIP in the same year lmao"
"People buy into the narrative that he's crap on D because teams go at him as much as they can.  For some reason people tend not to consider that, given the alternatives on the perimeter are likely to include some of: Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala, all of whom are elite and/or taller than Steph, so *of course* they fucking attack Steph if they can.  I'm on the tall side, by normal people standards. If I stood in a group with Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins, Anthony Davis and Giannis Antetokounmpo, I'd look *tiny*. Doesn't mean I am."
"Curry is under-rated as a defender. He gets targeted a lot on D because if the perimeter is being defended by Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant, you obviously go at the dude who's never been a DPOY, isn't seven feet tall, or Klay ""elite on-ball defender who's also tall for a guard"" Thompson.  Plus if you tire him out enough on D maybe he won't torch you on O. Maybe."
Kevin Durant or Prime Kawhi perhaps
i think kevin durant is better. better scorer and better defender. takes the cake 
"Lol you’re trying hard to hype up your golden boy. Like I said, it’s humourous that you claim Curry is a better defender, perhaps even delusional. LeBron doesn’t take as many plays off as you claim, not even close. It’s very clear that you don’t watch him play for prolonged periods of time. And you do realize that defensive stats are highly unreliable, correct? DRTG indicates that Kevin Durant was one of the worst defenders last year. Do you believe that? You’re stance is typical of someone who gets their takes from highlights and articles. But I don’t expect any better"
"Well first of all Ray Allen didn’t join until 2 years later. Also ray Allen was a decent role player for them, he scored 11 points per game for them. He wasn’t close to a star. Also lebron left a shitty team with a shitty front office. Kevin Durant had a championship caliber team, that if he didn’t choke, could’ve won a championship. And also the warriors were WAY better than pretty much every single team in the nba. The heat still had pretty Fucking good competition. I don’t think the moves are comparable other than the fact they left their team to go to a better one. "
2016 he reinforced that opinion: http://www.espn.com/blog/okc-thunder/post/_/id/1349/kevin-durant-isnt-taking-back-what-he-said-about-kawhi-leonard-three-years-ago
"We ship fledgling stars Stanley Johnson, Jon Leuer, and Langston Galloway to the Warriors for Kevin Durant, Jordan Bell, and Daniel House.  The Pistons grow considerably better with Kevin Durant now providing a healthy dose of scoring plus two young players to work on, the Warriors get Stanley motherfucking Johnson and the league gets the parity it's been desperately calling for since the summer of 2016.  "
I am so fucking sick of those turn around mid range jumpers. Doesn't matter who. You've got Clint Capela hitting turn around mid range shots like he's Kevin Durant or something. HOF is such a cheese.
"So you agree he's better at everything but efficiency, which Lowry posted 66 TS%, 62 eFG% and 45% from 3 last playoffs.  &gt;Idk if Lowry has that extra gear even though I think he's an underrated player.  If Lowry had LeBron he would've showed his stuff. Btw since 2015 Kyle Lowry hit the most clutch shots just behind Kevin Durant and LeBron James. His regular season clutch stats are also ridiculous. Also Lowry is a better rebounder as he gets contested rebounds like ad dog not because he has about 2 more rpg."
"Damn, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and DeMarcus Cousins means nothing without Zaza.  /s"
"And this is exactly why I hate Kevin Durant and his decision. This was incredible. Unleashed Steph is still the most fun.   &amp;#x200B;  Sadly, even if he misses every single shot they still win finals games "
Kevin Durant had 30/8/7 on 72% shooting and was the second best player on the floor. That's fucked up. 
Kevin Fucking Durant robbed us of prime Stephen Curry! FUCK! 
"The MVP race is actually going to be insane. Curry/Kawhi/AD/Giannis are all playing like MVP's at this stage. Thats not even including the last two MVP's or Lebron James and Kevin Durant, this shit going to be tight af"
&gt; Kevin Durant has a season-high with 30 points (13-of-19 FG) to go with eight rebounds and eight assists.
"I agree, Kuzma is better than Ingram in every possible way. I never understood the hype about Ingram, it's like people expect every tall lanky player to be Kevin Durant. It's never going to happen.   Rondo vs Lonzo... tougher choice there. I think Rondo plays better with LeBron and Lonzo is probably more useful with the second unit. But I can see the reverse working if Rondo doesn't make a stink about coming off the bench."
Kevin “George Bush” Durant
"I mean, LeBron James and Kevin Durant are above Curry.  And LeBron James is above Durant."
"I always forget that Kevin Durant is Albert Einstein's dad, it kinda freaks me out sometimes."
"NBA Rumors: Anonymous NBA executives expect Kevin Durant to leave the Golden State Warriors when he becomes an unrestricted free agent in the 2019 summer. Teams that are most rumored to acquire Kevin Durant are Lakers, Knicks, Clippers and OKC Thunder. #NBARumors #KevinDurantRumors #KevinDurantLakers  &amp;#x200B;"
"Kevin Martin was a 20 PPG scorer at that point in time, and you're also conveniently forgetting the other player in that deal, that dude named Goran Dragic... EG also hated the shit out of New Orleans and publicly went out of his way to say so multiple times. The rest of his time in NOLA was him predominantly sitting on the sidelines due to constant injury before he up and left for nothing in 2016.  The only reason the CP3 deal isn't looked at as one of the worst in league history is because the pick in the deal ""conveniently"" landed #1 in a draft with the most transcendent prospect since Durant and Oden. When a deal for a superstar relies on insurmountable luck (or outright lottery rigging if you put your tinfoil hat on) just to not look absolutely horrible and lopsided... then that deal was probably horrible and lopsided.  "
Raised by who? Kevin Durant
I'm gonna predict that Kevin Durant is signing with the NY Knicks next season. 
Kevin fucking Durant..
"the one year i played fantasy i missed the draft and had to auto draft. ended up with anthony davis, steph curry, and a couple other monsters.   of course, this was in 2013-14, so the team with kevin durant obliterated me."
"Kevin Durant, LeBron James are forwards.  Aldridge, MIN Kevin Love, were no fucking joke.  Don't get swayed by their current reputations/play for 5 years ago"
"INB4 @KDTrey5 tweets  “You leave Kevin Durant alone. He’s not fat, no one can guard him and he has nice hair. You just don’t know shit about Kevin Durant.” "
"Al “Big Al” Horford,  Cedi “MJ” Osman,  Mike “Injury” Conley,  Kevin “Underrated” Durant,  Gilbert “Marksman” Arenas."
"I watched the Warriors game lol. You expect me to put stock into Klay missing wide open 3s and Kevin Durant settling for no dribble jump shots that he’ll typically make anyways? You expect me to believe that the Warriors go to play down the stretch was dragging Jokic out on a switch against Steph because Kerr scouted Jokic as a respectable defender?   Also, you know four games into the season the Magic and Grizzlies were the best teams in the league last year right? 4 games means absolutely nothing, not to mention the fact that the other three games the Nuggets played were against lottery teams.

"15 times.  because this is obvious, it's fluff, and it isn't useful at all. blake is an amazing basketball player, he's much more divisive than he should be, he's proving people wrong with a career high.   i upvoted the post because it's above average content for the sub, but it's not news and it's boring. i'd say the same thing if the headline read steph curry or kevin durant"
"Well the common comparison is Paul George, who had similar weaknesses early in his career. Not to mention, Brown is clearly the superior shooter than LaVert. Also the better defender imo. You’d have to say Brown has a higher floor than LaVert from what each has shown up to this point. With Brown’s athleticism, I’d have to give him the high ceiling too. You can’t develop that kind of athleticism. You can, however, develop playmaking and ball handling (see Kevin Durant and DeMar DeRozan)."
I feel like Tatums game is a little too sweet to be compared to PG. the closest comparison I could draw is a hybrid between a Rudy gay and Kevin Durant. He has a touch/finish like KD and a movement like Gay but a little more seemless. That’s the only thing I can come up with   Edit: seamless* not seemless 
"Yep.  “THEY THEY THEY...I I I.”  That’s all I hear from this guy.  Oh and don’t think I forgot “all of you reporters get to go back to living the same life tomorrow”.   Oh and “not one not 2, not 3, 8”. They counted to fucking 8 and only won 2 titles.  Fucking embarrassing and people shit on Kevin Durant....bruh...I got a lot more where this came from.  This sub reddit thrives on salt and i brought it to the table for this video.  "
kevin durant and the warriors constantly show improvement! 
"As visible, the only two exceptions were the 2010 Rose MVP and the 2015 Curry MVP. And other than the 2017 Westbrook MVP, those have been the most controversial MVPs, and interestingly enough, many thought LeBron should be MVP over Rose in 2010, and again Harden over Curry in 2015.  ***  Games with 30+ Game Scores since 2010  1. 94 - LeBron James   2. 89 - James Harden  3. 75 - Kevin Durant  4. 71 - Stephen Curry  5. 66 - Russell Westbrook  6. 59 - Anthony Davis  7. 32 - DeMarcus Cousins  8. 32  - Chris Paul  9. 30 - Kevin Love  10. 28 - LaMarcus Aldridge  6 other players with 20+  18 players with between 10 and 19  ***  This year, LaMarcus Aldridge, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Jokic, and Trae Young all have one such game  "
"lol you know obama just praised and paid respects to kevin durant last month with a celebratory toast for his birthday and kevin durant has tweeted at someone ""shut up fagboi""   "
"Without Kevin Durant, Steph Curry would only have 1 ring."
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis might have the hardest euro to guard because of length. But the finesse and consistency Harden finishes with is insane.
IN MY OPINION!  Based off of pure talent:  1. Kevin Durant 2. Lebron James 3. Steph Curry 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis A.  Based off talent BUT including Legacy:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. James Harden   
"The complication with putting Curry on an all-time list is that his very best attribute is his scoring, and his teammate Kevin Durant is just as comparable in that regard if not even better.   So wherever you put Curry, Durant has to be either right behind him or right in front.  If you put Curry in the top 10 you'll have to put Durant in the immediate vicinity, and the top 15 or so is stupidly stacked. "
"Yeah and Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Jimmy Butler, DeMarcus Cousins, John Wall, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, to name a few.   Having said all that, spitting is another kind of low. "
Because he chased Kevin Durant and James Harden away! duuhhhhhh.
"Pretty good first game to start with lol. Statistically points are, at the end of the day, probably the most important statistic because that's how you win the game. Players who can impact the game a huge amount in other ways (like having 10 rebounds and 14 assists even if they don't score) are of great value, but all stars are ultimately people who can do those things AND score. Especially when defenses tighten up and a game is on the line, ultimately teams need someone who will win them the game. That being said, however, it's more important then ever for players to be multi-faceted. If a player can only score and can't do things like play defense or move the ball, their value drops significantly.  Regarding teams:  * The Spurs: Are technically the underdog in that they historically do not attract big free agents and instead have drafted and developed a majority of their players and consistently overachieved with them. Has the best coach in the NBA currently, Gregg Popovich. Right now the team has a lot of underdogs in the form of stars who are considered good but not good enough to ever win a championship (DeRozan and Aldridge).    * Oklahoma: Has one of the best players (at least statistically) in the league, Russell Westbrook, All Star in Paul George and very good center in Steven Adams. Their coach isn't anything special and that's historiclaly been OKC's problem; their coaching rarely elevates the team. But their GM (who orchestrates trades, drafts players, signs free agents), Sam Presti, is one of the best in the league by making really savvy, smart moves and drafting excellently. Pretty interesting history in that OKC drafted Kevin Durant, who is a Top 2 player, and Kevin Durant ultimately left OKC because he felt he couldn't win a championship. Definitely an underdog in that many people feel a Westbrook-led team with only Paul George is not enough for OKC to win a championship. A lot of other people feel OKC will never win a championship with Westbrook in general.  * Raptors: Probably the biggest underdog because they're always been regarded as incapable of performing in the playoffs. They have improved their regular season performance over the years by a huge amount, yet have continued to struggle to make it to the Finals (TBF though, Lebron beat every team in the East year after year). They just acquired Kawhi Leonard from the Spurs but had to trade DeRozan (a huge fan favorite). A major issue right now is whether Kawhi, whose contract expires on a year, will want to stay on the Raptors, a notoriously unattractive team for major free agents like Kawhi. They also have Kyle Lowry, one of the best point guards in the East. Their coach is Nick Nurse, a rookie head coach who, as an assistant coach last year, revamped the Raptors offense to be faster and more spaced out. Their GM, Masai Ujiri, is one of the best in the league, similar to Sam Presti in that he drafts incredibly well and consistently makes moves to better the roster, even despite being unable to land top free agents. History-wise, the Raptors have always been overlooked and their stars have always left the team for bigger markets or better opportunities to win (Vince Carter, Chris Bosh). They are definitely the biggest underdogs of the batch because, unlike OKC, a team that has made the Finals and been incredibly close to making the Finals numerous times, the Raptors have almost never been considered even close to winning a championship over the past few years. This year might be one of their best shots, however, because they have been looking pretty great with Kawhi as their focal point.  "
So you're saying they would have tried in the first and second quarters if Kevin Durant wasn't there - and they would've beaten them?  Interesting.  
Oh fuck off. You didn’t phrase it that way at all stop trying to change it.   You didn’t say GSW “coulda” won a championship. Your point was an average SF could have been in place of Kevin Durant and they would have won.  Jesus Christ. 
I think teams would naturally want to get better either through signing free agents or developing players. We didn't need Kevin Durant fuckin signing with the Warriors for all of us to want to win.
"Kevin ""Kareem"" Durant"
Rio Grande Valley Vipers have one slightly used and still very much raw Brazilian Kevin Durant
Imagine trading for someone on the caliber of Kevin Durant in the off season. You'd think otherwise too lol. 
"When I've said he has had poor efficiency and bad splits, I'm referring to the playoffs because that is the time which determines how successful your team.  Lowry shot 2% better TS in the playoffs on 10 less PPG than WB. He played worse competition and carried a lesser load than WB. The Thunder teams where built to where WB and Durant scored and created for everyone else.  If Lowry were on the team instead of WB, he would've been asked to carry a similar load offensively. There is no way he would be able to shoot the same TS while averaging 10 more PPG. He TS would most definitely drop below WBs.   &gt;I don't buy this, he's been in plenty of good systems. He spent a considerable amount of his prime next to Kevin Durant, as well as seasons with Victor Oladipo and Paul George.   The offensive system that they played in relied solely on talent. If you don't believe this, you haven't watched many Thunder games. They rarely moved the ball and always relied on isolation just like the pre-2018 Raptors. While you play WB for this, most of it is not his fault. A big part of this is bad coaching. Scott Brooks has similar issues in Washington and even when Donovan had the offseason, entire training camp, and preseason to build a new offensive system without Westbrook, it still had the same exact issues as the previous years which was showcased in their first two games. When WB came back, their system looked much more cohesive than in the first two games. He actually moved off-ball very well yesterday and scored off a couple of cuts. Another reason for this poor system, is their lack of playmakers and shooting. Presti loves athletic guys who can't shoot or dribble.Other than the 3 guys you've listed, he's been surrounded by athletic guys who can't make plays or shoot. He's never played with more than one of the guys you listed at the same time. This means that they've never had a reliable 3rd or 4th playmaker that the Raptors currently have. Factoring all of this in, the Thunder basically have had an offensive system similar to the one Lowry struggled in (in the postseason).  If you plug Lowry into this instead of WB, he would need to take on a bigger load. You can't just ask Ibaka, Grant, Roberson, Adams to create 10-15 more PPG because they need shots to be created for them, they can't create them on their own. Lowry does not have the skillet to take on such a big load. He's best when he's surrounded by one guy better than him and a bunch of playmakers and shooters. "
&gt;I really gave major props to Coach Pop and the whole staff for putting those guys in great positions to be successful. I’ve realized you can’t say anything about a champion so if I hurt anybody’s feeling I apologize (I really don’t) but you get my drift.”  http://www.espn.com/blog/okc-thunder/post/_/id/1349/kevin-durant-isnt-taking-back-what-he-said-about-kawhi-leonard-three-years-ago

Kevin Durant 
"&gt; The Raptors used to play this way. When they did, Lowry did not have  &gt; good splits and the Raptors struggled mightly in the playoffs.  This is not true, Lowry has had awesome splits and impact stats since he joined the Raptors pretty much. His first season wasn't elite, but since then he has been one of the best point guards in the NBA. He's had some bad playoff performances, but he's also had some really great playoff performances. Plus, Westbrook has had his fair share of playoff struggles as well.  &gt; On the other hand, Westbrook, in this same type of system, put up more  &gt; points and assists with better efficiency  Not true either, since he joined the Raptors Lowry has 58% true shooting, compared to 54% TS for Russ over that same time period. In fact, in 4 of Lowry's 6 season with the Raps, his TS% has been better than Westbrook's best ever TS% over a season. Lowry is *much* more efficient than Westbrook. In the playoffs Lowry's TS% has dipped to 54%, but Westbrook's career playoff TS% is 52%, and a dreadful 50% in two playoff series since Durant left.  &gt; However, prime Westbrook has never had this luxury of playing in a good  &gt; system where he is surrounded by shooters and playmakers.  I don't buy this, he's been in plenty of good systems. He spent a considerable amount of his prime next to Kevin Durant, as well as seasons with Victor Oladipo and Paul George. Part of this is also due to the fact that Westbrook is a poor off-ball player, compared to Lowry who is one of the best off-ball players in the NBA.  &gt; I think its absolutely absurd to think that if Lowry went to go play in a  &gt; similar system to which he struggled in  Again, Lowry has not struggled as much as you are implying here, and it seems likely that it is much easier to build a cohesive offensive system around Lowry than it is to build one around Westbrook."
Curry shouldn't have been on his ass. That's a flop. People act like Curry is some little filipino kid out there. Curry is a 6'3 pro athlete. Curry is bigger than Kyrie Irving. Curry is more jacked than Kevin Durant.
"Tatum is great, he is not going to be Steph curry. He ain't going to be Kevin Durant either.  LOL  It's ok to be wrong."
Kevin Durant is 6 feet 9 inches tall
"oh gotcha. No I agree with that. I still think that Kevin Durant is just better at basketball, but not by much. Mostly because he's seven feet, athletic, can pull up from anywhere. By his height alone he's going to have more impact on a game defensively and rebounding."
"[6 foot](http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/omnisport/e4/79/cousins-durant-07062018-us-news-getty-ftr_9owyv69v5i5413y0ne1tjdtqb.jpg?t=1867551468&amp;w=960&amp;quality=70) [nine](https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_limit,w_680/fl_lossy,pg_1,q_auto/vx4jtpjs6h82rwsm8oju/demarcus-cousins-kevin-durant)"
"&gt; There’s not really any data to suggest he’s a better scorer than lebron  The same number of points on fewer shots is pretty good data. He's a much better 3 point and FT shooter. He's averaging 61.1% TS on his career at ""lead the league in scoring"" volume.  His career average is 27.1 PPG and per 100 it's 36.9, just like LeBron (seriously they are very close in scoring output), except now he's pumping out 63%+ TS seasons like it's easy. Kevin Durant just uses fewer possessions to get the buckets LeBron gets.  Kevin Durant is alone at the top of the volume and efficiency pyramid.  Edit: you can [take a look at their careers](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1_select=LeBron+James&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players). Durant needs fewer shots to match an otherwise almost identical per game and per minute scoring load."
Kevin Durant is a better scorer and a better defender 
"Kevin Durant is quite possibly the best scorer to ever play basketball, even though it's heresy to suggest it.   He's at worst third place behind Jordan and Kareem and I think it's not insane to believe that, simply from a scoring perspective, he outdoes both of them."
"Yeah, KD was ring chasing too, just like CP3 was when he wanted out of NO, just like KG and Ray Allen when they went to Boston, and LeBron when he went to Miami with Bosh. There are countless examples of star players moving teams to win. It happens all the time.  http://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/list/nba-best-players-to-change-teams-in-their-primes-kevin-durant-warriors-thunder/1xpfllupx85vw1jjvky9xythh0  https://www.sbnation.com/2016/7/5/12095928/kevin-durant-warriors-super-team-weak-not-really"
Kevin Durant has become such a Cupcake
"It would all depend on how GSW bench could hang on while the starters rest. As long as the starters are playing well I don't see the Warriors losing with DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green as long as the bench doesn't let the score get out of hand while their out."
&gt;Kevin “Huerter” Durant  FTFY
"Only players currently averaging 30ppg are:  Kemba Walker, PG   Nikola Mirotic, PF   Kevin Durant, SF   Stephen Curry, PG   Zach LaVine, PG   Devin Booker, SG    Out of that group, none would be classed as trash teir players and the lowest value players there are probably Mirotic and LaVine. Even then, I wouldn't mind having LaVine / Kemba / Booker on my team. Mirotic I'm always iffy on cause he can hit 30ppg and then go for 8 points tomorrow night and ruin that average.  Plus this is such a small sample size seeing as most players have played 2-3 games."
"I mean, again, I’m a Kobe fan...but have you seen Kevin Durant play basketball??  If Kobe was in his prime right now, Durant would eat him alive. Durant is a 7 footer with ridiculous foot speed, quickness and a ridiculous handle that can shoot off the dribble from 35.  He’s his own special brand bro"
"Source: Draymond Green and Kevin Durant altercation was ""physical and emotional"" I'm told. One individual close to the situation said ""The relationship is deteriorating"" I'm told."
"to be fair, these dumbasses are both of the nba's biggest villains  they're both right. Kevin Durant IS a bitch. And I'm sure whatever he said about Draymond is true, because there is a lot you can say about that guy"
Kevin Durant lol
Kevin Durant lol

"You do now.  You don’t have the same bench or the money to go get anyone else with or without him.  Boogie is a fluke because of the Achilles.  If KD goes, and especially to a team that has a superstar, he will immediately challenge the warriors.  Y’all do realize how good Kevin Durant is right??  "
Kevin Durant to the Shark Tank? 
"Yeah, but the Lakers also have the kind of money where the luxury tax is something they're willing to deal with. If KD is interested, there's no team that's going to out-offer them.   And it's totally opinion based. But I still think its valid. I'm not even gonna get into the prestige of the franchises for this, but really think about it. Who would you rather play with? Toby and Boby? Or Lebron fucking James. Do you know what kind of magical storyline that is? That the two most dominant players in the the NBA joined forces?   That's past the point of hate, and more to the point of awe. KD going to the Warriors is a hatable move. Losing after being up 3-1. Lying to Russ. And in reality, while not probable, they are still a beatable team. But could you imagine Lebron and KD on the same team? That would be like watching the 92 Olympics for a whole season. People aren't even tuning in to see who wins, they're tuning in to see how much they win by. You thought Lebron going to Miami was crazy, this would be fucking insane.   That story in itself is something we haven't seen in the history of the NBA, and is something we might not see again for a decade. Like I said, Kevin Durant does what he thinks is cool, and this would definitely be one of the coolest moves ever. It would ruin the league for at least 2 years, but it would be incredible to watch, and I think he knows that  "

I can't wait for Lance Stephenson to not pass the ball to Kevin Durant and then yell expletives at him in the locker room.
Update: Kevin Durant (swollen testicles) will NOT play tonight vs Atlanta.
"In midst of verbal exchange on court late in game, sources said, Draymond Green turned to Kevin Durant and screamed, ""We don't (bleeping) need you. We can win without you.""

"The guy is sitting there talking about winning culture and that’s all the warriors do. Let’s be serious for a second, if the entire WEstern Conference didn’t have injuries, and LeBron had a team to field in 14-15 they probably wouldn’t of been champs. In 2016-18 if Kevin Durant didn’t prove he was literally a snake they probably wouldn’t of been champs, and this year they’re flexing like they just haven’t lucked out on some shit over the past few seasons. Gtfoh.   This team crumbles without Curry and when it shows up people talk about winning culture, like they’ve actually faced some competition and adversity "
"I really hope people start realizing this is a real argument before Steph retires.  He raises the offensive ceiling for his teammates the way Magic or Nash did, but he can also score like Kevin Durant  Every comparison for Curry takes his scoring and uses it as his primary asset. Durant vs Curry: ""comparable offense...""--no, because Curry's impact goes well beyond his point totals. The fact Curry can give you 30 *on top* of running the most efficient offense in the league means he's on a different level.  Curry has lead the league in scoring once. He been the ultimate teammate-raiser every season since Kerr took over.  When he's doing both, he's arguably the greatest offensive player ever"
"I agree it's a slight reach but there was no Clipper within 8 ft of that rebound. Draymond is an excellent passer with great court vision, there's no way he didn't see Kevin Durant two feet away from him w/ his arms outstretched. Obviously KD wouldn't have been clapping his hands and jogging up court if he had secured that rebound."
"Kevin ""Keyshawn Johnson"" Durant"
"MJ's Bulls were loaded but they still had competition. Other teams like the Jazz had talent just like them.   Lebron's Heat consisted of 2 top 5 players, and THAT'S IT. Chris Bosh was a high usage role player who couldn't even carry the Raptors to the 8th seed in the East his last year there. Bosh was an all-nba player ONCE in his entire career. And again, the Heat had competition.  Duncan has CARRIED non-stacked teams deep into the playoffs. Lebron has done that. Shaq has done that. Iverson has done that.  Kevin Durant can't beat the Clippers even with 2 other all-stars. Kevin Durant was in the lottery for years like Devin Booker and getting more and more lotto picks added to his team starting with Westbrook and Harden. Durant never made the playoffs without them he never even won 30 games without them. Then his team added Ibaka and Reggie Jackson and Steven Adams etc. Just an endless line of high quality players.  And then Kd decided even that wasn't enough and joined 3 all-stars who just won 73 games and went to the finals and beat him. This is the guy you think can carry any team and make them a contender? HA"
"More details:  https://twitter.com/anthonyVslater/status/1062426418401820672  &gt;About 7 minutes before locker room opened last night, Kevin Durant bolted out, already dressed, skipped media, which he never does. When doors opened, Draymond Green was in the corner on his phone, much quieter than usual, last to leave, but vibe around the room pretty normal."
"i dont like this best player vs most important saying with kd vs curry. if your winning more games and have the generational talent to back it up, arent you considered the best player on the team as well?   eye test also shows the team hums better and his positive affect on the game is undocumented on the stat sheet. this is not to discredit kevin durant but he has honestly felt like a second fiddle to me behind curry despite being a top player in the league."
"1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Lebron James 3. Stephen Curry 4. Kevin Durant 5. Anthony Davis 6. Kawhi Leonard 7. Joel Embiid 8. James Harden 9. Damian Lillard 10. Russell Westbrook  This is just for this season, obviously. "
"Lol I'm seriously expecting to see a top post 2 a month from now like ""The Golden State Warriors are now undefeated since Kevin Durant confronted Draymond Green in the GSW locker room""."
Current top 10 (note the list will change in the playoffs probably as LeBron James will decide to play some defense again maybe).  &amp;#x200B;  1. Stephen Curry 2. Joel Embiid 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Kevin Durant 5. Anthony Davis 6. Kawhi Leonard 7. LeBron James 8. Kyle Lowry 9. Nikola Jokic 10. Damian Lillard  Russ and Harden will probably do better as the season goes on and make my list. Fwiw I think the top 6 are all pretty close together right now. Any of them could be put number one and I wouldn't make too much of a fuss.  &amp;#x200B;
In what world would you trust Draymond Green at the end of the game over Kevin Durant? C'mon man you're better than that.  
"I don't think so.  Curry found himself in an incredible situation surrounded by an incredibly great cast to fit around his very specific set of talents. It isn't to say that he's a system player but rather that he's been able to shine due to the summation of parts around him.  First his backcourt pairing is Klay Thompson, arguably the second greatest three pointer shooter of all time. Imagine what prime Ray Allen could've looked like next to prime Kyle Korver. Ball handling duties are then handed off to another guy who's show some incredible abilities to command the floor, keep the team engaged, fire then up when need be and ensure everyone is communicating and playing good team defense. The challenger to when another superstar player doesn't get into their role or starts straying from the pack is Draymond not Curry.  Dude has been blessed with an amazing cast that has allowed his greatest ability to shine through which is to utterly wreck other teams from nearly any distance within half court. Dude is phenomenal and absolutely incredible. But he's not a better player than Magic.  Magic was able to play all 5 positions, Magic physically was the superior athlete. For his time Magic was absolutely unstoppable. Magic had the better rookie year. Magic was a better passer. Magic had a better post up game, Magic was a better defender. If you were to start a team today - Magic Johnson would have a greater team wide impact due to his ability to fit into multiple positions on the floor and ultimately have a greater impact overall and allow you to do more with less.  If you had a starting lineup of Ben Wallace, Antoine Walker, Larry Hughes, and Tony Allen - that last spot you would fill with Magic Johnson so you can try to get the best you possibly could scrape out of that bunch.  On the other hand - if you had a starting lineup of Marcin Gortat, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson then that last spot would be Curry because your team would absolutely be able to have a fucking field day with teams trying to fight through that kind of shooting firepower.  This isn't a knock on Curry. He's still the greatest shooter in the history of the NBA. Dude an incredibly powerful offensive weapon to have on your team and most teams would kill to have him. But asides from shooting - Magic is better than him at every other average of the game."
Kevin Durant thought everyone knew he was the go to guy without Steph and Draymond not passing it combined with it making them lose gave KDs ego a hit.   The end is near

"If you have freaking Kevin Durant on your team and he is clapping for the ball, in that situation you give the ball to freaking Kevin Durant. lol"
"He is not Jordan level. He’s by far the best shooter of all time sure, but he’s a good not great passer, a bad defender as well. Also I’m the past few years he’s played with the best talent ever assembled so it makes it a little easier. To be fair though he is the main reason it is the best, but it’s a lot easier when you have klay having to be guarded tightly, Kevin Durant having to be guarded tight as well. He’s not on Jordan level."
"#*""My next Odyssey""*  * Kevin Durant wearing white shirt with a clipper on it"
Back in 2015-2016 they were 73-9 without Kevin Durant.
What the hell does his even mean  The only thing Kevin Durant is better at than Steph is being tall
"Second best player in the world right now, after Kevin Durant."
What's the point of averaging 35 if you can't win lol. Kevin Durant doesn't need the kind of help defenders that Curry needs to shoot at his best and not be a defensive liability.   What was Curry doing his first few years in the league before Klay and Draymond came into their own? Dropping 18 points per game on 14 field goal attempts? Durant was averaging 30 ppg his third year in the league on 20 shots and playing solid defense.   The point here is we've never seen Curry without the assets that help make him great. Durant has proven himself to be the best player on each of his 3 teams. 
"KD was definitely in the right but...  They dont respect KD like that lmao smh  KD: 'im just tryin to win a basketball game' Thats not normal lingo between teammates LOL Been 2+ years it still seems like he a outsider.  That's 1 thing about GS, they have a lot of realists players and coach, so you know they understand the KD move the same way most people do. They probably think (know) they're helping him more than he's helping them. They know his move was soft. Probably mention it all the time  (Peep KD's reaction after the finals when Mitch Richmond said 'GS and Kevin Durant'. Same type thing. They laughed, he was salty)"
"Specifically, when it comes to the game of 5 on 5 basketball, Steph Curry is better at that game then Kevin Durant on the offensive end. Durant has him beat when it comes to defensive production, and that is mainly due to the size difference.  When it comes to a one on one matchup, KD vs Steph...clearly KD has the size difference and that would be the primary factor. But Steph might still torch him."
Durant is the better player. Period. Curry is ridiculous and has truly changed the way basketball is played for the foreseeable future... but you’re kidding yourself if you think he is a better basketball player than Kevin Durant. KD makes any team better. Curry makes some teams better.  Steph is the best shooter of all time who also happens to be one of the best scorers/playmakers of all time. KD is an infinitely better all around player who also happens to be one of the best scorers of all time.  Trade Curry to PHX for Booker straight up and GSW is playing for a 4 seed. Trade Durant for Booker straight up and PHX is playing for a 4 seed. 
Well Curry is the Point Guard. Of course the overall flow of the offense is going to go down way more if Curry is missing vs if Kevin Durant (SF) is missing.  Durant is still overall a better though when you look at them individually. That’s all people are saying. Really not that controversial.

"Kevin Durant on his reaction to being clippered: ""Shai just caught me off guard. I sat at the free throw line for, like, two hours just trying to process it all, like just trying to process the whole thing, and it just tripped me out honestly"" "
Kevin Durant took 24 shots and got fouled out.   You want him to start jacking shots from the sideline in OT?

Kevin Durant 
Kevin Durant literally has to do that every possession from here on out
[Kevin Durant or Kyle Lowry.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/mvp.html)
This kevin durant fella seems pretty good. I would like him on my team. 
Udonis Haslem was a Heat fan growing up.   Kevin Durant mentioned that he was a Raptors fan growing up because of Vince.   
It would honestly be like Kevin Durant skill + Shaq Strength + John Wall speed.  It'd be fucking terrifying
"Pretty much why I’m in such a good mood about it, last season we’d be in a dogfight against these teams, especially without Russ and Dre. Hell, even the Dallas game felt pretty good to me. They literally couldn’t miss from everywhere, we couldn’t get a layup to go and we still repeatedly fought back over the second half to get the game within single digits until time ran out. This team didn’t have anything resembling that fight last year, they’d go down 10 points in the first half and visibly just shrug and go through the motions for the rest of the game. Like me in pickup when I’m too lazy to close out on a hot 3 pt shooter and I’m just hoping he starts missing. The effort and focus is night and day from last year.   One thing from the offense I’m seeing that I’ve never seen the Thunder do under Donovan or Brooks is actually looking for mismatches and targeting them. Against Houston they put Melo in the P&amp;R and just smoked him over and over, they’re spacing out and finally just throwing the ball in to Steven against small lineups, letting him read the defense and abuse smaller defenders or draw double teams. This is all basic fucking basketball stuff but it’s stuff we’ve never really done. You could throw JJ Barea on Kevin Durant and we’d still just end up clearing out so he could take a 20 foot jump-shot. "
"Nah. Waiting on him to prove his point.  I can easily say ""No coach or GM would take Kevin Durant over DeMar DeRozan for the playoffs"" and just shrug my shoulders.  Go ahead and prove me wrong by contacting a coach or GM.   Cheers, awaiting your thoughts. "
Brandon Ingram is the next Kevin Durant! 
"Lol cmon man, you think in the 90s, when entire offenses were built around bigs, college guards couldn’t get the ball to Shaq? He was taking 18 shots a game   And why couldn’t Ben Simmons have done that? Or Zion now? This is 18 year old, not fully developed Lebron, who couldn’t even shoot yet. Kevin Durant, someone who was way too tall and athletic for anyone in college, and who could shoot put up 26 and 11 on 47/40/82 "
It was a phenomenal team really and matched up pretty well with the original Warriors teams (they had some classic games). But then Kevin Durant happened and it was over after that.
Kevin Durant is gonna stay in GS. He doesn’t the balls to carry a team like the Knicks. PROVE ME WRONG KEVIN
Yes because Chris Bosh and Kevin love equal Scottie puppet and Kevin Durant 
Did OKC boo Kevin Durant?    Did Toronto boo Vince Carter?   Did Cleveland boo Lebron?   Did Denver boo Melo?    Did Indiana boo PG?    Did Cleveland boo Kyrie?  Did Boston boston boo Rondo?   Did Boston boo Ray Allen?   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Yeah Jazz fans aren't unique here.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;
"Some Free Throws Per Minutes Played Context:  Player | FTA | Minutes Played | FTA/12 MINUTES -------------|----------|----------|------------- Joel Embiid | 147 | 491 | 3.59 Zach LaVine | 98 | 469 | 2.51 Giannis | 92 | 391 | 2.82 LeBron James | 91 | 455 | 2.40 Blake Griffin | 88 | 424 | 2.49 Damian Lillard | 84 | 441 | 2.29 De'Aaron Fox | 83 | 427 | 2.33 Anthony Davis | 82 | 336 | 2.93 James Harden | 82 | 326 | 3.02 Kevin Durant | 81 | 447 | 2.17  Embiid is still leading, but the Sixers have been screwed with 4 back-to-backs already so the number is inflated.  He's shooting roughly half a free throw more per quarter than Harden."
"Kawhi told his team he wants to out. Spurs got DeMar DeRozan, player who's averaging 25 points 50%FG 6.2assists with longer contract. Yes, what Kawhi did was bad, but atleast he was honest from the day one. Gordon:  &gt;Jazz center Rudy Gobert in a recent feature by ESPN's Zach Lowe: """"I could feel it. I was texting him a few days before (Hayward's July 4th decision), and he wasn't texting me back. That's what I didn't like. Just tell me. After five years, trust us, say what you are going to do. But I respect his choice.""  &gt;For my part, it was only the fact that he didn’t really communicate with me. I tried to reach out to him before, just to have some information. No matter what, I was going to respect his choice. He kind of ignored me. That’s the part I didn’t really like.  &gt;I was kind of considering him as a brother. We played four years together, went through a lot and I thought I was important enough to know. Looks like I wasn’t, but we’ve moved on and I wish him the best in Boston.”   Even Kevin Durant told to Thunder owners before signing. Gordon waited for last second and everyone found out about him leaving from twitter.  "
"BREAKING: Kawhi Leonard considering thinking about daydreaming of joining Kevin Durant on Lakers at some point maybe if they feel like it. Remember, if it happens I had the scoop. "
"Yes, and more than that, he's one of the best 20 shooters in the NBA. Sure he's in a slump to start the season, but he's still not someone you'd ever want to leave open. You can't just look at the raw percentages and draw conclusions. His volume, degree of difficulty, and offensive load are off the charts. I think I read that Harden won a shooting competition at Team USA minicamp this summer, where players like Devin Booker, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson were also in attendance. You can't do that if you're not a good shooter. When he dropped 53-17-16 against the Knicks two years ago, he did it on 9-16 three point shooting. You can't do that if you're not a good three point shooter. He also had the most three pointers made in the NBA last season. That's pretty hard to do if you're not a good three point shooter. So, unless your definition of ""good"" is really narrow, by most metrics, and by the eye test, Harden is a great shooter."
"Because you was booing players who did a lot for you. Even then he's playing. Gordon deserve these booes because;  1. He didn't inform teammates or owners about leaving. They found out about him signing with Celtics from twitter or another shit. Even Kevin Durant told Thunder owner/gm about leaving before signing.  2. He delayed his signing.  3. After journalist leaked his signing with Celtics, he denied it and few hours later he released players tribune article.  Look what Rudy Gobert said; &gt;For my part, it was only the fact that he didn’t really communicate with me. I tried to reach out to him before, just to have some information. No matter what, I was going to respect his choice. He kind of ignored me. That’s the part I didn’t really like.  &gt;I was kind of considering him as a brother. We played four years together, went through a lot and I thought I was important enough to know. Looks like I wasn’t, but we’ve moved on and I wish him the best in Boston.”"
Or Durant? I'm hyped for a Giannis v Kevin matchup in the finals even though it will probably be a sweep or 5 games
Closer to Travis Outlaw than Kevin Durant. What a dumb comparison.   Im in favor of trading him + Zo for an established all star. 
Kevin Durant
"-Lebron won 2 rings and 2 MVP's in Miami after losing to Dallas.   -Stephen Curry won 3 rings in Golden State and 2 MVP's (and you know the KD stuff)   -Kobe Bryant retired scoring 60 in his last game.   -Russell Westbrook has averaged a triple double for the past two years.   -Also everyone is shooting 3 pointers now.          -Some of the best players in the league include Lebron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook and Joel Embiid.   "
"Warriors a dynasty  LeBron to Cleveland then LA  The #1 overall pick in the 2017 draft forgot how to shoot  Huge emphasis on 3 pointers   Teams are finals contenders: Warriors, Raptors, Bucks, Celtics  Superstar players: LeBron (LAL), Kevin Durant (GSW), Steph Curry (GSW), James Harden (HOU), Giannis Antetokounmpo (MIL), Kawhi Leonard (TOR), Anthony Davis (NO), Russell Westbrook (OKC)"
"Warriors are the new Bulls but think more MONSTARS instead of MJ - they have 5 all-stars, including Kevin Durant.  Lebron's a laker because of family reasons, also got a ring for CLE  D'aaron Fox is the upcoming GOAT"

Kevin Durant joining the warriors
KEVIN FUCKING DURANT
HOLY SHIT KEVIN DURANT 
Wtf is Kevin Durant and why was he allowed to join that team
Kevin Durant is underrated
KEVIN DURANT IS A SICKO
Kawhi loves playing against Kevin Durant.
That's why the solution was to go to the Lakers and then add Kevin Durant next summer.
Why are you getting downvoted literally no one can guard Kevin Durant he's a fucking bullshit historic offense creator that can shoot finish inside move effectively and oh yeah the asshole is 7 feet tall. He's so good it's arguably bad for teams he plays on because it kills your offensive system when the best option is always KD iso. This man gets more buckets than the floor under a leaky roof and just had back to back 40 point games and these r/NBA hos gonna act like their favorite fake Canadian has a chance to shut that down? Hell nah. I can't fucking stand Kevin Durant he softer than Drake holding a teddy bear but the man cannot be guarded
"&gt;Siakam MAULS Kevin Durant   LMFAO really? I thought Siakam dunked on Durant or blocked the shit out of him.. but the dude literally got called for a defensive foul..    &gt;  How the fuck is this ""MAULING""? Only person Siakam mauled here, is his own damn self. Goddamn it fool.. these clickbait titles are just annoying"
Kevin Durant is good at basketball
Is Kevin Durant the best at pull up 3s in the league? This shot is INSANE but I feel like he does it all the time 
Kevin Durant couldn't guard Kevin Durant 
"Kevin ""Steph Curry"" Durant"
I have no idea how you stop Kevin Durant. 
#Kevin Fucking Durant
Kevin Durant has sexual intercourse with women
God damn Kevin Durant. Not this guy.
Kevin fucking Durant
"oh right, Kevin Durant is a transcendental scorer, oops "
Kevin Durant attempted more free throws than the raptors...
Is Kevin Durant the least likeable person?
Why are you all freaking out over that foul? Pascal's chest isn't supposed to be in the way of Durant. So what if he had his shoulder lowered? It's attached to Kevin Durant; so my first point still stands.
Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard are both better than Curry. 
People are saying the games close when it Raps should have a far bigger lead but they're facing Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson?? Are they rookies all of a sudden that Steph and Draymond are out? Lmao..
Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant is going to go for club 60 again.  
"&gt; Cleveland won a championship  Yeah, but by beating Warriors, it caused them to gain Kevin Durant. If the Lakers beat the Warriors, the Warriors will probably get Anthony Davis. Nobody wants that!"
"you with that username making this post calling others butthurt is the greatest lack of self awareness this side of kevin durant.  what's the matter, your CHRIS PAUL AND JAMES HARDEN ARE PLAYOFF CHOKERS copypasta finally got you banned and you needed a new alt?  harden still fucked your bitch. in his limited edition unreleased vol 4 signature flip-flops."
"Kevin Durant also played on a losing team his rookie year which gives everyone a poor +/-. Luka is on a team which has a winning record, and the Mavs are not primarily dominating teams while Luka is on the floor, it’s when Carlisle’s brings out the bench led by JJ Barea that they rack up huge leads. Luka is obviously the future of this team and insanely good for his age, so he gets the keys to the offense whenever he’s out on the floor, but he’s hardly an actual superstar player yet.   Make no mistake, Rick’s HoF tier coaching is the main reason the Mavs are able to let an obviously super talented but still raw rookie play so freely and develop comfortably while still able to win games. "
So they could take the Kevin Durant era Warriors to 7 games in the WCF. They were literally right there if CP3 hadn’t gone down. 
"Takeaways:  Atlanta - Baze continuing to look nice through RPM. Surprised to see Len/Dedmon look like an average big rotation through RPM. On the inverse, surprised to see the wing as low as it is with Prince but I guess their depth sucks and pg non existent even with Trae's passing at least keeping him afloat and JLin playing like a 6man candidate  BKN - Nothing too surprising. Allen has been good, guards have been good (Get back soon Caris) &amp; Dlo/Dinwiddie nice, Joe Harris is a splash daddy  Boston - Kyrie is an okay pg I think, and they good and deep everywhere else minus Brown's abysmal play killing their SG RPM it looks like  CHA - Has always been sorta well rounded and decent but just never had a 2nd star or facilitator to play with Kemba. Same ole story. Kemba playing like an All Star surrounded by decent role players. Like I like Zeller, Marvin, Lamb etc but in today's NBA you just need more firepower than a 1 man show and good role players/decent starters.  CHI - TIL RPM hates RoLo and WCJ....Also fucking no way thats Cam Payne, right?! Thats gotta be LaVine listed at pg...Also shouout to Justin Holiday having a good year   CLE - Who cares rn srs. Year 1 of a rebuild evident  DAL - SO WELL ROUNDED...LUKA!!!  DEN - Paul Millsap still an RPM god I see...Jokic and Harris obvious with their impact  DET - Roster is just a mediocre mess. They really need depth and wings. Where they get that from is gonna be the biggest unsolved question of the Blake/Drummond era with their draft positions and cap space  GS - Kevin Durant is good at basketball TIL  HOU - Per RPM Houston definitely needs to upgrade at SG or SF. That James Harden guy just not getting it done...Not sure if they have him as a SG or SF also if SG Eric Gordon is probably anchoring that RPM towards negative 0 if I had to guess for this season. Also thought Center would be higher bc I thought Capela and Tucker were RPM golden boys  IND - Predictable and well rounded. Spikes from Dipo and Sabonis prolly  LAC - Tobias is a rich man's Kevin Durant obviously, finally making the leap we saw the potential he could hit. DANILLO GALLINARI *heavy Italian voice*  Lakers - Lebron James is decent  Memphis - Gasol and Conely = Playoffs. They are symbolically the Spurs if the Spurs were only 2 players.  Miami - Boring team til those contracts expire. Great guard/wing depth evident.   MIL - Giannis. Khris. And Bledsoe??! just so well rounded   Min - RoCo and Drose the best players on this team obviously. It is known  NOP - AD/Niko front court killing it. Shoutout to Jrue &amp; 3Twuan, truly a top position group. Sucks they decided to play 3 v 5 this year tho with no wings or pgs  Knicks - Best Zo in the league   OKC - Does RPM hate Westbrook? I thought Shroeder + WB would be one of the top PG RPM's. Oh ya, PG is kinda good. SG and PF unsurprisingly bad. And Adams gotta be carrying that center position hard, 0 depth   ORL - Vuc  PHI - This is JJ Redick's team  Phx - :/  POR - Unsurprisingly deep and good   SAC - Ima a Big Buddy and Boggie fan. Good thing they are at least average in Center RPM. After drafting like their 11th lotto big man you'd hope so lol.    SAS - LaMarcus Aldridge, Pau Gasol, Davis Bertans - RPM HATES THEM! - Pg 34 5 reasons why...   DEEBO  TOR - Deeper and gooder than everybody. Sounds like Serge is still listed as a PF for some reason. Him and Siakam have been playing like border line All Stars which is why that position group is listed so elite.  UTA - Well rounded but avg and playing in the west with no elite shot creators  WAS - You could probably go to Dwight Howard orgy and pick out a more valuable center asset than Ian Mahimni. Especially if u paying him or her league min"
"It wasn't said directly, but it was pretty implicitly said. Here, look at [this article](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/6/27/12039566/kevin-durant-rumors-washington-wizards-dead), it explains a lot.  &amp;#x200B;"
"When you have the chance to sign Kevin fucking Durant, you fucking do it. Continuity doesn't mean jack shit when you compared to star power of Durant. "
"you realize kevin durant had a negative 9 on off in his rookie season too, Luka is a kid with superstar potential, he hits threes off catch and shoot and off the dribble, makes unreal passes, can navigate pick and roll, can post up smaller players and this is all with his “unathletic” body, wait until he gets a couple years of nba training. Just give up luka was a better pick than bagley and ayton( wont say trae young cause they got another pick in the deal). There were people in lebrons rookie year argued melo was just as good if not better, but people who knew the game understood would impact winning more long term"
"he definitely didn't ruin the game.  The Warriors were constructed organically and were a testament to great stewardship and scouting.  Then Kevin Durant (and now Boogie) ruined the game.  Before, they were a fun team to watch that could potentially be beaten, now the NBA is just a mean joke."
1. LeBron James  2. Steph Curry  3. Kevin Durant   4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Joel Embiid  6. Kawhi Leonard  7. Anthony Davis  8. James Harden  9. Russell Westbrook   10. Damian Lillard  
"KD might just want to leave regardless of what Warriors decide to do with Klay and Dray.         Fred and JV have enough value that Warriors can just trade them for assets. Someone like the Suns would definitely trade a couple of early seconds for him or even a first. The wanted to trade a pick for Terry Rozier...       Teams were willing to take a chance on JV when his value was at rock bottom two seasons ago, so he probably can get them things too.         Beside, JV and Fred make less than Kevin Durant, so they actually save money too, and if they actually want to keep JV they can convince him to opt out of his player option and sign a more reasonable long term contract.            If Durant wants out, Warriors would definitely take that trade because even a shitty pick is better than no pick. It's really up to Durant, if he wants it, it will happen. "

Kevin Durant
"For a couple of years now, I have believed that the Lakers young core is overrated by the media and the average NBA fan. Below I have typed up reasons why I believe that Ball, Ingram, and Kuzma are overrated relative to their actual abilities and potential ceilings.  Lonzo Ball:  We know that Lonzo is a good - possibly elite - passer, and in his two seasons in the NBA he has shown flashes of being a good defender. But, I believe that a good-to-elite passer and average-to-good defender is more than likely all he will ever be. That is not a bad thing by any means. Good passers and good defenders will always have a place in the NBA. Lonzo's passing ability and natural instincts already put him in the upper echelon of passers in the NBA and he could potentially be one of the all time great passers.  My knock on him (and it isn't much of a knock, really) is that he is not, and likely (IMO) never will be, a good scorer in the NBA. Let's look at his numbers.  Lonzo's 3-point shooting during his one year at UCLA is gradually seeming like more of an anomaly than a true indicator of his shooting ability. Lonzo shot an efficient 40% from deep during his lone season at UCLA. But, like many others, I like to look at free throw % as a reliable indicator of how well someone can shoot or how well they can potentially shoot. His freshman year at UCLA, Lonzo shot 67% from the free throw line on 98 attempts. Like Fallout Boy says, 2 out of 3 ain't bad.  So far in the NBA, Lonzo is shooting 47% from the free throw line (though he's only taken 85 attempts despite having played nearly double as many minutes as he did in college; his free throw rate has gone down from 28% in college to 11% in the NBA, which is understandable), so it's possible that he's just in a slump. But, if you combine his college numbers with his NBA numbers, he's shooting a measly 57% on 183 free throw attempts, a more than fair sample size. This is another tangent that I wont' go into that much, but opposing defenses are taking away his driving ability and forcing him to shoot, which leads to my next point.  As everyone knows, Lonzo has a pretty ugly shooting form. It's like the 'Tim Tebow throwing motion' of the NBA. He has a slow wind up and shoots with his arms out in front of him rather than at or above head level like most shooters. This makes his shot easy to defend for defenders with any sort of wingspan and manageable for players with minimal wingspans. His athletic ability also isn't head and shoulders above his peers in the NBA like it was in college, making it more difficult for him to create space, as well as get buckets in the lane like I alluded to earlier.  So far in his NBA career, Lonzo is shooting 31.5% from deep on 375 attempts, which I believe to be a true reflection of his shooting ability, not his outlier stats from his year at UCLA. Another negative is that 52% (over half!) of his shots in the NBA have come from outside the arc. He's shooting 51% from within three feet, so when he does get to the basket he converts a little more than half the time and is defended/blocked almost the every other time, as his low free throw rate indicates. So while he's effective in close range, he's taking way too many threes for that to matter.  There are some big ""if's"" for Lonzo. If he can improve his shooting motion and make it more difficult to defend, then he theoretically could become a good shooter. But his shot right now just doesn't cut it. It's a lot to ask of a player to change his motion after nearly 20 years of using it, but that's what it will take. Improving his shot will make defenders creep up on him which he can use to his advantage by using his speed and quickness to get past defenders and into the paint where he's been a pretty decent finisher.  In summation: Lonzo is not and will not be a good shooter in the NBA unless he drastically improves his shooting form, which is unlikely. That does not mean that he can't or won't be a great NBA player. Like I said above he has elite passing talent and that likely won't go away anytime soon. He's also an average defender. Combine those two elements and you have a good basketball player, but probably not a perennial (or even one-time) all-star. Again, he is a good basketball player, but he is not a scorer and never will be unless he fixes his shot. I think that his ceiling as it stands is Rajon Rondo, who is a great player, or a poor man's Jason Kidd. Again, those are great comps, but he isn't the all around star like people like to think he is.  Next!  Brandon Ingram:  Brandon Ingram is tall and very skilled for his size, which is why he was taken #2 overall, garnered years worth of Kevin Durant comparisons, and was in the discussion for the #1 pick over Ben Simmons a few years ago.  Let's look at that comparison real quick. In Kevin Durant's one season at Texas, he solidified himself as one of the most dynamic scorers ever seen in college hoops and one of the all-time greats despite playing just one season. Durant shot 40% from deep on 6 attempts per game that year and 82% from the free throw line on just over 7 attempts per game. Those are good numbers. Overall, Durant averaged 25 points per game on 47% shooting from the field. Unlike Lonzo's stats I mentioned above, Durant's three point percentage correlates to his free throw percentage, which was a good predictor of how good of a shooter he has turned out to be.  Brandon Ingram in his lone season at Duke hardly lit the world on fire. While he did shoot 41% from deep that year, better than Durant's percentage, he only shot 68% from the free throw line on 5 attempts per game. Overall he averaged 17 points per game on 44% shooting from the field. Fine numbers, but not elite by any means and certainly not comparable to Durant's freshman season. On the defensive end, Ingram averaged 1 defensive win share and 3.5 on offense, while Durant averaged 4.1 on defense and 4.7 on offense.  But back to the crux of my argument: free throw % as an indicator of shooting ability. His freshman year at Duke, Ingram shot in the 68% from the line. His free throw mediocrity has since carried over to the NBA, where he’s averaged 65% from the line over the course of 564 attempts in his 2+ seasons.  So, as data would suggest, Ingram's 3pt% this season and his rookie season has regressed to where it should be for someone with his shooting ability, in the low-30's. Ingram is a scorer, but the issue here is that he hasn’t been all that good at it and is pretty inefficient. IN FACT, he has a negative offensive win-share, meaning his offense actually HURTS his team when he’s on the floor. Ingram is still young, and can and will likely increase his efficiency, but history suggests that he isn't more than an average scorer and below average shooter. To his credit, Ingram doesn't shoot predominately from any specific range and spreads his attempts out pretty well. 31% of his shots come at the basket where he converts 63%, a great number. However, 23% of his shots come from midrange, where he's only shot 36% for his career, a very poor number. He actually shoots the least from three, which is understandable since it's his worst area, averaging 33% from deep in his career. So at least he has some awareness of his strengths and weaknesses, aside from that midrange issue.  Frankly, if you compare him to his similarly-aged peers, Ingram is nothing special. He's just... well, fine. He's fine. Again, he's not a bad NBA player necessarily, despite having a career negative OWS, but he isn't great, and likely never will be. He can be a role player on a good team, someone you can have guard lengthy wings, get to the basket and score from there efficiently, and shoot an occasional three, but that's probably it. Those who act like he's the next Durant or Giannis or even Paul George need to take a closer look.  Kyle Kuzma:  Lastly, Kyle Kuzma. Kuzma played three years at Utah, which I think most CBB fans would agree is an average-to-mediocre basketball program. In his time there, Kuzma averaged 3, 10, and 16 points in his freshman, sophomore, and junior seasons respectively. Those are decent numbers and not bad for college ball, but nothing fancy, granted no one really acts like he was some amazing All American at Utah, so this might be a moot point.  During his career as a Ute, Kuzma averaged 30% from deep and 63% from the free throw line overall, though he increased his FT% each season; his 3pt% did not follow the same trend, going from 32 to 25 and back to 32. Looking at his win-shares, he totaled 4.7 on offense and 3.5 on defense in 96 career games, not bad, but remember that Ingram and Durant put up more win-shares despite only playing in a third of the amount of games Kuzma did.  I'll give credit where credits due, Kuzma definitely had a good rookie year. He averaged 16ppg on 36% 3pt shooting and 70% from the line. His free throw % continued its upward trend from college, which may indicate that he will continue to work on and improve his shot, which is obviously a good sign.  Despite his yearly free throw % progression, his 3p% has not done the same. It went from bad to worse to bad again in college (32 to 25 to 32) before taking a big leap his rookie season. But, this year, he's come back down to earth, or to Utah I guess you could say. He's shooting 29% on 5 attempts per game in 20 games, which means he's made about 29 of 100. Not a good number, yet a decent sample size. This number is obviously much more similar to his college 3pt numbers, which were bad.  Unlike Ingram or Lonzo, Kuzma is not a freak athlete, which is likley why he was playing at Utah in the first place and not at Kentucky or UCLA or Duke. He’s a solid-to-good basketball player, but with his athletic limitations and history of a mediocre jump shot, he’ll likely never be a star. He’s actually a decent defender, with a positive w/s, but it isn’t anything spectacular.  "
Specifically on Kevin Durant. I wonder if we'll hear another hilarious trade proposal like KD for Otto Porter from a few weeks ago?

"&gt; I am 7 years older than you.  Then I'd argue that you are manufacturing a nostalgia for a game that was never as entertaining as today's game. As much is evidenced by the NBA's meteoric rise in popularity in recent years.  Even watching tape of those Bulls teams is an eye-opening experience for me. MJ and Scottie with all world performances in the post, but largely slow, physical, grind-em out games.  &gt; Or you now, some people prefer strategy to chucking from behind some line.  Sure. I'm not saying you aren't allowed to prefer a relatively unskilled game. But let's not get it twisted, that's exactly what it is. Pop is upset he can't take a bunch of depth players and b-class superstars and win a championship anymore. Now, you need all-world talent. This is happening across all sports with the analytical revolution.  Hockey has seen a parallel path: The 90s were known as the ""dead puck era."" It followed the highest scoring era of all time, as hockey coaches realized you could use an elite goalie and take a bunch of depth guys and teach them defensive systems to win against elite talent.  The NHL has acted and changed rules accordingly, and now the game has returned to it's high entertainment value: Less fighting, less penalties, less hitting, less holding, more skill, more goals, more athleticism.  &gt; How is that any different today? Lineups are frankly getting longer.  Sure. That's the dream now: A 6'9 point guard. But the bigs are getting skinnier, more athletic, and size is becoming [less significant.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-nbas-small-guys-play-bigger-by-getting-smaller-1511212192) Basically, it's becoming positionless basketball, and as Curry, Trae Young, Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul, Kemba, Kyrie are showing us is that, increasingly, you don't need to be tall or particularly built to drive an offense.  The percentage of total postseason minutes logged by players 6-foot-10 or taller has fallen from 29 percent in 2009 (the year 6-foot-11 Dwight Howard led the Orlando Magic to the NBA Finals) to 22 percent in 2017-18. At the same time, the share of playoff VORP belonging to big men has fallen from 34 percent to 26 percent. Only three players 6-foot-10 or taller — Kevin Love, JaVale McGee, Kevin Durant — played any significant minutes in the NBA Finals in 2017-18."
"&gt;David Robinson ran the court better than any seven footer today  Friendly reminder that Kevin Durant is seven feet tall.   Also, notice you just listed a handful of all time greats. Literally every single big man needs to be able to run like that now."
"Here's what I've got.  1st team: Kemba Walker, Kyle Lowry, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James  2nd team: James Harden, Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard  3rd team: Russell Westbrook, DeMar Derozan, Nikola Jokic, Blake Griffin, Paul George"
Lol neither of them are listed at 6’7”  KD is definitely 6’11” at least.  http://www.slamonline.com/nba/kevin-durant-finally-admits-hes-7-feet-tall/#FgpOER3AkP7DahQk.97   Players lie about these things all the time. LeBron used to hide his real playing weight. He was always listed like 20 or 30 pounds under what he played at. It used to be a talking point to guess what LeBron actually weighed. 
A Kevin Durant type player
"Curry also benefits from the gravity of Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green (Harrison Barnes before Durant) and Andre Iguodola. In terms of creating for themselves, I’d pick Durant to take the last shot.  Or a 2011 finals Dirk.  Or a prime Kareem.  "
Eastern All Star STARTERS (in my opinion)  PG: Kemba Walker  SG: Victor Oladipo  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Joel Embiid        Western All Star STARTERS (in my opinion)   PG: Stephen Curry (Damian Lillard in case Steph gets injured)   SG: James Harden   SF: LeBron James (pretty obvious lol)  PF: Kevin Durant   C: Anthony Davis     I can’t think of the bench players honestly because I don’t think I can think of too much players at 9 PM after I just came back from work.   
Considering that Kawhi Leonard was a Finals MVP.   Considering that Kevin Durant is a 2x Finals MVP and an MVP.   Considering that Giannis may very well be the league’s MVP this year.   Considering that James Harden was last year’s league MVP.   Considering that Anthony Davis is an MVP caliber player and just one day take over as the best player in the world.     Yes you can. 
Oh no now they only have Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson
"The KAT thing was definitely not just this sub though.  2016-17 GM survey:  &gt;If you were starting a franchise today and could sign any player in the NBA, who would it be?  &gt;1.

Ok Kevin Durant.
We already know what Giannis with Curry jumper looks like. Kevin Wayne Durant.

How do you really feel about Kevin Durant causing an entire year of free agency drama by signing 1 yr deals despite all the success on the court ? 
"A 6'5"" Kevin Durant."
"&gt;	Brandon is way stronger than he looks. You don’t have to be built like Karl Malone to be strong. There are thinner guys who are really strong. Kevin Durant, who I used to work with, has real strength to his body. And Brandon is no stranger to the weight room. He does everything we ask of him and more. He’s a worker. If you look at pictures of him from his rookie year to the end of this year, you’ll see a noticeable difference  Did you read that part of the shitty article that didn’t fit your narrative?"
"I love this idea and I have jackshit to do at work for another hour so here goes...  &amp;#x200B;  Klay Thompson goes to the Detroit Pistons!  Detroit has two star big men and two solid point guards(on paper, DET fans please tell me if I'm wrong) but they need better wing play/shooting. This move keeps Point Blake going in full effect and gives him, Drummond, and Jackson much more space to operate in.  &amp;#x200B;  DeMarcus Cousins goes to the Washington Wizards!  Wall and Boogie reunited. Plus we get to see the team chemistry of Wall, Beal, Porter, Boogie, Dwight Howard, Austin Rivers, and Jeff Green all mixed together(!)  &amp;#x200B;  Stephen Curry goes to the Phoenix Suns!  Curry, Booker, Bridges, Warren, Ayton. That's really fun. Plus the Suns literally do not have a PG. This team isn't winning the title, but it'll be fun as hell.  &amp;#x200B;  Draymond Green goes to the Dallas Mavericks!  Draymond Green and DeAndre Jordan. No one is scoring in the paint. You're just not.  &amp;#x200B;  Kevin Durant goes to the Charlotte Hornets!  Kemba finally gets a running partner and it just so happens to be one of the best players of all-time."
"For a couple of years now, I have believed that the Lakers young core is overrated by the media and the average NBA fan. Below I have typed up reasons why I believe that Ball, Ingram, and Kuzma are overrated relative to their actual abilities and potential ceilings.  Lonzo Ball:  We know that Lonzo is a good - possibly elite - passer, and in his two seasons in the NBA he has shown flashes of being a good defender. But, I believe that a good-to-elite passer and average-to-good defender is more than likely all he will ever be. That is not a bad thing by any means. Good passers and good defenders will always have a place in the NBA. Lonzo's passing ability and natural instincts already put him in the upper echelon of passers in the NBA and he could potentially be one of the all time great passers.  My knock on him (and it isn't much of a knock, really) is that he is not, and likely (IMO) never will be, a good scorer in the NBA. Let's look at his numbers.  Lonzo's 3-point shooting during his one year at UCLA is gradually seeming like more of an anomaly than a true indicator of his shooting ability. Lonzo shot an efficient 40% from deep during his lone season at UCLA. But, like many others, I like to look at free throw % as a reliable indicator of how well someone can shoot or how well they can potentially shoot. His freshman year at UCLA, Lonzo shot 67% from the free throw line on 98 attempts. Like Fallout Boy says, 2 out of 3 ain't bad.  So far in the NBA, Lonzo is shooting 47% from the free throw line (though he's only taken 85 attempts despite having played nearly double as many minutes as he did in college; his free throw rate has gone down from 28% in college to 11% in the NBA, which is understandable), so it's possible that he's just in a slump. But, if you combine his college numbers with his NBA numbers, he's shooting a measly 57% on 183 free throw attempts, a more than fair sample size. This is another tangent that I wont' go into that much, but opposing defenses are taking away his driving ability and forcing him to shoot, which leads to my next point.  As everyone knows, Lonzo has a pretty ugly shooting form. It's like the 'Tim Tebow throwing motion' of the NBA. He has a slow wind up and shoots with his arms out in front of him rather than at or above head level like most shooters. This makes his shot easy to defend for defenders with any sort of wingspan and manageable for players with minimal wingspans. His athletic ability also isn't head and shoulders above his peers in the NBA like it was in college, making it more difficult for him to create space, as well as get buckets in the lane like I alluded to earlier.  So far in his NBA career, Lonzo is shooting 31.5% from deep on 375 attempts, which I believe to be a true reflection of his shooting ability, not his outlier stats from his year at UCLA. Another negative is that 52% (over half!) of his shots in the NBA have come from outside the arc. He's shooting 51% from within three feet, so when he does get to the basket he converts a little more than half the time and is defended/blocked almost the every other time, as his low free throw rate indicates. So while he's effective in close range, he's taking way too many threes for that to matter.  There are some big ""if's"" for Lonzo. If he can improve his shooting motion and make it more difficult to defend, then he theoretically could become a good shooter. But his shot right now just doesn't cut it. It's a lot to ask of a player to change his motion after nearly 20 years of using it, but that's what it will take. Improving his shot will make defenders creep up on him which he can use to his advantage by using his speed and quickness to get past defenders and into the paint where he's been a pretty decent finisher.  In summation: Lonzo is not and will not be a good shooter in the NBA unless he drastically improves his shooting form, which is unlikely. That does not mean that he can't or won't be a great NBA player. Like I said above he has elite passing talent and that likely won't go away anytime soon. He's also an average defender. Combine those two elements and you have a good basketball player, but probably not a perennial (or even one-time) all-star. Again, he is a good basketball player, but he is not a scorer and never will be unless he fixes his shot. I think that his ceiling as it stands is Rajon Rondo, who is a great player, or a poor man's Jason Kidd. Again, those are great comps, but he isn't the all around star like people like to think he is.  Next!  Brandon Ingram:  Brandon Ingram is tall and very skilled for his size, which is why he was taken #2 overall, garnered years worth of Kevin Durant comparisons, and was in the discussion for the #1 pick over Ben Simmons a few years ago.

I guess Nike screwed up with their slides again showing kevin durant to kahwi lol
"Klay is my second most anticipated AMA.    I’ve long wanted to open this sub to see “Hi r/nba Kevin Durant here, heard you was talkin shit.”    It would be a shitshow, but a glorious shit show."
"Why you have to say BS? I wasn't born in 2005 and just started watching the NBA. You can't simply look at stats and say the player with the better stats deserved it. Give it to Lebron then 10 years in a row if that's all it takes.   Voters fatigue also happened with Jordan. Lebron joined Wade and Bosh so expectations were really high.   I still think Rose deserved his MVP. Bulls were the #1 seed, they were a really well playing and balanced team and Rose was young, upcoming and very special (even Harden and Westbrook MVP year didn't look as good as Rose's (not looking at their triple double average), his was on a Curry level) and made a big impact on everyone. Of course that plays a role.   &gt;Rose got 1,182 points and 113 first-place votes from a panel of media voters, supplanting Wes Unseld as the youngest to win the award with a runaway win. Orlando's Dwight Howard (643 points) finished second, Miami's LeBron James was third, the Lakers' Kobe Bryant was fourth and Oklahoma City star Kevin Durant finished fifth."
Kevin Durant
Yeah I haven’t asked a celebrity for an autograph since I was a kid. It just seems kind of better to not treat them like a celebrity. I don’t think I ever even acknowledged that Kevin Durant played pro ball on the numerous times he asked me to help out with drills.

Why don't you go and look at the stats and tell me how 2nd best player in the league Kevin Durant played down that stretch?
"Seriously, dude, and I'm blessed to be able to catch the guy the one time he came to our country (India). [Transcript of the full interview](https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/kevin-durant-is-the-only-unstoppable-player-in-the-nba-tim-hardaway-sr-nba-legend)"
"Let’s see, the bulls sign Dennis fucking Rodman and then win 72, the warriors win 73 AND THEN sign Kevin Durant (who is much better than Rodman just to be clear) so the equivalent for the bulls would literally be signing Hakeem after their 72 win season. Yes I would pick the warriors to win, the rockets brought them to 7 because of embarrassing play from Durant for a large stretch of the series that would have lost his team the WCF if he was the best player on any other team in league history.  If warriors were fully engaged and playing their best basketball the whole series then they win in 5.  The only reason you think it’s comparable is because of the epic individual legacy MJ built through signature performances to win titles. The warriors are not doing this, they’re just winning for free and nobody cares."
Kevin Durant -&gt; Russell Westbrook
"... that's a pretty weird take, yeah. Unless you look at it in terms of when the rest of the roster might be ready, by which point Steph might be a bit old.  The thing is, in a weird way, being a fan of a team that's There is less interesting. Not less fun - watching the Warriors crush it in the playoffs is great, although last season was not particularly fun during the regular season because of the amount of time I spent watching thinking ""I don't care if we lose just PLEASE NOBODY GET INJURED oh for fuck's sake I hope that isn't serious"" - but less interesting, because... what's there to say? ""I hope this team continues to be what it already is!""  I've become more invested in other teams that have *potential* and how that plays out, because the Warriors aren't about potential. I'm not wondering whether players can make a ""leap"", I'm worried about whether something will impair them. It's fun as hell watching Looney and Jones improve, but my hopes and dreams for the team don't really rest on them.  The other part, though, is that it's nice to have home-grown stars. There's value in that. I respect Kevin Durant and I love his tenure on the Warriors, but on some level, to me, he'll always be a Sonic."
"Kevin Durant isn’t a long, switchable defender?  Kawhi grew up in the Spurs motion offense. It’s how he first played NBA basketball. He’s an able and willing passer.  I’m not sure you have any idea what you’re talking about, honestly. "
"Anything about Kevin Durant being a bitch or a snake or a snek.  WE FUCKING GOT IT THE FIRST THREE MILLION TIMES, YOU'RE SALTY"

"Balling has nothing to do with ego  See: Durant, Kevin"
So if JR said “Kevin Durant is playing like an mvp” then that would have been wrong because Kevin Love is on his team and is not quite playing like an mvp but....might at some point?   The Cavaliers gave their picks for who they thought was rookie of the year last year. I don’t recall anyone writing in Ante Zizic. 
"the top comment is golden, ha  ""Kevin Durant...Golden State Warriors. You never heard of them huh? You gonna lose to them in 7 games. 3 straight. But don't worry, you'll join them.....they're gonna hate you in OKC""﻿"
Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team and thought that there would be no reaction
"Steve Kerr:  ""He is the most impactful offensive player in terms of what he does to the defense -- maybe ever,"" Kerr said. ""There are guys, obviously, Michael Jordan impacted things. But the way Steph plays, [he] puts the fear of God into defenses like nobody I've ever seen.  ""Nobody's been able to shoot off the dribble from 35 feet in a normal setting. But he does that, which changes an entire game. So everything we do revolves around Steph. You can talk about where he stands in terms of the best players in the league. He's obviously one of the best. By that standard, he's the best.  ""If you want to just say who effects the game the most offensively, Steph's the best player in the NBA. But there's different ways of measuring that stuff. From a two-way standpoint, if you like the two-way guys, maybe it's Kawhi Leonard or KD [Kevin Durant] or LeBron because they're bigger and stronger and they can protect the rim, or whatever.  ""… All you have to do is just look on the impact [Curry] makes every time he's on the floor for us to know that everything we do, everything we run offensively, the other guys' ability to make plays, Shaun [Livingston], Andre [Iguodala], Draymond [Green], it all starts with Steph's gravity.""  ""IT ALL STARTS WITH STEPH'S GRAVITY""  ""IT ALL STARTS WITH STEPH'S GRAVITY""  ""IT ALL STARTS WITH STEPH'S GRAVITY""  ""IT ALL STARTS WITH STEPH'S GRAVITY""  ""IT ALL STARTS WITH STEPH'S GRAVITY""  ""IT ALL STARTS WITH STEPH'S GRAVITY""  ""IT ALL STARTS WITH STEPH'S GRAVITY""  &gt;&gt;*I know more than Steve Kerr does about basketball*  That's what you sound like right now.  You denying a thing doesn't mean it ceases to exist."
"&gt;Russ doesnt have the luxury of spacing steph has.  I mean, he had Kevin Durant on his team for years and it didn't change how he played one iota.  &gt;WB's drives are pretty much unguardable.  Which is odd given how many playoff games in which Westbrook has shot under 33%, don't you think?  If he's so unstoppable that should literally never happen as drives to the hoop should be high % buckets."
"Smh young kids so lazy these days. They want EVERYTHING given to them. Back in my days, stars like Kevin Durant would go JOIN already established super teams. Now these entitled kids want the super teams to come to them. What a joke. The league is soft "
MVP- Kevin Durant   DPOY- Draymond Green   ROY- Jacob Evans III   MIP- Quinn Cook  6MOY- Andre Iguodala  COTY- Steve Kerr 
"Dirk was so ahead of his time. His skillset perfectly mirrors the ideal nba power forward of today. An athletic 7 footer who can handle the ball, shoot the three, and work in the po...fuck I just described Kevin Durant. Fuck the warriors. "
"So Steph Curry, Pat McCaw, Kevin Durant, Omri Casspi and Zaza...I'mma have to go with the Cavs. "
I think it will be   Curry / Harden / Lebron /Durant / Cousins  - If Curry stays healthy the rest of the season I think he'll be a lock. He's more popular and better than Westbrook plus I feel like bad play (Westbrook at the beginning of the season) sticks out more than an injury.  - Harden is the front runner for MVP (at least he is in my opinion)  - Lebron (is Lebron James)  - Kevin Durant &gt; Giannis  - I'm hesitant at putting Embiid over Cousins because idk how many games he'll sit out over the course of the season
"Is Kyrie a serious MVP candidate though? A generational talent, along the lines of a Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Duncan or Lebron? Wouldn’t you say him being even top 10 is arguable? "
I'll never forget this one. I remember someone on Twitter making a crossover between that shot and a commercial of Kevin Durant waking up from his dream and I laugh my ass off every time I see it  Edit: [The original commercial](https://youtu.be/wNjQishYOy0) | [The edited one](https://youtu.be/9FAeKU8Jp7M)   
I hate that narrative plays such a big part of the conversation these days but there's 1 big reason steph shouldn't get consideration for the award - Kevin Durant. Either player can lead this team to a 50 win season if the other misses the majority/all of the games so naturally this should disqualify both from the MVP conversation. There's no way a team should have 2 players in the season mvp ladder. The mvp should go to the player whose team has the biggest drop off if they were taken away.  The warriors going from championship favorite to maybe losing in the conference finals doesn't scream mvp to me.  
"Barry McCockiner:  ""Nobody respects women &amp; the troops as much as I do. Marijuana is the deadliest drug ever. Tom Brady is a system QB. Kevin Durant is a giant bitch. ""  Hahah"
"I become the warriors GM, I immediately trade Kevin Durant to the Sixers for Amir Johnson and a conditional 2nd round pick. I then resign"
It’s fair to say curry is the most valuable player in the league when the offense built around his skill set led to a 73 win season... kevin Durant can do more things better than  Curry but Curry’s main skill is so much better that tilts his impact 
"Its amazing how the 2016 Free agency nuked 80% of the league's salary cap situation, and the Warriors just ended up with Kevin Durant. "
Oh give me a fucking break i swear to god if Kevin Durant wins MVP man I'm done
"He doesn't have to improve his playmaking to reach LeBron's level (imo). his defense makes up for that when comparing them. I think if he could improve his efficiency that would be enough to make him a comparable player to LeBron in terms of value, similar to Kevin Durant"
"The following year:  Giannis - ""My teammate, LeBron.""  Reporter - ""Who would you pick after LeBron?""  Giannis - ""I gotta go with Kevin Durant, second best player in the world, and so we can have a good relationship for the free agency""   The year after that:  Giannis - ""My teammates, LeBron and KD""  Reporter - ""Who would you pick after LeBron and KD?""  Giannis - ""I gotta go with Stephen Curry or Kawhi Leonard, two top-5 players in the world, and so we can have a good relationship for the free agency"""

"Kevin Durant is the best player on the warriors. Curry is the most impactful, but Durant is the more versatile scorer and a better defender. His size let's him do things that curry just can't"
"And I hate the perception that steph curry is the only player who attracts opposing teams defenses. You think defenders are cool with sagging off of Kevin Durant, another great shooter? Yes defenders chase Steph Curry all around the floor just like the do all great shooters in the league. You'de have to be retarded to give Kyle Korver an open shot too. i get that Steph Curry is even better and it's even more deadly if the defense doesn't but it's defender in the same exact manner. "
"I agree with everything you said and didn't mean to imply that Steph's not doing much relative to an average NBA player when his shot's off. He's incredibly impactful even if he shoots 0-10 from 3. But the guy we're comparing him too is also one of the best NBA players of all time, so it's a very high standard. A player can be really really really impactful outside of their shooting and still not be as impactful as Kevin Durant. "
"Respectfully I don't think that makes any sense. Kevin Durant going to the Warriors clearly raised their ceiling, unless I'm missing something."

I heard this on a podcast somewhere but it’s a good description Kevin Durant raises the floor of the warriors and curry raises the ceiling of how good the warriors can be
Kevin Durant winning MVP would be retarded.  He's not even the best player on his team.
"This is truly hilarious. As of right now, 26 people have agreed that the best players on the warriors and second best player in the league for the past 5 years would be the best player to drop from this team.   Klay and Green are incredibly important in what they do for the warriors and a key reason why they are the best team we've ever seen but the idea that either of them are more important than Kevin Durant is basketball retardation at it's finest. "

"Exactly, that girl Tina Thompson was spitting facts. If Kevin Durant had beaten that 73-9 Golden State team and face LeBron in the Finals and beat him finally, THEN HE HAD A VERY VERY SERIOUS CASE for being the new best in the world.   But Durant choked and lost to that 73-9 Warriors team. LeBron beat that 73-9 Warriors team. Durant then joined that Warriors team, the best team in the league. Then he beat LeBron in a Finals series, even there LeBron averaged 33-12-10.     HOW THE FUCK ANYONE HAS THE BALLS TO EVEN SAY  OR THINK DURANT IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD? The sheer arrogance and lack of shame. Disgusting. Yes Durant has a ring, but that ring has ZERO value. Fuck outa here, he now has the best team in the league, but has zero chance at ever being considered better than LeBron.    Snake ass"
Kevin Durant
"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry could easily be seeking $500M deals but because of the NBA's salary cap system, they're restricted to a set amount. I mean, I get it why there's a salary cap but if they were playing baseball, they'd be making insane amounts of money across 6, 7, 8 years. Amounts of which we likely will never see in the NBA."
can you imagine if this team had kevin durant?
Is it just me or does the Kevin Durant Basketball Facility for Men sound like a place for dudes to fuck each other? 
"I think Kevin Durant joining the Warriors was the smartest decision he could have made for his career and it would have been stupid for him to not go there.  Another unpopular opinion I have is that I don't think Shaq is a top ten all-time player. While I understand how dominate he was, I think Shaq could have accomplished even more with his career than he did.  "

Kevin Durant joining the warriors is like when the power rangers gained the green ranger (Steph is definitely the pink ranger) 
"There are some NBA greats who are 0-0 in the finals(Nash, Webber, Wilkins), why does it matter that he can't win them all specially when he lost to historic teams. People called the 2014 Spurs team one of the best offenses ever, then the 2015 Warriors were called again one of the best ever, he didn't lose to the 73-9 team because guess what he did, he then lost to the 73-9 team that added Kevin Durant and gave up Barnes and Bogut. If we're going by rings then Bill Russell went 11-12 and we know he isn't the GOAT (as of today since he was considered the one before Jordan)."
I think he just called KG Kevin Durant

"Kevin Durant is likely getting taxed at an ungodly tax rate.  It looks like the CA's marginal tax rate is 12.3% and the federal marginal tax rate for KD is ~35%, so the money KD is donating would have been taxed at somewhere between 42% and 47%.  So even though its only a deduction (not a credit), it is a much more significant reduction in taxes than it would be for most people. In this case, his $3mil donation would also come with a decrease in taxes somewhere in the range of $1.25m-$1.5m.  He was effectively able to give Texas $3m at a cost to him of only $1.5m-$1.75m."
"Thanks Professor! The point is if you're about the cause and not the adulation you do that shit anonymously. If you're doing it for the adulation, then I'll be the guy who gladly points out that while it's very nice that you're doing that, all you're doing is choosing where your tax money goes and 3 million is a lot of money if you only have 4 million total. But if annually you make 25+? Cool, you donated a lot of money but what do you need 25 million a year for? More boats? More houses? More cars? You should be donating that money to help those less fortunate. Most likely though, he's trying to get The Kevin Durant Science Building or The Kevin Durant Practice Facility. He wants his name on some buildings. You want my praise? Give 3 million dollars to Rainbow Babies, or to establish a homeless center or something other than just a vanity cause. "

However, had he donated that $3M to a lesser school w/ limited assets to invest in their basketball program, or a school without a program at all, it would have a substantially greater impact. "

"The real reason KD joined the Warriors is because he and Steph were secretly gay together. Kevin Durant had just been in the midst of an awkward, experimental phase with Russ, but things ended badly after Kevin told Russ that he wanted more. All KD wanted was to be exclusive with his then FWB, but Russ told him that while he may mess around with other men from time to time for fun he only dates women. Russ told Kevin that it was over between them, and that from there on out their relationship would be strictly professional. Kevin was emotionally lost, but at the same time he knew what he really wanted for the first time in his life. He just didn't know how to get it. The 2015 season started, and Kevin was just going through the motions. Things had gotten a little weird between he and Russ, and he began to feel isolated among his own teammates. Kevin began to fall into a deep depression, but he continued to play so well on the court that nobody seemed to notice that something was wrong. Kevin was all alone on this, and he was afraid even to turn to him mom. This was the first time in his life that Kevin hadn't been able to confide in his mother, and he didn't know what to do. He spent many nights curled up in bed just crying, and nobody knew what he was going through. It was during this dark time that Kevin met Steph. They had bumped into each other before, but this was when Kevin really got to know Steph. The two of them met out at a night club in San Francisco a couple of days before the Thunder were set to play the Warriors. Seeing Kevin looking very awkward and lost in the crowded night club, Steph called out him name, and motioned for him to come join him in his VIP booth. This was the first time the two were actually hanging out, and they seemed to click on just about every level. They talked about basketball, they talked about the world, they talked politics, science, and religion... and they talked about their love lives. Kevin admitted for the first time to Steph that he had been struggling with depression after being used in his last relationship. He told Steph that he couldn't trust anybody anymore, and that he was broken. Steph told him that he too had been having his fair share of relationship issues. He said that he had married Ayesha as a lie to himself, and that he had really loved somebody else, who he could never be with, in the past. One thing lead to another, and the night ended in a steamy trip back to Kevin's hotel room. He was hooked. As the season went on, Steph and Kevin continued to see each other whenever they got the chance, however throughout the rigors of the NBA season that opportunity didn't arise too often. Not being able to see each other often began to put a strain on their relationship. Steph began to get jealous of Kevin always being around Russ, and he told Kevin how he felt. Terrified of losing his love, Kevin promised him that he would leave the Thunder next year, and that his feelings for Russ were long-dead. Once the season ended, Kevin still wasn't sure which team he was going to join. That was when Steph told him he loved him for the first time, and that he wanted to be together everyday. Steph, however, was bound by his contract, so the two of them couldn't just go start over together on a new team. Not only that, Steph was still keeping up appearances with Ayesha. For those reasons, Kevin decided to go to the Golden State Warriors. Also, San Francisco is home to some of the best gay swingers bars there are."
"Now thanks to the Ringer, the West is about to find an answer for the Warriors at center.  &gt;Green may not even be their best small-ball 5 anymore. Kevin Durant has all of Green’s strengths on defense without his weaknesses on offense. Defensive strategies that traditional centers use against Green would be suicidal against Durant. They can’t give him an open lane to the basket after he sets a screen, or leave him alone on the 3-point line. Playing Durant at the 5 put a different twist on the Lineup of Death, because the Warriors can spread the floor even farther by taking Green out and putting a better 3-point shooter in his place, either Nick Young or Omri Casspi.  I get this, but you cannot use KD for long minutes at the 5. Draymond is a much more physical defender despite his lack of length and can do it for long periods of time. KD cannot do both offense and playing the 5 defensively for extended periods due to the strain of the 5 spot."
"The trash we beat in the east had been frequently beating us since the all star break. So obviously we turned something on to beat them.  And if by real team you mean the winningest team of all time + Kevin Durant then I guess there's only one real team in the nba because that isn't just any team. They're not just a ""real team"".  And we put up an alright fight. A much better fight than any of the teams in the West, who are apparently much better than us (or that's what you're implying).  So I guess what I'm saying is no, that's not what happened. "
Kevin Durant is that you?!? 
"No.   Team is structured around him. Plus, you already have Kevin Durant. The fan base is thoroughly enamored with Curry. He doesn't just represent team or organizational success, but also big bucks. There isn't a single part of that decision that isn't a bad idea, and this is one of the only instances in which you could ever conceivably say that about a trade for Lebron, but here we are. "
Kevin Durant looks so relieved that not all the pressure is on him. Look at him just admiring stephs greatness.
that's even what you said though lmao. you made this highlight video about KD's move to the warriors and how that ruined basketball.   and you've insulted me and made it personal with me waaay more than i did with you man. so maybe you should heed your own advice a little bit. all i said is take in one god damn CURRY highlight video without making it kevin god damn durant for once. you started throwing out the insults. 
that means he'll project to be a Kevin Durant-level player
oh shit tferg youngest person to score 20 in our franchise besides kevin durant. we're gonna be champions
"You're right dude Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green would turn to shit players if Steve Kerr wasn't there. He made them great. Certainly couldn't have been that Steve happened to walk into the right job at the right time.  I mean, just hypothetically, if Steve Kerr were to leave the team during the playoffs and Finals I bet they wouldn't win a single game without him coaching right? Oh wait..."
Yeah you're right Steve Kerr made Steph Curry have the most dominant shooting season of all time and he also made Kevin Durant one of the top three players in the league. How could I be so naive.
How so? It’s not like Masai handed Carey a Kevin Durant or some top3 pick. Most of our guys developed under Casey and it’s him maximizing whatever talent skill players like Van Vleet has.

"This season I'd say LeBron, Harden, Curry, and Giannis.  Kevin Durant and Kyrie are both about at DeRozan's level this season.    KD is obviously capable of more, but is having a bit of a down season and the hype about his defense seems unsupported by the numbers.    Horford also having a great season, despite unspectacular numbers, so he gets honorable mention.  Damian Lillard just below.   "

"&gt; Roberson is also a better defender than Tony was in my opinion.  This is one of those moments people say ""nephew"" I believe.  He put work in against Kevin Durant, one of the best scorers to play the game. He also got shout outs from Kobe Bryant as the toughest defender he's ever faced.   Tony Allen also has been on 6 all-defensive teams (3 1st teams). Roberson has been on one 2nd team.  Roberson is very, very good defensively, but Tony Allen was seriously feared by perimeter players and teams would gameplan in anticipation of his defense knowing he was going to be a major problem with his rugged playstyle."
Kevin Durant to the Hornets
"Curry  is not even the best player on his own team, that's Kevin Durant, who Curry and all the other GSW players went to crying after LeBron fucked and  ruined their glorious 73-9 season. The same Durant who won Finals MVP just last year as well.       I don't know what i'm more disappointed about, that Celtics flair, or that username, or just the fact that r/nba is getting filled up by underage dumb kids like yourself more and more every day.    It's so pathetic, if you want to make a shit post, atleast try to be funny. And mods should do a better job about this *[SERIOUS]* tag. What's the point of using that tag if you let these kids post horseshit anyways?     And u/Patriots0117 , you really got to delete your account kid.

"He’s made it clear multiple times that winning is a priority this year. While you may be right about many NBA players of average talent, stars with the ability to play anywhere only relocate to win.   I’m not saying he won’t leave. I’m expecting it to be honest, especially with the likelihood of Melo choosing to opt in due to a lack of offers after this subpar year. OKC just doesn’t have the money.   Kevin Durant had the right to leave. People think OKC fans are this salty because he simply just left when it actually has nothing to do with that. It was just shitty of him to intentionally sabotage the franchise that drafted and groomed him, all while going to the team that they were just up 3-1 against. He waited to announce his decision until after every other relevant free agent signed. He’s continued to dig his hole by stirring up drama and getting caught in his own lies. He knew what he was doing, and he just had no idea that he would receive so much backlash. If he really was unhappy, he could’ve done what PG and Kyrie did and warned the front office in advance.   I’ve ignored Lavar from the start, but that doesn’t prevent him from constantly popping up on my timeline. Say what you will about him, but as long as people keep making him relevant, players will think twice about relocating to LA. Not saying absolutely no one would go there, but it would definitely be grouped on the list of cons. "
"You're under the assumption that George wants to move just to win. Don't be naive. Winning isn't the number one priority to A LOT of NBA players. We grow up getting it drilled into our brains that that's all these guys care about and it just isn't remotely true at all.   Paul has said multiple times and had his agent tell teams that he wants to be a Laker. His reasons are his own.  Thirdly, am I the only one that finds it hilarious that people are chiding Paul on how he should pick where he has the best shot to win, but these are the same dudes that shit on Kevin Durant for doing that exact thing.  The Lakers don't have a Lavar Ball problem at all. He's a marketing genius that says dumb shit to get sensitive people riled up so he can get PR. If you guys were smart enough to ignore him he wouldn't exist."
"Jimmy Butler, Paul George, DeMar DeRozan, Jordan Clarkson, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Harrison Barnes, Mason Plumlee, Kenneth Faired, Tobias Harris, Omri Casspi, Shaun Livingston, James Johnson, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Noah Vonleh, Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gay, Kyle Anderson, etc. a lot of players have gotten better in the post after they’ve reached the NBA. Maybe not elite, but better."
"If we're talking about year by year, than the Warriors have an amazing case for GOAT team, 73-9 team adds Kevin Durant and dominates the regular and post season.   But if we're talking about era, than obviously the Warriors need to stack up some more accolades , but they're off to a pretty great start with 3 consecutive 67 win seasons and 2 championships"
"That's because Klay Thompson, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant are starters on the Warriors"
lol yeah this is kind of hilarious. He's a great player but people are pretending he's some kind of psychological monster that reduces people to tears.   There's loads of articles and stories about him putting up an act.    https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/report-udonis-haslem-called-kevin-garnett-a-fake-tough-guy-071415   https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/1/14/7539949/kevin-garnett-fight-sad-bully   https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2015/01/13/the-dwight-howard-headbutt-and-five-other-times-kevin-garnett-was-a-fake-tough-guy   Half of these comments are some weird fantasy that Durant and Draymond would run to the locker room crying the moment KG headbutts the stanchion
The Warriors started making moves to get Kevin Durant right after Kyrie made that shot so yeah it's ok. You can't just stop trying to get better just because you won a game.
Man I would never #NBAvote for Kevin Durant dudes a fucking Pusssy ass snake 
"Squad also includes Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan, Trevor Ariza, Dwyane Wade, Avery Bradley, Rajon Rondo, JJ Redick  You reckon they'd make the Playoffs?"
"I would think  if the Cavs are making a trade its for a defensive stopper.  Someone like a Paul George type that can Kevin Durant so LeBron doesn't have to.  Micro tickets adds hardly any defense and more or less does what Love does (to a lesser degree) and Channing Frye (to a higher degree).  Lopez for Thompson swap is adding a slightly better offensive player but I see them as the same type of player.  The Cavs offense looks set.  On any given night when healthy Wade, Love, or Isaiah can drop 30 to go with LeBron 25+.  Then they have Korver, Crowder or Green capable of 20 off the bench.  I would say Thompson is the perfect fit as he requires no touches and is only in there for rebounds.       Back to your original offer.  I don't see it as a smart play for the Cavs.  Getting rid of that awful Thompson contract is a positive but I still believe they are in win now mode trying to convince LeBron to stay.  "
Never understood why spurs fans hate on LeBron. Maybe worry about Kevin Durant cause he's the one who's been dad dicking you guys.
Its probably just Kevin Durant messing around.
Yeah and that teammate was usually Kevin fucking Durant lol  Cavs defense is quality
"This is the team thats supposed to stand a chance vs Golden State? LOL, league is so easy for Gsw. Kevin Durant ruined NBA."
"well, Jordan, Wilt, and a few others did it in even fewer games, which makes KD 9th fastest that way...you really just made KD less impressive using your own method  http://www.nba.com/article/2018/01/10/golden-state-warriors-kevin-durant-passes-20000-career-points#/"
"I started the post by stating that I put Kevin Durant ahead of Dominique Wilkins, the first reply immediately criticizes the post for saying something that I didn't say in the post. Then, the reply clarifying that remark which was casually exaggerated for effect and upvotes was used to get me into a debate which I *did not want to get into* from the onset, because it's *all subjective.*  I've gotten pretty tired of explaining these things, this particular situation happens over and over and over again on this website. So it's not really my responsibility to mind what you or this recurring feed of LaVar Ball quotes finds rude."
"I'm probably one of the biggest Wiggins believers on this sub but this isn't a fair comparison. Harden was in his second year, came off the bench, played only 26 minutes a game, and had to share the ball with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook."
I doubt Kevin Durant is worried about his sex life lol

"The thing is that Booker also has a size advantage over both Steph and Lillard. That's why those two aren't a great comparison. Booker will be able to play differently because he can post up or shoot ever smaller guys.   When I look at the next generation of talent, I'm looking guys like Jokic, Simmons, Embiid, Towns, Porzingis, Giannis, and Booker. Booker is the only guard doing these things at that age. The only one. Can you just imagine how far ahead of other guards he'll be when he's 25? Just look at the way he's developed in only 2 years. Steph Curry was scoring 18 a game at 22. Damian Lillard went to college for 4 years and when he got into the league at age 22, he scored 20 a game. Harden, Westbrook, DeRozan, none scored as much at such a young age. You know who did? LeBron. Kevin Durant. Kobe. Melo.  Booker is a one and done phenom who is lighting it up at a very young age. Dame is undersized and went to college for 4 years at a small school. Booker deserves comparisons to Harden and Kobe, not Lillard.     edit: and obviously I could be wrong. I just think Bookers resume is way closer to a Kobe than a Dame. "
"&gt;If LeBron is team east captain  I mean when was the last time LeBron wasn't the East captain? He always gets more votes than any other player in the league among both conferences, nothing new.   And since it won't be televised, he can pick anyone, doesn't have to pick his own teammates at first. He could pick Durant, or Giannis since dude mentioned he would pick LeBron if he was captain, so that's that. LeBron can always pick Kevin Love or Wade or IT whoever with last few picks, nobody would know who got picked when anyways, so it doesn't matter"

"He is shooting a better percentage from 3, than Kevin Durant in his rookie year."
"It's the media's fault, not the players. Imagine the amount of questions Kevin Durant would have to answer if he didn't choose Steph Curry. "
"Kevin Durant is my answer, most people won't even realise the dude lost a step due to foot surgery because his fundamentals are that damn good, He can shoot over anyone, from anywhere. Yeah I think his game will age gracefully"
Here's a better small-ball lineup:  PG - Reggie Jackson  SG - Victor Oladipo   SF - James Harden  PF - Kevin Durant  C - Serge Ibaka
Kevin Durant comes back. Warrior lose.  Hhmmmmmm........ ^^^^^/s
"Yes but that doesn’t mean they’d do it again. The west is so strong this year, w/o KD and with steph consistently being hurt they don’t win. If you take mvp Russell Westbrook with Kevin Durant the warriors lose. And they never beat a healthy cavs team so add pg13 to them Cleveland wins in 5 MAYBE 6. "
"I do.   To make sure we're on the same page:   - A better scorer is one that is efficient in putting up points. A lot of the times it's the center or a pf. As many are from put backs or offensive rebounds, etc.  - A better shooter is one that is able to score from more places on the court and at a high enough efficiency for it to not be a negative and be worth it.   &amp;nbsp;  I feel the argument you have is dependent on the 3pt line. KD shoots more and better than MJ from the 3pt line. Is that correct?    The other dependency that I feel you have is to categorize layups as easier than 3pt shots (why we have eFG). &amp;nbsp;  With these 2 items, you conclude Kevin is a better shooter than MJ.   &amp;nbsp;  Unfortunately, your claim of MJ's shots being nearly half the time layups, is a guess. From what I understand, the distance at the FG A/M is not available until 2001 season. That season MJ was old and was playing for the Wizards.   &amp;nbsp;  What we DO know, MJ was the single biggest threat to any team. Every coach and players kept trying to figure out how to stop Jordan. This has included being physical with him, hard fouls, double teams, and/or shutting down everyone else so MJ had to be on the floor to keep his team from defeated or blown out (tire him out).   &amp;nbsp;  With that understanding, I can't just use the stat of 3pt line and ""lay-ups"" as the reason that Jordan was not a better shooter than Kevin Durant. Those ""lay-ups"" are some of the most difficult shots that we have EVER seen a player do. We have seen Jordan go through some extraordinary and legendary shot blockers. We have seen Jordan create some of the most iconic and dazzling shots in the history of basketball.   &amp;nbsp;  Just on the point of how creative Michael Jordan was in scoring the ball, is enough for me to stand by my opinion that Michael Jordan was a better shooter than Kevin Durant.   &amp;nbsp;  Edit: And why FG% matters is that if I CAN score from more places on the court, but if I'm inefficient at doing so, then that holds little value. "
"Durant had the highest minutes of any warrior tonight.  When everyone is standing around watching the Kevin Durant show, their team play suffers - e.g. Zaza being the only other warrior to score double digits and lackadaisical team defense allowing someone to drop 50 on them."

I fully agree with this great fan. Kevin Durant is an unstoppable beast and has surpassed Lebron in every form. Kevin Durant should be the MVP this season.. 
I don't know about that. MJ averaged 31pt per game with the Bulls and has a better career FG%  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Michael+Jordan&amp;player_id1_select=Michael+Jordan&amp;player_id1=jordami01&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players
Kevin Durant has overtaken Lebron as a better scorer in the NBA.  Lebron **is** the better **overall** player.
"Easily. Only blind Bron stans disagree. KD can do it all, is the best on defense and a better scorer as he can shoot from anywhere and can get to the hoop with ease as Paul Pierce just said live on TV Kevin Durant is the best scorer in NBA history. Also much more clutch and plays with poise and confidence.  LeBron passes a bit better but KD can pass too.   No chance LeBron is still the best. "
"Kevin Durant is a very good basketball player; if LBJ ever pumps one into Kevy, that baby of theirs is going to be pure magic on the court."
"""Hi 18 year old me, in ten years Kevin Durant will score his 20000th point for us after winning finals MVP, the second chip in three years.""  "

"On one hand, I wanna contest that the Spurs are doing very well this year with a limited roster. On the other, Davis Bertans is the white Kevin Durant, Brandon Paul is a 2nd Kawhi and Bryn Forbes is a slightly smaller Steph Curry. "
"Kevin Durant?  Edit: Actually I don't know if he applies, he might be known a Warrior when it's all set and done."
"Telling it like it is, tbh. Although, I don't think he's terrible he's just not Klay Thompson, Steph curry or Kevin Durant when they shoot the ball so he stands out just like Draymond shooting stands out."
"&gt;The pressure of the situation, the footwork, degree of difficulty while being contested, his opponent, just so many factors that make it great.   Except the fact that it's Kevin Durant, and i have been watching him take that exact shot and making it for almost a decade now. Pull up 3 in transition, using that 7'6 wingspan, so nobody can really contest him, he's been doing that his whole fucking career.   It's funny how people overrate and overhype that particular shot,  only because  LeBron contested him lol if it was literally anyone else, nobody would have given a shit, because Durant made that same exact contested transition pull up 3 countless fucking times in his career. It's nothing new"

This article is pretty much a transcript of [this podcast/interview] (https://soundcloud.com/warriors-all82/kevin-durant-sitdown-interview-20000-points) if you'd rather listen.
"His history with ankle injuries is actually quite extensive:  ---  **Dec. 8, 2010**: In his second season in the NBA, Curry suffers his first sprained right ankle against the Spurs.  **2010-11**: Curry tweaks his right ankle five times during the season.  **May 25, 2011**: Curry undergoes offseason surgery on his right ankle to repair instability that existed in the ankle due to recurrent ankle sprains.  **Jan. 4, 2012**: Curry sprains his right ankle for the first time since his surgery, against the Houston Rockets, and misses two weeks.  **March 11, 2012**: Curry sprains his ankle against the Clippers while stepping on Blake Griffin's foot and misses the final 28 games of the season.  **April 25, 2012**: Curry undergoes his second surgery on his right ankle. The exploratory procedure revealed a stable ankle with no structural damage and consisted of cleaning out loose debris and scar tissue.  **March 23, 2013**: After tweaking his ankle twice earlier in the season, Curry suffers a season-ending sprained right ankle against the Washington Wizards.  **April 16, 2016**: After three years without ankle injuries, Curry sprains his right ankle in Game 1 of the first round of the 2016 playoffs against the Rockets. He misses Games 2 and 3.  **Feb. 27, 2016**: Curry sprains his left ankle against future teammate Kevin Durant and the Oklahoma City Thunder.  **Dec. 4, 2017**: Curry sprains his right ankle against the New Orleans Pelicans."

"-Ty Lue is a pretty good coach. I don't watch enough Thunder games but I imagine Donovan is fine too  -Kevin Durant should not be in DPOY conversation  -I still consider Harden a PG, they just play with 2 PGs now"
1. LeBron  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. Steven Adams  5. Russell Westbrook
"Kevin Durant is an all around better talent , but Steph Curry broke basketball. The warriors do stuff that people thought was never possible because they allow curry to be curry. We've seen great scorers , and iso players like Durant (even though he is waaaaay up there) i don't think we've ever seen something like Stpeh both from an ability standpoint and from a leadership standpoint. "
They went 73-9 then added Kevin Durant. I think that's all that needs to be said 
"The situations are not comparable. Lebrons choice was shocking, not because of where he went, but on how the choice was delivered.  KD had the 73-9 dubs down in the WCF 3-1 and choked the series away. He then joined the team he lost to.   He went to a 73-9 roster who already won a ring without his amazing abilities, and were likely going to win more.   KD walked and it ruined all parity in the league. Now we have 5 years of 2 teams going at it. Literally we are about to have the same finals matchup for 4 years in a row, where back to back matchups in the finals had never happened before. Lebrons heat lost to dirk and the mavs as well as the spurs. I guarantee there is no upset coming for the dubs   Lebron went to a roster that didn’t make a difference in the playoffs the year before and he teamed up with 2 other players. The roster was gutted and had to be filled with low level players or players willing to take a major discount.  They simply are not even close. Kevin Durant performed the biggest bitch move in nba history, and he deserves to be remembered as such.   You are right, people forget. This sub is a shining example. The opinion changes here if the wind changes direction, this speaks to the validity of their opinion. People who love this game will remember and that asterisk will always remain. "
"He has showed he has the skill as a player to lead a team. He has the skills to be an all time great player. But he will always have an asterisk next to his rings.   I really lost all respect for Kevin Durant. He could of been truly special, instead he hopped on the warriors bandwagon worse then the people on here.   Greatness is not just the skills of basketball, but the integrity and ability to overcome obstacles. Kevin Durant has done neither. "
"So, to summarize this thread.   Kevin Durant: [normal thing to say]  /r/nba: Fuck you!"

"But your ignoring two important ones: Michael JEFFREY Jordan and Kevin ""Kevin Durant"" Durant. Seems like the top 2 players all time were #2 picks. One is the GOAT and the other is Michael Jordan "
Kavon Looney team is pretty stacked   2017 Steph Curry  2017 Klay Thompson  2017 Andre Iguadala  2017 Kevin Durant   2017 Draymond Green  
"&gt;riding on the coattails of our developing assets and Maasai’s godly GM’ing  Chill dude. Masai has been good but don’t pretend like Casey has been handed a Kevin Durant or a Lebron James by Masai. In fact, every one of our main players developed into what they are today under Casey. DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry, and of course the rookies, none of whom were any Ben Simmons or KATs. Fuck he turned 2nd round picks like Powell and undrafted no-names VanVleet into productive role-players.   Not taking anything away from Masai, but this narrative (pushed mostly by JV fanatics) is an extremely unfair one to Casey.   "
Kevin Durant  PG - 2015 Russell Westbrook  SG - 2017 Steph Curry  SF - 2016 Klay Thompson  PF - 2013 KD (MVP year)  C - 2017 Draymond Green  I used the seasons with the highest PERs. It's basically the Warriors + Russ lol
the league was better with skyfucker chucking 35 feet threes off the dribble without also having kevin durant on his team
"**Michael Jordan** - Possibly the greatest scorer ever  **Kevin Durant** - Most efficient and versatile scorer (Occupies 5 spots out of the 25 most efficient volume scoring seasons, 8 out of the top 50)  **Adrian Dantley** - Insane efficiency in a rough era , (Averaged 29.6 over a span of 450+ games on 63.3 TS, Has 7 seasons among 50 most efficient volume scoring seasons)  **KAJ** - One of the greatest Post Scorers ever, extremely reliable and durable  **Kobe** - Arguably the most explosive scorer ever, Not crazy efficient but always well above league average  List is in no particular order and I assumed Volume scoring to be 25ppg.  HM : LeBron, Wilt, Barkley, Bird, Curry"
David West:  PG: '17 Steph Curry / '09 Chris Paul  SG: '17 Klay Thompson / '16 Danny Green  SF: '16 Kawhi Leonard / '13 Paul George  PF: '17 Kevin Durant / '16 Aldridge / '09 David West  C: '17 Draymond Green / '12 Hibbert / '16 Duncan / '08 Tyson Chandler  Mostly just a virtue of him playing on two of the greatest teams of all time with the '16 Spurs and '17 Warriors. Toss in prime Paul George and Chris Paul to run the second team and you've got an unreal team. It's got three DPOY quality traditional Centers to square off against these '90s teams or Draymond.   
unfortunately for all of us Kevin Durant turned into a massive bitch.  Would have been cool to see him still on the Thunder and not making the Warriors hilariously overpowered.
What about Kevin Durant? Pg 2018 curry SG 2018 klay Sf 2018 Durant Pf 2017 zaza C 2018 draymond

You do know that Kevin Durant is George Gervin on crack right?
Jordan Bell's is pretty good. Imagine this:  * PG Stephen Curry (2017) * SG Klay Thompson (2017) * SF Kevin Durant (2017) * PF Draymond Green (2017) * C Zaza Pachulia (2017)
"Of course they would do it. What team wouldn’t want the best player in the league on their roster? Plus a Lebron/Curry PnR would be so nasty.   Everyone knows Lebron is at his best surrounded by 3 point shooters. Now imagine him surrounded by the greatest shooter of all time, another top 5 shooter all time in Klay Thompson, and then Kevin MF’ing Durant. "
"Since joining the Warriors Kevin Durant has 1 ring, before joining Warriors he had 0 rings. "
"Yeah just saying any controversial or fringe opinion on this sub should change OP's mind:  * The Thunder are performing poorly for a team with 3 stars  * Kevin Durant did nothing wrong  * James Harden only puts up big numbers because he can draw fouls better than anyone else  * Victor Oladipo is DeMar DeRozan with a better 3pt shot and defense  * Jimmy Butler is better than PG13  Pick your poison, OP"

[Post-Game Thread] Kevin Durant leads the Cleveland Cavaliers to a game 7 victory over Lonzo Ball and the Bakersfield Lakers to clinch the 2023 NBA Finals
Kevin Durant (Twitter banned) is probable for his remaining career
"&gt;lol if Harden was the best iso scorer in the league, he wouldn't have brutally choked against the Warriors in 2015 or against the Spurs last year. And Durant balled out the last game against the Warriors.  Durant choking is why he had to join a championship team to win a championship. This is a joke. He's literally the face of choking in big games in the NBA.  &gt;Are you kidding? You would rather have Reggie Jackson who had a 52.7 TS% that year and Serge Ibaka than Clint Capela, Aaron Gordon, and Patrick Beverly? You have to be trolling.  Those guys are nothing, they only get wide open shots off of harden's ability to create shots. Durant can't create anything for his teammates thats why they have low shooting percentages. He cannot make plays for teammates to save his life.  &gt;LeBron James in the playoffs: 28.4 PPG, 57.4 TS% Kevin Durant in the playoffs: 28.8 PPG, 58.8% TS  In elimination games/games facing elimination Durant's counting numbers and efficiency numbers go waay down compared to Lebrun's which goes back to my point about Durant consistently coming up short when it matters the most. That is until he gets on a 72 win championship contender team."
"Yeah, Ekpe is a great defender. He's not kidding when he says he believes he's one of the best defenders in the world. Just doesn't offer much on offense. He's tied for 3rd in blocks per 36 minutes at 2.7 (tied with Gobert and Jordan Bell).  |||||||Crit||Tota|||||||||||||||||||Shoo|||||| |-:|:-|:-|-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|Season|Age|Tm|Lg|MP|BLK|G|GS|FG|FGA|2P|2PA|3P|3PA|FT|FTA|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PF|PTS|FG%|2P%|3P%|eFG%|FT%|TS%| |1|Myles Turner|2017-18|21|IND|NBA|964|2.8|33|32|173|353|145|269|28|84|85|114|39|176|215|52|16|74|55|90|459|.490|.539|.333|.530|.746|.569| |2|David West|2017-18|37|GSW|NBA|510|2.8|39|0|122|191|119|184|3|7|27|39|37|98|135|70|26|40|37|66|274|.639|.647|.429|.647|.692|.658| |3|Jordan Bell|2017-18|23|GSW|NBA|518|2.7|35|9|82|125|82|122|0|3|18|28|45|98|143|66|26|39|35|68|182|.656|.672|.000|.656|.643|.663| |4|Rudy Gobert|2017-18|25|UTA|NBA|539|2.7|18|18|76|127|76|127|0|0|56|82|47|125|172|21|10|41|35|41|208|.598|.598||.598|.683|.638| |5|Ekpe Udoh|2017-18|30|UTA|NBA|586|2.7|37|2|38|78|38|78|0|0|28|37|44|52|96|42|26|44|13|79|104|.487|.487||.487|.757|.552| |6|Bismack Biyombo|2017-18|25|ORL|NBA|690|2.6|40|6|72|145|72|144|0|1|46|73|68|148|216|15|6|49|40|78|190|.497|.500|.000|.497|.630|.536| |7|Clint Capela|2017-18|23|HOU|NBA|887|2.5|34|34|209|311|209|310|0|1|66|112|110|268|378|40|22|61|56|97|484|.672|.674|.000|.672|.589|.672| |8|Kevin Durant|2017-18|29|GSW|NBA|1146|2.4|33|33|307|613|227|408|80|205|160|179|20|215|235|174|25|75|107|74|854|.501|.556|.390|.566|.894|.617| |9|Brook Lopez|2017-18|29|LAL|NBA|683|2.4|31|30|146|332|106|202|40|130|55|73|39|90|129|54|17|46|51|88|387|.440|.525|.308|.500|.753|.531| |10|Kristaps Porzingis|2017-18|22|NYK|NBA|1111|2.4|34|34|286|658|227|499|59|159|176|209|46|184|230|42|19|75|73|98|807|.435|.455|.371|.479|.842|.538| |11|Joel Embiid|2017-18|23|PHI|NBA|906|2.3|29|29|237|485|211|398|26|87|189|236|63|252|315|98|17|58|118|103|689|.489|.530|.299|.515|.801|.585| |12|Jakob Poeltl|2017-18|22|TOR|NBA|655|2.3|38|0|117|176|116|174|1|2|26|51|76|95|171|18|15|41|29|98|261|.665|.667|.500|.668|.510|.658| |13|Kyle OQuinn|2017-18|27|NYK|NBA|671|2.2|40|3|113|193|113|188|0|5|49|65|60|178|238|81|19|41|54|113|275|.585|.601|.000|.585|.754|.620| |14|Hassan Whiteside|2017-18|28|MIA|NBA|535|2.2|21|21|122|220|120|218|2|2|47|67|63|178|241|13|18|32|29|41|293|.555|.550|1.000|.559|.701|.587| |15|Jarrett Allen|2017-18|19|BRK|NBA|524|2.1|31|0|75|142|73|136|2|6|35|46|53|81|134|12|15|30|25|60|187|.528|.537|.333|.535|.761|.576| |16|Anthony Davis|2017-18|24|NOP|NBA|1197|2.1|34|34|319|569|295|504|24|65|214|262|80|271|351|80|37|70|67|62|876|.561|.585|.369|.582|.817|.640| |17|John Henson|2017-18|27|MIL|NBA|923|2.1|38|31|141|232|141|229|0|3|45|85|68|180|248|50|18|55|47|107|327|.608|.616|.000|.608|.529|.607| |18|Serge Ibaka|2017-18|28|TOR|NBA|971|2.0|34|34|188|379|136|237|52|142|44|58|35|177|212|24|15|55|42|102|472|.496|.574|.366|.565|.759|.583| |19|Mason Plumlee|2017-18|27|DEN|NBA|811|2.0|40|18|118|208|118|207|0|1|45|110|71|164|235|78|25|46|65|86|281|.567|.570|.000|.567|.409|.548| |20|Daniel Theis|2017-18|25|BOS|NBA|543|1.9|41|2|73|143|65|110|8|33|40|51|52|120|172|23|18|29|42|96|194|.510|.591|.242|.538|.784|.586|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;year_min=2018&amp;year_max=2018&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=mp&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=500&amp;c2stat=blk_per_mp&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=1.9&amp;c5val=0&amp;order_by=blk_per_mp&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#stats) Generated 1/9/2018."
"Except those guys also had Kobe/Shaq, Duncan/Kawhi and Curry/Green/Thompson. You guys have poor man's Jason Kidd and the peasant's Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant
"It's because the Warriors are a match-up nightmare for Kevin Love. Even Klay Thompson can effectively cover him when he needs to, nevermind Draymond Green and Kevin Durant."
"Stephen A. predicted the Warriors will win in 2017, and dating back to 2011, he has been wrong for 6 consecutive years until last year. This curse would have a good chance of happening if the Warriors didn't have Kevin Freaking Durant. He's the equalizer of all the curses."
2 years ago I had a guy telling me curry was the third best player on his team. This was before Kevin Durant. People come out of the woodwork in the playoffs with some dumb ass hot take opinions 
"**LeBron James**  * Averaging 27/8/9 with 1.7 steals, 1.1 blocks, and 4.3 turnovers  * Leads league in VORP (4.6)  * 6th in eFG% (.609)  * Has played in 40 of 40 games  **Kevin Durant**  * Averaging 26/7/5 with 0.8 steals, 2.3 blocks (leads league), and 3.2 turnovers  * 16th in VORP (2.0)  * eFG% of .537  * Has played in 33 of 41 games"
"When Harden got hurt I had him and LeBron tied. The longer Harden sits, the larger LeBron's (small, for now) lead gets.  KD? No way. As a practical matter neither he nor Curry will get it while on the same team. Looking at it objectively, LeBron is playing better than KD...  **LeBron James**  * Averaging 27/8/9 (4th in league in assists) with 1.7 steals, 1.1 blocks, and 4.3 turnovers  * Leads league in VORP (4.6)  * 6th in eFG% (.609)  * Has played in 40 of 40 games  **Kevin Durant**  * Averaging 26/7/5 with 0.8 steals, 2.3 blocks (leads league), and 3.2 turnovers  * 16th in VORP (2.0)  * eFG% of .537  * Has played in 33 of 41 games"
GSW- KEVIN DURANT WHY? coz why hate SNEKS
All of us are either Kevin Durant or that kid
"Kevin Durant made the ""weakest move by superstar ever"" according to Stephen A Smith. So that year doesn't count. "
"I'm glad we hold Kevin Durant to the same offensive standards as Timofey Mozgov, that's really good to know.   Durant has publicly admitted to holding onto those shots until just after the buzzer on purpose in order to save his percentages. Are you really going to claim that Durant has a 0% chance of making them? If he even has a 1% chance, please let me know what the benefit to his team is of him deciding not to shoot it."
Kevin Durant joined the best team in the league and made them unbeatable.  LeBron James joined a team who would never win a championship without him (2011 Wade + Bosh Heat without LeBron would never win a ring) and made them the best.  There is a *clear* difference.
"Just look at the difference in players my guy. And the Warriors got Kevin Durant, you're gonna act like that doesn't make things hugely different? Then there's the fact that JR Smith got way worse since then and IT is a downgrade from Kyrie."
"Yes because Aldridge, rose and Iggy are comparable to Kevin Durant, good point, I just don't get how it's different?? "
"It is.  Unless it happens to Kevin Durant, then it's just a great play."
Kevin Durant makes bad looks look good
Basically by adding kevin durant the warriors took a team that was already nuts as far as systematic ball movement and added a 7 foot garbage man for any of the bad possessions that might happen 
Kevin Durant it was clear as a bright sunny sunshine day that u fouled him. 
"Cavs get Deron Williams and a 37 year old Korver    ""How much more help does LeBron need?!""   Warriors get Kevin fucking Durant    ""Steph better"""
Stephen Durant or Kevin Curry?
My top 5 this season  1. Steven Adams  2. Nikola Mirotic  3. Kevin Durant  4. Steph Curry  5. Demar DeRozan
"Anthony Davis Kevin Durant  Lamarcus Aldridge  Paul George Demarcus Cousins  Karl-Anthony Towns  Maybe Jokic.   So, I have 6-7 frontcourt players having better individual seasons than Green's. But I also don't think it would be crazy to have him as an All-Star (i mean, he's still everything you mentioned on the best team in the West)."
Kevin Durant does.
Kevin Durant because of team's record and Curry's missed games.
"Kevin durant, he has the smoothest game out there, everything just flows so smoothly "
"There were some pretty clear mitigating factors in 2016. Steph injury, Dray ejection. Also, we've replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant, so I don't think using 2016 as a standard quite applies here.   &gt; I do somewhat agree that houston wont beat GSW in a shootout but lets not act like it wont be close  What do you consider close, exactly? If the Rockets loses in 5, would you consider that to be close? "
"OKC would have taken a tax hit, but [100% yes](http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-thunder-vs-warriors-russell-westbrook-james-harden-trade-okc/1tt026yq1lmjj1vh97biyotfwf).   In fairness, the changes to the cap would have made that tax hit more manageable than they thought it would be when they traded him."
Kevin Durant went to Golden State BECAUSE of Stephen Curry. 
"Don't you mean  &gt;""Kevin Durant is the DPOY this year.""  -- Kevin Durant thinking he's still signed in as Kevin Durant's alt"
The Warriors are better off because theyre NOT having to face Durant on OKC or any other team. NOT because they HAVE Kevin Durant on their team.
"I could never put Kevin Durant in an ""overrated"" category "
"Well it's you who is missing the bigger picture of my original post. The objective of my post was to point out that Draymond is always more important than KD when it comes to defense because he's an all around better defender and he allows Kevin Durant to utilize his length to alter shots by what you just said. I didn't argue that KD was a better defender than Draymond. What I said was also technically true because KD is leading the league in block shots so technically he does have a ""monster presence"" in the paint. I didn't say he was the best defender in the paint."
And then they have Klay Thompson who’s right next to him in terms of shooting (all time) and then Kevin Durant lmao. 
"Yea but the gravity (and just plain respect from defenses) that Kevin Durant and Klay provide for him isn’t understood I don’t think. When Klay runs around a screen, when KD rolls of screens or set them himself. It’s generally Steph Curry by himself being defended by a big that got switched on P&amp;R or a point guard (PG’s generally don’t play good defense).  Also Steph Curry gets doubled all the time? Wow bro what are u watching. Zaza plays 8-10 minutes a night. Kevin Looney and JaVale don’t play more then 8-10 min. And Kevin Durant plays a lot of 5 this year bro u gotta pay attention more lol "
"don't you mean   &gt;""Kevin Durant is the DPOY this year.""   -- Kevin Durant's alt"
"""Kevin Durant is the DPOY this year.""  -- nobody"

I feel stupid for not having LeBron in there, but he'll be 38 in 2023 and even genetically superior humans have to slow down eventually. I think KD and Steph have games that will translate well into their mid-thirties. I also think DSJ will inherit Westbrook's soul and become the second coming.  "
"Do you really think they would gain nothing from adding the best player in the world?  Everything you said could have been said in the Summer of 2017, when they were a 73-win team fresh off two finals appearances.  They still went and signed Kevin Durant, and it made them better.  You'd have to be stupid not to sign a generational talent like that if given the chance."
"2K15 - Kevin Durant, 2007 draft 2K16 - Steph Curry, 2009 draft 2K17 - Paul George, 2010 draft 2K18 - Kyrie Irving, 2011 draft  2K19... probably someone from the 2012 or 2013 draft.  Giannis, AD, and Dame are my three guesses for most likely selections."
1. Curry 2. Irving 3. Delon Wright 4. Kevin Durant .. .. 11. Lebron James  https://stats.nba.com/players/ball-handler/#!?sort=Percentile&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PossG*G*3:GP*G*30&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season  If you go by points per posession in the pick and roll for at least 30 games played and 3.0 posessions per game  
Kevin Durant did not start this trend of teaming up with other superstars. Lebron has himself to blame for this. 
i think  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Steph Curry  is a better list sorry
"&gt; A quick look at Westbrook’s shot chart suggests that all that practice has not paid off in efficiency, but those seeking to evaluate Westbrook’s offensive contributions through his shooting behavior are simply doing it wrong. Last season provides the perfect example. Somehow, despite winning the scoring title, Westbrook also ranked fourth in the NBA in assists per game — and it’s that statistical category that may define the next phase in his career.

1 Anthony Davis  2. James harden  3. Kevin Durant
"I was thinking this same line. On pure physical measurements Kevin Durant is probably the best “big” in the league. He can play both ways, inside and out, and has even been a top blocker in the league this year."
"Here's what WS/48 would have picked just applying a simple +20% expected growth age 19 and 20, 15% age 21, 10% age 22 and 5% age 23 and then the reverse expecting 5% decline at age 28 and 29 and then increasing in 5% increments each year (minimum 1000 MP):  1. Kawhi Leonard 2. James Harden 3. Kenneth Faried 4. Kevin Durant 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Kevin Love 7. Ryan Anderson 8. Chris Paul 9. Derrick Rose 10. Greg Monroe 11. Blake Griffin 12. LeBron James 13. Paul George 14. Serge Ibaka 15. Joakim Noah 16. Thaddeus Young 17. Ersan Ilyasova 18. Andrew Bynum 19. Russell Westbrook 20. Derrick Favors  If you get to look at the 12/13 season (not sure if this was printed after the season started), a lot of the bad picks here would be adjusted out. Ryan Anderson,  Ersan Ilyasova, Kenneth Faried and Thad Young all had outlier good seasons in 11/12. Bynum and Rose also both missed the next season.  Removing those four would add the following players:  * Deandre Jordan * Lou Williams * Gordon Hayward * Steph Curry  There are more misses here than the BR list, but if you just look at how it predicts the younger players, which is a far tougher challenge, it does a lot better than BR did... Kawhi, Harden, Irving and George weren't household names at the time.  Obviously, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Towns, Lilliard or anyone drafted after summer 2011 can't be included here, but other omissions are as follows:  * Kyle Lowry (#33) * Demarcus Cousins (#38) * Lamarcus Aldridge (#42) * Demar Derozan (#139)  Jimmy Butler didn't play 1000 minutes in 11/12, but if he did, he'd be ranked 21."
"I don't give a damn about meaningless stats that come at the expense of wins. The fact of the matter is that Russ makes people around him worse. Do you think it's a coincidence that Oladipo, Sabonis and Kanter all took off the second they stopped playing with the most ball-dominant player in NBA history? Even when he was teammates with one of the most efficient scorers ever in Kevin Durant, Russ who has a career 43% field goal shooter, took more shots than KD. Explain to me how that is in any way acceptable."
And then “But he did choose Waluigi who looks just like Kevin Durant.”
"Steph (who didn't choose Yoshi) ""I'm a traitor""  Hunter Pence: ""So basically Kevin Durant"""
man can this sub go back to having players quotes so we dont have fictional trades and where steph curry and kevin durant are ranked all damn day.
"Jeremy Lamb for one. Remember Westbrook staring him down when he refused the high five? He didn't talk to him after he left the team either. Durant did though. Lamb mentioned this to the media.   Kevin Martin is another one. He made a few comments to the media after he left about how much better Minnesota was as a team than OKC because ""nobody is trying to lead the league in scoring here"". Apparently Westbrook wasn't too great to him after he left.  Ibaka is another one. Ibaka has never said a good thing about Westbrook since he left and there are no indications they keep in contact at all. Ibaka made a point to mention how difficult it is to play with Westbrook as a teammate because he's self-centered and worries more about his own play. Quote:  &gt; I’m gonna tell you the truth, it’s hard sometimes when you play hard, you play you’re (butt off), You play so hard on defense, then you come to offense and you’re going to be out there in the corner for 4, 5, 6, sometimes 8 minutes and you don’t touch the ball. We human, man. It’s hard.  I'm not even mentioning Reggie Jackson and Durant here, who are the most obvious teammate snubs in Westbrook's career."
How dare you mention 50 point legend Corey Brewer in the same breath as Kevin Durant
Kyrie/Love stats are equal to Kevin Durant in this case so I don't understand your point.
"I don't think you can hold the ""4th best player on his own team""   I mean its Steph ""Skyfucker"" Curry, Kevin ""Fuck KD"" Durant, and a donkey"
"Thanks Kevin Durant, thank you for ruining basketball because you are a snake ass hoe and have no personality "
Without Stephen Curry the Warriors don't have Kevin Durant. So tell me again who's more valuable?
"&gt; All he's asked is to score and defend?  TO SHOOT and defend.  Lets not get it twisted, there's a 3% difference in TS%(even ignoring the PPG gap) and one of them gets 80% of his shots assisted and has two of the top 15 offensive threats OF ALL TIME pulling defenses for him.    Klay doesn't have to run an offense, he doesn't pass, he doesn't have to create his own shot, hell he doesn't even rebound as well as Dame.  Switch their spots and let Dame play offball of fucking kevin durant and steph curry and watch Klay lead our team, shit would be hilarious.  Lillard beats him out in points, assists, rebounds, and just about every advanced stat out there(VORP, BPM, RPM, both offensive and defensive win shares, PER, WS/48).  Those account for both offensive and defensive impact.  "
that's good imo. im tired of players getting so close to people then never talking mess or truth. im so sick of hearing Kevin Durant learn how to talk publically and not screw up anymore. it's the most boring shit hearing him praising everyone
"If Kevin Durant got a 13 year old pregnant like Karl Malone, how many finals losses would he have to get before people forgave him?"
"&gt; If Kevin Durant was accused of rape...  ....and for that reason, i'm out"
"He has no control over the team. We just do whatever Wall/Beal feel like out there and he never runs plays for Otto Porter. I’ve never seen him make good adjustments. He consistently plays all-bench lineups despite it NEVER working. He refuses to bench Markieff Morris or Marcin Gortat even though they’ve been horrendous.  He was brought in to entice Kevin Durant and every time I even think about that I get so fucking embarrassed. Can’t wait til the guy is gone, he’s truly atrocious at coaching basketball."

Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is significantly better.
You're forgetting the Warriors added Kevin fucking Durant 
My dad pulled a Kevin Durant and left us for a much better family   Fucking snek
LeBron James is a really good player.  Jason Tatum is only 19 and has great potential.  Steph Curry is a great 3 point shooter.  Cavs are old  Kevin Durant is also a good player  Russell Westbrook is an MVP and carried his team.  Since this seems like the only thing you can post on this subreddit I'm wondering what you guys think about this.

vs. Kevin Durant
Are you joking? A team with Kevin Durant &amp; Russell Westbrook went 23-59 too. That's what happens when your two best players are in their first and second years. Then you get better. Jesus Christ.
"Kevin Durant handpicked an entire squad, he just had to move to play with them"
Kevin Durant: efficiency and consistency 
Kevin Durant.  
~~Reggie Miller~~  Edit: its Kevin Durant
What about Kevin Durant in three point stance.
" Here are the rules for team captains LeBron James (Eastern Conference) and Stephen Curry (West) to choose their rosters for the 2018 All-Star Game in Los Angeles.   * Starters (First Round): The remaining eight All-Star starters -- Kyrie Irving, Giannis Antetokounmpo, DeMar DeRozan and Joel Embiid from the East, and Kevin Durant, James Harden, Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins from the West -- will be drafted, regardless of conference (All-Star Roster).  * Reserves (Second Round): The fourteen players named as All-Star reserves, to be revealed on Jan. 23 (TNT, 7 p.m. ET), will be drafted, regardless of conference.  * James, as the overall vote leader, will pick first in the First Round.  Curry will pick first in the Second Round. Picks will alternate until all players in that round have been selected.  * By the end of the draft, each captain will have a team of 12 — the captain himself and 11 teammates. Each team must have a minimum of three guards on its roster by the conclusion of the draft.  * The team rosters will be revealed on Thursday, Jan. 25 at 7 p.m. ET in a special one-hour edition of TNT NBA Tip-Off. "
"Steph  Klay  Otto Porter Jr  Draymond Green  Steven Adams  I bet that team beats the KD led thunder, the Spurs, and the Cavs the next few years too.   But unfortunately in 2016 the only upgrade over Harrison Barnes was Kevin Fucking Durant.   It’s like renting a car and then it dies on you. When you get to the car rental company they don’t have anything they can give you but the fucking Tumbler from The Dark Knight. "
Kevin durant or kawhi Leonard 
"Of the five remaining CMVs that still remain in the Reddit archives, none of the discussions resulted in you changing your view.

He won’t ever be  Kevin Durant is trending to be an elite player on both facets of the game. 
we're all kevin durant
"Not to mention, why the fuck would he need to score more than 11ppg.. that's actually quite a lot considering his team mates are Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson."
"Well ""good money"" probably means different things to you and Kevin Durant.  Unless it doesn't, in which case get in touch with us and we'll see if we can buy a KD AMA."
"I know exactly which one you’re talking about but can’t find it.

I would actually pay good money to get Kevin Durant to do an AMA on r/nba...although there'd be hardly any question he could/would answer!
Yeah I think we should definitely see Spencer Dinwiddie over Durant. That's why I tune into meaningless exhibitions. For Spencer Dinwiddie and definitely not for Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is already allowed to play 
"Oh fuck, I been looking forward to seeing this! LETS GO CANADIAN KEVIN DURANT!"
"You missed the joke, my KD isnt Kevin Durant lol"
"*Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry led All-Star voting in their respective conferences and will serve as the captains for the All-Star Game.*   *Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, Philadelphia's Joel Embiid, Boston's Kyrie Irving and Toronto's DeMar DeRozan were also selected as starters from the Eastern Conference.*   *Houston's James Harden, Golden State's Kevin Durant and New Orleans teammates Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins were also selected as starters from the Western Conference.*"
EJ: Is Kevin Durant not on your list.
So he is picking Kevin Durant?
I wanted Kevin Durant to top the West voting to become captain. Only because I'd love to see LeBron and Curry on the same team for once. JUST ONCE!
"&gt; last years finals where he thoroughly outplayed Curry  In last years final the Cavs decided they would rather double Curry at half court and allow Kevin Durant to run the offense 4v3 than allow Curry to do anything in the game. Sure, KD scored more points, but he scored more points because of how ridiculous Steph is."
like Kevin Durant?  You guys know they're friends and hoop together in the summer right?  
This has nothing to do with my original point that [individual] offense affects winning far greater than [individual] defense does. Individual is implied because the original argument was about Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant. Whatever you’re on about has proved nothing. You’ve entire argument is proving that the team that scores more win. Might as well argue that water is wet.
Warriors in 2016 would have Kevin Durant.   That would never fucking happen. 
"Kobe's TS that year was 55.9%.   Steph Curry: 67.5%  Kevin Durant: 62.9%  Lebron James: 63.9%  James Harden: 62.7%  Even last year, when everyone was saying Westbrook was having terrible shooting percentages he shot 55.4% TS. This isn't about shooting league average, are you calling Kobe a league average player? We're comparing him to the best players in the league right now. And right now shooting 55.9% is not considered **great**.   "
"It doesn't matter about trade value. It's a matter of how good Smart / Tatum is. Smart and Tatum don't belong in the same grouping of Kyrie or Kevin Durant. Sure Tatum has great potential sure. Smart's impact on a Celtics team with KD is much more impactful than Tatum's. Tatum brings scoring, something that Durant and Kyrie have. Smart brings amazing defense and hustle, something that not both Durant and Kyrie have."
"You're arguing against something only someone completely biased would even begin to argue.   Blows my mind you're legitimately trying to argue that Kevin Durant marginalizes others like Lebron does.  It doesn't mean KD is better(he's not), but he's a better fit on some teams.  KD is probably the least ball dominant superstar in the NBA right now, completely the other end of the spectrum from guys like Lebron or Westbrook.  KD you can stick on any team and he'd do his thing.  Stick Lebron on any team and they're suddenly playing Lebron ball.  Is one necessarily better than the other?  No, but it's hilarious you're trying to argue this is true.  No matter the makeup of his teams Lebron's teams always play the same.  "
"This was a comment on a post about KD having property on Waiters Island:  &gt;""It was my favorite place to come home to"" Durant continued, ""after a long day.""  &gt;""In the summertime, you could hear the birds chirp as dawn came. And in the evening, the cicadas would rock you to sleep. With his arms wrapped around me, I felt safe. It was just me and my Dion. Us against the world.""  &gt;""In Fall, we would play basketball on the court behind the mansion. His sweat-drenched back, up against my stomach, as I draped over him. And soon, we were on the court, naked up against each other. With my back on the warm pavement of center court, he mounted and entered me. Over and over again, he thrust inside me, each deeper than the last. Faster and faster until he let out a masculine moan. 'And one', as he burst inside me. I was forever his Kevin."" "
Pg Gary Payton  Sg Michael Jordan  SF Kevin Durant  Pf Kevin Garnett  C hakeem  This team is elite defensively and has enough shooting. Chose KD over LeBron because you have to build around LeBron and KD is better integrated into an existing team

the golden state warriors added kevin fucking durant to a 73-9 team and you're mad at us for tanking
Mirotic really just did that. Motherfucker stepped over Kevin Durant like AI stepping over Tyronn Lue. God damn. 
Nobody should be calling anyone but Kevin Durant KD. 
But Kevin Durant is constantly hunched over with his little goatee and spider limbs. The guy looks like the evil big boss’s right hand man in an anime.   That kinda stuff makes it hard to shake the snake memes.
Dion “Dijon the Mustard Man” Waiters  Enes “The Penis” Kanter   Kevin “Bitch” Durant 
"Also missing Pau Gasol, who was drafted 3rd overall in 2001. This whole list is kinda bullshit because of the fact that Duncan played 4 years in college and so most of his top competitors in his prime were drafted before him. That ends up ruling out the following top 3 picks from title teams post Duncan draft: Jordan (1x champ post Duncan draft), Shaq (4x champ), Billups (1x), Kidd (1x). So you're cutting out key players from 7 championship teams as well as Duncan's 5 titles. That's 12 of 20 teams excluded.   Here are the 8 remaining eligible championship teams and where their key players were drafted:  * 2008 Celtics -- Kevin Garnett (#5), Ray Allen (#5), Paul Pierce (#10), Rajon Rondo (#21) * 2009 Lakers -- Kobe Bryant (#13), Pau Gasol (#3), Lamar Odom (#4), Andrew Bynum (#10) * 2010 Lakers -- see above * 2012 Heat -- Lebron James (#1), Dwyane Wade (#5), Chris Bosh (#4)    * 2013 Heat  -- see above * 2015 Warriors -- Steph Curry (#7), Klay Thompson (#11), Draymond Green (#35) * 2016 Cavs -- Lebron James (#1), Kyrie Irving (#1), Kevin Love (#5)   * 2017 Warriors -- Steph Curry (#7), Kevin Durant (#2), Klay Thompson (#11), Draymond Green (#35)  So ~~3~~ 2 of the 9 teams didn't feature a top player who was a top 3 pick. Of these top players, all but Draymond Green were lotto picks. 13 of 17 were picked in the top 5."
Kevin Durant?  Yeah...I saw him too.
"&gt;Steph’s team is more fun than Lebron’s team   &gt;&gt;&gt;   Only if you think shooting is the only fun nothing in basketball, then sure   But all the best and most dominant players are in Bron's team, along with all the best BIGS.   &gt;&gt;&gt;  Only Big dudes Curry's team got are Giannis and Embiid, that's it. Unless the shooters in his team doesn't miss any shot, they will get vaporized by Bron's team..    &gt;&gt;&gt;   TBH, obviously few people loves watching the lil guys dribble dribble dribble and shoot, that's fun for them. For someone like me, i like watching the best and most dominant players, dominate. Straight up. That's the most fun thing in basketball.    &gt;&gt;&gt;   Watching  LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis all in one fucking team would be orgasmic"
"No. He lost that chance by leaving OKC in 2016.   I know this will sound like my flair is talking (and it is) but hear me out. Kevin Durant could have solidified himself as the absolute best player in the world during that post-season, and it was the only chance he ever had.   In the 2016 playoffs, Kevin Durant retired Tim Duncan. Then he could have beat Steph Curry and the ""greatest team of all time"". Then he could have beat LeBron.   Who knows what happens to GS if they lose 4-2 after winning 73 games. In the hypothetical that KD stays and OKC wins it all, they have to be the favorites moving forward for the next 4-5 years.   That could have put KD in position to be the clear best player in the world, on the best team, with a chance to rack up 4 or 5 rings and Finals MVPs (Russ would have stolen some of them).   Now, as it is, KD may up with more career accolades (rings), but he cannot compete with LeBron by being on Golden State. There's arguments on whether Durant is even the best player *on his team*. There's no way you can say he's better than LeBron.   But he could have been."
Can someone go back and figure out who the captains would have been if we had been doing this all along?  Edit: Jk I did it   Year	| West Captain| 	East Captain ---|---|---- 2000	| Shaquille O'Neal|Vince Carter 2001	|	Kobe Bryant		|Allen Iverson 2002	|	Shaquille O'Neal		|Vince Carter 2003	|Kobe Bryant	|Tracy McGrady 2004|	Kevin Garnett	|Vince Carter 2005	|Yao Ming	|Shaquille O'Neal 2006	|Kobe Bryant	|Lebron James 2007	|Yao Ming	|Dwyane Wade 2008	|Kobe Bryant	|Kevin Garnett 2009	|Tim Duncan|	Dwight Howard 2010	|Kobe Bryant|	Lebron James 2011	|Kevin Durant|	Dwight Howard 2012	|Kobe Bryant	|Derrick Rose 2013	|Kevin Durant|	Lebron James 2014	|Steph Curry|	Paul George 2015	|Anthony Davis	|Lebron James 2016	|Kobe Bryant|	Dwyane Wade 2017	|Kevin Durant	|Lebron James 2018|	Steph Curry|	Giannis Antetokounmpo

Almost positive that Lebron snatched up KD first.   Something like this.  Round 1 LeBron: Kevin Durant Curry: James Harden  Round 2: Curry: Giannis Antetokounmpo LeBron: Anthony Davis  Round 3: LeBron: Kyrie Irving Curry: Joel Embiid  Round 4: Curry: DeMar DeRozan LeBron: DeMarcus Cousins  Round 5: LeBron: Russell Westbrook Curry: Klay Thompson  Round 6: Curry: Draymond Green LeBron: Kevin Love  (Quick note: I think Steph leads the charge on picking his teammates and so LeBron panics a little and grabs Love to prevent drama.)  Round 7 LeBron: Kristaps Porzingis Curry: Kyle Lowry  Round 8 Curry: Karl Anthony-Towns LeBron: LaMarcus Aldridge  Round 9 LeBron: Bradley Beal Curry: Jimmy Butler  Round 10 Curry: Al Horford LeBron: Victor Oladipo  Round 11 LeBron: John Wall Curry: Damian Lillard
Full list:  1. James Harden 2. Kevin Durant 3. Russell Westbrook 4. Stephen Curry 5. LeBron James 6. Kyrie Irving 7. DeMar DeRozan 8. DeMarcus Cousins 9. Jimmy Butler 10. Giannis Antetokounmpo
Kevin Durant is making a big deal out of it 
"Again, who is doing that?  Who is out here giving Oden the lifetime achievement award for greatness in character and failing to bring up his DV charges?  Anyone who knows about it thinks it's wrong, and anybody who doesn't know...doesn't know.  Are you mad the whole country isn't following him around ringing a bell and chanting, ""Shame!""?  I've asked you multiple times: what do you actually want that isn't happening?  You're disappointed that more people don't know that a washed up NBA player committed a crime and mostly think of him as, ""That good player who couldn't stay healthy?"" instead of ""That good player who couldn't stay healthy and got into such a bad mental place that he lost control and hit a woman?""  I mean, I guess.  I just think that's an awfully small thing to be worried about, that more people don't know about a particular former NBA player's DV charge.  It takes a pretty high level of news consumption to keep tabs on the legal travails of every former pro athlete and make sure nothing slips past you.  In 50 years, ""Hall of Famer Kevin Durant won X many MVPs, Y many scoring titles, and Z many championships...but believe it or not: he was only drafted 2nd.  Who was drafted #1 that year?"" will probably be a pretty solid trivia question."

"I like how you made that disclaimer. Super necessary  Btw, I’m not Kevin “Wayne” Durant"
"Kevin, Wayne, and Durant.  Throw in Stephon and Curry. KD is not even top10 at that point."
You think when LeBron drafted Durant he did this:  I choose Kevin....pause.....stare at Love....... Durant
"For real. Everyone else is shitting on KD, but you've got to give this some props.   For the record , I am not Kevin Durant"

Kevin Durant the type of bitch who holds a grudge against the guy who cut him in line in 2nd grade
Next day.  Kevin Durant: im sorry for all ive said. I'm ready for all the consequences.
"&gt; Westbrook isnt on Curry's level    &gt;&gt;&gt;     Is Westbrook more accomplished than Curry? No   But better player? Many people believes Westbrook is better individual player  because he's bigger stronger and the most explosive athlete in the NBA right now in his prime, he'll rape Curry head to head, 1 on 1. Simple   &gt;&gt;&gt;   BTW, what's Curry's level actually? Crying and going to the 2nd best player in the world Kevin Durant for help, because 73 win team with 3 all Stars wasn't enough to beat Lebron and healthy Cavs? So he needed 4 all Stars and a super team to beat Bron?That's his level? because that's exactly what he did.    &gt;&gt;&gt;   Your username is *anal dick cum slut* LMAO so you are underage. I can't even take ya dumbass seriously. Rockets fans and underage illiterate trolls, it's not surprising, just sad.   Go to sleep kid. "
"Yes, Kevin Durant is indeed good"
"Are you autistic or just a dumb troll? Bron is still the most feared basketball player in the league, everyone knows that and have said it publicly as well. He has been raping the East for decades now, and in the West? Ask 2016 Golden State, the team that was being compared to the Jordan Bulls. Sad  &gt;&gt;&gt;   Why do you think Curry, Draymond and those boys went home crying and called Kevin Durant? They had the best team in the league, 3 all stars, a 2 Time MVP, and just won 73 games, but they realized it ain't enough to beat Bron and a healthy Cavs team.   &gt;&gt;&gt;  So they went on crying to Durant and recruited him, formed a Superteam, just to beat Bron in the Finals. That shows how much scared Curry and the Golden State has been of 33 year old LeBron.. that's just weak but quite hilarious.   &gt;&gt;&gt;   Stop hating, if that 6'9 260 lbs genetical freak was coming at you full speed, you will shit your pants too LOL go to sleep kid. Fuck outa here"
"I know it's a joke and all in good fun, but even so, what KD said in his interview is kind of taken out of context.  &gt; Durant, who joined Golden State two years ago, said he was grateful to be selected by James. ""It's all in good fun. [Steph] knows how I feel about the whole thing. But that doesn't mean I'm not coming for him.""  &gt; When asked to clarify his comments, the former Oklahoma City superstar had this to say: ""We joke, but that doesn't mean we're not competitive. A lot of people think [The All-Star Game] is a big joke, but every time we step on the court, we're out there to compete. I wouldn't have it any other way.""  &gt; Durant followed up by sharing his thoughts on Curry as a teammate. ""There are few players I'd rather have out there battling with me. Steph and I have a real bond. The only other guy I really consider a brother is Dion [Waiters]. Last week, for example, we took a trip to his island, just to kick back and relax. We spent lots of time on the court behind his mansion, going at it one on one. Pretty soon our shirts were off, and we were going all out on each other. I looked at him to check the ball, and I saw something change in his eyes. I dropped the ball as he walked towards me. And then, suddenly, a kiss.""  &gt;""As he laid me down at center court, I could feel the warm pavement against my bare back. Soon, he entered me. First slowly, and then faster and deeper. 'I'm coming for you' he said, before feeling his body go limp on top of me. And in that moment, I was forever his Kevin."""
Kevin Durant was snubbed from being a captain. How does the best player in the NBA not an all star captain? There should be no fan vote for the all star game. 
"[FWIW, Jerry West agrees with you.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/heres-what-jerry-west-reportedly-told-kevin-durant-during-his-warriors-pitch/) "
Kevin 'BFF LeBron' Durant
"Kevin ""Lebron James"" Durant"
"Watch Westbrook brick game-winning 3 after 3 while he stands in the corner, or join up with Wardell and get a ring, and splash all over LeBron's face, easy choice for Kevin Wayne Durant. "
KEVIN DURANT IS THE NEXT RON ARTEST!
"Uh oh. Belly had better look out. Kevin ""The Big Fucking Clit"" Durant is looking for him."
"Kevin ""grayson allen shenanigans"" durant"
I guess your grandma isn't Kevin Durant
"""I'm as good as lebron now!""-kevin durant quotes "
"Lil b was right, fuc kevin durant lol. Seriously though, so ironic that kd somehow ended up in the bay with that song happening. "
"I would still pick Curry but I could see a very clear argument for Westbrook. People will argue that this GS team is so overpowering that in order to lead your team to victory against them in a playoff series you must be an all time great. That is something even LeBron James and Kevin Durant could not achieve. Unfortunately, Curry does not get the opportunity to to play against GS so he cannot prove his greatness against them."
You ever have that friend group in high school where there's that one dude who's totally the butt of every joke with regards to how corny and lame he is? Kevin Durant is an NBA champion and MVP and he's absolutely that guy
"Best part of this is that it obviously shows LeBron took Kevin Durant with the first pick, otherwise Steph undoubtedly would. "
"This dumbass on a local radio station said that ""Kevin Durant doesn't care what people think about him"" and argued with me over text for 20 minutes when I brought up KD's fake accounts."
"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Anthony Davis is one of the best 3-on-3 teams I could think of. Now add these other guys? Whewwww"
Klay Thompson is a better player than Kevin Durant
"I mean, you can't sit here and tell me that there is any team in the league that has a shot against the Warriors. If you do, you're underestimating your team. And even if we don't go off regular season stuff, we have a team that's been to the finals 3 times in a row now, and after the second time they added kevin durant, a player in his prime currently the second best player in the world.  The Warriors bench isn't amazing, I agree. This is sort of masked by the fact that Kerr always keeps 1-2 starters in with the bench, and the ball stays moving. Makes the bench players look a lot better.   And you're crazy if you think the Warriors aren't going to turn it up to another level in the playoffs. Your core is playoffs/finals experienced and will know how to turn up when the regular season BS is over. And after that, it's over.   Well, whatever. I guess we'll just wait and see, but it's really too bad that people have already forgotten how unfair the Warriors are. The NBA is a glorified race for second place"
My name is Kevin Durant. This is my story. 
kevin durant finally gets to return to his natural NBA position of shooting guard
"Alright LeBron, who do you want with your first pick?  LeBron: Kevin...  *Love jumps up*  ...Durant"
"“James to Westbrook, driving hard, Westbrook dancing, pass to Kyrie, pa- passs stolen by James...James the fall away, misses, Durant the rebound, Durant up for the layu- b-Blocked by Westbrook, Westbro- Kevin Love has been knocked down, teammates are nowhere to be seen”"
"How tf do you let somebody get kevin durant, anthony davis and demarcus cousins "
Isn't it obvious that it was KD? Does anyone believe Kevin frickin' Durant fell to the 3rd pick in the draft?
"LeBron basically combined the '16-'17 Cavs/Pelicans/Wizards/Thunder into one team, then added Kevin Durant, Unicorn, and LMA"
Kevin Durant. Twin towers. And Kyrie. 
"mostly the fact that no other team starts 2 mvp level players, 3 of the best shooters ever, a dpoy, has a finals mvp coming off the bench, a decent to good coach, and one of the better benches in the league. also there's a 73 win team that won a championship in there somewhere, which added kevin fucking durant. so yeah. teams are lucky to take THAT to six games when they're locked in and actually give a shit about winning/losing because it matters"
"Hey cool it with that, some of us are Kevin Durant and would rather not be outed."
55 is worse than 67 or 61.  Congratulations to Stephen Curry/Kevin Durant/Kawhi Leonard on their 2017 MVP.
&gt; at least 7 of them who's Kevin Durant.  I laughed out loud at work and now everyones looking at me lmfao
"Bets between the players.  It can be for money, sure, but it would be better if it was for pride.  The more creative the better.    For example:  If Russ loses he has to wear clothing chosen by Kevin Durant to the next six home game.  If Curry loses he has to dress up like a clown for Lebron's kid next birthday party.  If Harden loses he has to shave off his beard.   (holy fuck!)  Let these guys pick teams, THEN come up with bets.  They can negotiate if the stakes are too high (and be laughed at for chickening out).  Whatever.  But put their pride on the line.  Give them something personal to play for, and these human beings ... some of the most competitive people on the planet, are going to TRY TO WIN THAT BET."
Kevin Durant is the pet Snake 
"&gt;Kevin Durant made the weakest move in the history of professional sports.  I just described one weaker. Trying, failing, and going to a great team is not as bad as not trying, failing, blaming others and then trying to go to a team you think will be just as good."
"Well, I mean, /r/nba has 1 million subs, at least 7 of them who's Kevin Durant.   Some variation in opinions and intelligence is to be expected."
"Kevin Durant made the weakest move in the history of professional sports. If you can still support him after that, that's fine. But I and many others can't. Going to a 70+ win team that came 1 minute away from a 2nd championship in a row when you are an MVP type player is as weak as it gets. It would be like Julio Jones joining the Patriots after last years super bowl. KD will never fully be able to live it down in the eyes of many fans even if he wins a title every year, because it was weak and he should have gotten it done in OKC. "
"Durant looking for that double heel turn. ""Kevin didn't screw Steph... Steph screwed Steph."""
Burt Steele: Sources tell me LeBron James and Kevin Durant have interest in becoming a Rocket. 
"&gt;The NBA will not televise the NBA All-Star draft. Initially, that decision makes you wonder why even have it at all. The whole point is the drama of picking and choosing, the politics and the pettiness. That’s the riveting part, not the East and West being mixed.  &gt;But the more I think about it, the more I come to see why the NBA is passing on the playground-style draft. Because it could go like this:  &gt;Commissioner Adam Silver: LeBron James, you have the first pick. Stephen Curry, you pick second.  &gt;LeBron: Gimmie KD.  &gt;Kevin Durant: That’s right. No. 1!  &gt;LeBron: You were supposed to go to the Warrriors and squash the Under Armour empire by now. But somehow, the Curry 4s are selling and not on sale at Ross.  &gt;Durant: But …  &gt;LeBron: You had one job.  &gt;Durant: You don’t understand the spell he has on 13-year-olds, man.  &gt;LeBron: That’s why I’m picking you first. I’m bequeathing you the throne so you can take over middle schools...   That's what a copy/paste into notepad gets you after highlighting everything. It seems pretty stupid"
"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, DeMarcus Cousins, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Love, Bradley Beal, Kyle Lowry, and LaMarcus Aldridge.   vs   Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond Green, Kristaps Porzingis, Damian Lillard, Karl-Anthony Towns, Victor Oladipo, John Wall, and Al Horford   I want to see James Harden recruiting LeBron for next year. KD and Westbrook throwing lobs again. Kyrie and LeBron running PNR. Klay Thompson and Steph going back and forth jacking up threes against each other. Anthony Davis and Greek in PNR."
"my dunmass idea to make the Cavs a championship team  trade 1: Lebron James for Draymond Green and Klay Thmopson   trade 2: CJ Mcollum for Kevin Love  Trade 3: IT, Frye, Shump Nets pick for Marc Gasol   Warriors get Lebron Curry and Durant as the big 3  Cavs get CJ Klay Green and Gasol  Portland gets Love  Grizzlies get that Brooklyn pick and tank  YOLO "
"Pasting the article here since it's behind paywall. My bad, guys.    The NBA will not televise the NBA All-Star draft. Initially, that decision makes you wonder why even have it at all.

KD: Bequeathing? I took that, homie.  Curry: Maaaaaan. Fu … dge Nike. Give me Klay Thompson.  LeBron: See, I knew that was coming. I’m a student of the game.  Curry: Klay … Klay! What are you doing???  Klay: I can’t find my lighter.  Curry: Man, come over here. I picked you.  Silver: Klay Thompson is not eligible for the first round. You must choose from the pool of starters that were voted in.  Draymond Green: (*through gritted teeth*) Steph! That’s not the plan!  Green nods his head twice to the right.  Curry: Oh yeah! My bad. You know me. I lose focus sometimes.  Ron Adams: Yeah, we know!  Curry: Give me Anthony Davis.  Davis: Niiiiice!  Kyrie Irving: Hol’ up … hol’ up … I see what’s happening here.  LeBron: Y’all doing this again???  Curry: What? I’m picking players just like you. Why is it a problem when I select a player???  LeBron: Nah. It’s cool, Steph. It’s cool. I’m ready this time.  Whadduya say Ky! Down for one more run together?  Kyrie: Respectful requests usually come with a please.  LeBron: I’m the King!! I don’t say please to nobody. What I look like?!?!  Draymond: Don’t let him talk to you like that Ky!  Kyrie: See, this is why I left.  LeBron: I don’t care! I’m taking James Harden!  KD: (*whispers in Bron’s ear*) You ain’t supposed to pick him. He with adidas.  Bron: WE RUN NIKE! And Kyrie acting funny again! I’m through with him!  Kyrie: Control is but an illusion. The truly free are those who surrender to the reality of having no control.  Curry: I’ll take Kyrie. My bad, James. You were my next pick.  LeBron: We need some size. Lemme see. … Give me Joel Embiid.  Embiid: Finally. You guys were taking too long to trust the process. I should have been the first pick.  LeBron: Don’t trip, bro. I’ll make sure Rihanna holla at you as a bonus.  Embiid: I told everybody I’m off her now. She didn’t want me then, I don’t want her.  Harden: You say that now. You know you wanna see her nakey nakey naked.  Curry: Yes! Give me Giannis!  Draymond: Told you we’d get him too! This chess. This ain’t checkers!  Cousins: You betta pick me, Bron! I ain’t no last pick!  Davis: You not last. You see all these cats out here?  Cousins: Last of the first round! I ain’t last at nothing. Bron, don’t play me out here like this.  LeBron: Cuz, I already got Joel. I can’t have two centers.  Cousins: I ain’t just a center fool! Stop tryna play me! I play the four and I can run the point. My 3 is better than yours!  Durant: Pick Cuz, man. You know he gone blow a gasket if you don’t. Let him live.  LeBron: C’mon Cuz. You know I got you.  Cousins: That’s what I thought!  Thompson: Here it is! Found my lighter!  Curry: Let’s go DeMar DeRozan. You know I love The Six.  DeRozan: Right on. Right on. Let’s have some fun.  Drake: Somebody said The Six?  Durant: Don’t nobody give a damn about no Drake night!  Silver: This is a closed meeting, Aubrey.  Drake: I’m with DeMar. He said I can get one of his stints.  Silver: That’s not allowed under the CBA.  Drake: But I’m designing the uniforms.  Russell Westbrook: No you ain’t! I already set up a designer from Milan to make 'em!  Drake: But I’m making a soundtrack.  Damian Lillard: Too late. I’m already on it.  Drake: Can I at least perform at halftime?  Victor Oladipo: I could use another background singer. You a tenor, right?  Silver: So the starting lineups go as follows:  Team LeBron James consists of himself, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid and DeMarcus Cousins.  Team Stephen Curry consists of himself, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, Giannis Antetokounmpo and DeMar DeRozan.  Now for the reserves. LeBron, since you had the first pick in the first round, Steph you get the first pick of the second round.  Curry: My brother of Splash. Klay Thompson.  Thompson: So, I’m set right? That’s all you need from me?  Draymond: Klay, where is you going bro???  Thompson: Um … I’m just … about to make sure Rocco is still safe outside.  Cousins: I’m coming witchu.  Silver: To check on Rocco?  Cousins: Um … yeah. It’s like he both our dog. We just keep him at Klay house.  Silver: You two are not checking on Rocco without me. Stay here. LeBron, your pick.  LeBron: Let’s go Russ!  Westbrook: Hell nah! I ain’t playing with him!  LeBron: Oh, so you gone play for Steph???  Westbrook: I don’t play for nobody! I play for myself! Because why not!  KD: Brodie calm down with all that. Just play basketball, man. Cut the act.  Curry: I ain’t picking him. I wanna win.  Westbrook: What you say!?! I’ll play you 1-on-1 right now!  LeBron: Chill y’all! Damn! Russ. Let’s go Brodie. We hooping.  Silver: Curry, your next pick, please.  Thompson: Sucks. It’s a beautiful, sunny day outside and I’m stuck in here.  Curry: Draymond.  LeBron: I’ll take Jimmy Butler.  Curry: Karl-Anthony Towns.  LeBron: Kristaps Porzingis.  Curry: Victor Oladipo.  Draymond: Oh, we about to destroy y’all!  KD: Bet a rack.  Draymond: Bet 5 racks.  KD: Done. Easy money.  LeBron: D-Wade. Where D-Wade at?  Silver: You are only allowed to select from the current crop of All-Stars.  LeBron: What?! I’m the King! I can pick my brother if I want!  Chris Paul: Well actually, Bron, as the president of the players association, I can confirm that the agreement was only current All-Stars.  LeBron: Why would you even agree to that? You know I gotta have my guys with me.  CP: That’s not true. I believe in you bro. You can do anything.  Curry: It’s you can do ALL things. If you gone steal my slogan, at least get it right.  Kyrie: But didn’t you steal it from the Bible, though?  Curry: It’s not stealing if it’s from the Bible.  Silver: LeBron, please make your next selection.  LeBron: John Wall.  Curry: This one for The Town. Give me Dame.  LeBron: Giiiiiive meeeee … LA.  Kyrie: See! I knew you was going to the Lakers!  Paul George: Let’s goooooooooooo!  LeBron: Chill out! I meant give me LaMarcus Aldridge! Geez.  Curry: Bradley Beal.  LeBron: I see what you’re doing. Trying to load up on shooters?  Curry: (*whispers*) And a little light recruiting.  LeBron: Kyle Lowry.  Curry: OK, last pick. Hmmmm. This is tough.  I’ma close my eyes and throw my mouthpiece. Whoever I hit is my pick.  Embiid: But I thought you only threw it at refs and fans.  Draymond: You’re not allowed to talk until you make the playoffs.  Curry: It was a joke. Relax. Give me Kev … no, give me Al Horford.  Kevin Love: Dammit, Steph! C’mon bro! I promise I won’t lock you up on the perimeter ever again.  Wall to Beal: Look at Kyrie over there cracking up.  Beal: Hilarious.  Wall: I bet he’s so glad he’s out of that mess.  Beal: Must feel good. Tops in the East. Free from his ball-dominant co-star who tries to control everything. He’s living the life.  Wall: Riiiight … wait, what you trying to say???  LeBron: Give me CP. I ain’t taking K-Love.  Silver: Again, you can only pick current All-Stars.  LeBron: HE’S THE GREATEST POINT GUARD EVER. How is he not an All-Star this year???  CP: It’s cool. Me, Trevor Ariza and Gerald Green got somewhere to go anyway.  Blake Griffin: You sure you don’t want a go-to guy like Lou Williams?  Curry: Let him have CP. He is All-Star worthy.  Silver: The coaches did not vote him in. I can’t allow it.  LeBron: Not surprised. I never get any calls in this league anymore.  Curry: All right, I’ll take Kevin Love as my final pick.  LeBron: You can have him. Al Horford, let’s go.  Horford: Great. I’m on the top seed in the East and the last pick? Do I get a prize or something?  Harden: You get to win. Look at our squad.  Thompson: We about to light it up. We’ve got the best shooters on the globe.  Kyrie: Well, actually, it’s not a …  Butler: Let it go, Ky. Just let it go.  "
I was reportedly upset that Kevin Durant did not sign with the Heat.
Kevin Durant for JR Smith 
I mean Kevin Durant has become very unlikable to me.
"I think Jarrett Allen has crazy potential. He's already good enough to be a starter, in my opinion, and he's 19 years old. It's so rare to see a 19 year old executing complicated plays, blocking veterans like Kevin Durant, grabbing boards over Drummond, calmly making free throws during overtime, and other such things. Imagine him when he's 27. He'll be unstoppable. All he needs is more strength and experience."
Dumb is acting like there's nothing you can do about Kevin Durant dropping 35 PPG on almost .70 TS% against you.   They should probably trade for guys that (unlike Crowder) actually are two-way-players who can guard on the wing and switch to guards. But the first step has to be the realization that you can't just go out and outscore the Warriors.  Edit: And also create a scheme to hide IT like Boston did if you aren't going to trade him. But you need other capable defenders for that.
Kevin Durant when he encounters IT
Fuck the Mods Fuck Kevin Durant Fuck Steph Curry 
"OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Brazilian Kevin Durant"
Bravo to Kevin Durant. I have always liked this guy and i know he has had a very short fuse with the media and refs lately but good on him for owning up to being a dick to the ref. Fuck anyone who defended him being an asshole last night.
"&gt;been the best player at his position   &gt;&gt;&gt;   Literally nothing wrong with this quote, idk why these hateful children out here trying to make a big deal out of it. PG13 is Westbrook's teammate, and many others believes this as well. People really think opinions from kids on r/nba is the majority?  No, it's not even 2% of the real world population. Chill   &gt;&gt;&gt;   Westbrook can annihilate any other point guard 1 on 1, he can just bully any other point guard. Many people thinks he's the best player in the point guard position, so what? He's indeed the most explosive athlete in his prime right now in the NBA. He knows this, PG13 knows this, most other players know this as well.   Hell, even Kevin Durant have said countless times that Russel Westbrook is the best player in his position, before he turned snake.    &gt;&gt;&gt;   So Paul George thinking he's the best in his position, or Westbrook himself thinking that, or anyone else thinking that, is totally normal. Just because you think something is abnormal doesn't actually make it abnormal, i think most people out here think their own perspective and opinion means everything, when it really doesn't.    &gt;&gt;&gt;   Some people out here might be shocked, like *how can Westbrook think he's better than Curry who won 2 MVP's and championships and all etc""..   &gt;&gt;&gt;   Well, how do i put it as nicely as possible... So like, people like Westbrook or *most* other superstar athlete really don't give a shit about what kids on r/nba or twitter or youtube or instagram says about them, they don't care how ya'll rank him as a player, they don't care how ESPN or Bleacher Report rank them as a player, most of them don't even know any of you exist. Players like that and fans or haters on the internet totally lives in a different bubble, different world. Some of ya'll need to understand that shit.   &gt;&gt;&gt;   If a professional athlete who is also a superstar, believes they can destroy someone head to head, 1 on 1, mainly because they are physically superior and have elite skills too on both ends of the floor etc, they will believe and know they are indeed the better player, even if kids on social media don't agree with that, it really don't matter.    &gt;&gt;&gt;   If professional athletes really took anyone on social media or the internet seriously, their opinions, rankings, comments, anything seriously, then people like Skip Bayless would have been dead in a ditch long time ago.     &gt;&gt;&gt;   News flash, the players don't give a shit about faceless names on the internet ranking them or hating on them, and opinions on r/nba doesn't mean anything, many people thinks he's better than Curry as a player. Is he more accomplished? NO. But is he a better player that can destroy Curry or any other point guard head to head, 1 on 1? Yes, many people and real players think that. Simple.   Get over it sweethearts"
"Wb can win a championship. Give him 3 other all stars like Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant. "
Can't believe Rick Barnes led teams with Kevin Durant and LaMarcus Aldrige and couldn't get a championship.
"He's seen too many ""Kevin Durant is a bitch"" posts and wanted to prove everyone wrong by yelling at old men a quarter of his size"
"I'll do you one better and not only give you ""seasons of players in the modern era [I] think are truly better than Lillard last year"" that were not All-Stars that season, but I'll also give you players in the modern era who have had comparable seasons to Dame that were also not All-Stars that year:  Better that season than Dame last year:  * DeMarcus Cousins averaged 23p 12r 3a 2s 1b and wasn't an All-Star in '14  * Kevin Durant averaged 25p 7r 3a 1s 1b and wasn't an All-Star in '09  * Deron Williams averaged 19p 3r 11a 1s and wasn't an All-Star in '08  * Deron Williams also averaged 19p 3r 11a 1s and wasn't an All-Star in '09  * Al Jefferson averaged 23p 11r 2a 1s 2b and wasn't an All-Star in '09  * Elton Brand averaged 21p 9r 3a 1s 2b and wasn't an All-Star in '07  * Pau Gasol averaged 21p 10r 3a 1s 2b and wasn't an All-Star in '07  * Carmelo Anthony averaged 27p 5r 3a 1s and wasn't an All-Star in '06  * Elton Brand also averaged 20p 10r 3a 1s 2b and wasn't an All-Star in '05  * Elton Brand also averaged 20p 10r 3a 1s 2b and wasn't an All-Star in '04  * Tim Duncan averaged 22p 11r 2a 1s 3b and wasn't an All-Star in '99  * Grant Hill averaged 21p 7r 6a 2s 1b and wasn't an All-Star in '99  * Jason Kidd averaged 17p 7r 11a 2s and wasn't and All-Star in '99  * Rod Strickland averaged 18p 5r 11a 2s and wasn't an All-Star in '98  * Kevin Johnson averaged 20p 4r 11a 2s and wasn't an All-Star in '92.  * Hakeem Olajuwon averaged 21p 14r 2a 2s 4b and wasn't an All-Star in '91  * Michael Adams averaged 27p 4r 11a 2s and wasn't an All-Star in '91  * Kevin Johnson also averaged 20p 4r 12a 2s and wasn't an All-Star in '89   * John Stockton averaged 15p 3r 14a 3s and wasn't an All-Star in '88  * Dominique Wilkins averaged 27p 7r 3a 2s 1b and wasn't an All-Star in '85  Comparable season to Dame:  * Monta Ellis averaged 26p 4r 5a 2s and wasn't an All-Star in '10  * Monta Ellis averaged 24p 4r 6a 2s and wasn't an All-Star in '11  * Michael Redd averaged 27p 4r 2a 1s and wasn't an All-Star in '07  * Antwan Jamison averaged 25p 9r 2a 1s and wasn't an All-Star in '01  * Paul Pierce averaged 25p 6r 3a 2s 1b and wasn't an All-Star in '01  * Damon Stoudamire averaged 20p 4r 9a 2s and wasn't an All-Star in '97  * Tim Hardaway averaged 20p 3r 9a 1s and wasn't an All-Star in '95  * Dale Ellis averaged 25p 6r 3a 1s and wasn't an All-Star in '87   * Dale Ellis averaged 26p 5r 3a 1s and wasn't an All-Star in '88  * Kiki Vanderweghe averaged 27p 3r 3a 1s and wasn't an All-Star in '87  * Purvis Short averaged 28p 5r 3a 2s and wasn't an All-Star in '85  * Mark Aguirre averaged 26p 6r 3a 1s and wasn't an All-Star in '85  * David Thompson averaged 26p 4r 3a 1s 1b and wasn't an All-Star in '81  And if you go back before the ""modern era"" (which I presumed began with Magic and Bird in 1980), there were players with stats as/more impressive than Dame's that were not All-Stars:  * World B Free averaged 29p 4r 4a 1s and wasn't an All-Star in '79  * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar averaged 26p 13r 4a 2s 3b and wasn't an All-Star in '78  * Pete Maravich averaged 26p 5r 5a 1s and wasn't an All-Star in '76  * Nate Archibald averaged 28p 3r 9a and wasn't an All-Star in '72  * Nate Thrumond averaged 22p 20r 3a and wasn't an All-Star in '69 "
"Not down with the media (The Ringer) turning the nickname into a title. Because honestly, the only person who's a true unicorn is Kevin Durant, who's the one who christened it to KP."
"If we're ignoring the youth factor that usually comes into play with this title.. In terms of the pure fuckery of the combination between frame and skillset, Kevin Durant is by far the best unicorn player in the nba."
"just thinking aloud. what if Kevin Durant says after the all star break: ""this season in Golden State will be my last, next year I will sign with the worst team in the league."" Imagine the tanking that would go on lol! Michael Beasley, shoot 60 times a game!"
"The real way to fix the All-Star game is to split the teams up young guys vs old. Old guys won't roll over and give the younger generation bragging rights and the young guys would have something to prove.    Young Bloods:  Starters: Kyrie, Klay, Giannis, Davis, Embiid  Bench: Dame, Wall, Beal, Olidipo, Draymond, Porzingis, KAT   Vets:  Starters: Steph, Harden, LeBron, Durant, Boogie  Bench: Westbrook, Lowry, Derozan, Jimmy Buckets, Aldridge, Kevin Love, Hortford "

"Kevin ""the servant"" Durant"
"Heard about Hollywood divas who are pain to work with but everyone tolerates them because of their track record. Same with basketball, players know they can act like this and the only repercussion is get ejected and a pay a small fine (small for them), unlike us in the real world, act like this and get fired.   Think about it if you are the GSW owner are you gonna fire Kevin fucking Durant just because he was mouthing off at the refs. "
"Worse than Kevin ""the minion"" Durant ?"
Kevin Durani is the long lost cousin of Kevin Durant. 
"How do you expect Cavs (or anyone else) to beat the 73 wins Warriors when they add FUCKING KEVIN DURANT. Cavs team definitely reached their potential. If it weren't for KD signing, they probably have a better shot at more rings."
"Lebron with the first pick: ""I'm taking my boy Kevin... Durant!"""
"You sound triggered and really salty. We aren't arguing who's the better player. I don't think all-star voting should take into account if you are ""getting acclimated to the team"" or if he's going to get better.  You can't consider one person a star player and another person a role player if they are putting up pretty much the same stats.   If you want to say that only Kevin Durant and Steph Curry are the star players on the Warriors team, then only Westbrook is the star player on the Thunder team. It doesn't matter if Paul George was a star player on Indiana. That's not who he is with the Thunder.  Don't get all pissy just because your opening argument that Paul George is a star player and Klay Thompson is a role player is bogus."
"&gt; Kevin Durant, who believes his buddy from DC never “got a fair chance.’’  KD is the only guy in the world who thinks an NBA #2 pick is not given enough opportunities in the league.   Or, you know, Beasley jeopardized his own development by persistently abusing weed to the extent of getting checked into rehab and missing practices. I'm glad he's balling now, but Beasley squandered his own talent during the best years for his development."
michael jordan vs kevin durant-lite
Khris Middleton vs Jaylen Brown was feeling like Kevin Durant vs Kevin Durant today
I'm pretty neutral on Kevin Durant
The Brazillian Kevin Durant and our lord and saviour Lucas Bebe Nogueira 
"Lincoln: Well did you at least free the slaves?    Klay: Well I freed this guy, his name’s Kevin.    Durant: Hi Mr. President.    Lincoln: So you got high off hemp rope, went to the wrong state, burned the wrong city, and managed to only free one slave?    Klay: Yeah pretty much.    Lincoln: Congratulations you’ve just been promoted to supreme commander of the United Stares military.    Klay: Dope."
if only kevin durant went to the wiz as planned
"I don't care about your blatant bias and excuses, did you even watch before Kevin Durant joined?"
* Grizzlies: Zach Randolph * Magic: Shaquille O'Neal * Nuggets: Carmelo Anthony * Pelicans: Anthony Davis * Raptors: Demar Derozan * Thunder: Kevin Durant 
"I'm not under estimating Bird, I'm accounting for longevity. KD was also better than Bird earlier and had a higher ceiling based on their PPG. Bird was a better playmaker than Kevin Durant will ever be. However, (and I'm saying this as a LeBron fan) we may have never seen a scorer like KD. Bird had 6 peak years. KD has been at his peak since averaging 30 his 3rd year and still has 3-4 more years left in it."
Isn't Kevin Durant listed at an inaccurate height so he wouldn't be considered/played as a PF while entering the draft.
"lol. Aldridge was getting doubled consistently and passing out to teammates, they just couldn't hit their shots. He got 34 points on 21 shots and 12 FTs and had more than one important offensive rebound. Aldridge is our most important defensive player too, though Draymond's obviously better.  It's a hell of a lot easier to look better when you have Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant on your team.  Also, when has Pop ever done anything more with less talent in the playoffs?"
"Let's be real for a moment... Dipo was lost because Russ Westbrook. While Russ is an amazing talent, he does not enhance anyone around him IMO. He is a prolific point guard, but he also binds his offense because he is the primary everything. Dipo could have been what he is now with the Pacers if Westbrook didn't strangle the offense.  OKC's biggest fault to be is first, believing in Kevin Martin when he was on the wrong side of 30 and second, for assuming Lamb could ever even match what Harden brought. OKC wasn't going to lose Harden, they just had to pay him was all. Instead they went the opposite of the Warriors and went for depth and to pay premium prices for ""glue guys"" or some low end role players. Durant, Westbrook, Harden would have beat on the west 3 years ago. They would have gotten a title."
Kevin Durant does bring the ball up. And also people who operate off the ball (aka Kevin love) are not independent shot creators 
Til everyone who doesn't bring the ball up isn't a shot creator. Someone should tell Kevin Durant that. Jesus 
Steph is a regular season phenom that had a massive helping hand at winning 2 rings because of injury to the cavs and kevin durant joining. Stop trying to put him next to magic fucking johnson for the love of god 
"They went 16-1 in the playoffs last year and everyone still constantly underestimates this team somehow. They went 73-9 and then added Kevin Durant. It's the best team of all-time, and it's not even that close imo. "
"I mean, there’s the whole joke about him not being able to bench the bar at the combine.   You forget he hasn’t always been adult Kevin Durant and one of the best basketball players on earth. He was an awkward teen once, dealing with who knows what kind ridicule.  "
Kawhi has been an mvp finalist for the last 3 years and came in second during his 67 win season. He led this 7th seed team to the WCF last year. He's been all nba defense and all nba first team in the same time. He's always going to be an mvp finalist and now Curry and Westbrook are out of the way. Westbrook already took the triple double anomaly away and Curry can't win it anymore with Kevin Durant there. 
"I guess you’ll just have to make due with only Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green."
Kevin Durant is a person that exists. 
Kevin Durant would like me to tell you that it's kyle anderson
"Well brotha I’ll stop you right there. Kevin Durant will never in my opinion or the opinion of anyone who matters or knows what they are talking about, be considered the GOAT. That is reserved for MJ KOBE and LBJ... but Kevin is like..... the most perfect basketball player I have ever seen. I literally see no holes in his game... and as much as I love the three mentioned. I could find some holes if I looked. But with KD... he could literally do it all. Except like you said. Lead a team. But everything else is virtually perfect "
I like Kevin Durant
"So happy there is a serious thread.  It's great to see Klay heat up after a slow start for the game and finish blazing hot like last game.   Kevin Durant needs to drive more, or atleast chuck 3's less. There's times you see him dribbling the ball down the court trying to subtly move to that wing 3 area, and you just know he's gonna launch it 8 seconds into the shot clock. I'm not sure if those are the cause of some of our stretches where we just have no ball movement, or if that's his attempt to get us out of the rut we have gotten in from other means. He also pulls up for those elbow jumpers and he makes them enough to quiet me but it still irks me he takes such crappy shots some times.  Kyle Anderson is not a 3 point shooter. He's got hitch there and it was not looking good. Danny Green, what happened? Dude was solid like 2 or 3 years ago.  LMA is the Spurs best player, offensively especially. Javale slowed him in game 1, and game 2 he got a lot more open looks or matchups against Draymond. This game was the most I expect out of LMA and I don't think anyone else on the spurs is capable of stepping up offensively enough to help LMA win it on that end of the floor. Warriors in 4 imo, maybe 5 if the Spurs host a defensive clinic and play an absolute grinder against us.    I'm sleepy."
"Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, a slew of role-players. They are a very scrappy bunch."
I dislike Kevin Durant.
"It’s a valid point. The warriors have set up nearly everything the same as the spurs (drafted nearly all their core players, set up a winning culture, created a working system, winning coach etc etc) but everybody hates them.   There’s really no good reason for people to hate them legitimately. And if your reason is that they have Kevin Durant, that’s dumb because everybody wants Durant. "
~~Kevin Durant~~ Klay Thompson
"I was watching an engaging game of basketball on ESPN when halftime ended. I rose to go to the bathroom, when the television cut to Kevin Durant dunking over a player. In truth, I can't even remember which player it was as I was so enamored with Kevin. His nappy, black hair, the beautiful, radiant asymmetry of his pubic facial beardage, his serenading voice wafting over me like a gentle morning mist, his laugh as he interacted with the faceless player, all of it sent a wave of blood surging straight toward my chivalrous shaft. I sprinted to the bathroom and released my passion as I thought of Kevin and his shimmering jumpshot. Since then, all my thoughts have been of Kevin. I imagine us canoeing down a lazy river, talking about our families and our pasts, about our childhood friends and our hopes for the future, and him smiling at me as a spark begins to develop between us. I imagine myself gently reaching my hand toward his chin and tilting it down toward me, then brushing his hair from his crown to his forehead. As my fantasy digresses, I imagine us pulling up to the corner, our scoring appetites engulfing us, and I begin to remove his hesitations until I see his beautiful pull-up jimbo in all of its glory. We engage in ludicrous, uninhibited sexual adventures, each of us reveling in the pleasure an passion of each other's company. This is only one example of the frequent and diverse fantasies that enter my skull. Each day, I spend long periods of time thinking of him that I would have otherwise devoted to activities that I can now only describe as mundane, such as watching snake documentaries or playing video games. I watch every game that he is a part of that I possibly can, desperate to catch glimpses of him, as my mental images neither suffice or do him justice. I can no longer function without Kevin. I need him. Oh, how bittersweet the thoughts are, for I know they will never come to fruition! Anyway, just something I wanted to share."
"Game summary:  1st half: What beautiful gritty basketball by the Spurs, intercepting the passing lanes, getting to the line, abusing the post, and driving hard to the basket. This team is utilizing old school basketball to the finest and they're up by 4.   2nd half: Kevin Durant with a hand in his face, BANG, another three pointer! Warriors up by double digits."
"Klay ""Kevin Durant"" Thompson."
I’m here for the downvotes. Kevin Durant is a basketball god. 
"I think I speak for everyone when I say,   #FUCK KEVIN DURANT"
I mean...Spurs without their best player and their best shot at slowing Kevin Fucking Durant.  
Kevin Durant is so unfair. Why did you have to go to the warriors you motherfuck
"Kevin ""Steph Curry"" Durant"
Lamarcus is the black Kevin Durant 
"What does this change? The refs literally don’t care. On b-ball breakdown on YouTube a former red even said they know they just don’t call it. Kawhi does it, lebron does it, Kevin Durant carries, Kyrie carries, what is the point of this post? And also the post that says it’s not. The refs aren’t gonna say “oh well reddit said so now we gotta enforce” "
Kevin Durant needs to go to Curry's hair doctor before it's too late :( 
"I always thought that Durant should sponser some super cheesy deodorant commercials. ""Hi, I'm Kevin Durant, and I only use Deo-Durant brand deodorant, fucking buy it."" I would. "
"While we're at halftime. Can we appreciate that pop is up at the half in the playoffs against a team with 3 all stars, including kevin fucking durant, a DPOY, and one of the best shooters the game has ever seen, with a pretty decent supporting cast?   And all he's basically got is a 32 year old LaMarcus Aldridge (who's doing great this year btw), and some old/inexperienced g-league level/past their prime role players?   Dude's a living legend and he's going to be gone soon. As basketball fans, let's appreciate. "
Kevin Durant is getting soft blog boy calls out here. 
Anyone else hate Kevin Durant??? Hes such a stupid bitch man. Thinks hes all that for joining the best team in the world

"Look at Kevin Durant. This isn't even jumping on the hate train, I love the dude as a player. But if carrying was called he would not be able to move with the ball without turning it over. "
Kevin Durant 
Ft. Kevin Durant.
Strong work Livingston.  Why give the all to the future hall of famer Kevin Durant when you can just iso up and air ball 3 feet from the rim?
Kevin Harlan I guarantee kevin Durant did not knock that in 
so i see danny green did not grow 4 inches and kevin durant is still good. but i thought pop was a master of adjustments? what a bum.
"Haha, I quoted KAT's high school interview with Kevin Durant where he basically had word salad"
same.  olynyk reminding me a lot of Kevin Durant
These articles get dumber and dumber as they continue to ignore the root issue. He's injured and there's nothing to be gained from him playing injured. Do they think an injured kawhi is going to shut down kevin durant or put up 50? It makes no difference one way or the other. 
"[KD used an analytics guy](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1615870-kevin-durant-hires-analytics-expert-checks-lebron-james-stats-every-game) to make sure he was taking better shots when he was in OKC. I think KD is bullshitting there.  They say that, but heaps of vets have added a 3pt shot so they can still be effective in today's league."
"Kevin Durant also said something similar on Bill Simmons' podcast, and so did Jalen Rose during the last Sloan conference. I think it's safe to say actual players don't like analytics."
"The Warriors actually match up a little better than the Blazers do. Draymond does mean things to AD and then Klay has a legit size advantage over Jrue, who while being a great 1 on 1 defender, would have more trouble chasing Klay around 30 screens. And then there's Kevin fucking Durant and I wouldn't feel so good about E'Twaun Moore or Mirotic on him. If AD guards him, which I'm not sure is the best way to go, that leaves a center open and none of your other guys are guarding Javale who will be camped out at the rim"
"It seems a lot of the greats nickname themselves:  **Lebron ""King"" James** - came pre-NBA and supposedly self-coordinated.  **Michael ""Air Jordan"" Jordan** - came when with his Air Jordan brand release which was probably approved by him on some level.  **Cash ""Legal Tender"" Considerations** - while that nickname never came from $CON's own mouth. It was tattooed on his body. So that counts.  **Kevin ""The Servant"" Durant** - Self-served when reporters asked him what he wanted his nickname to be instead of the much cooler sounding ""Slim reaper""  Fun note: Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr. changed his legal name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar."
"I'm not entirely sure I agree, at least in the case of Tatum. I truly believe he can be a top 10 player. I wanted to compare Tatum’s rookie year to other wing/guard players who played the majority of their rookie season as a teenager. Here is a list of some of the better players, (in no particular order):  1. Lebron James  2. Kobe Bryant  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. Tracy McGrady  5. Carmelo Anthony  6. Kyrie Irving  7. Bradley Beal  8. Kevin Durant  9. Tony Parker  Here are some stats and where Tatum ranks among these guys and their rookie numbers:  FG% = 1st  3P% = 1st  TS% = 1st  eFG% = 1st  WS = 1st  VORP = 3rd  BPM = 3rd  ORTG = 1st  DRTG = 2nd  TOV% = 1st  These stats give me confidence that Tatum can be a top 10 player. Most of those guys are/were top 10 players in their primes. Tatum is a plus defender that can shoot the lights out. He spent most of his rookie season as a teenager and almost got a 20/10 game in his first every playoff game.   I will admit that Simmons and Embiid are the better prospects, but it is hard for me to disbelieve that Tatum won't be a top 10 player.   I also believe that Brown will be a perennial all-star. Brown plays excellent defense and has been a pretty darn good shooter. His play-making needs work, but he's also only 21. I'm less convinced of Brown, but Brown still ups his game in the playoffs.   All that to say, it's not illogical to think that at least one of these guys will be a top 10 player, while the other one is an all-star potential type player. "
"Ehhh they didnt really focus away from Kobe that series that whole series Shaq got one on one treatment. The Pistons whole plan was to treat Shaq one on one and focus help elsewhere while letting Shaq get his.  It's why inspite of how good his stats were that series he probably should have been even more aggressive.   All of this is besides the point though. IF you want to talk about him not having enough options to help him......in 2012 that clearly wasnt the case. Nobody would call having Kevin Durant and Russell WEstbrook ""not having guys who can relieve offensive duty from you"". "
Kevin Durant 
"Being debatably the best player on a championship team makes someone a generational talent imo.  Let’s look at all the championship teams since 2000 and the best player on each team.  16-17 Golden State Warriors: Curry and Durant 15-16 Cleveland Cavaliers: LeBron James 14-15 Golden State Warriors: Curry  13-14 San Antonio Spurs: Kawhi  12-13 Miami Heat: LeBron James 11-12 Miami Heat: LeBron James 10-11 Dallas Mavericks: Dirk 09-10 LA Lakers: Kobe 08-09 LA Lakers: Kobe 07-08 Boston Celtics: Kevin Garnett (All of the Big Three) 06-07 San Antonio Spurs: Tim Duncan 05-06 Miami Heat: Dwayne Wade 04-05 San Antonio Spurs: Tim Duncan 03-04 Detroit Pistons: Team Effort 02-03 San Antonio Spurs: Duncan 01-02 La Lakers: Shaq and Kobe 00-01 LA Lakers: Shaq and Kobe 99-00 LA Lakers: Shaq and Kobe  The only teams on this list I wouldn’t consider to have generational talents leading the team are the 03-04 Pistons, the 05-06 Heat, 07-08 Celtics, the 10-11 Mavericks, and the 13-14 Spurs.  One thing each of the teams have in common is that they only won one championship with the same player leading the team.  After looking at this I would change my opinion of a generational talent to someone who is the best player on a championship team two or more times."
Not Kevin Durant 
1) There's a reason why I said THIS year. I didnt say anything about 2015: Jrue Holiday wasnt as good defensively then as he is now.   2) It's almost as if Holiday didnt really guard Curry that Game. Only spent 13 of his 84 poss on him that night.    https://stats.nba.com/game/0021700346/matchups/?OFF_PLAYER_ID=&amp;DEF_PLAYER_ID=201950  Look at who he did guard that game:   Kevin Durant: 39 poss 10 points 4/11 shooting 2 TO   Jrue Holiday at his size holding Durant to that actually only adds to my point. 
The frustrating part for me is that Lue can’t adjust. We really did run a good defense in the 2016 Finals. Pretty much smothered Curry and Klay as much as possible and forced the other guys to hit shots. But then in the 2017 Finals he tried the exact same strategy (complete with RJ playing big minutes again despite being a shell of his 2016 self) even though the Warriors added Kevin Durant and were a radically different team as a result. The result was us getting run off the floor in 5 and KD having a monster series
"He's been doing it all year  https://stats.nba.com/player/201950/matchups/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Defense&amp;sort=POSS&amp;dir=1  Look at his data when matched up vs guys like Dennis Schroder, John Wall, Kemba Walker, Kyrie Irving, Tyreke Evans etc.   He's also as versatile as they come; the number of guys who night to night guard anybody from Kyrie Irving to Kevin Durant is way way smaller than people think. The vast majority of guys with good defensive reputations whom you would assume just spend the whole game guarding anybody 1-3 dont actually usually do that. "
"Covington actually spent more time guarding 1's and 2's this year than Simmons. 56% of his poss vs 41% for Simmons   https://public.tableau.com/profile/knarsu3#!/vizhome/DefensivePositions/Dashboard1  Both guys can guard 1-4. Simmons though spends more time on 4's and can guard 5's like Al Horford when asked.   https://stats.nba.com/player/1627732/matchups/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season  https://stats.nba.com/player/203496/matchups/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Defense  In terms of ""guarding the best scorer"" it depends on matchup. Ben Simmons took Russell Westbrook, Tobias HArris, Steph Curry, Harrison Barnes, and Jrue Holiday more than Covington this year. Covington took more of Kevin Durant, CJ McCollum, Goran Dragic, DeMar DeRozan, Kmeba Walker, Victor Oladipo and Devin Booker this year when they played. "
"Kevin Durant, Clint Capela, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo. "
Lol terrible defense. My dude had to guard fuckin Kevin Durant. You know how difficult that is?
"Kevin Durant  reasoning: shook bitch, probably will give up easy"
"Something to consider : true shooting career percentages... Kobe Bryant:55% James Harden 61%, Stephen Curry:62%. Michael Jordan 58% Kevin Durant:62%. Those are my top 5 scorers of all time. Obviously, kd, MJ and Kobe are better overall players than the other two and are more versatile scorers, but I still think when taking into account overall scoring ability and efficiency, Curry and Harden do deserve to be considered all time great scorers along with the other three. "
Kevin Durant just joined the warriors
Who is Kevin Durant? is he that guy that Westbrook was carrying all those years? Paul George was always better than that guy...whatever happened to Durant anyway?

Kevin Durant is the best example of an unstoppable scorer imo. He's just so tall and lengthy that he can shoot over everyone and his jumpshot is fucking wet. 
did kevin durant also die?
Kevin Durant?????
"Kevin Durant is the GOAT, you are right sir "
"kevin, 35, D... all in the same post.   Kevin Durant secret reddit account confirmed"
"Honestly, Westbrook just doesn’t feel like a ‘main man’ type dude. He needs a Kevin Durant or a Paul George to lead the team while he tries to remain versatile."
See Kevin Durant (pretty sure there's a reference/article about it somewhere too)
Yes! We just need Kevin Durant to join our team and we'd be fine
It seems to be he saw Isaiah play through an injury he shouldn't have and look terrible the next season. I don't get why the Spurs didn't shut him down sooner though.  If I remember correctly Kevin Durant back in 2015 when he had his foot injury could have played through it. But the team choose to shut him down for his health.
Scrubs don't even have Kevin Durant to fall back on. 
"Lebron’s pre free throw routine is different. When did he change? He used to shimmy a little, like Kevin durant  He didn’t do it on the last 3 he missed and didn it on the last one he made."
Kevin Durant would never let his team score only 14 in the first.  
Kevin Durant is a blog boy
"""It was my favorite place to come home to"" Durant continued, ""after a long day.""  ""In the summertime, you could hear the birds chirp as dawn came. And in the evening, the cicadas would rock you to sleep. With his arms wrapped around me, I felt safe. It was just me and my Dion. Us against the world.""  ""In Fall, we would play basketball on the court behind the mansion. His sweat-drenched back, up against my stomach, as I draped over him. And soon, we were on the court, naked up against each other. With my back on the warm pavement of center court, he mounted and entered me. Over and over again, he thrust inside me, each deeper than the last. Faster and faster until he let out a masculine moan. 'And one', as he burst inside me. I was forever his Kevin."""
"Nutrition, medicine, training from a younger age, gameplans, etc have all improved drastically in the last 20 years and will continue to improve for the forseeable future.  If you told people in the 1980s about players like KD, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Anthony Davis, etc they would think you were crazy. A 7 footer that can handle the ball, guard pretty much anybody in the league and shoots over 40% from 3? That didn't exist in the 1980s but today we have Kevin Durant.  Also to think a lot of professional athletes aren't on some form of PEDs is naive."
"Not sure which prime line-up I'd rather have:  James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant  or  Kyrie Irving, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, LeBron James, Kevin Love"
"Oh I thought we were agreeing to pretend he never happened. ""The next Kevin Durant"""
Like Kevin Durant?
Except “Westbrook’s man” has blatantly admitted to *actual* stat-padded heaves.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/1526943-kevin-durant-claims-he-wont-always-shoot-high-risk-buzzer-beater-shots.amp.html  And “Westbrook’s man” never once mentioned Russ as a reason for leaving.   Bitch. 
"you can also just cheer for kevin durant who's on the warriors. call him the underdog, ""with or without steph, he might not be able to win with those cats"""
"Look, I get that it's not an easy job, especially trying to get cooperation out of a guy who is notorious for disliking interviews and who just lost a playoff game.  But honestly, Pop will answer a question if it's an actual question of substance.  I also get that people make mistakes. If this particular journalist doesn't ask questions like that often, then it really is no big deal. I'm commenting more on a fairly systemic habit the media has of asking low-content questions.  As for your question, how would I feel? I'd feel good because I'd come ready with appropriate questions rather than ""Coach, uh, you started Danny Green, basically, on Kevin, was that, uh, I mean, did that work very well?"" Anyone with a brain would perceive that as either unprepared or arrogant. How about ""any insight into adjustments you can make to better guard Kevin Durant heading into game 2?"" There, write it down and read it word for word at the postgame."
"Oh it’s definitely close, I don’t think even the biggest Nowitzki fan will say it’s a landslide or clear margin. While Garnett is unarguably better on the defensive end, what Nowitzki has done offensively, how he changed the game (We talk about Dirk Nowitzki types, not Kevin Garnett types... the one legged fadeaway jumpers other superstars have adopted, he single handedly changed the perception of European players, the sustained longevity, much longer peak than KG... he will surpass Wilt and Jordan in the all time scoring list ffs...) and the magical 2011 title run where the Mavs buzzsaw swept the defending champion Lakers, the Durant-Westbrook-Harden Thunder and the Superteam Heat, where Nowitzki was the best player on the court during the series has to clinch it for Dirk no doubt. To use a boxing analogy, a victory by decision, by a couple points, but a unanimous one IMO."
"""Kevin Durant. He played like a Danny Green that was 4-5 inches taller and could jump higher and move faster."""
"The guy literally asked a professional of the game, and the leading expert on why things happened on the court and possibly the reasons behind them happening, ""what went wrong for you guys tonight?"".  Is he meant to go in there instead and say ""Hey Pop, when i was watching the game tonight i couldn't help but feel a Kafka-esque trial unfolding before me while i watched the apparent helplessness of your wing defenders in stopping Kevin Durant. Would you agree?""  People say shit like ""reporters asking dumb questions like 'What went wrong' deserve answers like 'we lost'"" without having any god damn notion that journalism is about asking open-ended questions to experts on a particular subject or event."
"It is astonishing how stupid you are. Kevin Durant never said that, he  signed with the Warriors because Steph Curry is a better player than Russell Westbrook. The team was 73-9 because Steph Curry is a better player than Russell Westbrook. "
"yes Hassan Whiteside is better than Joel Embiid. That's why Erik Spoelstra who's one of the best coaches in the NBA, only could play Whiteside for 12 mins in a game vs Embiid's backups. You're smart. Also you know who else doesnt think Westbrook is better than Steph? Kevin Durant. Thats why he left. He was right. You're badly misusing an outdated advanced statistic to state your case. The heat are a better team with Whiteside not playing https://stats.nba.com/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612748&amp;VsPlayerID=202355&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season"
He took three steps getting position with the ball  The other guy who does that all the time and never gets called is Kevin Durant
"Aight in no particular order: curry, lebron, Durant, klay, Draymond, Kyrie, John wall, beal, Dame, cj, lowlry, derozen, harden, cp3, westbrook, George, LA, Ad, cousins, embiid, Booker, jokic, Adams, Butler, Kat, wiggens, drew holiday, Blake Griffen, dragic, Kevin love. There's others that are close like Carmelo and there are also some injured players that would be better than him if they came back at full strength like Hayward and kawhi etc. You could maybe argue he is a good player but not better than at least #25. He will likely be a better player in a couple years"
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden. Imagine a team with all 3!"
"Even if I agreed with what you’re saying - and I don’t - the big thing is this:  Kevin Durant is a better player than Harden  Chris Paul has had leg injuries throughout the year; there’s just as much a question about his health as there is about Curry  The Warriors have better depth, 2 different Finals MVP winners, a coaching staff who has significant Championship experience, the reigning DPoY, and more all stars. Where is the Rockets advantage? "
"So according to RAPM, Jae crowder is more impactful than Kevin Durant. Interesting. /s"

Yup. Maybe a top 30-40  Edit: also this guy does too http://www.backpicks.com/2018/03/05/backpicks-goat-26-kevin-durant/
"Dear Friends, I implore you that on this night, you root for the Warriors As we play the Pacers tonight, it is the most consequential game for our team in over 24 hours. A win versus the Pacers tonight could put us in a strong position to make the postseason with the same seed and a loss could put us in danger with the same fucking seed. If there is any compassion in you, send us your positive vibes. I’m 12 and have been a Warriors fan since 3 years ago. It means I can remember the excitement I had the first time the team made the playoffs and promptly win the championship. My friend and I rebelliously stayed up hours after our curfew past 9:00 on a sleepover to watch the Warriors play the Cavs in the Bay on a 100in tv screen the year after. I remember the elation of Steph winning the unanimous MVP and the heartbreak of them losing to Lebron and Kyrie in what was supposed to be our year. There is nothing as sweet as playoff basketball and us Dubs have been denied it for too long. For those of us still hanging around since the first time Javale McGee was here, we’ve endured less than 1 fucking year of being in the wilderness. 1 years of watching scrubs like Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson log heavy minutes for us. 69 years of mismanagement by Jerry West and Bob Myers. 420 years of draft blunders like ~~trading Monta Ellis for Andrew Bogut~~ and drafting one point guard in the lottery and it being Steph Curry. 3 years of optimism created from Klay’s toaster or Kevin Durant’s toughest path. We need this. If there is any mercy in you, root for us to end the drought. Sincerely, Dubs Fans "
[Serious] Is Kevin Durant the worst player in the NBA?
&gt;[Does Kevin Durant need Steph Curry to carry him?]( https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/05/nba-mothers-day-kevind-durant-mother-mvp-speech) 
"The options are get talent through the draft, get talent through trades, or sign Free Agents if we want to distill roster moves down to what is possible.  Those are your 3 ways to build or rebuild a team each with their own factors dictating how realistic they are.   Free Agency:   As an example of this, Philadelphia or Memphis or Phoenix could have signed Lebron James but the player himself decided to go to Cleveland and accelerate their rebuild.  Kevin Durant could have went to Orlando or Atlanta, but decided GSW.  A team can pitch a case to a player and clear the cap space necessary for the money they want, but in the end they are at the mercy of the player.   Trading:   Houston traded for James harden when he became available, trading Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, 2 first round picks and a second rounder.  Blake Griffin was also traded to Detroit.  Paul George for Oladipo and Sabonis is obviously here as well.  This method is a way for a team without cap space or otherwise undesirable for free agents to just trade for one.  This does not guarantee the player will sign long term, but can guarantee that player will be on your team for his current contract.  The limiting factor to this method is assets / current value.  You need to give up value whether it's current players, future draft picks, rights, pick swaps, protections, etc.  Salary could also be a factor as you need to pay these players and need to match the money going both ways...and if you plan on trying to sign this piece long term.   Draft:   The draft offers a third way to acquire players.  The only limiting factor is your picks, and each year everyone starts with the same amount (unless of course you traded for more or traded some away).  The whole basis of this ""tanking"" discussion revoles around teams trying to lose to get a better draft pick in this area.  Some players do reject certain teams and such, but the draft offers affordable talent (on rookie deals) that can range from superstars like Lebron James to talent that flames out and doesn't deserve to be in the league.     So when people claim tanking is the only way or the ""only choice"" of course they are over generalizing in a vacuum, but to some teams the draft is the only realistic scenario where they can acquire premium talent consistently.  This offseason it appears the Lakers will be able to help improve their situation with perhaps a signing of Paul George at a minimum.  Memphis is not able to add him even if they offer him a maximum contract.  Perhaps a team like Boston with trade assets will be able to trade for Kawhi Leonard.  Perhaps some other team will be able to put a package together that will improve their talent level while also giving assets to San Antonio that they can turn around and use in the draft themselves.  Only 1 team will get Leonard (if he in fact does get traded, its possible San Antonio hangs up the phone and accepts no offers and resigns him to a supermax).  Maybe another superstar can be traded for like Demarcus Cousins.    The one area EVERY team can use and improve their team instantly is the draft.  It's proven nearly every single pick.  You give a name to the commissioner then instantly you have Markelle Fultz, or Jason Tatum, or Donovan Mitchell, or Michael Jordon, or Shaquille Oneal.  People can have whatever view or argument they want, but it's a universal truth that the draft can help every team regardless of cap space or market size or free agent desirability, and the better the pick you have and the more picks you acquire the better chance you get at hitting a stud with your picks and changing the fortunes of your franchise.   "
I met Kevin Durant after a Ty Dolla Sign concert in Berkeley. He looks even taller in person.
ESPN: Kevin Durant hates children
I am a bot.   Comment Analysis:  Kevin Durant is a snake.  Kevin Durant is a coward for joining a super team.  Dinosaur &gt; Snake  KD makes mad Tech money.  KD makes mad Sponsorship money.  Both players are soft.  Kevin Durant is a bitch.  Analysis complete. This sub has a 92% negative view on Kevin Durant and are a bunch of bitch ass Blog Bois. 
"&gt; In fact, the super max, or ""Designated Veteran Player Extension"", is also called the ""Kevin Durant"" Rule, precisely to make situations like Kevin Durant going to the warriors more difficult.   Even sneked himself. SMH. "
"If Kerr never joined the Warriors, you wouldn't count Draymond among ""the greatest assembly of players in history"". You'd think Iguodala, Livingston and West were washed-up old guys. Kevin Durant probably would have never joined the team too.  Kerr is a victim of his own success."
"Dog, Steph Curry **is** the spacing. He was double-teamed while running PnR with *Kevin Durant* in the *NBA Finals* while *Klay Thompson* was spotting up at the line.  I'm not arguing there isn't spacing from KD and KT, and that even with it he's still getting pressured more than anyone else in the league. There's a reason he has such a huge impact on Hall of Fame-caliber teammates."
"Remember how LeBron gave up last year and let Kevin Durant do whatever he wanted on offense? That's gonna happen again at this point, it's just going to be new faces in the same roles. The offense hasn't really changed, it's the same shit. The rotations are stupid, the offense is way too stagnant and dependent on 3s, and the help defense doesn't exist. Nobody communicates, the best player on the team doesn't set an example when he needs to on defense, and he puts up 20 in the first half, then rounds his numbers out in the 2nd half while not giving half a fuck about playing D or even taking good shots 9/10 times this season. Surely you remember the stretch of him just missing contested 3s for weeks until he finally quit? At least now he isn't doing that, but again he's worrying about a weakness rather than playing to his strengths. "
Kevin did the exact same thing Bosh did: signed as a free agent to another team that would have/already has multiple superstars.  So why is Durant a bitch but not Bosh?
KD is a better scorer and has been for like 10 straight years of amazing performance. But Tmac in his prime for like a year or two there was up on that elite scoring level in an era less reliant on 3 point shots  Take a season and look  look into each of their primes and they are both averaging like 32-7-6 or something so it's definitely closer than we think it is. Tracy just flamed out after a couple years and Kevin Durant is the most consistent scorer ever so it warps out perspective 
Kevin Durant is 
&gt; if a star on their team took a paycut.  I'd wager just about nobody would be criticizing Kevin Durant if he took a paycut to help the Thunder so lets not pretend like its the same thing
"Damian Lillard replacing Steph Curry causes the overwhelming championship favorite to miss the finals? You realize they still have Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green? Curry is far too deified if you really think that's the case"
"Later that night...  Dear Diary, Today I asked Kevin Durant an awesome question. He liked it; he smiled. I was happy I asked a good question. "
I feel like he's gonna be more Tobias Harris then Kevin Durant and some team is gonna be very dissapointed
"According to Basketball Reference's Value over Replacement Player, here's the list of the most productive players from ages 24-30 (athletic prime) over the last 20 years:  |||||| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|From|To|VORP| |1|LeBron James|2009|2015|61.9| |2|Kevin Garnett|2001|2007|53.7| |3|Russell Westbrook|2013|2018|43.5| |4|Tim Duncan|2001|2007|43.1| |5|Dwyane Wade|2006|2012|41.2| |6|Stephen Curry|2013|2018|40.6| |7|Kobe Bryant|2003|2009|39.0| |8|Chris Paul|2010|2016|38.2| |9|James Harden|2014|2018|37.3| |10|Dirk Nowitzki|2003|2009|35.5|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=24&amp;age_max=30&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;year_min=1998&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;order_by=vorp&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#stats) Generated 4/5/2018.  Note that Westbrook and Curry are 29 and Harden is 28.  I was surprised Durant missed the top ten but he did lose time due to injuries.  He's number 11 on the list.  Shaq was 25 in 1998, so he lost a year of his prime.  Even so, he's number 12 on the list."
"Not eligible, due to signing as a free agent to the warriors. The team offering the extension must have originally drafted the player, or obtained him in a trade while he was on his rookie contract. In fact, the super max, or ""Designated Veteran Player Extension"", is also called the ""Kevin Durant"" Rule, precisely to make situations like Kevin Durant going to the warriors more difficult. "
"&gt;It's true though  LOL i know, but it's also true that Bron did beat the 73-9 team in the Finals, and then those cocky ass cats gave on that glorious 73 win team and went crying to Kevin Durant for more help, built a superteam because 3 all stars wasn't enough, they needed 4, to beat LeBron. No team in history ever had 4 all stars, 2 former MVPs, all in their prime in one team. That says A LOT about LeBron's dominance.  &gt;  FYI, if this below average non playoff Lakers team had LeBron, they would be championship contenders over night.  That's LeBron James, and his importance and value is more than everyone in your current Lakers roster combined.   &gt;   Just sating the obvious ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ "
Kevin Durant is probably the best valued player in the league. You aren't gonna get better for cheaper.
"Kids are modeling their shot after Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, not Lonzo Ball."
"As a black man, it's quite easy to have a bad hair day, but I can't understand for the life of me how someone like Kevin Durant can't bother to bring a barber with him. Just go bald."
"interesting fact: among GSW's three best shooters, Kevin Durant is the least efficient one in mid-ranger shooting.."
"But that's the beauty of the model. Let Lebron set the market price for what a ""Max player"" is really worth. If Lebron gets 40 in New York then there is no reason other teams should be paying 40 for Paul George. At which point smaller market teams have a better shot.   Realistically your all NBA tier talent could command well over 50 a year if we're being honest, but then that would lessen the market for other people and cause a market correction. In a world where a team spends 50 mill on Kevin Durant, they can't afford to give someone like Kevin Love or Kyle Lowry 30. However, if Kevin Love still wants his 30 mill a year, he can go to small market team with more flexibility to build a team.   Money talks, I know al lot of the top level athletes have numerous sources of income besides their salary, but maybe your Demar Derozan's, Kemba Walker's and Dame Lillard's will just straight up go to the highest bidder.   The downside to this is that you will inevitably end up with albatross contracts, like what we saw with Antoine Walker, Gilbert Arenas, Jermaine O'neal...the list goes on, but it would at least allow for REAL NEGOTIATIONS between plyers and front offices. I hate the idea that every big market free agent just looks at the landscape and knows who can and can not offer them a max deal.  I want a world where we have a hard team salary cap with no max deals. Let agents actually do something and negotiate for real.   EDIT - The example you used with Kyrie also isn't really fair, there is hardly ever just 1 big name on the market. It would be a rare occurrence. You will usually have multiple all star talent free agents, so if Kyrie decides to go to New York then fine, that puts them out of the running for the next big name free agent, who then is more inclined to go and get that 50 mill in Orlando.   Conversely why would Kyrie want to go to Orlando to get a ""max deal"" if he's getting the exact same exact deal from New York in this hypothetical situation. At least Orlando being able to offer more is more of a bargaining chip!"
"Why Giannis over Durant? Giannis has been averaging 27.2/10.0/4.8 on 60.3 ts % and he has played 73 games (will play 77 games, if he finishes the season out healthy). Durant has been averaging 26.5/6.9/5.4 on 64.3 ts% and he has played 64 games (will play 68 games, if he finishes season out healthy). Giannis is statistically having a better season and he has played nearly 10 more games, so I think he deserves the nod over Durant.  Why Westbrook over Lillard? Westbrook is averaging 25.6/9.9/10.1 compared to Lillard’s 26.7/4.5/6.6.   !st team: G: Russell Westbrook G: James Harden F: LeBron James F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Anthony Davis. I feel like AD getting listed at center this year and him getting voted into all nba first team, would be most fair, if he got the center ballot.  2nd team: G: Damian Lillard G: DeMar DeRozan F: Kevin Durant  F:  LaMarcus Aldridge C: Karl Anthony-Towns. Have KAT at the 2nd team, because he is on track to play all 82 games and he has been averaging 21.2/12.3 a game.  3rd-team: G: Ben Simmons. This was very tricky to pick, but Simmons is averaging 15.8/8.1/8.1 on 53% shooting from the field and he is on track to play 80 games this season. I feel like his high level of play and durability, should be awarded with an all nba selection. His team is also on the brink of a 3rd seed, if they beat Cleveland and finish the season out strong. He has also had to lead his team, as Embiid will miss 19 games on the season. Curry, Kyrie, CP3, and Butler would all be getting all team selections, but Butler has played 55 games, Curry 51 games, Kyrie 60 games, and CP3 55 games. They haven’t played enough, to get on an all nba team in my opinion. G: Bradley Beal. He’s having a great year. Beal is averaging 22.7/4.4/4.5 and he is on track to play all 82 games.  F: Paul George F: Khris Middleton. Underrated year. Since the forward position has been plagued with injuries to Hayward, Kawhi, Porzingis, and Draymond, I feel that Middletown deserves the nod due to his averages of 20.2/5.3/4 a game and he is on track to play all 82 games. C: Nikola Jokic. Had to leave Embiid and Cousins off this list, due to their missed games. Cousins only played 48 games and Embiid only will play 63 games on the year. Jokic is on track to play 75 games (12 more games than Embiid) and he is averaging a cool 18.3/10.5/6 a game."
"For Golden State it looks like...  * Steph Curry: [Knee] Out for the first round at the earliest, I can see him wanting to play, but I cannot see management risking it. * Omri Casspi: [Ankle] Back to begin playoffs.

Kevin Durant isn't in the top 100 let alone the top 5.  He's 498th in DRAPM this year for fuck's sake.
"No, rather I think LeBron tries harder overall in the post season than he does in the regular season, but let's be real he's not exactly a defensive stopper. He'll make a great defensive play or two, but he's never known to be a ""lock down defender,"" nor is Kevin Durant. So to talk about either of them as DPOY level is a little silly."
"Probably cause the three scariest teams in the NBA playoffs are the Warriors, Rockets, and Cavs respectively, and the zone falls apart to players like Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden, Chris Paul, Kyle Korver, Lebron James. "

"Kevin Durant Might have been the first to be in the position to do so there yes and no. The league with how much the cap has been opened and how much players are getting paid, that just what the league has become now.  Ultimately do you blame him?? He left to a better situation, where he’s still consider the best player on his team, which was already championship caliber, and by winning a ship, there’s no more criticism over not getting over the hump all while still getting near max money in a better market where he can make up the difference in money with better sponsoring deals "
"Lonzo won't become transcendent......BECAUSE HE ALREADY IS TRANSCENDENT!!!!!   Then he brought up the two weeks lonzo shot 40% from three and compared it to how lebron has never shot 40% for his career. Which sounds completely false to my ears even without fact checking. Then he ranted about Jason Kidd not averaging 10 7 and 7 like lonzo is doing in his first year.  Then for some reason started talking about LeBron in 2011. Something something killer instinct. Something something 3 and 5.   Then the ""debate"" se into Kevin Durant being finals MVP which means he's the best player in the world. How lebron is padding his stats because he knows that's the only way to catch up to Jordan. Etc etc"
"I love it when redditors try to be revisionist historians here. OKC would have lost in the finals against the Cavs. They did not match up well against the cavaliers. They beat OKC pretty handily both times that season with Kyrie only playing 9 total minutes in those matchups.    They had no way of stopping Love and Lebron James, OKC was that one team Kevin Love matched up really well with, Ibaka had trouble guarding him. And Kyrie would have also went off on them in the finals against them.    Hell you even had Cavs players come out and say that they were hoping to face OKC in the finals instead of the warriors. Lebron has always had Durant’s number throughout his career until KD decided to run off to a 73 win team.    Bottom line is Westbrook couldn’t get it done with having a top 20 all time player by his side. He made the finals that one year due to Durant and Harden going off in the WCF. You won’t win a championship with Westbrook as your best player. If that wasn’t the case then KD wouldn’t have left. Deep down inside KD knew that he wouldn’t get it done against Lebron in OKC.   "
"Justin Anderson was pretty damn exciting imo. He also had the freakish athleticism and made the crazy plays. And I'll never forget when he absolutely locked up Kevin Durant in a playoff win for Dallas.... as a rookie.   I don't think anybody thought he'd be a star or anything, but he was pretty damn awesome.   Same with Yogi-Mania last year. Dude had a stretch where he was electric. Out-dueled Dame.   We may not have had anyone with the prolonged excitement of DSJ. But Roddy B, Simba, and Yogi all showed flashes of absolute jaw dropping plays and games. "
‘Way more impactful’ than Kevin fucking Durant
I garrentee you Steph will return in round one if things got bad for them.. but Kevin Durant will roast us I have no doubt
"Not really in order other than maybe the top 3:  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Stephen Curry  Dwight Howard  Kobe Bryant  Dirk Nowitzki  Tim Duncan  Chris Paul  Dwyayne Wade  Melo? Kevin Love? I don't know who to put in the last spot tbh. Melo definitely was one of the best players in the league around the turn of the decade, but he doesn't have anything to show for it and he's hot garbage now. Kevin Love is pretty underrated imo. In Minnesota he was one of the better players in the league. Both of these players suffer from bad defense though.  Maybe Boogie or Anthony Davis or Kyrie or Westbrook or Harden or Kawhi. There's a lot of borderline guys that will definitely be on all 2010's team by the end of the decade.  Edit: LaMarcus Aldridge is also a great shout. I'd put him with Melo and KLove in contention for the last spot."

Kevin Durant is literally a champion now that he left OKC  ^^^^/s

Probably because he's sharing the floor with Draymond Green and Kevin Durant.

Kevin Durant says he wants to join the eagles
"Kevin Durant pregame ritual: Which great team should I join next? Maybe the eagles, they're looking pretty good."
Did anyone else notice kevin durant head ?
"I'm looking forward to Kevin Durant being on his farewell tour, possibly not even with the Warriors still, and seeing him still get mercilessly booed every time he touches the ball in OKC."
"Ignoring Southwest v2, we can have Pacific v2 of  PG: Chris Paul - Clippers  SG: Kobe Bryant - Lakers   SF: Kevin Durant - Warriors  PF: Charles Barkley - Suns  C: DeMarcus Cousins - Kings  &amp;nbsp;  Or even  PG: Chris Paul - Clippers  SG: Oscar Robertson - Kings  SF: Kevin Durant - Warriors  PF: Charles Barkley - Suns  C: Shaquille O'Neal - Lakers"
"I think you're seriously underestimating how much talent the warriors have. Their top two are better than Harden, their number three (Draymond IMO) is not much worse than, if not as good as, CP3 and their fourth best player is miles better than the rockets number four. This is by far the most stacked team in NBA history with two of the possible top three players in the league and two other all-NBA caliber players (very possibly four of the top 15 in the league). The only team I see with any shot of beating them in a series is if everything else goes right for the Cavs and LeBron has one of the greatest finals performances ever. I have never in my life seen a team in any sports league close to being as stacked as this warriors team all thanks to that pussy bitch Kevin Durant though I heard he's looking at the eagles for next season."
Northwest - Gary Payton - Clyde Drexler - Kevin Durant - Karl Malone - Kevin Garnett
"People talk about 33 years old as if that's still ""prime"" years.  Kevin Durant recently said that he isn't surprised Lebron is this good 15 years into his career because he's ""only 33"".  Lebron has created more value for his team this year than anyone 31 years or older ever has, and I expect him to break Karl Malone's longevity statistics that you can see in the chart as well.  Just wanted to post this to make sure y'all have heard of this Lebron James fella, he's decent."
"* PG: Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, recently Jrue Holiday * SG: Paul George, Klay Thompson * SF: Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard * PF: Anthony Davis * C: Joel Embiid"
"Please, please fuck up the warriors for everyone one of us, the whole basketball world is behind you  Also Kevin Durant is a bitch who can't win without joining teams with 3 all nba caliber players and winning 73 fucking games. Fuck him for being a pussy who chokes away 3-1 leads and joins 73 win teams."
Kevin Durant starred in a movie.  He's clearly far more outgoing and relatable to a wider audience.
"Well it is a surprise to me since I haven't watched the bucks that much this season, but I have a lot in the last 2-3 years. Middleton was always a good shooter, but this level of efficiency at his volume is very elite.    2014-2015: 342(4.33 a game) at 44.4%  2015-2016: 465(5.89 a game) at 41.5%   2016-2017: 122(4.2 a game) at 42.6%   2017-2018: 427(5.55 a game) at 49.9%  So despite being a good mid range shooter, he has now gotten his mid range efficiency to be one of the best in the NBA, above DeMar DeRozan (43.1%), Dirk (46.5%), Beal (45.3%), McCullom (43.2%)  He is putting up very similar numbers this year to Kevin Durant (5.7 a game at 50.1) in the mid range.  So regardless if you have been following Middleton, the fact is that he is having by far his most efficient year from mid range. "
"It appears I was incorrect, turns out the max his last year in okc was less than I remembered. Still doesn’t change the fact that he accepted less than the max for all three years in golden state. We can’t factor in how much adding a championship or two or three adds to his value though. Through his little twitter mishap we know he didn’t believe he could win one in okc and that fueled his decision to leave. I imagine a Kevin Durant with multiple rings in a large market is more valuable than a Kevin Durant on max money in a small market without any rings. I think the big market bump in non salary earnings for a guy like him is enough to leave the max contract money on the table which is what I’m getting at. Imagine a player doesn’t have to leave max money on the table for big market sponsorship. It stands to reason that a guy like Kawhi who may be more focused on money since he already won a championship, wants to get to a big market and make as much money as possible. "
He's also first team nba over Kevin Durant for two years now. Only person on the first team to also be in first team defense. Which is really only a thing kobe and Michael where known for trending.

"I think it's funny you question my reading comprehension as a fall back option instead of showing more examples of him breaking news.  Except he didn't break the news of the signing, Lebron himself did on national TV.  Stephen A. Smith claimed his ""sources"" which is laughable cause he's almost always spewing shit out of his mouth that he would sign in Miami. And Lebron happened to announce a few days later.   Would you say I'm breaking news if I said ""Kevin Durant is gonna sign with the warriors"" a few days before he actually announced it? No you'd claim it's my opinion.   If you actually know anything about him you'd realized that the reason he is still at espn, it isn't to break news but to bring in views with his accusations and opinions like many online news outlets use clickbait for views. Why else would they give a clown like him a show. "
Kevin Durant averaged 30 PPG/8 RPG/5 APG on over 66% TS. He shit on the Spurs worse than Harden did. 
Wait is this a protest against Kevin Durant leaving?
I think it’s because most of this sub started watching basketball 3 years ago. And CP3 really gets disrespected here due to his team collapsing in the playoffs. Put prime Chris Paul with Kevin Durant on those thunder teams and tell me if he doesn’t make multiple finals appearances. 
"Myers: ""We'll give you Kevin Durant.""  Buford: ""I want Quinn Cook or the deal's off."""
"He never was in a situation where he had to decide to take more or less money when signing his contract.  &gt;In fact, Curry told The Athletic in August he offered to take a pay cut if it helped keep the core together. Because the Warriors owned Curry’s Bird Rights and could exceed the salary cap to sign him — an exception that did not apply to Durant — any discount that wasn’t outright ludicrous would not have made retaining role players easier.  &gt;“I actually asked Bob,” Curry told The Athletic a month after re-signing. “If I were to take a discount — at any number, I don’t know what it would be — how much of a difference would that make for us to be able to sign other guys. It wasn’t like (Kevin Durant’s) situation. His had a direct impact on us being able to sign Andre (Iguodala) and Shaun (Livingston). And it was just an unbelievable sacrifice by KD. But mine didn’t matter.”"
"Gotta love the Warriors and their evolving team.  Starting with the We Believe Warriors, morphing into the Splash Brothers, getting Kevin Durant and becoming the Toaster Warriors, and now we emerge as the Hospital Warriors.  "
Kevin Durant - Judas
"Free agency officially starts at 12:00AM EST on July 1st, but this is also the beginning of the moratorium period when teams are permitted to start negotiating with free agents (before this, free agents-to-be are still under contract) but not actually sign them because the salary cap is yet to be confirmed. When tweets and reports start coming out at this time, it is usually just a verbal agreement between a free agent and a team rather than the player actually signing the contract. These verbal agreements are rarely backed out of (unless you're DeAndre Jordan).  Any member of a team (front office, coaching staff, players included) are actually not permitted to entice or induce players under contracts from other teams to play for them before the clock hits midnight EST, though, but tampering rules, especially for players, are never enforced. The way tampering works in the NBA is that the league only looks into matters if they receive a complaint from a team suspecting another of violating the tampering rules. The league itself won't actively seek to put its nose in these cases even if it is blatantly obvious, or even if a player himself acknowledges that he was recruiting another player (e.g. Draymond Green texting Kevin Durant after the 2016 Finals)."
"What is a ""lane violation""?   Are players allowed to be in the lane before the ball gets to the rim on foul shots? Or are they not allowed to and refs just ignore it?   Also... is there any NBA rule regarding a player's listed height? Like, some guys are listed lower than their barefoot height, (Durant comes to mind,) and other guys are listed 2+ inches more than their real height w/o shoes, (e.g. Kevin Love, Ben Wallace.)   Would a team be allowed to list a 6'5"" player as 6'9"" if they wanted to, or would the league make them change it? "

With Kevin Durant...
"He's mediocre at best, but I take every chance I can to shit on him mercilessly. Never runs any plays, especially during crunch time, just ISO's the two best players on the team like he did in OKC. Difference is, John Wall is not Kevin Durant. It basically never works. This team is at it's best when we move the ball like we did for that stretch where we lead the league in APG while Wall was out. With one of the best distributors in the league back on the floor now, there's no reason that shouldn't continue. It's all on Brooks not drawing up the plays. He can't. He doesn't even use a fucking whiteboard at the end of games.  John hitting that game winner in the playoffs last year to send the Celtics series to 7 is one of the worst things that could have happened for this team regarding end of game ball movement.  Grunfeld is a whole other can of worms..."

"Wait... You mean Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Curry 2 of those times where they went 1-1 and theeeeeen added Kevin Durant.   There ya go - FTFY  Also what did Curry do in those finals other than vanish from relevance? I believe Iggy saved him in series 1. He lost series 2. Then KD came in and stole the show in series 3 if I'm correct?   That's my point man. It's semantics. You can't definitively say Curry is better than Stockton without sounding biased. So just stop."
"I agree but context matters too. Has Jordan ever held LeBron in high regard tho? He even said he’d choose Kevin Durant over LeBron in an interview. He’s always had something against LeBron.   This is similar too how kobe fans dismiss what IT said about LeBron being better than Jordan.   Magic Johnson is a lifelong laker legend... Kobe is a lifelong laker legend... you don’t think there is any bias there?  How come what wade, Kerr, Brett Brown etc have said is dismissed but stuff like this isn’t? I’m just saying keep it consistent. "
"Loser. Downvoting me and responding within seconds. Probably been glued to your computer waiting for responses.        And yeah, I think he's a shitty competitor. MJ, Kobe, the greats wanted to to destroy their competition, not join them. Kevin Durant wants the ""hardest path""."
*With the first pick in the 2018 NFL Draft the Cleveland Browns select....Kevin Durant!*
"The ExThunder are going to be stacked next year with a backcourt of Victor Oladipo and James Harden and a frontcourt of Paul George, Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka. There can't have ever been a group of one team's castoffs that were close to this good."
"KD *does* care about what people like us think. That’s why he’s continued to stir up shit on social media. He just can’t stand the fact that 14 year olds are upset and constantly mocking him for making the most uncompetitive free agency move in the history of sports. Was he allowed to leave? Absolutely. Did he leave in the worst way possible? Definitely. Has he continued to dig himself deeper into the PR hole that he’s in? Certainly.   Lebron gets a pass because he left his team in rebuild mode, almost as if he did it on purpose. He left and got a few rings, allowed CLE to tank and get some good picks, then comes back and finished what he started in 2016. I still think it was shady, but KD’s decision dwarfed it in comparison. When they blew the 3-1 lead, OKC was the best team in the league and players have since come forth and confirmed that. The front office was actively making moves to bring in more players that would suit a roster with KD as the center piece, and he just walked away from it all. He just sabotaged OKC and forced the entire league to adjust. It was a weak move, no way around it. History won’t be as kind to Kevin Durant. "
Kevin Durant was a beanstick when he entered the league.   He got stronger and also moved out of two-guard role to defend larger players.

"I feel like at this point it's been so long since the Thunder big 3 broke up that you can get a gauge on who became who. Like for example  I feel like they're the Yardbirds of the NBA because the Yardbirds had three legendary guitarists at one point or another in their history. If I had to compare them I'd say:  Kevin Durant- Eric Clapton (Most successful one, arguably the most talented.)  James Harden- Jimmy Page (Joined up with one of the best PGs of all time just like Page joined up with one of the best singers)  Russell Westbrook- Jeff Beck (Out of the three they're both the most exciting ones and they love being in control musically or basketball-wise)"
"Lol faulty opinion. You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do. Honestly, there's simply a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is Kerr's size, he's literally exactly Kerr's size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill. In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league. And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Jordan is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force. Curry simply doesn't have it"
"Charles Barkley and Karl Malone weren't able to win championships as the first option either, I guess you wouldn't want them either   Even Kevin Durant couldn't do it until he joined what was already one of the greatest teams of all time "

"Yeah. I think actually any team in the playoffs except the Spurs would've given them a good matchup. The Spurs have nothing. They have coaching and depth, sure, but they have no star power - you aren't going to win against Kevin Durant with coaching. You need star power to push the Warriors. Denver have Jokic, who is absolutely insane and causes a ton of problems for Golden State, far more than LMA. Denver went 2-2 against the Warriors, and they did well vs them last year too. Spurs went 1-3. Their one win was with no Klay, no Curry, no KD, and Draymond played 12 minutes. Theyy still only scored 89 points. Even when LMA dropped 30/17, Curry got injured and Klay had a bad shooting night, the Spurs lost."

"Not as the best player on his team.  If Nash had prime Kevin Durant on his team:    - Durant would have never left   - He would have rings to show for, besides the Warriors one that Durant got him.  Westbrook as the best player on his team is about to get bounced for the 2nd year in a row. So much for individual stats. Rose had less stats and won 62 games with no other allstars, ECF. Kawhi had less stats (last year) and won 61 games with no other allstar, WCF. Harden had less (minimally less) stats, and got the Rockets to WCF with Dwight, and will do so again this year probably (with CP3).  Winning is what matters in basketball. Individual stats don't mean anything. Westbrook added PG13 and is taking 21 shots at 52%TS per game. Durant is taking 18 per game, even without Curry."
with Kevin fucking Durant?
"successful meaning that unless they have another MVP caliber player on their team like a Kevin Durant, or a player good enough to challenge Westbrook's leadership on this team, they won't be gettin anywhere near a championship IMO. "

Kevin Durant
The Jazz is my new favorite team. Gobert is DPOY. Mitchell is the ROTY. And Ingles is the manu Ginobli of small forwards. Love em.  Paul George is the Walmart version of Kevin Durant. 
Depends on who you ask. Some would say the season ended two off seasons ago when the warriors got Kevin durant. Some would say it doesn't even begin until the playoffs.  The answer lies somewhere in the middle. But not really
"They need to have space for the ""Kevin Durant liked an Instagram post"" thread at the top of the board, that's more important"
"Lol, he has a Steph Curry and Kevin Durant tat, not even making this up lmfao."

"KAWHI? WHAT IS HE GOING TO JOIN COUSINS, LEBRON, PAUL GEORGE, KEVIN DURANT, GEORGE GERVIN, AND THE GHOST OF LARRY BIRD?! HAHAHAHAHA  Honestly though I'm fine with it. At least we get press. I think I'd rather have this than the alternative of small market hell."
"Kevin Durant is actually a pretty honest and honorable person, I don't see him doing some passive aggressive or betray our trust in me. I believe that this was just an accident."

Uhhhh fuck Kevin Durant??
*Does Kevin Durant support the opiod epidemic?*
"Kevin Durant is 3rd in the NBA in jersey sales, he clearly still has a lot of popularity "

Why Kevin Durant will join the Philadelphia Eagles 
Had a really good defensive season out of the following 18 guys below     Giannis Tobias Harris DeRozan Middleton LeBron jimmy butler Kristaps Porzingis Devin booker CJ McCollum Paul Georgd Victor Oladipo Bradley Beal James Harden Goran Dragic Dame Lillard Ben Simmons Lou Williams Tyreke Evans   1) only Ben Simmons and Dame scored at or above their average points/poss rate on poss guarded by him   2) Out of those guys only Simmons Harden Beal Oladipo and McCollum shot 45+% from the field on poss guarded by him  If you combine those 18 guys above with steph curry lyric Irving mike Conley Kevin Durant klay Thompson John wall Gary Harris Donovan Mitchell Eric Bledsoe and Chris Paul collectively on over 1300 poss he held those guys to 40% FG shooting

"Actually one of the most surprising things from that whole KD Twitter alt account ""can't win with these cats"" controversy was that Westbrook was NOT the problem, it was the rest of the roster + Donovan.

Kevin Durant is the Most Online Player 
"..kevin durant is immature, between this and his fake accounts and his ""why is everybody always picking on me"" mentality, dude can't act his age!"
"Who said I was defending him? He's really silly and too thin skinned sometimes. So what? You're the one getting upset over it. I'd rather be Kevin Durant than you, and I know you feel the same way.  Also flair up if you're going to front. ;) "

Kevin Durant is a ring chasing bitch. 
The hypocrisy of Kevin Durant referring to people who criticize him as “blog boys” and telling them to focus on their own lives not his while at the same time regularly dissing his former team mates on social media is just too much. This dude is the most insecure super star in the history of the league.
"Yeah and Markelle Fultz was gonna be James Harden, Greg Oden was gonna be Shaq, Bargnani was gonna be the next Dirk, Darko was gonna be the next Dirk, desean stevens was gonna be the next Jordan, thon maker was gonna be the next Kevin Durant, Andrew Wiggins was gonna be the next Tmac etc "

Wow Kevin Durant just seems stupid at this point. 
"Why is this stickied? Of course Kevin Durant says it was a ""total accident"". What else would he say?"
"[Royce Young on Twitter](https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/988516403706609664?s=19)  &gt; Kevin Durant tells me it was a ""total accident"" that he liked a comment on Instagram about Russell Westbrook. Was just an honest mistake."
Kevin Durant is the wrong type of petty.

"&gt; Durant joined a 73 win team that lost in the Finals.   Durant joined a Warriors team that won a ring without him the year before, were one win away from repeating without him that season - and oh, by the way, beat KD's team in the Western Conference Finals!  Just comical how people are trying to justify KD's decision because the Warriors had ""only"" won one ring without him instead of repeating.  &gt; The Warriors... added a free agent to make sure it didn't happen again and everyone gets mad at them?  First of all, people are more angry at Durant than the Warriors.  Second of all, the Warriors didn't merely ""add a free agent."" They begged a prime MVP to join them after they choked in the Finals. It was a cowardly decision by Durant to join them, and it was soft for the Warriors' players to even be recruiting him in the first place after all the trash they had talked to the league all year.  &gt; How is that Kevin Durant or the Warriors fault? Is it the Warriors job to build the Cavs roster?  It's Durant's ""fault"" for joining a 73-win team because he didn't want to compete anymore."
"“Git gud welfare boi” - Kevin Durant, probably, at some point this year"
Durant joined a 73 win team that *lost* in the Finals. The Warriors lost to Lebron and his own stacked team (it was 3 all stars vs. 3 all stars I dont care how you try to spin it) and then added a free agent to make sure it didn't happen again and everyone gets mad at them? They built a stacked team through the draft and added a free agent. Shame on them for signing the best player available.  &gt;Warriors simply being a *lot* more stacked   How is that Kevin Durant or the Warriors fault? Is it the Warriors job to build the Cavs roster?
bruh OP is Kevin Durant
"We've all accidentally favorited a picture of a girl in a bikini. This is the same thing except instead of a girl in a bikini it's Russel Westbrook, and instead of you an average person it's genetic freak superstar athlete Kevin Durant."
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/lookit/2017/9/18/16327672/kevin-durant-private-instagram-account-arguments-nba-warriors  Here you go. But you can google for more info. Basically he was jumping back and forth from between his real account and fake account and was arguing with kids. He initially denied it was him, then said it was an intern, then said it was him but he was sleep deprived and didn’t remember doing it.  I believe he also got caught using his real account, thinking he was on his fake account, critiquing the thunder coaching staff.  Edit: don’t downvote this guy for asking for sources. What is even the point of that?"
"Durant is a millionaire who's an NBA legend with a ring. Stop being so salty. KD is the reason your franchise became relevant in the 1st place. If Kevin Durant is a ""loser"", then what the fuck does that make any of us?"
"Oh it's the same thing I was just too lazy to type out their respective percentages. I don't mean to imply Curry is last or something he's definitely not that's why I left the link.  Anyways so yeah, Curry has a 14% career turnover % and Lebron and CP are at 13%. The difference is Lebron and CP handle the ball a ton and generate a ton of assists. Curry mostly plays off-ball and does not do a lot of direct playmaking and yet has a higher turnover % than these guys.  If you look at playoffs career among active players Curry gets near 15% and Lebron is still around 13% as is CP.   |Rank|Player|TOV%| |:-|:-|:-| |67.|Kendrick Perkins|24.25| |66.|Mario Chalmers|17.28| |65.|Dwight Howard|16.71| |64.|Rajon Rondo|16.37| |63.|Shaun Livingston|16.26| |62.|Draymond Green|16.23| |60.|Joakim Noah|15.68| |61.|Devin Harris|15.68| |59.|Tyson Chandler|15.67| |58.|Manu Ginobili|15.37| |57.|Kyle Lowry|15.09| |56.|James Harden|14.98| |55.|**Stephen Curry**|14.97| |54.|Paul George|14.63| |53.|Tony Allen|14.62| |52.|DeAndre Jordan|14.48| |51.|Richard Jefferson|14.20| |50.|Lance Stephenson|14.15| |49.|Dwyane Wade|13.94| |48.|Marcin Gortat|13.78| |47.|Russell Westbrook|13.75| |46.|Jeff Teague|13.67| |45.|Nene Hilario|13.66| |44.|Nick Collison|13.52| |43.|Andre Iguodala|13.36| |42.|Derrick Rose|13.22| |41.|Tony Parker|13.15| |40.|Josh Smith|13.08| |39.|**Chris Paul**|13.07| |38.|Udonis Haslem|12.92| |36.|Thabo Sefolosha|12.52| |37.|**LeBron James**|12.52| |35.|Paul Millsap|12.37| |34.|George Hill|12.10| |33.|David West|11.96| |32.|Al Horford|11.91| |31.|Tristan Thompson|11.86| |30.|Kevin Durant|11.80|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/tov_pct_active_p.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#stats_active_p_tov_pct) Generated 5/3/2018.  Curry is right there with James Harden yet Harden handles the ball a lot and does a lot playmaking. Curry barely handles the ball and does not directly assist the basketball."
"Eh, someone will pay. We thought the league wouldn't let the Warriors get Kevin Durant, but Mark Cuban still gave Harrison Barnes the max and took on Bogut's contract. People still gave the Heat draft picks. People still give the Warriors draft picks."
"Also my cousins kids, 1 boy, 2 girls play basketball. The favorite player of both girls (unfortunately) is Kevin Durant. Girls dont care about the WNBA."
"Yea, Steph could, but it's not likely. And most likely Kevin Durant would have to leave sooner rather then later. Steph has only played 2 seasons as the clear cut number 1 guy while being a top player in the league. If KD leaves and Steph wins 1 or 2 more rings at his peak level and has a few more peak seasons left in him he'd have a good argument.  Steph should have won the 2015 Finals MVP though so I'll give him that."
"nah, it's literally just a narrative that this sub and a few other online places like to push. Most former OKC players have praised just how good of a teammate Westbrook was. Even KD omitted him from the cats statement (""imagine taking Russ off that team, see how bad they were. Kd can’t win a championship with those cats...it was just kd and Russ.” ~ Kevin Durant)."
"He also beat 4 teams in the finals with only 1 HOFer on them (Magic, Drexler, Barkley, and Payton). Imagine if Lebron got to the Finals every year and faced James Harden without Chris Paul or Damian Lillard or Anthony Davis by themselves or hell, Kevin Durant surrounded by role players or Steph Curry surrounded by role players."
"How are we still using lack of strength as a knock against prospects? We see it every year, these dudes have MASSIVE frames to fill out, which is hard, and takes time and targeted effort. The college level pales to the pros in strength/agility training, nutrition, and overall wellness tech.  Kevin Durant went from “couldn’t do a push-up” to turning into a for-real rim protector. Just give these kids a chef, a dozen fitness nerds on staff, and a year of work. They’ll be fine, they always are."
Yeah. I noticed Kevin Durant and Draymond Green on the floor too. Klay Thompson alone surrounded by role players would get locked up.
Kevin Durant is also probably the 3rd best small forward of all-time. You got   1. LeBron  2. Bird  3. Durant  I would also put Durant and Curry on the same tier of current players in the 1-4 range
[The Dubs two biggest losses this season were against Utah](https://thejnotes.com/2018/04/24/kevin-durant-not-surprised-utah-jazz-3-1-lead-okc/) Even KD recognized these Jazz as legit. I dont think it will be an easy sweep
Except Kevin Durant does exactly that.
"I say they just need a clutch player that can make a shot when they need it. James Harden, Lebron James, Steph Curry, Damien Lillard, Kevin Durant, just to name a few that are super clutch in the final minutes of the game. Raptors have no one. Seriously I would trust not even Deebo in the deep minutes of a playoff game.  They can try and create a clutch player by practicing late game sequences and having the same consistent shooter practice taking clutch shots with the ball but honestly the best experience is in a live game and the ""clutch"" trait is such a rare and difficult to find one that it's just kinda hard to find a solution to this problem without just getting a player that's already really clutch or has the skill to learn.   Kinda like what Brad Stevens did with Jaylen Brown, Casey can try and setup a player like Anunoby to take the last shot in clutch moments of the game to build up his resistance to pressure. Those late minutes Jaylen Brown played in the 2016/2017 season I feel like were huge for his development."
"With Kevin Durant, he’s won 3? Playoff games in 2 seasons without KD but with Oladipo PG and Melo. Not buying what he’s selling in the postseason "
Kevin Durant ruined the NBA. 
"I'm gonna put myself out there and say that I think this is a more interesting hypothetical than y'all are giving it credit for.   No shit taking Westbrook was a good pick as he's turned into a perennial all-star and one of the best players in the NBA.   But... you could also argue he led to Durant calling it quits in OKC and led to the organization letting Harden go.   What if OKC takes Kevin Love and George Hill instead of Westbrook and Ibaka and still takes Harden the next year?  Is a Hill/Harden/Durant/Love foursome that much worse than a WBrook/Harden/Durant/Ibaka one? And, more importantly, is OKC forced to get rid of one of them, considering they might not still make the Perkins trade?   I would still give that squad a very good chance of being a perennial contender in the West and you never know if Durant would have ended up staying with a different team around him.   You're a dumbass for the title OP, but I do think your post is more interesting than people are giving it credit for. "
Small difference between Shawn Kemp and Kevin Durant don’t you think
Kevin Durant after watching the Thunder this year
"It's disgraceful to omit Ray Allen from this list. Also, Kevin Durant only played 1 year in Seattle."
"Wow congrats, he drafted Kevin Durant after the Blazers decided they wanted Oden instead.  The only pick that he overperformed on was Russ"
"The idea of Anthony Davis to the Warriors makes me want to puke. I want a competitive NBA, to quote Kevin Durant, “what happened to wanting to go at these guys?”"
"""To reiterate, I am really glad Steph is back because the pressure is off me and things are much, much, much more easy. Thats why I came here, so things can be easy, so I can take the easy way out,  and I can have the easiest path towards a championship.""  Kevin ""Snek"" Durant"
"Yeah Kawhi is the only true answer. He’s the only one with enough size, speed, and hands. Also worth mentioning he’s on the Spurs, who play some of the best team defense in the league which really makes him the true answer imo. There are guys like PG or even CP3 who have the hands capable of disrupting him but don’t have the team defense to help when you inevitably get beat bc it’s Kevin fkin Durant. It’s the same thing with LeBron. I guess now you can argue it’s KD and Kawhi since KD can stay in front of LeBron and get help from DPOY+god damn Klay Thompson AND Iggy. Fk I hate thinking about the Warriors.... "
"&gt;	""I was in that same situation -- playing behind somebody when I first got into the league and then finally getting my opportunity and then taking advantage of it,"" said Harden, a sixth man for the Thunder behind Kevin Durant and Westbrook before being traded to the Rockets. ""That's what it's about. So I can relate to what he's come from. He works his butt off every single day. That's the reason that he's so successful.""  Good on you Harden; I love it when we see players develop like that."

This is why people say Kevin Durant is unguardable. He'll just shoot over you like you aren't even there.
The jazz would very much like to sign Kevin Durant 
"Hate to break it to you bro, but they're not going to be the dominant team in the NBA without making crazy moves and spending more than they've ever spent before. There's already reports of Kevin Durant looking to opt out and resign with the dubs. As we've seen in the past, Steph is a homer and probably isn't going anywhere. Klay has said he wants to stay and he'd rather be part of a winning team than be the star of a losing team. Not sure if draymond has expressed the same sentiment but I'd guess he feels the same.  All this to say that OKC can't get a championship with just Russ, right? Not with the powerhouse gsw and rockets. And he's 29. So you've got probably 3-4 more really explosive years from him and then he's going to need to rely on his shooting more than his athleticism. We've seen how that goes. Realistically unless okc lands someone like James harden and maybe one more solid role player, an iguodala type, they're not gonna get it done. The time to tank is now. "
"i don't think i understand why you'd say he's been a ""huge disappointment"" and that he's been ""pretty bad for most of his playoff games."" his averages in cleveland are 17/10, and has been an allstar for two of the four years. in the playoffs, his averages are 15/9.5 and has shot an astonishing 43% from 3 on nearly 6 attempts per game (kevin durant is a career 34% 3 point shooter on 6 attempts per game in the playoffs.)  one last piece of context: chris bosh averaged 15/7 in the playoffs during his four years with lebron. kevin love is hardly a disappointment, nor has he been anything resembling ""pretty bad for most of his playoff games."" "
"you'll never believe this, but i thought kevin durant was a better prospect at the time than greg oden!!11!11 btw no downvotes for my very unpopular opinion plz"
Who cares what Kevin Durants business partner thinks about anything as regards Knicks coach?   The only team Durant would choose the Knicks over is the Shandong Golden Stars. He is more likely to become a physics professor in Arkangelsk than to come here in FA. 
"Kevin ""bath water"" Durant was already weird. If anything, I think he contributed to the weirdness lol."
"Right I get that, but this is Kevin Durant being guarded by guys who are like 6’3 from 10 ft out.  As Shaq would say, this is BBQ chicken for him.   If this is your “worst option” you’re impossible to stop. "
Ha This reads like KD is some role player and not one of the best volume and most efficient scorers in NBA history.  I think it’s pretty safe to say Kevin Durant will continue hitting shots like this at a high percentage. 
"Durant, Kevin is all you need to know. A game is supposed to be competitive, who wants to see blowouts all the time?"
"""But when Lebron went to Miami that team was stacked""  You're right. Now add Kevin Durant to that team. Boom, Warriors. "
https://www.gq.com/story/drake-steph-curry-kevin-durant-tattoos 
"“In his time off he drinks wine with Dwayne Wade, reps the cavs, and makes videos with Kevin Durant. LeBron is a shameless NBA groupie.”  This argument is dumb, these guys are professionals and for the most part friends off the court."
[Here's an article on it](https://deadspin.com/does-drake-have-steph-curry-and-kevin-durants-numbers-t-1821932101)  [Here's another one](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2018/1/9/16871522/drake-steph-curry-kevin-durant-tattoos)  [And another...](https://www.gq.com/story/drake-steph-curry-kevin-durant-tattoos)  I wonder if NBA players have a tattoo of Drake...
Kevin Durant is the most unguardable player ever.
I would love to see Kevin Durant in a nets tunic...
"Yeah, he should have went to Portland. Why doesn't Portland ever get a player like Kevin Durant?"
Text Kevin Durant from your car in a parking lot?
"&gt; Not sure how you can say Curry is the best with such confidence.  Honestly it should be apparent, but if you dig into the on/off numbers from the past few years it's really obvious. Curry is the only guy whose net +/- is great regardless of teammates.  &gt;  Did we all forget Kevin Durant in the Finals last year?  He got to play with Curry, and the system that was created around &amp; because of Curry. Easiest situation for a star player ever."
"Curry benefits greatly from the system (he's also a huge part of the system of course). Durant can function on his own, and thrive in the system. Curry beat Durant because Curry had the better team. I can't believe I'm defending Kevin Durant, I can't stand the guy. His basketball skill is otherworldly though."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJYPMaoACl0        I counted one wide open shot Kevin Durant got off. Most of his shots were heavily contested and extremely difficult for the average NBA player. Go back and watch the highlights if you don't remember.
Kevin Durant is infuriating.  He always shoots the game winning daggers when you most expect him to.
"That's hilarious. You think Kevin Durant was neglected on D while Steph was triple teamed? I have no idea what Finals you watched, but it wasn't the one I saw. Wide open dunks? You mean like KD used his elite athleticism to get himself open and dunk the ball?"
If the Warriors offense fails just give it to Kevin Durant and he can do anything offensively.
"Kevin Durant doesn't follow through, he stays to admire the make."
I remember Kevin Durant getting multiple wide open dunks while Steph was doubled at the three point line. Is that the finals you're talking about?
"I think other years this is a finals team lol not even an underdog. I don't know what they've done in the brief time between Demarcus's injury and now but they are really really good, like a completely different team. They didn't shoot any free throws tonight and were fucking down 2 at the end of the third. They make the warriors turn the ball over so much, ridiculous on-dribble defense and they are amazing on the fast break. They are tough as fuck also. When curry checked in at hit that deep was 3 that made oracle roar mirotic calmly answered with a really deep pull up 3 the possession after. They don't fucking quit. Unfortunately Kevin Durant can't miss in the 4th quarter...  However, the free throw disparity has been outrageous and they have been playing at oracle. I'm excited for the return to New Orleans I think it will make a world of difference."
"they were fouling him before that, Kevin Durant can't be an excuse for not making calls"
Yep Rondo would definitely have a chance to win a meaningless jump ball against 7' Kevin Durant 
"Not sure how you can say Curry is the best with such confidence. Did we all forget Kevin Durant in the Finals last year? I dislike the guy as much as anyone else for his decision, but let's not be victims of the moment. Kevin Durant is a top 5 all time scorer."
"I'm not a fan of Kevin Durant, for obvious reasons"
"I dunno, that Kevin Durant fellow is pretty good too. Imagine if he was on a super team with Westbrook and Harden."
"Most valuable you mean, IMO Kevin Durant is a better player overall but Curry's {G R A V I T Y} makes the plus/minus skyrocket skyfucker "
"Formerly injured point guard Steph Curry yelled out, “YA YA HEY!” Sharpshooter Klay Thompson gave a look of utter confusion and knocked over his gatorade bottle. Forward Draymond Green yelled out, “We got an[d one!] squad now.” And before Kevin Durant hit the locker room door, former Warriors great Leandro Barbosa hugged him and said, “Y’all gon be shampionship”"
Kevin Durant with the quiet 29 points as usual.
Kevin Durant just put that game on his back. I can't believe some of the shots he hit. 
I too would like to have a team who's star players don't have to do anything other than let Kevin Durant take a contested mid range shot every possession
Fuck Kevin Durant. I can never respect that asshat for being so damn good and running to the warriors. Such a shame. 
Kevin Durant is the kind of player where he does some unexplainable shit and you almost appreciate it if you’re the other team.
Is that Lamarcus Aldridge or Kevin fucking Durant
Also a daily reminder: Rick Barnes did not reach the Sweet 16 with Kevin Durant on his team.
DAILY REMINDER: THIS TEAM SHOULD NOT HAVE KEVIN DURANT.
"""*Hey, slow it down.*"" - Kevin Durant  ""*I am good, huh?*"" - Stephen Curry"
When Kevin Durant drops 50 a game on his ass you can shut up about it
kevin durant keepin it real on area 21
Kevin Durant ugly af god damn
there are long stretches during these games where I forget that Kevin Durant is on the team
"Why would anybody ever think a team with arguably 3/5 of the best pure scorers in the game would ever lose a best out of 7.   It's like watching Dragonball Z but Goku is played by Kevin Durant and just gangs around with 2 other shorter, lighter skinned Gokus."
Pssst. Kevin Durant is shooting 28.3% from three on almost 8 attempts per game in the playoffs.
"No, it's that I don't feel like wasting time ""debating"" who Michael Jordan was as a player with someone who clearly isn't even old enough to have watched the NBA as recently as 2014. If you never watched MJ play, (and have only watched LeBron for the last few seasons) how could you possibly expect to be taken seriously when discussing them?   Please don't try and claim now that you've been watching basketball for 30 years, but just happened to **completely forget** about LeBron ever playing in Miami. Either you didn't know LeBron payed for the Heat, or you weren't aware that Wade spent nearly his entire career there. Which one is it?  It's like as pretending to be a diehard NBA fan while confidently thinking that Kevin Durant has played for the Warriors his whole career."
"I read recently something that is basically true. Westbrook was never the first option in any team that he played for, until recently. That is, in all his teams from high school to now, he always had a bigger presence than him. Only after Kevin Durant left was he forced to become the first option. It seems he is not ready for that role.  So, OK3 could have worked if only Paul George had become the primary scorer like Kevin Durant was. With Westbrook as the second option, and Adams the third, it could have worked. The biggest issue there was Melo's minutes and shots. Maybe if they don't trade for him, it would have worked."
Jrue cooked Kevin Durant. Oh my 
Kevin Durant forgetting he has a better shooter than him on the court now. Pass the ball!
Stephen Curry is better than Kevin Durant.
I wonder if anyone has ever told Steph Curry that his name is a girl's name followed by the name of a food. That'd be like if Kevin Durant changed his name to Barbara Hotdogs 
"nobody put up a fucking fight last year, your team is arguably the most talented of all time lol  and it was arguable before you added Kevin Durant to the roster. The Warriors are a fuckin cheat code at this point."
"It's not something people in this sub say, it's something people surrounding the NBA and former players think, like Jalen Rose, Kevin Durant, Tracy McGrady, Paul Pierce, Charles Barkley, etc.  I will give you this: Kawhi still hasn't finished his career, so obviously we haven't seen all that greatness; people are basically banking on his potential and what he will do in the next seasons. But the same is done for other current players, like Giannis, Anthony Davis, Embiid and Ben Simmons. When people talk about these players as Hall of Famers (Simmons and Embiid basically being rookies), it's because when it's all said and done, they will have played 15 seasons and will have achieved MVPs and championships. Obviously it hasn't happened yet, but we are expecting that to happen. And to Kawhi's point, he has already won a championship, finals MVP, and defensive player of the year, and before his injury he was a clear candidate to get a regular season MVP award. So, he has already demonstrated greatness.  Another thing, nobody is saying he is right there at the top with Jordan and Lebron as the best ever. But he is one of the best of this generation clearly. If you compiled a new 50 best players list, he would make it, no doubt."
"You wouldn’t be surprised if a team comprised of Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and **Quinn Cook**, all in their primes, got swept in a playoff series?  That’s almost laughable. They aren’t getting swept. "
"Thunder forward Paul George yelled out, “Here I go! Here I go.” Bricklayer Carmelo Anthony gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Russell Westbrook yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before George hit the locker room door, former Thunder great Kevin Durant hugged him and said, “You can’t win with those cats.”"
"Didn’t Westbrook sign some massive 10 year extension with Jordan Brand last year that was supposedly super-lucrative? I couldn’t find the exact numbers, but I’d be shocked if it were in the $50 million range for ten years after Durant and Curry signed deals in the hundreds of millions (KD’s is worth up to $300 million, per [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-durant-nike-jay-z-roc-nation-2014-9)). I mean, yeah Westbrook is clearly not as good as those guys, but not by $250 million. "
Durant in the NBA finals was making contested jumpers. Yes LeBron would be more efficient if he had better teammates but his game is mostly predicated on his 1 on 1 bullying his way to the basket. LeBron's a better basketball player than Kevin Durant but Durant is a more versatile scorer than LeBron. LeBron isn't going to become a better three point or mid range shooter no matter who his teammates are.  In the finals last year LeBron's teammates scored 415 points on 55.8 TS%. Durant's teammates scored 432 points on 54.8 TS%.   I don't think it's blasphemous to admit that Durant can do some things LeBron cannot at this point in his career.
"Different situation. Danny Ainge inherited a middling Celtics team in 2003 that already had a star player in hand (Pierce) but was otherwise full of under-performing vets and going nowhere fast, both on and off the court. They were at the bottom of the sports food chain in New England. The fastest and safest road back to respectability was to clear out the roster around Pierce, try not to fail on your #10-20 draft picks, sell the Antoine Walkers and Mark Blounts for whatever spare parts you could get, and scrape together enough assets to make a deal for a second star. Pierce was already 25 when Ainge took over and was 30 by the time they had enough to make the KG and Ray Allen trades. That thing was never built to last, it was just to put the Celtics back on the map. When the time came, Ainge would blow it up and sell off his aging Herschel Walkers to some ne'er-do-well franchise that would trade a testicle for a sniff at contention (enter Brooklyn), collect their unprotected draft picks, and *then* the real rebuild would begin.  That's now. Jayson Tatum is a better prospect than everyone we traded in that KG deal combined, and so is Jaylen Brown. We won 55 games and have at least a second-round playoff run in their rookie/sophomore year respectively while sustaining a ton of injuries, thanks to their contributions. We have more first round picks in the pipeline and our team is good and stable enough to where we could trade down or out of a given draft and get even more picks down the road, like we did with Philly last year. We have the best coach in the league and certainly one of the best scouting and development systems in the league. This team can be the New England Patriots of basketball. Emptying the war chest for 3 years of prime Kevin Durant/Kawhi Leonard would be really fucking stupid. Anthony Davis is a little better, but what happens if you trade the farm for him and he sustains a catastrophic freak injury like Hayward did? The investment you made in him, both in dollars and traded players, goes up in flames and your franchise endures a crippling setback. If you have a player development machine, a major injury is unfortunate but won't fuck your franchise.  And yes, 2008 was a cheap championship. Like I said, all it did was remind Boston that the Celtics were a still a thing, when they had complete shit for over a decade prior. What's better for ownership and a fan base, 4 years of desperate title contention plus a couple of denial years on the back end before it dies off, or 10+ years of consistent title contention creating multiple franchise icons and retired-number candidates? The answer is obvious to me. You're not gonna get the 10+ years by trading tomorrow's star for today's 28 year old malcontent."
If you’re talking guys who’ve had bad situations with injuries/contracts and now have unrealistic expectations   JR Smith  Derrick rose  Lance Stephenson  Carmelo Anthony  Tristan Thompson    But if you’re talking just All-Anti Team as in hated players (in this sub)  Russell Westbrook  Harden Kevin Durant  Lance Stephenson  Zaza  
"loool kevin durant and steph curry are the twk best players on the floor. after cp and harden, klay and draymond are by far the best players of the rest. Iggy is back in playoff form. suddenly yall have a reliable bench out of no where again. and then your coaching staff is one of the best in the league. you guys are comfortable. "
"Oklahoma, in its ~10 year regime, has hosted lineups containing:  - Kevin Durant - Russell Westbrook - James Harden - Steven Adams - Paul George - Victor Oladipo - Carmelo Anthony - Serge Ibaka - Andre Roberson - Domantas Sabonis - Enes Kanter  I cannot fucking believe this team never won a championship. It's unfathomable that, in a 10 year span, a franchise so remarkably stacked never experienced the sheer bliss of a championship. Confetti raining among a thousand cheers, an entire city rejoicing in unison, lingering joy for a full offseason- it should've all belonged to the Thunder. At least more than once. "
"These situations are tricky. While Curry is a solid player, I’m not sure you want to screw with the chemistry Iggy has brought to this team. I also think that Curry doesn’t do a good enough spacing the floor — he’s always moving. Iggy is able to stand in the corner and provide space for their other elite players, such  as Kevin Durant and Javale McGee, so operate freely "
Everything you listed for 2015 is worse than having a Kevin Durant.
what if he passes to kevin durant or rejuvenated iguodala or draymond or livingston
Yea. Also he can just pass to kevin durant or klay thompson.
"Love the enthusiasm.  Would you really not trade him for someone like Kevin Durant though?  I think if you traded Tatum for Durant straight up, C’s would win the chip next year.  "
"He never went toe to toe with LeBron. He might have outplayed LeBron in 1 or 2 games and came close to matching him in a few others, but he was badly outplayed the majority of the time. The only player that has consistently been able to go blow for blow with LeBron has been Durant.     |Rk|Player|Date||Opp||MP|FG|FGA|FG%|3P|3PA|3P%|FT|FTA|FT%|TRB|AST|TOV|PTS| |-:|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |13|Paul George|2013-05-22||MIA|L|46:57|7|16|.438|3|6|.500|10|11|.909|4|5|6|27| |14|LeBron James|2013-05-22||IND|W|46:33|12|24|.500|2|6|.333|4|7|.571|10|10|4|30| |15|Paul George|2013-05-24||MIA|W|38:49|9|16|.563|1|3|.333|3|3|1.000|2|6|2|22| |16|LeBron James|2013-05-24||IND|L|45:17|14|20|.700|3|7|.429|5|7|.714|8|3|5|36| |17|Paul George|2013-05-26||MIA|L|41:33|3|10|.300|2|4|.500|5|8|.625|2|8|5|13| |18|LeBron James|2013-05-26||IND|W|41:13|8|17|.471|0|1|.000|6|6|1.000|4|3|0|22| |19|Paul George|2013-05-28||MIA|W|33:01|4|10|.400|0|4|.000|4|5|.800|8|3|5|12| |20|LeBron James|2013-05-28||IND|L|43:19|8|18|.444|4|7|.571|4|6|.667|6|5|2|24| |21|Paul George|2013-05-30||MIA|L|44:00|11|19|.579|5|8|.625|0|0||11|5|5|27| |22|LeBron James|2013-05-30||IND|W|44:29|13|26|.500|3|7|.429|1|4|.250|8|6|3|30| |23|Paul George|2013-06-01||MIA|W|43:16|11|19|.579|3|5|.600|3|4|.750|8|5|6|28| |24|LeBron James|2013-06-01||IND|L|42:17|10|21|.476|2|4|.500|7|8|.875|7|6|4|29| |25|Paul George|2013-06-03||MIA|L|33:51|2|9|.222|1|4|.250|2|4|.500|7|4|3|7| |26|LeBron James|2013-06-03||IND|W|40:49|8|17|.471|1|2|.500|15|16|.938|8|4|2|32| |27|Paul George|2014-05-18||MIA|W|38:40|7|13|.538|3|6|.500|7|8|.875|4|7|3|24| |28|LeBron James|2014-05-18||IND|L|40:50|11|18|.611|1|5|.200|2|2|1.000|10|5|4|25| |29|Paul George|2014-05-20||MIA|L|43:20|4|16|.250|2|5|.400|4|6|.667|5|6|3|14| |30|LeBron James|2014-05-20||IND|W|42:21|9|18|.500|1|5|.200|3|6|.500|7|6|3|22| |31|Paul George|2014-05-24||MIA|L|32:14|5|13|.385|1|6|.167|6|10|.600|2|4|2|17| |32|LeBron James|2014-05-24||IND|W|39:46|9|14|.643|1|2|.500|7|9|.778|5|7|6|26| |33|Paul George|2014-05-26||MIA|L|42:54|8|16|.500|3|9|.333|4|7|.571|7|3|5|23| |34|LeBron James|2014-05-26||IND|W|35:48|13|21|.619|2|3|.667|4|4|1.000|10|5|2|32| |35|Paul George|2014-05-28||MIA|W|45:04|15|28|.536|5|14|.357|2|3|.667|6|2|3|37| |36|LeBron James|2014-05-28||IND|L|24:21|2|10|.200|1|3|.333|2|3|.667|2|4|3|7| |37|Paul George|2014-05-30||MIA|L|41:17|8|18|.444|5|10|.500|8|10|.800|8|2|1|29| |38|LeBron James|2014-05-30||IND|W|31:39|8|12|.667|0|0||9|9|1.000|4|6|2|25|      LeBron DOMINATED him in their 7 game series in 2013        |||Shoo|Shoo|Shoo|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|FG%|3P%|FT%|MP|PTS|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV| |1|LeBron James|.510|.441|.778|43.4|29.0|7.3|5.3|1.4|1.4|2.9|   |2|Paul George|.475|.441|.771|40.2|19.4|6.0|5.1|0.6|0.3|4.6|  Since 2011 when Durant became a superstar, H2H PO &amp; RS       |Player|G|W-L|MPG|PPG|REB|AST|TOV|TS%|ORTG|DRTG|NET RTG| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Kevin Durant|24|11-13|39.47|31.2|7.1|4.5|3.2|64.7|123.15|109.79|+13.36| |LeBron James|24|13-11|40.36|29.6|9.0|7.3|4.5|59.1|115.23|109.08|+6.15|    "

"Because when you strike out on signing Kevin Durant, you gotta make a splash by signing ~~Al Horford~~ Ian Mahinmi."
"No but a team of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Anthony Davis would be better."
"Harden and Westbrook both had a better regular season than him last year hands down, and I would rather have Harden than Kawhi Leonard any day of the week.  **Edit-  Late add - Personally, here are the players I would rather have than Kawhi Leonard for next season:   - LeBron James     - Kevin Durant   - Steph Curry   - James Harden   - Anthony Davis"
They also did not have Kevin Durant
"Yeah, because Donovan is 6’2” so Capela can use his length to easily contest even if he gets by him or creates space for a jumper. Meanwhile Kevin Durant is 7 ft tall with an unblockable jumper that is money from every spot on the floor. No one can bother his shot and he has a huge quickness advantage on Capela."
It's very hard to improve your team when you pick so late in the draft. He can't make Lowry and Derozen better he can only improve the players around them which he did. It's not as easy as picking up Anthony Davis or Kevin Durant in free agency. 
"&gt;  What I'm trying to say is if they lose in a CLOSE back and forth series that goes to 6-7 games then what's wrong with that?  well its because its shameful as fuck, because  &gt;Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team that made it to the NBA Finals and lost in game 7."
Kevin Durant committing one of the biggest pussy moves in the history of the league is another reason people don't like the Warriors at this point. 
"i'm happy about bobby knight and donny, but when you watch this team play you can tell steph is not the best passer.  he turns it over too much, and makes wild, bonehead throws across the court. one sec, i'm going to go find the potential assist to bad pass turnover ratio for the whole GSW squad and list them in order:  POTENTIAL ASSIST/BAD PASS TO RATIO GSW:  1. Quinn Cook: 96 (holy crap)  2. Kevon Looney: 16.25  3.  Patrick McCaw: 13.  OK.  Obviously this suffers a little bit from SmallSampleSize-Itis.  I'll rerun this but filter by Klay's total passes per game.  You only get counted if you pass as much as or more times than Klay. (arbitrary but reasonable)  POTENTIAL ASSIST/BAD PASS TO RATIO GSW FILTERED BY KLAY:  1. Quinn Cook (Holy Crap): 96  2. Andre Iguodala: 12.3913  3. Kevin Durant: 9.411765  4. Draymond Green: 8.776978  5. Stephen Curry: 6.730769  6. Klay Thompson: 5.972222 (that's the entire list)  so Cook has been an incredible passer for us in this short stint but it appears the true best passers on the dubs are Igloo, KD, and Dray in that order. I'll save this spreadsheet so i can run more numbers for you if you want  "
"Kevin ""Harrison Barnes"" Durant"
"Ariza is 6'8"" and has a 7'2"" wingspan, Capela is 6'11"" with a 7'4.5"" wingspan. I'd consider that one of our best players to match up against KD, considering what we need from Capela. There's no way in hell I or any other fan would be okay with Capela being a primary defender guarding Kevin Durant. If Capela is forced to the perimeter on a switch, that's something we can live with because he's pretty good at that but it's not something you want to see primarily from him and you definitely do not want him trying to stick onto KD all game."
Y'all cut Harrison Barnes and added Kevin fucking Durant.
"The thing is, you can still guard the perimeter and have effective rim defense. Capela should not be guarding Kevin Durant, we have tall and long defenders that can try to get in his way but it's pretty much impossible if AD can't have much success. You also underestimate how much the Warriors use multiple screens or cuts to punish teams in the paint. They do that effectively and that's something we need to be on top of because if Capela is sucked out to the perimeter guarding KD they will make us pay a majority of the time unless we play perfect defense."
Imagine Kevin Durant using a burner account to say Westbrook was the only reason he liked playing for OKC.
"Kevin Durant is the better player, but Steph is clearly the mvp of the team out of the two of them"
LeBron Raymore James James Edward Harden Kevin Wayne Durant 
Imagine playing in a way that doesn't make Kevin Durant leave
But r/nba told me that Kevin Durant killed basketball when he went to Golden State
Kevin Snake Durant
"It's Kevin Durant. He eats everyone alive. Jrue guarded him as well as could be expected. Honestly, AD needs to work on whatever he needs to over the summer to be ready to guard Durant next year. We'll have DMC to help protect the rim, freeing up AD to play more defense on the perimeter. "
"I hope people didn't wait too long for this series, as it's just as likely to be a 4-1 Warriors cakewalk as it is to be a competitive, fun series. Thanks, Kevin Durant!"
"Nah, fuck Kevin Durant"
&gt;  there's absolutely no shame in losing a close series to these Rockets  I repeat. Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team that made it to the NBA Finals and lost in game 7. Quit this bullshit narrative like the Warriors should expect anything less than a championship. 
Houston vs Golden State --  Predictions:  * It will go seven games. * This will be the most watched non-Finals NBA series ever. * Chris Paul will be closing out games because James Harden won't be able to get beneficial foul calls down the stretch. * Kevin Durant will eat Trevor Ariza or PJ Tucker alive on offense. Expecting averages of 35/10/7 from Durant this series.   Can't wait!
Kevin Durant
"That Clipper team lost the next round to OKC and Kevin Durant, who I believe is on the Warriors now. Then that OKC  team lost to San Antonio in the conference finals and then beat LeBron and Miami in the finals.  Then the next season, LeBron went to Cleveland and the Warriors beat them in the finals.   My conclusion: shit that happened 4 years ago more than likely will not effect the present day.More evidence may be needed though."
Yah but what about Kevin Durant who eliminated CP3 in 2014?
"the warriors are absolutely better for adding Kevin Durant. Knowing reddit, someone will interpret this as me saying otherwise unless I say that explicitly. The thing is though, look what it did to Durant and Curry individual when he showed up. Neither Durant or Curry can have an MVP caliber season while playing with each other, because there's only 1 basketball, and they have to share the spotlight. Harden has to share the spotlight with Chris Paul, and Chris Paul is still good, but that's not comparable. Harden looked like an MVP over Durant and Curry, because he's got more space to himself. If Durant or Curry didn't have to share as much, they'd both look better than harden.   Point being that if you did that with any team that went against them, the same effect would apply to that team to. Maybe you could list 5 guys, and the sum of their parts would be greater than the sum of the warriors parts, but it's not about the sum of the parts. It's about how they work together. Look what happened to both Kevin Love, and Chris Bosh when they played with Lebron, and another solid ball handler. They both got diminished. The team that would oppose them could have max, 2 guys who get to really spread their wings. I don't know if any 5 guys could beat the warriors barring injury. They just play too well TOGETHER.  "
Kevin Durant was the final Infinity Stone.
Kevin Durant &gt; Harrison Barnes. Barnes was a choke fest in the finals. 
Kevin Durant more than makes up for anyone they lost 
"LMFAO.  The Warriors with Kevin Durant on the floor are 24-3 in the playoffs while winning a championship. The team that won 73 games in a season after winning the ring added the 2nd best player in the world and one of the best scorers ever, which is the only thing they lacked. They were one Harrison Barnes performance (30/30/60 splits are not good it turns out) or one Draymond Green suspension away from winning 3 times back to back.  This sub is not reactionary in this take, this Warriors roster is the best team ever in the history of the league.  They have gone through the Spurs and Pelicans easily with KD shooting 28% from 3, Curry missing more than half of the games and Klay struggling in hard in 3 games (5/13, 4/16, 4/20)"
Did Kevin Durant and or Lebron James die?
Devil In A New Dress - Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant is effectively increasing his earning potential down the road if need be. Value isn't always monetary within the moment.  I'm a software engineer. Early in my career I took a $12,000 a year pay cut to move to a different company to work under someone who had much greater knowledge of the field I wanted to be in. Because of that, leaving that job for my next job gave me a much higher salary.  Having that one ring has already increased his earning potential. If he was to leave, he's incredibly more valuable with the amount of dominance and a championship ring he's been given from the GSW.  Everyone is so pissed off at KD because ""they can't beat the Warriors."" Houston has a MASSIVE CHANCE at beating the Warriors. Take a look at your own organization, identify what's wrong with *yours.* Leave the salt elsewhere."
You mean Kevin Durant right?
"Seriously. People don't seem to get that KD isn't a bitch for leaving the Thunder, he's a bitch for joining the Warriors. If he truly felt like he couldn't win with those cats, he had a bunch of other teams to join and instantly make contenders. Instead he chose the easy way out, tarnishing his legacy forever. Fuck Kevin Durant. "
You see curry and klay struggling? You realize they’re 2 off the best 3 shooters in history right? And when they’re not shooting you have to deal with Kevin fucking Durant
I was thinking about what the perfect lineup around LeBron would be... Really good 3pt shooting and floor spacing with some players that can get their own shot if need be and defend on the other end.  Something like this:  1. Steph Curry - Greatest shooter in history and can get his own shot  2: Klay Thompson - Top 5 shooter in history and great defender  3: Kevin Durant - 38.4 career 3pt% really good defender on D  4: LeBron James   5: Draymond Green - former DPOY 32.7 career 3pt% and adds tenacity  Now if only there was some way for them to all be on one team... hmm 
"Did this fuck just say the rockets have more players that can shoot the 3 as opposed to the team with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant? Is he high?"
"""So smooth. So tall. So good. Kevin Durant."" -Chris Webber"
kevin durant broke the nba when he went to golden state

Anthony Davis is still more handsome than Kevin Durant
We can't all have 73-9 teams and then get a Kevin Durant.
Whose going to stop KD in that Rockets series? Klay can somewhat offset Harden. CP3 and Curry will be a wash. Draymond is arguably the best defender in the league. Whose going to stop Kevin Durant? He averaged 35 PPG on nearly 55% shooting on LeBron in the Finals.
You ever just sit around and get depressed that the Warriors managed to have enough cap space to sign Kevin Durant after winning 73 games and almost winning the title?
“Kevin Durant didn’t ruin the NBA”
Kevin Durant is basically cheat code and he will be the difference in the Rockets series. Noone cAn even hope to contain Kevin Durant in that series. Curry will play a lot better in that series as well.
KD is the best player in the NBA. Has been since 2012. Whose been a better defender between KD and LBJ since 2010?  What players averaged more FGA and FTA than Kevin Durant in the 2012 NBA Finals? I guess Westbrook is a better player than Curry based on your stats argument. Swap KD in place of  LBJ for each team LBJ played in since 2010. Do those teams not have the same success if not better? 
"Curry and Klay had a good half, then I remember this team has Kevin freakin Durant"
"It's been used since Kevin Durant joined. I like it because it has nothing to do with basketball, it just alludes to the exact moment KD decided to eliminate all competition from the NBA. "
Why would you want to piss Kevin Durant off 
Kevin Durant and Michelle Roberts when they ruined the league 
"But did you know that Kevin Durant is taller than 6'9""???"
Kevin Durant is not 6’9 
"He might have to average close to that to get past the Warriors  That ain't gon be Royce O Neale out there givin them trouble, it'll be Kevin Damn Durant"
"Kevin Durant is on another level than AD, a 7ft dude should not be crossing over and pulling up Js like he does"
"This is the best answer so far.  Despite a slew of injuries this year, the offense hasn't changed and the primary players haven't changed either.  Another year of the same may be less exciting (thus less regular season effort) but the team synergy has been established.  The Hampton's 5 line-up (New Death Line-up) is obviously the best lineup.  In the playoffs thus far, Kerr has gone away from his regular season rotations and is playing a tight 9 man rotation.  Other than the core-4, the rest of the players and rotations are based on the opposition, with a very heavy preference towards solid defensive players.  There is a tendency towards staleness on offense when Curry is not on the floor.   Curry, since returning from injury, still isn't playing at 100% either, and his defense is still not up to par.  Thus far, we have yet to see a team that has effectively defended Kevin Durant.  We may never see it. "
Obviously jordan vs Lebron but how bout prime tmac vs. prime Kevin Durant.  Another one would be Anthony  Davis vs Hakeem 
"I don't think Cavs or the fans need to worry too much. Lebron will make it work out. CLE news always get exaggerated by media. And at this point hood won't make a huge difference in the outcome of the ECF or Finals unless he comes back playing like Rodney Hood*-ie Kevin Durant*.  Title even says ""Lebron to meet with Rodney Hood after he refused to enter the game in the 4th quarter"". "
"This isn't a 'who's better, who's worse' thing. Kevin Durant is a coward who would damage the league and his own image to win a few empty rings. Instead of sticking with a team and organization that had his back through thick and thin. I hope when all is said and done that he is happy with his decision."
"Even with Iggy's contracts off the books, they'll be paying $65 million tax in 2020 should they resign Klay. Year after that, signing Draymond puts them at a $115 mil bill (mind you, this $115 mil on top of everything else). Then after that is when it gets really scary and they're looking at a $150 million bill 1 year into Draymond's contract.  https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2017/10/2/16383160/nba-2017-golden-state-warriors-salary-cap-steph-curry-kevin-durant-klay-thompson-draymond-green  Repeater tax is no joke."
I doubt the best player in the league cares if he's a leader or not. He has a leader on his team in Steph who is also the co-best player in the league. They play amazing together and they will go on to win a stupid amount of rings. Why? Because they are the best players and they have the best fucking team. It doesn't matter if Kevin Durant is a ______. He is the best fucking player and he will win it in the games that fucking matter.   If you need proof of him doing it please look no further. [This is what being the best fucking player in the NBA looks like and this is how it looks like when you take the big shot and make the big shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDnPOtgHvjo)
"&gt; In today’s NBA an iso midrange jumpshooter is basically worthless in the playoffs unless you’re Kevin Durant.  CP3? He's got a 3PT shot, though."

1. Kawhi Leonard  2. LeBron James  3. James Harden  4. Kevin Durant  5. Steph Curry  
1. Lebron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Steph Curry 4. Kawhi Leonard 5.James Harden. 
curry is my hero man but the finals last year really seemed like a KD vs. Bron series. Kyrie and Steph both played out of their minds as well and it really seemed like through those first 2 Finals matchups both teams matched up really well in that environment but adding kevin fuckin durant  has fucked that balance up for some crazy reason
"Can someone help me understand how to calculate total luxury tax burden? For example, i'm trying to understand how much the Warriors will pay for say, the 2017-2018 season. Salary numbers I am using from [Basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/GSW.html). If the GSW have team total of $137,494,845.00 and the 2017-2018 luxury tax begins at  $119,266,000.00, does that mean they owe about  $39,243,750.25?  2017-2018 season: over by $18,228,845.00   In this [article](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2017/10/2/16383160/nba-2017-golden-state-warriors-salary-cap-steph-curry-kevin-durant-klay-thompson-draymond-green), they calculate the Tax total to be 28,750,000.00 which is one bracket below what I calculated.   |Running Total|Tax rate|Current Tax|Max| |:---------------|:--------|:------------|:-------------| |$18,228,845.00|$1.50|$7,499,998.50|$7,499,998.50 | |$13,228,846.00|$1.75|$8,749,998.25|$8,749,998.25 | |$8,228,847.00|$2.50 | $12,499,997.50 | $12,499,997.50 | |$3,228,848.00|$3.25 | $10,493,756.00 | $16,249,996.75 | "
"If you play TT more than 10 minutes against this Warriors team, you're so fucked. This isn't Harrison Barnes out there, it's Kevin Durant. You can not play 4 on 5 offense against the Warriors, I'm going to go crazy explaining this over and over. Cavs get it which is why Love has been playing center all year.  Tristan is an energy guy. You can play him a few minutes here and there."
The Kevin Durant special
"There's a difference between teams dominating for stretches and lack of parity. The 90s Bulls are probably the closest analogue to the current Warriors, and while they were clear favorites to win every year with Jordan, they were not 'foregone conclusion' good. They had two all stars, not four, and one MVP, not two. And they didn't have two of the greatest shooters of all time. The Warriors pre-Kevin Durant were already poised to win multiple championships and possibly dominate for years to come, but there would have absolutely been parity. The addition of KD ruined parity."
"Lowry is definitely your best player.  Derozan is useless in the playoffs when D is tougher and teams have more time to prepare.  Derozan can’t shoot the three, so you just collapse in the paint and Derozan is happy to settle for the midrange jumpshot because he’s not a passer.  In today’s NBA an iso midrange jumpshooter is basically worthless in the playoffs unless you’re Kevin Durant.  Basically, when you take away Derozan’s ability to score efficiently, he becomes absolutely worthless because that’s the only thing he does well.  No idea why the fanbase can’t see that he’s a big problem.  That and Casey deciding not to play JV despite game 1 showing that he was a matchup nightmare for the Cavs."
...Kevin Durant
"[Pompey] ~~Kevin Durant~~ Michael Rubin tells me it was a ""total accident"" that he liked a comment on Instagram about ~~Russell Westbrook~~ Brett Brown. Was just an honest mistake."
"I was about to say, on paper Kevin Durant is shorter than Kevin Durant irl by 3 inches!"
"On paper Rodney Hood is 1 inch shorter than Kevin Durant.  You would never believe it though because Hood plays like being taller than someone is an unfair advantage.  Also, KD is a dirty liar.  "
Chuck is not the guy to ask this question. He is loyal to his era and will put anyone from that era above anyone from todays. He probably thinks Clyde Drexler is better than Kevin Durant.
"1. It speaks to the older rules in regards to Free Agency that didn't make it easy for a player to just leave their team.   2. It speaks to the fact that Larry Bird got 2 fucking future All Stars and Big 3 formed around him in just his second year in the league, thus giving him no incentive to leave, whilst Lebron got dog shit for 7 years, thus very much giving him an incentive to leave.   3. LeBron went from a piece of shit team, to create something completely new and unestablished. Kevin Durant went from a dynasty, to an even better dynasty. Acting like those are anywhere close to being the same thing shows an extreme amount of ignorance willful on your part.   4. And lol, even though you're wrong let's say you're right. Bird has a better "" mentality "" than Lebron.   Good thing it doesn't make up for being a worse defender, passer and scorer with less MVP's, All NBA teams and All Star Appearances. "
"Capable? But they HAVEN'T. If you wanna play the hypothetical game then um yeah all those names I mentioned were equally ""capable. Clarkson is playing like ass, Nance barely plays at all at this point in the postseason cuz he's been trash. Hood has gone so many games this postseason without scoring a single fuckin point, so immediately slot Cole above him. Battier was never an offensive wizard, it's his defense that matters, Battier helped guard Durant in the 2012 Finals, who the fuck on the Cavs roster besides Lebron can guard him decently? No one. Also Mike Miller hit 6 threes in Game 7, way more clutch than Korver who's been spotty, same with fucking Kevin Love whos play is incedibly similar to Chris Bosh's numbers in the 2013 postseason. And lastly, none of Lebron's teammates even compare to Ray Allen or Dwyane Wade on this Cavs roster."
Korver and JR are the same as Steph and Klay. Kevin Love is just as good as Kevin Durant. Draymond Green and Jeff Green do the exact same things on the court. We are pretty much the same roster 
Kevin Durant* really broke the league. People get all defensive about KD nowadays but let's not act like it wasn't his decision that single-handedly ruined parity in the NBA.
"And now Paul George is gonna leave, Kevin Durant and the hated Warriors will win another title, and Melo will opt in for $27 mil next season. Weeeeee"
Fuck Kevin Durant lol
"You’re right , the Raptors have a favorable matchup against Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.. not to mention Draymond Green who would obviously get dominated by Serge Ibaka"
*Call Kawhi* ~ Steve Kerr  *On it* ~ Kevin Durant
"Yeah LeBron is doing it off of pure skill. Kevin Durant is a legend, but it's easier to live up to that legend on a team with a couple of them"
"Fuck Kevin Snake Durant. If it wasn’t for him, this league would be so much fun."
I still can't believe people exist that  think Kevin Durant is better than Le____
"Oh yes, Kevin Durant, a model of loyalty and competitiveness"
"Athleticism is useless if you're mentally weak.  &gt;Basketball players aren't as willing to get hurt for your entertainment as they once were.   They should be with the amount they're being paid. Or at least quit bitching about 82 games.  &gt;How do you form a championship-caliber team ""the right way""? This is arbitrary and you know it.  Not forming a team with the intent of winning 8 Championship easily.  If the Cavs would've got Amare in 2010, no one would care. But he had to go and form a super team. Same with Kevin Durant."
"I’m going to respond to both of your trash ass comments here.   I use basketball reference too. [In 2012-2013 KDs TS went from 610 to 640. The only times Kevin Durant has had a TS over .640 was 2012-2013 in OKC and the last 2 years of GS ](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html)   Yes that matters because it reflects KD getting better shots. KD has taken less contested shots. His contested shots (where the defender is within 0-2 feet) have decreased. [Durant wasn’t too 40 in contested shots this year. However, Russ, LeBron, Harden, Greek freak, and Steph were all top 40 in contested shots](https://stats.nba.com/players/shots-closest-defender/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)   [Durant was among the top 20 in contested shots the season before he played with Golden State ](https://stats.nba.com/players/shots-closest-defender/?Season=2015-16&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)   Kevin Durant is taking less contested shots and has the best TS% of his career while his attempts have stayed about the same. What does that mean? Durant’s getting higher quality shots.   Durant’s quality of shot, directly correlates to the Gravity of Steph and Klay. It is harder to help off Durant because you have arguably the two best shooters in NBA history behind the arc. An example of this would be when Cleveland let GS get to the paint in game 1 of last year to try to curb the three ball. It lead to a lot of easy baskets.   To your point about what I said about LeBron and KD switching teams.  It’s absolutely accurate. Durant can’t carry bad teams and the Cavs are lacking in talent. Durant’s playoff loses to teams he should’ve beat are evidence of this.  All of Durant’s teams that advanced far into the playoffs  had another MVP player, a really good third option, and depth. He has not advanced far into the playoffs without that combination.  LeBron carried bench warmers to the finals against a team with a back to back DPOY  So no, Durant would’ve not beat the pacers because he’s shows he’s not the type of player that makes others better. That’s not his game.   Yo I hope you respond because I got you the fuck out of here in every way imaginable. Marin County Warriors fan gets all angry and still gets proven wrong "
"...Which is exactly what happened to last years Cavs with LeBron/Kyrie/Love that was just 1 year removed from winning a title.  Just because Kevin Durant decided to ruin the league for some reason doesn't mean that the 2nd best team in the league is ""fools gold"""

"this is the thing that pisses me off. because when they didn’t have kevin durant they were beatable and they WERE beat. the KD-less warriors was a fantastic team to watch, i found myself tuning in to most of their games because they were exciting and it was amazing to watch how good they were and watch curry’s dominance    that was a fun team because they had gotten lucky and made incredibly smart decisions with drafting and landed a fantastic coach. but adding one of the best scorers of all time to an already stacked team is just not fun.

LeBron James and Kevin Durant are the best bullshit fadeaway makers in the league
"Its a team sport. The rockets have the two best facilitators in the series who can make their teammates better and have what appears to be a massive advantage in the paint.   Sure the Warriors have some great individual players, but if you have a great facilitator who can get good but limited players open shots then you can spread the scoring around.   Houston also has two guys who have historically guarded Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson really well.   "
"fuck the warriors, fuck kevin durant and fuck draymond green "
"Kyle Anderson - 人类蠕动精华 ""Human Peristalsis"" - Because he plays so slowly  Boogie Cousins - 表妹 ""Younger Female Cousin"" - They directly translated his last name into Chinese, but went with the most effeminate version possible.  Gordon Hayward is 九妹 (""The Ninth Sister"") since he was the 9th pick in the draft.  Pau Gasol is 家嫂 (jia sao, ""Sister-in-Law"") since it sounds a bit like ""Gasol."" - Sometimes the Chinese give people feminized nicknames if they think they are too soft or do not conform to masculine stereotypes.  Andre Miller - 莫文蔚 ""Karen Mok"" - Because people think he looks like Hong Kong actress and pop star Karen Mok  Tristan Thompson - 八贤王 ""The King of Eights"" - Thompson held out of training camp in 2015 and received a contract worth more than 80 million, despite averaging only 8 points and 8 rebounds in 2014-2015. ""The King of Eights"" was a nickname for several historical Chinese rulers.  Anthony Davis - 浓眉 ""The Thick Brow""  Hakeem Olajuwon was known as ""The Dream"" in English, but this got upgraded to 大夢 (""The Big Dream"") in Chinese.  Tim Duncan - 石佛 ""The Stone Buddha"" - Due to his perceived unemotional nature  Joel Embiid - 大帝 ""The Great One"" - ""Da di,"" meaning ""great emperor"" is the title used in Chinese for rulers who are called ""the Great,"" as in ""Alexander the Great""  Steve Nash - 风之子 ""Son of the Wind"" - *likely because of his hair whipping around like the wind*  Stephon Marbury - 马政委 ""Marburyist Political Commissar"" - This is a pun on ""Marxist Political Commissar,"" since in Chinese both ""Marbury"" and ""Marx"" are spelled with the same first character ""ma"" (""horse"").  Kevin Garnett - 狼王 ""King of the Wolves"" - Leftover from his time with the Minnesota Timberwolves  Dwyane Wade - 典韋 ""Dian Wei"" - Dian Wei was a mighty warrior from the ancient Three Kingdoms Period who was a loyal sidekick of the general Cao Cao. He famously died covering for Cao Cao's retreat when they were ambushed by a rebel army. His name also sounds like ""Dwyane Wade.""  Scottie Pippen - 天下第二人 ""Second Best Under Heaven""  James Harden - 大胡子 ""The Big Beard""  Paul Pierce - 真理 ""The Truth""  Allen Iverson - 答案 ""The Answer""  Gary Patyon - 手套 ""The Glove""  Kawhi Leonard - 可愛 - means ""cute"" but sounds like ""Kawhi""  Dr. J - got turned into J博士 (""J, Ph.D."")  Steve Francis's nickname ""The Franchise"" was badly translated into 特权 (""Special Rights"")  Dirk Nowitzki is 德国战车, ""The German Panzer Tank""  Tony Parker is 法国小跑车, ""The Little French Sports Car""  Michael Jordon - 帮主 ""Gang Boss"" - Jordan's ordinary name in Chinese is 乔丹 (qiao dan), but Qiao is also the surname of Qiao Feng, the leader of the ""Beggars' Sect"" in popular wuxia martial arts novels, often known simply as ""Gang Boss Qiao"" (乔帮主).  Charles Barkley - 飞猪 ""The Flying Pig""  Kevin Durant - 书包杜 ""Schoolbag Du"" - Because he used to often wear a backpack to press conferences (""Du"" is short for ""Durant"")  Carmelo Anthony - 甜瓜 ""Melon"" - Because his English nickname ""Melo"" sounds like the English word ""melon"" which they then translated into Chinese (pronounced tian gua).  Shaquille O'Neal - 大鲨鱼 ""The Giant Shark"" - Derives from the fact that the first sound in the Chinese word for ""shark"" (shayu) sounds like the first sound in ""Shaquille."" Toward the end of his career, he was frequently called ""O'Fat"" (奥胖) - a play on ""O'Neal.""  Manu Ginobili - 妖刀 ""The Demon Blade"" - Perhaps the coolest nickname of them all, Ginobili earned this moniker for his ability to slash to the hoop using tricky footwork like the Eurostep.  Kobe Bryant - 蜗壳 ""Snail Shell"" - Kobe is ""Snail Shell"" because it rhymes with ""My [guy] Kobe."" When he was young they called him 小飞侠 or “Peter Pan” (literally ""Little Flying Warrior"") and at the end he became 唠嗑 (“Chatterbox, Gossip""), which rhymes with ""Old Kobe.""  Giannis Antetokounmpo - 字母哥 ""Letters Bro"" - Because his last name has...so...many...letters!  Steph Curry - 库昊 ""fucks the sky"" - This is an extremely elaborate pun. One of Curry's phonetic names is 库里 (ku li) and the second character is a combination of the characters 日 (""sun"") and 土 (""ground""). But 日 is also slang for ""fuck."" Given Curry's penchant for launching shots into the sky, Chinese netizens apparently felt it would be more apropos to name him ""fucks the sky"" instead of ""fucks the ground,"" so they replaced ""earth"" (土) with ""sky"" (天) in the second character. Other common nicknames for Steph Curry include ""Sprout God"" (萌神) and ""The Elementary School Student"" (小学生), both playing on his diminutive stature.   Russell Westbrook - 威少 ""Wei Dude"" - Russ's phonetic name in Chinese (衛斯特布魯克 wei si te bu lu ke) is really long so they shortened it to ""Wei Dude."" They also upgraded the ""wei"" from ""guarding"" (衛) to ""dominating"" (威).  Lebron James - 小皇帝 ""The Little Emperor"" - A play on the English ""King James"" that is also a slang term for a ""spoiled only child"" under China's ""One Child Policy""Used more when Lebron was young but now mostly by Lebron haters. His fans prefer 詹皇 (Zhan Wang or ""King James"").  "
Kevin Durant 
"&gt;yes it is because it's not even relevant to the discussion. You're trying to win this argument by pointing out that I ""lied"". If that's not a strawman then I don't know what is.  That's a different argument, and why are you putting the word in quotation marks? You *did* lie.  And now you're trying to make the conversation about whether I committed a straw-man fallacy. That in itself is exactly as much of a straw-man fallacy as my pointing out that you lied.  &gt;How do I know your remark is unoriginal? Because it's been parroted so many times. Kevin Durant snek hurr durr. And no it's not useful in discussion anymore. It happened, get over it.  Snek? What does that mean? You're too attuned to the memes. Things can originate more than once. And my remarks were useful in the discussion we were having.  &gt; It happened, get over it.  Wise words indeed. Try considering them yourself."
"&gt;The efficiency difference is purely free throws  KD had shooting splits of 56/47/93  Lebron had shooting splits of 56/39/65  &gt;With the most stacked team of all-time Durant only managed to outscore Lebron by 2 points per game  That makes no sense. Kevin Durant having a better team means he should average less points, since the offense is being relegated to multiple players. Lebron also averaged more minutes than KD  &gt;Lebron was the better offensive player.  KD had a higher offensive rating. You're objectively incorrect. "
To be fair you must have a high IQ to understand Kevin Durant 
"Great scene in Westbrook basketball camp. Russell Westbrook was FaceTiming his son, Kevin Durant. He asked to see Bradley Beal. Someone brought the phone over to Bradley and he said “great camp.” Bradley responded, “Not me, that was your Dad!"""
"Detail on Kevin Durant: ""No no.. that's soft. You can't go to the team that just beat you in the playoffs"""
"So is Kobe gonna, you know do a detail episode on Steph Curry or Kevin Durant or both? Asking for a friend here"
Yeah but they have Kevin MOTHER FUCKING Durant now. Big game changer buddy

The 2015 warriors didn’t have Kevin Durant. 
Umm Kevin Durant

Fun fact: kevin durant took a paycut after joining a 73 win team in order to save joe lacob money on his luxury tax bill
Is Kevin Durant a snek FTFY
Is Kevin Durant tall?
"Nah it’s the context of how the player scores. It’s been simple buckets for him. Like the Toronto game 2 he had, that game was a barrage of highlights and was “louder” . It’s kinda like how Kevin Durant  get buckets off pin downs and mid range and easy lay ups. You look at the box in the 4th quarter and your like wtf Kevin Durant has 30. "
We're not the team with Kevin Durant on it
"With or without home court, going into this series, the Rockets were not expected to get any farther than a six game loss by everyone except people paid to take hot-like-fire takes. There isn’t pressure on the defending champs in their own backyard, they haven’t lost since game 7 of the finals. They are so much better now than then, as crazy as it is to say that, they would blow either of the teams in that finals out 4 out of 5 games.   A 2-2 series, or any game amount besides 4 wins in 7 games and hindsight could ever have the Rockets as the favorite in any definition of the world. D’antoni isn’t feeling that that, he’s trying hard to deflect from an increasingly alarming disaster happening to every team looking to contend. The Warriors are that good and anyone who’s been watching them evolve since those 3 successive lightning strikes can see from the eye test alone how far away from feeling pressure they have been since they added KD. They’re so confident they will ultimately win a series they can go out and work a team any night they want to.   You need at least one Lebron James or Kevin Durant to contend against the Warriors core and they went out and killed one bird with two stones a few years ago.   "
No Kevin Durant has claim to Cleveland
2016 playoff Kevin Durant was the best Kevin Durant ever
"Measured by what? By eye? No athlete actually has 4% body fat. Your organs stop working correctly at that point. People say all kinds of things.   Kevin Durant said he was 6' 8"" for a long time. Except when he stood next to everyone else who was actually 6' 8"" he was like 4"" taller than them. Guess what? He wasn't 6' 8"" he was 7' tall.   Guess who is 4% bodyfat? No one on an NBA team who is up and walking without dialysis. "
Ya Kevin Durant should not be allowed to take such a big paycut because he wants rings. 
"Kevin Durant and some other people are better overall players than Lebron James. More talented or better superstars? No. However for me while I can't say for certain James certainly appears quite on coachable and unable to just play his role. Which I why I guess Blatt situation never worked out.  Like I said can't obviously be 100&amp;#37; certain about it from the outside. But if I'm correct on that, then I stand by that. Also it's not just James, I have similar understanding about Westbrook and many others."
"I guess it depends what you define as average. A 2 on 1 advantage is almost as advantageous as 3 on 1, or 4 on 1 if they actually know how to play. They might not ever win though, because they have to outscore Kevin Durant.     :     Doesn't matter if it's 2, 3, 4, or 5 he can just shoot over them. Since it's ""make it take it"", once he gets the ball, that's pretty much game."
"Just looked up the breakdown of votes that year:  1. Anthony Davis, New Orleans – 29.0% 2. LeBron James, Cleveland – 19.4% 3. Draymond Green, Golden State – 16.1%      4. LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio – 12.9% 5. Blake Griffin, L.A. Clippers – 12.9% 6. Kevin Durant, Golden State – 9.7%"
Kevin Durant?
Would you rather have Kevin Durant and Al Horford or Greg Oden?    I know that's an outlier. But 99% of the time you'd rather have 2 &amp; 3 than 1.   Its such a crapshoot trying to predict outcomes at that elite level of talent.  You could end up with Hakeem Olajuwon or you could end up with Sam Bowie.  
1) expectations are going to be too high for the Celtics next year   People will falsely assume linear implement with all their young players. They'll also not realize the diminishing returns of having all these talented guys together now playing with only 1 ball and fewer opportunities   They'll be better come playoff time but 55-57 wins is a realistic bet for next year despite them winning 55 with all the injuries this year   2) S/T between NOp and Wash for Cousins and Porter makes both teams better   3) Al Horford is a borderline top 15 player and no that's not an overreaction to this postseason   4) Few predictions we'll see how they age   A)  LeBron James is staying in Cleveland no matter how much of a clown show the roster is   B) Kevin Durant won't be in GSW beyond 2020   C) Sixers top out as a 55-57ish win team who's never a truly serious title contender. By that I mean maybe they sneak into one nba finals in an awful east to get worked in the finals at most   D) By fall 2020 Westbrooks contract will be seen as a true negative asset   5) Whenever Draymond starts his decline that's when the warriors are no longer unbeatable even if they still have Steph/KD he's that important  6) Currently the most overrated player in the nba: Marc Gasol   People liking him clouds their objectivity. Not coming off a great year offensively and he's a far far cry from what he was defensively I wouldn't go as far as what Nate Duncan types have saying his defense was flat out trash this year but it was meh at best   Translation: a big part of why Memphis didn't look to trade him is they knew he didn't have a lot of value
"- The Rockets defense has done a great job of extending their defense to and past the three-point line. The ball denial by not allowing passing lanes from the Warriors is what making stay in the game. And because of that, thank god for Kevin Durant    - Clint Capela is such a problem for the Warriors on defense. Draymond is having a hard time trying to figure out whether to be a help defender or because if he does, he will leave Capela open for an alley-oop and if he doesn’t, it will be a lay-up for whoever is attacking the rim."
"But that's more indicative of Steph being less consistent than KD.   Steph will have games where he drops like 16 points. Kevin Durant will ALWAYS get his period.   We've seen games where Steph is cold and KD isn't, but rarely the other way around. By proxy Curry looks infinitely more important because 'when he gets hot the dubs win' but he still has KD putting in work regardless. "
Aldon Smith has done dumb stuff.     Kevin Durant did what countless pro athletes in their prime do at least one in their careers. Also: pro athletes aren’t immune to the same shit as everyday people. 
"Expecting the Raptors to live up to any potential is a pipe dream.  Let's be real, anyone beating this Warriors squad is not going to happen in they're healthy. It isn't just the Rockets obsessed with them, they have been the team to beat in the NBA for 4 years, and it took the best player of this generation coming back from 3-1 to do it. God himself could barely beat this team THEN they added Kevin fuckin Durant"
Did you know Kevin Durant has a finals MVP trophy 
"It’s from a counterstike forum a long time ago, I think it was HLTV.   People were talking shit about a fairly well known player named semphis and one of his home boys basically said no one would take shit to him at lan (like back in the day when you wanted to do a huge multiplayer you’d have to go to what was called a “lan party” where everyone played local, so he was basically saying “you wouldn’t say that in real life” and went on to say the reason you wouldn’t take real shit is that semphis is muscular, is popular etc etc.   Kevin Durant should have said this to Charles Barkley. "
not its kevin durant

"Michael Jordan,  Wilt Chamberlain,  LeBron James,  Kareem Abdul Jabber,  Kobe Bryant,  Jerry West, Kevin Durant, George Gervin,  Shaq, Alex English/Karl Malone"
"Kind of like Kevin Durant, huh? What an idiotic comment. No one leads a team by themselves. Not Steph, not Lebron, they all have stars in their prime to help them. Ironically, Harden has never been paired with any star in their prime. "
THIS A THOUSAND TIMES! CURRY IS SUCH A SCRUB! DAE SAY KEVIN UNICORN DURANT IS BETTER THAN GLASS ANKLE CUREREE??!!!
"He doesnt desvere shit LOL Maybe before, not now with KD. And nor does Dantoni or the rockets deserve blame. \*The Warriors signed Kevin Durant\* The 73 win Warriors signed **Kevin Durant**.  Thats the end of the discussion. Im tired of analysts dissecting GS games like ANY of it maters. Houston could play the perfct game, Kerr could have a 'bad"" coaching game,  and GS could still win by 15.  The media did their job all year by convincing nubes that Houston was a threat \(suckers\), but Chuck and Shaq said it best: 'this is depressing'. No one is beating GS in a series for the foreseeable future. I could literally coach this team. Enough. /rant"
Well I mean that is the point. You got yourself a 73-9 team and that was overwhelming but still bearable clearly. The fact you added Kevin Durant to the mix makes it just stupid and we’re all just waiting for your team to disassemble or take a step back so a new team can win. 
Because Durant is almost always hot and more consistent in general. Its like asking why Cavs destroy teams when Kevin Love is hot but might get blown out even when Lebron gets hot \(like game 2 against the Celtics\).  And the warriors did just fine destroying the Cavs last Finals when Durant was hot but Curry necessarily wasn't. You just don't remember because he's a snake.
I could not care less about Internet points   I’m not Kevin Durant afterall with all my fake accounts defending myself now am I   I just can’t post with these cats 
"Haha Steve Kerr’s main adjustment was hedging screens early in the game.  That was Steve Kerr’s great idea after three days off.   After about five minutes, Houston took the lead, Kerr called a timeout, Steph Curry complained, and they scrapped it. So Kerr’s big adjustment was a complete failure and they abandoned it.    Shortening the bench, to the extent that you can call that an “adjustment“, is routine and something every coach that has ever lived has done in the playoffs.   His most important adjustment was adding Kevin Durant."
"It’s like a Venn diagram, where 64% of r/nba that said they wanted to punch Draymond Green in the face after he kicked Steven Adams in the balls, and 59% of those that called Kevin Durant a cupcake snake bitch, are united in outrage at Charles Barkley’s jokes about punching Draymond Green in the face.     And then there’s the 107% of us who have said much worse but pretending like we would never say such things."
"You guys act like they’ve already won 6 straight championships by 40 points in every game. They are going to face adversity like every great team has. Kevin Durant is great but he is just one of many great players in the league and they gave up depth to get him. They are not unbeatable, someone will top them eventually. It almost looked like the Rockets were going to. What’s exciting to me is that their potential is 6 straight... can they actually do it? We have no idea. "
Kevin durant and klay thompson is a better combo than kevin love and kyrie. Plus outside of love and kyrie didnt have anyone else
" it's a stupid argument just because you can't make a good argument? lol  These players all think Kobe is better, but they must all be stupid or don't know anything about basketball.  you certainly know way more, right? lol  Michael Jordan  Kenyon Martin  Vince Carter  Tony Allen  Stephen Jackson  Jim Jackson  Allen Iverson  Charles Barkley  Tracy McGrady  Caron Butler  Dwyane Wade  Kevin Durant  and more if you want."
Haha yeah and Kevin Durant chose the Warriors only because they seemed like a bunch of fun dudes
"Steph is the cog of a team that, when working properly, can defeat any team in the NBA. You can actually take [KD's word](https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2018/03/11/kevin-durant-stephen-curry-is-the-system-here/) for it, and say Steph is the system. So when Steph performs well, probably the most important part of an all\-time great team.. we all know how that goes.  Kevin, however transcendent his talents are, is only a part of that system. Unless he can be so efficient that he can be his typical venomous self and guarantee that his teammates are still getting theirs, he's going for those ISO chances. Once that happens, his teammates adjust to feed him the ball. They get Durant the slim reaper, but not Durant the player who works hard to get everybody involved."
"Yes I do, thanks for reminding me. I’d like to remind you that Kevin Durant is 8-2 against Lebron James in the last two seasons and will likely be 12-2 when this season is done. Enjoy"
"They are a team located in California, their notable names on the roster include Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant.  They have recently won two championships in 2015 and 2017, and are looking favorable to win another this year."

This guy is definitely Kevin Durant.  Edit: Whoops. Wrong account.
Yes. I am Kevin Durant.
&gt;kevin durant showing any sort of emotion at all  probably as rare as his sexual experiences
"I swear people like to feel a contrarian minority if they gonna say that Nutella tastes good or whatever. Like half the threads after GSW games are about how ""everybody"" unfairly says something not negative enough about Steph Curry. Even after a game when he demolishes rivals the threads are like ""yeah, why doesn't Curry get shit???"". Everyone's arguing but hard to say with whom.  It's not any kind of praise to say someone is not healthy, by the way, like they all seem so bent on. It's an athletic competition. It's not a praise. It's bad to not be healthy. It's better to be stronger and never tired. No one argues anything different. It's just something that happens all the time, people are more or less in top form physically. Everyone has their flaws - LeBron is not the best shooter ever, Curry is easier to tire. But with Curry there's like a moral judgement attached to it. He has to ""get shit"" or you're like a problem to society. Surreal.  (Even more funny that GSW could finally sign a player accepted by the wise, Kevin Durant, because Curry had such a low contract precisely because of his health)."
Kevin durant
"What are you talking about? These are just technicalities and not accurate representations of what happened.  The Miami Heat won 47 games during the 09-10 season, losing to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics in the first round. The team had Dwyane Wade, who already won a championship without Lebron, and who was considered one of the best players in the league.   In terms of PER, in the 09-10 season, Lebron James was #1, Dwyane Wade #2, and Chris Bosh #4. Essentially, you had the two best players in the league alongside another Top 5 player joining forces.  Comparatively, with the Warriors you had with the Warriors in terms of PER the #1 (Curry), #2 Durant, and #41 player in Green (and #49 with Thompson) join together.   The 4th guy on Miami was much worse (Haslem at #110), but the #3 guy on Miami was much better. Otherwise it's similar in that the 1st and 2nd best players in the league joined forces.  Headed into the 2014 season, you had Lebron (#2 in PER) joining up with Kevin Love (#3 in PER), along with Kyrie (#22 in PER). They also had Varejao (#60), and Thompson (#106). They also added mid season through trades, Mozgov (#65) and JR Smith (#124) for an overall super talented team.  On paper, these teams are as talented as Golden State was for the most part, especially when you consider Kyrie was going to make a jump as he was so young.  The biggest issue seems to be that Lebron's playstyle puts a ceiling on his team's success, primarily because he forces his big men to play a role that minimizes their talent. "
"All time scoring great, MVP Kevin Durant joined the winningest team in NBA history, who coincidentally had the back to back (and only unanimous) MVP to coast to a ring "
The Celtics even if healthy or the Cavs with Kyrie would be thoroughly outmatched by the Warriors. The Warriors are too overwhelmingly stacked that it is unfair and the outcome is predetermined.   The Rockets are doing what they did all season it's not they didn't try it's that they're not good enough. Mah bute or whoever is trash while Nick Young is making 3s.  Kevin Durant needed it impossible for him to lose so he could win championships and it has ruined the NBA.
[Reserved for comment about having sex with Kevin Durant]
"Yeah, the other teams had one whole off-season to add someone like Kevin Durant on a discount. Why didn’t they just do that instead?"
Thank you Kevin Durant for effectively ruining the NBA 
"JaVale ""Kevin Durant"" McGee with the postup fadeaway."
"The only team LeBron dragged TO the finals was the 2007 Cavs when they got blown out in the most one-sided finals ever.    LeBron only needed Dwayne Wade (one of the best midrange guys ever) and Chris Bosh (who put up 20+ 10+ for multiple seasons in Toronto) to reliably get to the finals where they lost 4-2 to Dirk and I guess Tyson Chandler.  Bron only needed to add HOF caliber player Ray Allen to reliably win two finals in a row.  Kevin Love (fourth in points and second in rebounds, 26+ and 15+, at age 23 on the actually talentless T wolves) and Kyrie are basically slightly worse versions of Bosh and Wade.  And Bron went 1-1 against the Durant-less warriors.   EDIT: at least try to present an argument."
Kevin Durant deserves credit for being a snek
"The takes here are so wild.  Houston wins game 2: Steph Curry is overrated, Kevin Durant doesn't pass the ball at all.  Golden State wins game 3: Warriors in 5. Playoff Harden strikes again."
"Draymond Green yelled, “There you go!” Klay Thompson gave a look of pleasant surprise. Steph Curry belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Kevin Durant hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Lebron James hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Kevin Durant is a bitch
Lol this same conversation will be had about Kevin Durant in 10-20 years.   Insert hardest road meme.
"What a fucking joke. Zero parity in the NBA, as always.  And Kevin Durant is delusional enough to think his rings with the Warriors mean a fucking thing.  Nothing like stacking the deck and acting like when you win it's an accomplishment!"
"Draymond even said they weren’t as motivated in game 2, how do you compete with this team? They’re the team of this generation, good for them but fuck them and especially Kevin Durant "
Arrange these in order of greatness:  Trevor Ariza Stephen Curry Lebron James White Mamba Black Mamba Mbah A Moute  Kevin Durant
He has dominated like this before. He never got a ring so that's fine to knock him but let's not act like Kevin durant wasn't amazing before this. He's been a top 5 player the past 7 years.   Edit: y'all are salty af 
"Curry was given Klay, Dray, and Kevin Durant.  It's all relative "
Daily reminder that Kevin Durant ruined the NBA
"When you signed Kevin Durant, you ended the league. If you want to pretend the league is still competitive so when you win it feels good then definitely do it you guys deserve it. But don’t tell me adding a top 3 player in the league to a 73 win team doesn’t nearly guarantee a championship. "
"""Did kevin durant save curry's legacy???"""
&gt; And it isn't even close. The way KD can score and bend the defense is unparalleled. Combined with the fact he is 7'0 with unlimited range and DPOY caliber defense. And he is the most clutch player in the playoffs. Is Kevin Durant the best player in the world right now? Is anyone else even close?
"There is no answer for Kevin Durant. Not now, not ever."
Kevin Durant is playing well.
imagine being Kevin Durant and htinking you actually accomplished something
Kevin Durant can suck a dick.  
"Kevin ""bitch who couldn't win shit without historically great teams around him"" Durant"
"Kevin ""Force"" Durant"
Upvote if Kevin Durant ruined the NBA
pls just give the ball to kevin durant.  curry is literally the only reason warriors aren't up by 20 right now
Kevin Durant. What a punk.
"Lebron already has 3,000 more minutes played than Jordan (in the regular season) which is basically 1 full season more than Jordan.   Lebron is the all-time leader in minutes played in the playoffs. His record in minutes played in the playoffs is going to be one of those ""untouchable"" records when it's all said and done. Lebron has 9,695 minutes played. Closest is Duncan at 9,370. Next on the list? KAJ at 8851. Over 800 minutes seperate Lebron (#1) from KAJ (#3). That's basically 20 playoff games (~ basically 1 finals run). The closest still active player is Tony Parker at 7,758 (good for #8).  Who is the closest to Lebron in minutes played in playoffs without being at the end of their career? Kevin durant at 4,793 minutes played. #49 on the list. Lebron has nearly 5,000 more minutes played in the playoffs than Durant. That's over ONE HUNDRED PLAYOFF GAMES. Even if you were under coach Thibs and Durant played 45 minutes a game, that's still 111 games to surpass Lebron if Lebron retired TODAY. That's absurd. "
Has anyone ever seen Kevin Durant pass the basketball?
You know school is out when the top comment is someone trying to insult Kevin Durant by calling him gay
Kevin Durant

Kevin Durant.

"Lol /u/sbahir1 trying to fish some controversy gold so badly.  contxt matters kid   &gt; Apparently, Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni told Warriors All-Star forward Kevin Durant during Game 7 that his team would have won the series if Paul played.  Might want to include that this was said BEFORE Kerr said Iggy would've won in 5. Gtfo. "
"Replace Morris, Rozier, and Smart chucking up threes in crunch time with Kevin Durant, and he makes it to the Finals"
"I feel like we’re trapped in a bad alternate timeline where In reality Steph Curry was supposed to tweak his ankle on Eric Gordon resulting in the Rockets moving on to the Finals where they beat Cleveland in 6.  Lebron and Kevin Durant then go on to join forces in LA in order to take on the Warriors, Rockets, Lakers, Spurs, Celtics, and all the other top notch teams that emerge in order to cement their legacies back to back. As Clippers.  KD needs clippers. "
"I am enjoying watching LeBron carry his team, but fuck Kevin Durant."
Yeah it's super fun when a team can lose Kevin Durant to injury and still have the 2 greatest shooters of all time. It's super fun when Steph can get Injured and you still have a the world's 2nd best player and a DPOY and an all time great shooter. It's super fun when Klay can get hurt and could probably heal up in a minutes time with free chocolate milk. 
"See, you're relying on the fact that everyone else on here is 15 and can't call you on your bullshit, but I'm not, and I can. That's bullshit. This isn't normal. A dynasty is one great team. One. It isn't one ***man*** making the Finals for an entire decade as he drags the team of his choice behind him, and it isn't a superteam signing the second-best player in the league right after beating him in the WCF. Cats didn't used to do that back in the day. That would have been like Charles Barkley signing with the Bulls after losing to them in 93. That would have outraged everyone, and rightfully so, because it would have been shit that made the league boring as hell.  Speaking of Chicago: the Bulls went to the Finals 6 times with Jordan, and they faced 5 different teams. When they faced the Jazz in *back to back* Finals, people were already saying that it was boring and uninteresting, and that was with the angle of the Jazz being able to seek revenge. Even then people were tired of seeing it. The Celtics-Lakers rivalry, the longest and most storied in the history of the league, has never seen those teams meeting more than twice in a row in the Finals.  This isn't a dynasty. If you want to call the GSW a dynasty, that's fine. If you want to call Lebron a one-man dynasty, fine. But this same *exact* pairing that makes the entire regular season irrelevant? That's not a dynasty, and since Golden State signed Kevin Durant, it's really not even much of a rivalry. It's just boring."
"I don't mind the Warriors...  ...but goddamn, their fans are just god-awful.  Their unbridled optimism just shows how fucking immature most of them are. One hot Game 7 Win and they're ready to claim the the NBA finals over the Cavs without even playing and declare themselves ""Kings of Basketball"" again? Give me a break. That shit lasted a cool five minutes in 2016. The refs in the NBA are just horrendous. I appreciate the average Laker fan since generally they seem to be a lot more educated on the dynamic of a basketball season, especially during this 0-27 streak when the stupid Rockets aren't hitting from 3. The cavs certainly won't be hitting the panic button. But every Dubs fan I know will be quick to point out ""LOL youre 5 seasons removed from the playoffs, money doesn't buy wins"" like shut the fuck up our entire core is home grown you fucks. Fuck Kevin Durant. Talk to me again when your team can survive without cheatin’ refs or facing injured superstars.  And holy shit, I can't wait until their team fucking implodes because there's no way their players can maintain this against Lebron. But even guys like Jalen and Reggie that I respect are saying that this Dubs team is comparable to the Showtime Lakers like give me a break, in your dreams.  God, Warriors fans are the fucking worst.  "
Is recruiting Kevin Durant to an already stacked superstar team REALLY earning it?
"&gt;Apparently, Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni told Warriors All-Star forward Kevin Durant during Game 7 that his team would have won the series if Paul played. While unwinding long after the win with Morton’s The Steakhouse cuisine and a cold one, Kerr responded to those words by saying, “We would have won the series in five if Iggy played.”  this is the entire thing. take it as you will"
Kevin Durant eating cupcake is the best part.
"Not because ""THEY DONT LIKE IT"", but because ""THEY CANT RESPECT IT"".    Are you, as competitive and hard working person, seriously going to respect Kevin Durant,going to GSW just to win a title fast and easy ?    No you will not, you will not give him any credit because thats a pussy move.    In a same way, you will not give any credit to team that comes together to win a title fast and easy and then later disbands.    I can not put ""superteam"" on any scale because to consider a team great, you have to acknowledge their greatness, hard work and dedication to stay together and say ""we will win this, we will improve to win as a unit""  and as such, show respect.   **Looking at Dallas Mavericks 2010-11, I take my cap off to that team.**      **Sure, looking at it from angle ""who can beat Bulls team"", yea most of these todays teams might have some shot at beating Bulls and being considered ""super team"" in that way.**    But listen to this...   Even tho James Harden is MVP, I do not respect him at all for his playstyle.   No one is going to remember him with ""that guy worked hard, played hard, never cheated the game"" in a heart to heart conversation.   Everyone is going to say ""he always looked to draw foul, he played sneaky, flopped"".   Same way with these teams that form in a ""superteam"" way.    You know what Kobe once said in a ""PRE SEASON"" game  when asked ""Kobe its pre season, why are you playing""   Kobe said ""People pay their hard earned money to come watch us play, Imma play""    And then on other end you got Lebron who sits out games in mid season and flops.    Not a role model to follow and respect, same with these ""superteams"".  "
"Then I don't see consistency in your argument.  You're judging James Harden off basically 1 series against GSW (if you're saying he hasn't (proved his worth"") and seemingly lofting LeBron off 1 series against an injury riddled Boston team.  LeBron played phenomenal, but it's easier to perform when you're being guarded by Marcus Morris than Kevin Durant."
"Mostly this thread is just people who didn't actually read the article, which adds this crucial detail:  &gt; Spears noted that Kerr's comments were in response to Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni telling Kevin Durant during Game 7 that the series would have ended differently had Paul played the final two games. Houston guard Eric Gordon echoed similar sentiments after the season-ending loss."
Speaking of classless... You must HATE Mike Dantoni...   &gt; Spears noted that Kerr's comments were in response to Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni telling Kevin Durant during Game 7 that the series would have ended differently had Paul played the final two games. Houston guard Eric Gordon echoed similar sentiments after the season-ending loss.
"Bruh we just pretending that context isn't a thing, or are y'all just ignoring the actual articles now...?  &gt; Spears noted that Kerr's comments were in response to Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni telling Kevin Durant during Game 7 that the series would have ended differently had Paul played the final two games. Houston guard Eric Gordon echoed similar sentiments after the season-ending loss."
I'm sure James Harden would've had a much better playoff series if he was being guarded by Marcus Morris instead of Kevin Durant lol
"“Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni told Warriors All-Star forward Kevin Durant during Game 7 that his team would have won the series if Paul played. While unwinding long after the win with Morton’s The Steakhouse cuisine and a cold one, Kerr responded to those words by saying, “We would have won the series in five if Iggy played.”  https://theundefeated.com/features/golden-state-warriors-reigning-champs-are-headed-back-to-nba-finals/"
If D’antoni was actually saying shit like this mid game then what Kerr said is justified. But I’m gonna need a little more concrete evidence than “apparently D’antoni told Kevin Durant they would have won”
"1 year ago, Steph was perceived as choking in 2 Finals in a row, the image of Steph getting blocked from behind by LeBron was seared into fans’ memories, and the Warriors had blown the 3-1 lead the previous season.  It was widely accepted that the Warriors’ revenge and Steph’s redemption in ‘17 was owed almost entirely to Kevin Durant and his MVP performance in the Finals.  But since then, the West got so much tougher, and the Warriors struggled so much more, that KD has become the scapegoat for those with short memories."
I think the Warriors dynasty would be more celebrated if it didn't mean recruiting Kevin Durant. Everyone feels cheated after that. 
"&gt;Apparently, Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni told Warriors All-Star forward Kevin Durant during Game 7 that his team would have won the series if Paul played.   Since no one's reading the source. Kerr said this in response to D'Antoni trying to make excuses mid-game and downplay the Warriors' achievement."
Shaun Livingston = Lion Nut Shavings  Kevin Durant = Drunk Native  Klay Thompson = Lanky Mop Shot  Nick Young = Gunky Icon    
"Kevin Durant is Kevin Durant, but the mystery box could be anything, it could even be Kevin Durant!"
"How is this going to be accomplished?    Y'all are 28 million dollars over the cap next year if KD doesn't opt out after this year, with only 8 players under contract (Curry, Durant, Thompson, Green, Iguodala, Livingston, Jones, and Bell).    Loony is an unrestricted free agent after this year because GSW didn't pick up his team option in 18-19.   You've got 35 million dollars tied up in a 34 year old Iggy for the next 2 years, and 16 million tied up in 32 year old Shawn Livingston, which is why you already have 85 million dollars committed in 19-20.    2019 happens  the same season you have to try to re-up Klay and Kevin while Curry is making 40 million a year at 32!   And that's assuming everyone can stay healthy.  If the Yao/TMac years taught me anything, it's that there's nothing worse than having the best roster in the league that just can't stay healthy."
"Jesus christ this combination of delusional and confidence in your delusions is ridiculous.  You believe in Kevin Durant more than most MAGA dumbasses believe in Trump but you're both equally insane and stupid sounding.   You're just objectively wrong dude, get out of whatever retarded little GSW circle jerk you've been in for the last two years and quit ignoring reality. Your opinion doesn't make a legacy, it's the entire public perception that does, and you are 100% disconnected from the real world on this.   "
If Melo were Kevin Durant the Thunder would be contenders.
Would you rather have Kevin Durant or the mystery box? 
"Kevin Durant was easily the MOST liked player in the NBA. Calm demeanor, and do it all player. He's one of if not the most complete offensive players ever, and he was so fun to watch. You're right, I hate that I have to hate Kevin Durant. Basketball was better when I didn't."
8:42		Kevin Durant makes 25-foot three point jumper (Stephen Curry assists)	50 - 58   7:48		Nick Young makes 25-foot three point jumper (Kevin Durant assists)	53 - 58   4:29		Kevin Durant makes 25-foot three point jumper (Draymond Green assists)	61 - 61  
So LeBron has made 8 straight finals out of the East but Kevin Durant took competitiveness out of the league?  OK.
Kevin Durant - I ruined basketball 
"Yea Kevin Durant is the biggest pussy in sports. What would sports be if all players joined the teams that they lost to. KD is pathetic, he couldn't win a championship on his own "
Kevin Durant- Naked Ruin TV
I need you to understand something so you don't sound dumb on the internet.  Chris Paul was traded by a team owned by the league. The league said they could veto it and they did.  Kevin Durant was a **FREE** agent. He was allowed to sign where ever he wanted
and kevin Durant 
"guys do u remember when he went to GS and everybody said ""kevin durant will NEVER win the championship with the best team in the league and the reigning unanimous mvp"" because i do and u are all just mad that he proved u wrong HATERS grow UP!!!"
"Warriors drafted Klay, Steph, and Draymond. KD was available and GSW was a good fit. They drafted their core and signed a free agent. They had the cap, the coach, the system, the players. Do people here really think that Myers and co. would pass on Kevin fucking Durant because some people would think that the rings they would win would be 'empty'? Golden State played their cards right. You can't discredit them for doing exactly what they were supposed to do."
"Play Lebron 48 minutes.  Lebron guards the worst Warriors offensive player on the floor at all times and sags in the paint as much as possible, barely avoiding 3 second calls by tap dancing out.  This will once again be exhausting for the Cavs' role players, chasing around the Warriors' stars, but I think it's their best path to winning.  Rather than having Lebron guard Durant, he conserves his energy guarding Bell, Looney, or Livingston.    Draymond is down to 27.7% on 3's on 3.8 attempts per game in these playoffs after last night's 0 for 5.  The Cavs are gonna give him the Harrison Barnes 2016 Finals treatment, so that's another hiding place for Lebron.  Draymond is going to be unguarded at the three-point line, which also affects his passing lanes, as it did against Houston.  Good teams play Draymond and Iggy to pass, and Draymond will once again make a lot of turnovers due to him being unguarded, the other 5 defenders eyeing his passing lanes, and the Warriors' laziness about coming back to meet the ball on a pass.  Just like he did during the Celtics series, I expect Lebron to push like crazy off Warriors misses if he gets the rebound himself, and then play very deliberately on all the other possessions, to help conserve his energy.    I expect a closer series than last year.  Kevin Love and Kyrie are atrocious transition defenders, and the Warriors took advantage of that last year.  The 2015 Cavs took a 2-1 series lead when they won games 2 and 3 with low scores.  Kyrie went down in game 1 and Love was already out and that Cavs team was six guys - Bron, Mosgov, Delly, TT, Shump, and JR...and they won 2 in a row from the Warriors.  Balls to the wall effort surrounding Lebron's brilliance and on-ball creation, which is the Cavs at their best.  I think this series will be similar to that one.  TL;DR the Cavs' path to winning is gritty defensive effort lineups like 2015, along with Harrison Barnes-level choking from every Warrior besides KD, Klay, and Steph.  I really think the Cavs should just blatantly ignore everyone else because I think those other Warriors will shrink in the moment."
"I thought this was common knowledge amongst NBA fans, but KD has been one of the front runners for DPOY this season.  [Here.](http://www.espn.com/blog/marc-stein/post/_/id/5042/kevin-durants-improvements-earn-defensive-player-of-the-year-shine-with-stein)   [Here.](https://bballbreakdown.com/2018/01/03/kevin-durant-defensive-player-year/)  [Here.](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2751239-kevin-durant-continues-to-evolve-in-dpoy-caliber-season)  [Here.](http://www.nba.com/article/2018/03/21/blogtable-favorites-kia-defensive-player-year-award-2017-18)  [And here.](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/2/13/17005976/kevin-durant-defense-dpoy)"
"Usually if you are trying to compliment/highlight a player you say their name first followed by the team. LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers take on Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors. Saying it the opposite way sounds like the player is just a tag along, which is what I’m assuming he was trying to do here."
"we watch the most complete athletes in the world. football players get brain damage, the frequency of fat baseball players is too high, soccer players look like they bench less than kevin durant. cant say anything bad about hockey players' completeness."
"Like 6 days ago, Klay Thompson had 10 points and blew the final play of the game. But he’s so lovable that we forgive him for the horrible games he has.   If Kevin Durant had 10 points and blew the last shot I mean we would all be Colin Cowherd."
"I think it’s reasonable to believe all the criticism of his ISOs and talk that Steph Curry is the most important player is hurting Kevin Durant, particularly given how sensitive he is.  I think if he had a better option, not even necessarily for championships, but just a better environment, he would bolt."
"Does he get past okc?  Man Kevin Durant would still be the biggest factor. Kyrie Bron and love versus KD, Russ, and the supporting cast. Tough to say but i think he gets an extra ring in 2015  Does Kyrie leave if he wins 2015 and 2016? This scenario would change the entire league and it's way too complex haha. "
" Dude that's the only one that cared about, was curious to hear Houston  reaction  for former Texas longhorn Kevin Durant. "
and Kevin Durant
I really like the Warriors... when fuc**** Kevin Durant is not around.
"jeff green or nance, unless lebron wants to this year but i doubt it.  this is another reason why everybody thinks this series will be a stomp, cavs can't match their firepower and they certainly don't have the defenders to stop kevin durant. "
Richmond: *Congratulations to the Golden State Warriors and OKC's Kevin Durant.*  Laughter ensues.
"Shutup kid. Just for that, I am going to pray to the basketball gods that Steph Curry goes to taco bell before game 1 and gets massive diarrhea part of the way through getting a rebound and shits all over Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. "
Legacy be damned a la Kevin Durant 
"Really floored to see a 3 year-long Warriors fan being so classless. You only ever see that, ya know...all the time.  Were you so excited last year after you Googled who Kevin Durant was? I bet you were stoked to get him on your team once someone else told you how good he was."
Golden State were awful forever. Steph Curry was the largest part of dragging them out of that. Kevin Durant hopped on the team once they were already great. The former causes far more emotional connection 
https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/report-warriors-players-recruited-kevin-durant-all-season
"tim hardaway \- steph curry  mitch richmond \- klay thompson  chris mullin \- kevin durant  Current warriors are the HD/ AAU/ Pedigree/ on steriods \- Run TMC,  aka  Splash SKK"
"While that may be so, should we keep Durant out as an X factor cause didn’t he avg the most FTA out of the big 4 in this series? So its not like his missed calls are as egregious as the video makes Hardens. But thats just me. I only dislike KD like i dislike Spacey, Giving the name Kevin a sour taste as well as that uncouth pointy beard lol"
"The only way that team goes 7/44 is if they are dead ass tired. It's that old school saying ""jump shots don't win championships"" Rockets had 5 guys + Gerald Green. Kevin Durant isn't getting as tired as Harden, he doesn't have to work for his shot he is 7 feet tall. Total imbalance of potential energy between the two teams and Golden State just had more since there was no CP3."
"It's just a very strange series of injuries. I wrote something up after CP3 was injured:   I can't believe how ""lucky"" GS has been with these injuries. The only times I remember the Spurs benefiting like that was in 2003 with Dirk in the WCF (when SA was up 2-1 and Tim was absolutely torching Dirk already), 11-12 with Kobe's injury, but that Lakers team wasn't going to stop us even with him and then 3 quarters of CP3's hamstring injury in game 7 of 14-15 - with CP3 playing and playing well the rest of the game. You could stretch it to 04-05 with Joe Johnson's injury or 13-14 with Ibaka's if you really wanted to and that's it. That's 3 all-stars and 2 solid role players over the last 20 years, with one of those stars being healthy for 6 games and a quarter of the series.  In that same span, SA has lost Duncan for an entire playoffs (99-00), lost Derek Anderson - who was their second most important player in 00-01, David Robinson's back in 01-02, Duncan's plantar fasciitis from 04-05 thru 05-06, Manu's ankle making him miss the playoffs in 08-09, Duncan's ankle and Manu's broken arm in 10-11, TP's various nagging injuries in the playoffs from 13-15, TP's quad blowing up last year and Kawhi getting injured against HOU/GS.  Can you imagine if LA didn't have Shaq or Kobe in 00-01, 01-02 or 03-04? Or if the Mavs didn't have Dirk in 05-06? Or OKC not having Durant or Russ in 11-12 or 15-16, or Miami not having LeBron in 2013, or CP3 injuring his hamstring in game 5 and not game 7 in 2015?  In 2015 GS didn't play a starting PG who didn't get injured, plus Kevin Love was injured. 2 all-stars in Kyrie and Love, plus multiple solid players in a single playoffs.  In 2016 they played some healthy teams (minus Love who I think had a hand issue) and Curry was coming off an injury... what happens? They lose.  In 2017 they play Portland without Nurkic, Utah without George Hill and a hobbled Derrick Favors and then Kawhi goes down in game 1 when SA is up by 25 or whatever. That's 1 all-star and at least 3 solid players.  This year they played NO without Boogie and CP3's hamstring blew up at the worst time. That's not even counting Kawhi still being out. That's 2 more all-stars. If Kevin Love is still dealing with his concussion, that may be another all-star  In a 4 year span, they have had 5-6 opponent star players and many other solid players miss significant time, while dealing with Bogut's injury in 2016, a couple of injuries to Curry, 2 missed first round games by KD and now this Iggy issue. Only the Bogut and Iggy injuries were sustained during the playoffs.  It's an incredible and unfortunate series of coincidences. The one playoffs they have a little injury trouble and they play mostly healthy teams, it was one of the most competitive playoffs in NBA history. "

George Hill has to defend Kevin Durant.  Name a bigger mismatch in all of sports.

"I was one of those Heat haters. I wish he didn’t pull me along for his free agency ride with all the showboating only to form a superteam. But he didn’t join the team that beat him down 3-1 or one that had a core with a championship (and regular season records). He did create something from scratch. Something KD hasn’t had to do. And even then, there was plenty of competition to where the Miami Heat were never glaring favorites year in and year out. Celtics, Spurs, Lakers, Bulls, Thunder were all considered to have a chance. Mavericks even showed up and upset the whole party. There was PARITY back then.   Now it’s just the 73-win Golden State warriors and Kevin Durant. Sick. "
Yes it will bro. The warriors are FAR superior to any team Jordan ever faced. They added KEVIN DURANT. 
"Really good point. Maybe I should jump onto the next bandwagon that rolls by.  Nah, I won't. I won't be line u/johngoodmanspenis or Kevin Durant. (Psst: it's the same person)"
"Also know as a ""big bitch.""      Kevin ""Big Bitch"" Durant."
"Comparing trading for Dennis Rodman at that point in his career (or any point, really) to poaching Kevin Durant in his prime from your biggest conference rival is a galaxy brain level argument"
Thread should be titled Golden State Warriors AND Kevin Durant
"In the first half, Golden State was having the same sort of calls on hard drives to the paint, and even more so on the glass where Capela and Tucker were allowed to hack and scrum for offensive boards without a single loose ball foul called on either of them.  Besides the point, Houston was getting great looks from outside the three point line and their offensive gameplan was working the exact same as it was in the first half, except in the second half they went 1-30 instead of 6-14 or whatever they shot in the first half.  Golden State endured some bad calls in the first half while they were down, and Houston was unable to endure them in the second half while they were up. This is the NBA, and you have to realize that the officiating will be bad. And there will be swings in every game where the officiating is bad for you and good for you, but it typically evens out. The team that wins, especially in playoff time, is the team that's able to best execute their gameplan and play through the whistles, and Golden State handled that much better tonight.  This can be well attributed to their leadership, whether it be Stephen Curry, Steve Kerr, Kevin Durant, or even a guy like Draymond Green, Golden State has leaders on their team. The Rockets have two leaders in Chris Paul and Mike D'antoni and those guys were both on the bench tonight. If James Harden would've stepped up and calmed his team down or shown some resolve in any way, Houston could've won this game. Easily.  So sick of this lazy, salty, ""rigged"" narrative. I'm done with it. It's wrong."
"Steph curry is the most fun player I have ever been able to watch. Fuck Kevin Durant for making me hate the warriors. That prick means I can't be happy watching Curry drill 40 foot bombs every other game because it means that snake wins. Great MVP speach though, you da real MVP mom, you da real MVP"
"I mean Lebron also left a team where he had to drag them to the playoffs, not as much as this year, but still. Thats evidenced by the Cavs becoming s lottery team after he left. Kevin Durant was on a team that could have won a championship team, just one that pissed away their opportunities. Thats evidenced by the fact that OKC, even after losing probably the 2nd best player in the league, is still solidly in the playoffs."
"Let me break down these so called ""missed calls""  1. Harden gets blocked but Jordan Bell is also jumping towards Harden who is NOT given adequate space to land. Shooting foul for 3 free-throws. INCORRECT CALL   2. Harden creates the contact swiping through the defenders arm. Rule book states it is a swipe through foul, non shooting foul. CORRECT CALL   3.  Again Harden swipes through the Defenders arm, creating contact on a defending players arm. Non-Shooting foul per the rules. CORRECT CALL   4. Eric Gordon drives hard and is met by a legitimate straight up challenge by Jordan Bell, Draymond Green closes in from behind and blocks the shot or hits his hand (or possibly his arm) . The body contact is not illegal and the possible foul on the arm cannot be seen in the replays. More replays are needed to confirm the call by me but it is an understandable no-call and block. CORRECT NO CALL   5. Jordan bell passes the ball to the corner and James Harden grabs him and possibly rides him to draw a foul by pulling him towards the Houston Rockets bench. Either that or Bell is certainly moving to block him off. Could be called either a foul on Harden or Bell. No call is understandable due the confusing situation. I can't tell who is holding who and driving the movement. CORRECT NO CALL   6. Trevor Ariza drives to the hoop and looks to be legitimately blocked by Durant. No replays are showed. CORRECT NO CALL   7. Curry loose ball, possibly fouled by Tucker, no call is appropriate if the refs want to let the play be more physical. CORRECT NO CALL   8. Jordan Bell is clearly pushed in the back on the rebound by Tucker. Correct foul called. CORRECT CALL   9. James Harden rips through the chest of Kevin Durant, not a legitimate basketball play, also called a ""swipe through"" correct non shooting call. CORRECT CALL   10. The video angle is too far away to see, but it looks as though Trevor Ariza hits Durant on the Arm as he is shooting a midrange shot. The shot falls far short, correct Shooting foul called. CORRECT CALL   I see one incorrect call, all these calls can be confirmed by any basketball referee or experienced analyst. I would like to see what other referees think about my breakdown. "
Dude what? Depends on the situation of Kevin Durant is good at basketball? Pure salt.
"What you call an arse I call a competitor, but I started watching basketball when it was at it's height the 80's. Jordan wouldn't have shook there hands either. And all this unsportsmanlike talk needs to stop. If we want to talking about sportsmanship then we have to look at the Warriors, was it sporting of Kevin Durant to join a team with 3 all stars and 1 mvp, no it wasn't it was a cop out and way weaker than Harden walking off. Always will be regardless of how many finals he wins, same with LeBron. Jordan, Bird, Magic, Isaiah Thomas and the list could roll on, would never have taken the bitch route of teaming up in the off season to coordinate where a group of players would sign. The NBA doesn't have enough guys like Paul and Harden IMO."
"Not even one team, one man, and that is Kevin Durant"
"We didn't have 3 of the top shooters of all time when Ernie was talking about us as a jump shooting team.  That was 2015.  Yes, he changed his mind after we won, went 73-9, and picked up Kevin Durant, but that's not being right, that's being browbeaten into submission by reality."
"""There's going to be a video that's going to come out soon, in the next couple of days, involving the TNT crew bringing up THAT OKC series,"" ex-Thunder player and current Warriors snek Kevin Durant told reporters on Monday. ""And I'm going to be honest with you, I'm going to need a few more Twitter alt accounts during the challenges.""  "
"Maybe it's just one of those generation bias things, you know, people comparing the ""good old days"" vs now.   I grew up watching 90s basketball, took a bit of a break from NBA in the early-to-mid 2000's, and when I came back to watching basketball I didn't notice too much of a difference except for maybe the athleticism of the players.   I would say that players today are more athletic or in better shape overall, and I think this has more to do with the progress that modern sports science - including medicine and nutrition - have made on the industry. But athleticism and skill aren't completely related. Look at Kevin Durant, he's not exactly the strongest or most athletic looking player on the court, but he has incredible shooting ability.   So, I would argue that players being more ""talented"" really doesn't come into play here as much, it's probably just that they are more athletic - which impacts the speed and 'pace' of the game."
Yeah well not even he could've predicted that Kevin Durant would be such a carebear.
[Whenever I see Kevin Durant](https://youtu.be/NNJnxRyaJc4)
"Or he could attract other elite players just like Curry did to Durant. Or like LeBron did to Kevin Love / Chris Bosh.   The league was a 4-5 team league before KD joined the Warriors. This year it was likely going to be a 4-5 team league being Warriors, Spurs, Rockets, Celtics, Cavs, but due to injuries it was pretty much a three team league. It's not much different than before, people just love to complain."
Look here's the plan. We trade Joakim noah and a protected second round for Kawhi leonard then sign Lebron James. Kristaps Porzingis morphs into Mecha-Form and laserbeams Kevin Durant into the sun. By game 3 of the NBA finals we're playing fizdale's hot wife at center and James Dolan is drinking again
"Jealousy.   A lot of hate in general can have roots in jealousy.   He exercised his freedom to upgrade to a better situation - nicer city, better work environment, the opportunity to achieve the highest highs in  his field.   These are things that are out of reach for the average guy. That breeds resentment. They want Kevin Durant to stick it out like they have to. In reality if people had his freedom of mobility, they'd take it in a heartbeat. "
You can thank Kevin Durant for this 
TIL Kevin Durant is somehow behind LeBron making the finals every year since 2010. Mind explaining to me how he did it?
Fuck Kevin Durant back to the snake pit that spawned him
"As someone who doesn't follow basketball regularly, why does everyone hate Kevin Durant? "
Finals MVP Kevin Durant :)
"&gt; if both teams were down 0-3 in the first round  How the fuck did the Cavs manage to make it to the playoffs without LeBron? At least the Raptors aren't choking this time..   Curry is a great player, but he stands no chance against Kevin Durant and the San Antonio Spurs. "

"Reason why i H.A.T.E the warriors: as a huge lbj fan, when they lost the 2015 nba finals against the warriors without irving and love, all i can remember is a drunk and possibly high, draymond green singing about how the Cavs sucked. 2016... been a thunder fan since 2011.... fucking 3-1 up. the thunder, durant and Westbrook were 1 game away from their second finals.... guess who choked? We all know what happened, durant pooped his pants and shot worse percentages that the so called (rightfully) inefficient, crazy, immature, low IQ, Russell Westbrook. Seeing how curry celebrated, I was like don't matter well be back next year.... 2016 finals... warriors 3-1 up, pissed as hell what I see it's a China klay being China klay, telling the reporters LeBron got his feelings hurt and that this is a man's game.... ok klay... what we all witnessed was the best comeback of sports history and LeBron fullfills his promise to bring a chip home... remember who got his feelings hurt going to the locker room as soon as the buzzer went off game 7 Oracle arena ????? KLAY THOMPSON, this is a man's game... huh. Having all.of that one of my favorite players, a guy who I've been following, cried for (no homo), been angry at, been supporting for so many years... DECIDES TO TAKE THE HARDEST ROAD AND GOES TO THE TEAM WHO BEAT HIM, WHO MADE HIM THEIR BITCH. I guess durant ""can't win with those cats"" ?  That's why you needed to team up with the best shooter of all time, the second best shooter of all time, and a DPOY right? Ruining what made the NBA fun. Ruining the sense of pride and accomplishment a championship brings to a city. Thank you Kevin Durant, I am witness of your ""greatness"". We all are, I will make sure your "" legacy"" it's not more than a lie and the story of a coward and a traitor, thank you for betraying the great OKC fanbase and thank you for ruining the opportunity of LeBron James to shut the ""6-0"" haters, like he said, he doesn't care about a win lose percentage he does leave everything in the floor, something durant will never do. Fuck that team and everyone who follow that mentality and justifies it. rant ended. "
"Most people don't hate the GSW though. Curry can be obnoxious at times and Green can be toxic at times, but most people don't hate the club because of the club. They play legit basketball, and the core of their team was drafted and developed there.  They hate the Lakers fans that make up the majority of the GSW fanbase. They hate Kevin Durant for betraying everyone's expectation...it was a great career move; but it was also the most disappointing move that I've ever seen."
Kevin Durant and Green. Who cares about Iggy at this point
"Kevin Durant will never be in a GOAT discussion (as in top ten top 20 etc)  He will get his rings but it doesn't matter. He's just a cog in the machine. History will never acknowledge how good he is, cause he took the easiest road and went to a 73 win championship team. Couldn't get it done with Westbrook and Harden... couldn't get it done with Westbrook.  He has his rings, he has his money and he deserves them. He also deserves to have his legacy tarnished forever. He will never be as held as high in esteem as he should be, and he deserves it."
"The season that the Warriors won the most games in NBA history, KD choked away a 3-1 lead in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors went on to lose to Cleveland in the finals so during the offseason, now-free agent Kevin Durant chose to sign with the Golden State Warriors. So the team that already won the most in history and had two of the best shooters in history now added one of the best all around players in the league without having to sacrifice anything at all. "

"By that logic every player in the NBA has the same motive as Kevin Durant, which is to win Championships."
"The Rockets were up 3-2 on a team with Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green.  “Miss me” with any argument concerning the 2016 Thunder or rebounding. "
"You said it yourself greatest team he doesn’t make this team without the help of klay Thompson, draymond green and iggy and now Kevin Durant."
"&gt; Chris Bosh made all nba teams once in his career (second team in 2007). If he was consensus top 15 he'd at least have a few more third team appearances.  when did you start watching the NBA ? Literally every google search for player rankings in 2011 puts bosh in the top 15. You can't argue against this  &gt; Kevin Love made 2 all nab second teams in his career.  again, google search any player ranking in 2014-2015 and can kevin will *at least* be the the top 10, and at best the top 5. Esp if you you're a new basketball fan, this isn't an argument you're going to win  &gt; Even before the playoffs people weren't rating them because of how they played  who are these ""playoff people"" ?? that can't be a real job title. First of all, there are PLENTY of teams with deep rotations that do fantastic in the playoffs. look at ANY spurs team in the past 20 years for example. Second of all, slower tempo is NOT the reason the warriors beat the nuggets in 2013. Like, you even suggesting that tells me that you clearly didn't watch that series  &gt; Again, Lebron's first part of his career hangs over everything. The first finals run especially.  why? he didn't start winning titles until he started forming super teams. That's what this whole debate is about, remember? You trying to dismiss Curry's importance to the dubs' 67 wins and championship, then 73 wins, and playing up Lebron's importance to the Cavs' single championship  &gt;  But it's notable that the debate being had is not who'd win if you swapped Lebron for Curry, but if you swapped Lebron for Curry and Durant to make the team equal, as a sign of what the team strengths are.  if you swap curry for lebron, the cavs get swept regardless, what are you talking about? And this is about Curry's impact to the dubs' dynasty vs Lebron's impact to the Cavs' singular championship. Remember, you made a ton of false claims about both of those things, and I corrected you at almost every turn ?"
"Dude with Draymond's goon tactics, Durant's snakish history, Klay's man's game bullshit, and Iggy literally quitting on the Nuggets and telling the Warriors he would join them mid series, Golden State doesn't know shit about respect.

Kevin Durant. 
I’m a Kevin Durant burned account. Been in the NBA first team years were tough but I got made sucks to be you losers hahaha   XOXO Snek
"**Favourites:** LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Kuzma.  **Least Favourites:** Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Jordan Clarkson."
"I mean, Oden would’ve been a good player had he not gotten repeatedly injured; Bennett is/was trash, but their was no Kevin Durant level player picked right after Bennett, so it’s hard to say. "
What about Warriors legend Kevin Durant?
"I think what others have said is very important. Kevin Durant is raw talent, a player that is long and versatile that can isolate and score on anybody. But the spirit of the Warriors, the true leader that carries that team, is Curry. Durant joined Curry's team, not the other way around. The Warriors is still Curry's team, it didn't become Durant's team.  If you are considering raw talent and size, you probably think Anthony Davis, Westbrook, etc. are better than Curry, because they have the size advantage, and can also score at will. But the way Curry controls the game in his team is the reason the Warriors have been so successful, even before KD arrived.  Curry is like the uber intelligent field general who commands the army, while KD is like a secret weapon that shoots lasers and can vaporize enemies. You don't just win with the best weapon, you also need the general to command the army. And the Warriors have both."
"&gt;Ray Allen is a bit closer, but he was not the first option before he joined the heat and he didn't become the 3rd either.  Uhhhh.... You know Ray Allen was a first option scorer before joining the big 3 in Boston and becoming a third option right?      &gt;I think your considerably over valuing what he was to better fit your argument   I think you don't know what you're talking about.  He was the primary option and widely regarded as one of the best players in his position. He was just on a bad team.   Plenty of the best big men have been in the same situation. KG, KAT, Cousins, Anthony Davis have all struggled to reach the playoffs on teams that didn't have a solid supporting cast.  Minnesota Love was a better version of KAT. He was an offensive specialist that dictated the entire offence. At 25 he was 11th in MVP voting despite never having reached the playoffs and was considered a top 10 player by most.  Kevin Love on his final contract year was traded for Andrew Wiggins. That might not sound super impressive now, but Wiggins was the most hyped rookie since LeBron, and only Ben Simmons has really matched that draft hype since.  Here are some excerpts from the trade:  *Even though he endured six seasons without a single postseason appearance in Minnesota, the 25-year-old Love may very well be the best teammate James has ever had (Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh included).*  *Last season, Love averaged 26.1 points (No. 4 in the NBA) and 12.5 rebounds (No. 3), and he ranked third overall in Player Efficiency Rating, Win Shares and Wins Above Replacement Players, trailing only Kevin Durant and James in all three metrics.* [- SI](https://www.si.com/nba/2014/08/23/kevin-love-trade-timberwolves-cavaliers-sixers-lebron-james-andrew-wiggins)  &amp;nbsp;  *Love, arguably the game's best power forward, is headed from Minnesota to Cleveland, where he will join James and instantly make the Cavs an NBA title favorite.*  ...  *Love is coming off of his best season, averaging career highs in points (26.1) and assists (4.4) while grabbing 12.5 rebounds per game and shooting 37.6 percent from 3-point range.* [- ESPN](http://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/11397368/kevin-love-traded-minnesota-timberwolves-cleveland-cavaliers)   &amp;nbsp;  *Last season, Love averaged 26.1 points, 12.5 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game. Only Kareem, Wilt, Elgin and Billy Cunningham ever averaged 26, 12.5 and 4 in the same season. Nobody has achieved that feat in 38 years. Bird, Barkley, Baylor, Lucas and Malone never did it.*  ...  *Love finished with a 26.9 PER in 2014 (same as Duncan’s 2003 MVP season, higher than Barkley’s MVP season, and higher than all three of Bird’s MVP seasons) and .245 win shares per 48 minutes (higher than Bird’s three MVP seasons, LeBron’s first Miami season and Barkley’s MVP season).*  [- Grantland](http://grantland.com/features/kevin-love-lebron-james-trade-minnesota-timberwolves/)     "

but it *will* feature Lebron James and Kevin Durant
"I mean, that's not unpopular, that's just plain wrong, not even comparing this year and the last, they added KD, how can you say a team is less talented when they kept their three best player and only lost bench players to add Kevin Durant ?"
"Unfortunately in this scenario the Warriors are so good unless you build for them you have to luck your way past to a certain extent like the Cavs did in 2016 with Draymond getting his dumbass suspension and Bogut getting hurt.  Then they added Kevin Durant.  So you either build for them and hope you're good enough to handle the rest, like I believe the Rockets did pretty effectively, or you stand a negative chance if you do ever get to face them."

I'm not following.  11 teams dominating the past X years is true, but that has nothing to do with KD, and it also doesnt disqualify the existence of parity.  even if the same team won EVERY year, it wouldnt disqualify parity...they could be winning every year while going to game 7 in every series they play  i talked about 1995 because Shaq was signed in 96.  you brought up that it was funny coming from a lakers fan, and you compared kobe/shaq to this situation, so clearly you're trying to point out that theres some issue with big FA's signing.  But Shaq joining the '95 lakers is nowhere near KD joining the '16 warriors....its not even in the same universe.  so another irrelevant point   &gt;You also won 5 titles in the 80s when Oakland has won a total of 2 so far.  its funny you keep bringing up past history, as if that has any bearing on this... lol "

Yes Kevin Durant is okay with less money because he just wants people to be nice with him and not have any bad feelings in the locker room. 
"I think Kevin Durant will tarnish that a bit. If the Warriors are doing what they are doing now without KD, then without a doubt."
Kevin Durant or Anthony Davis. Chris Paul would work as well.

Hey Kevin Durant - whachu gonna do - whachu gonna do make our dreams come true. 
Warriors 2nd best player? Debatable between Curry and Durant. Cavs 2nd best player? Kevin Love. Warriors 3rd best player? Debatable between Thompson and Green. Cavs 3rd best player? ???
"Um... having Kevin Durant completely changes the game for everyone on the floor. You can’t waste fouls hacking Roberson when you have to worry about guarding Kevin Durant. And leaving him wide open doesn’t make him unplayable since KD and Westbrook can make up for his offensive lapses. And I don’t think Luc adds more than one game if the Warriors are healthy. Let’s not forget that Steph didn’t really look 100% recovered until they went back to Golden State, and that’s probably a bigger swing in those games."
"With Roberson you’re talking about last year when they didn’t have Kevin freaking Durant to space the floor. This time they have more spacing to leave Roberson on and now he can guard Harden and Gordon, which he can do as well as anyone. Westbrook is a huge problem for the guards because of his athleticism, especially since he doesn’t have to do everything here. Luc is certainly valuable but not as much as Iggy. He wouldn’t have added more than 1 game and the Rockets were in for a 5 game loss already when the Warriors had Iggy"
Kevin Durant ruined basketball. But this is really cool though. He is pretty cool guy... that ruined basketball.
"I totally get where you’re coming from. In a vacuum, Kyrie might be much better on offense. But in the context of an offense functioning on a court in real time, Gordon doesn’t just offer the sum of his scoring, playmaking, etc.   You have to factor in how unique some of his skills are from a big wing. He can distrupt defensive game plans entirely, and make opposing teams lean on rotations they’re not as familiar with (I.e. they have less chemistry when GH forces them to do this).   He’s not a Kevin Durant level talent, but KD is a decent comparison purely I terms of what it does to an opposing defense. You keep a defender his size that’s used to defending PFs on him, and he can finesse around, by, and through them. They’re just not used to defending many players with the skill GH brings to the table.   Put your typical wing defender on him that is more apt to defending skilled wings? He can back them down in the post, send bullet passes right over their heads, release his shot higher than they can reach and then some, and maybe most importantly see the entire floor despite the D.   Kyrie is an amazing scorer, but there are many players in the league used to dealing with players in Kyrie’s mold. He just doesn’t present the same type of situational and matchup advantages GH does. And, as others have said the defensive gap does exist. Factoring all of that in, these two are roughly equal talents right now in my mind."
"Probably no one. But they have like $22M in cap space now. They can certainly trade Nene ($3.5M) if they attach a cheap draft pick like a R2 one. That's up to $25M. Then if they stretch Ryan Anderson, they're getting into that $30M+ territory. It's not that far off from LeBron range. And I'd tell him, ""Hey you know Kevin Durant took $25M this year..."""

Keep in mind that the games come out a year before \(2k18 came out in 2017, 2k17 in 2016, etc\).  2000\-2004 \- Allen Iverson: Did not get traded any of the years he was a cover athlete.  2005 \- Ben Wallace: Got traded two years later.  2006\-2007 \- Shaquille O'Neal: Got traded two years after his second stint as cover athlete.  2008 \- Chris Paul: Did not get traded in conjunction with being a cover athlete.  2009 \- Kevin Garnett: Did not get traded in conjunction with being a cover athlete.  2010 \- Kobe Bryant: Did not get traded in conjunction with being a cover athlete.  2011 \- Michael Jordan: Retired at the time of release.  2012 \- Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson: Retired at the time of release.  2013 \- Blake Griffin, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose: None of them were traded in conjunction with being a cover athlete.  2014: \- LeBron James: Was traded a year after being a cover athlete.  2015: Kevin Durant \- Was traded two years after being cover athlete.  2016: \- Stephen Curry, James Harden, Anthony Davis: None of them were traded in conjunction with being cover athletes.  2017 \- Paul George: Was traded a year after being cover athlete.  2018 \- Kyrie Irving: Was traded a year after being cover athlete.  Let's be generous and state that cover athletes that were traded within two years \(so completing the regular season during which they were cover athlete, and being traded during the next one\) are our cut\-off.  That would mean that the cover athletes for 2k5, 2k7, 2k14, 2k15, 2k17 and 2k18 were traded after being cover athletes, for a total of 6 athletes, while the cover athletes for the other 13 games, a total of 14 athletes,  were not traded in conjunction. So going by this statistic, I guess LeBron has an almost 40&amp;#37; chance of staying in Cleaveland for at least one more season.  But if we narrow it down further, because going by the OP LeBron would be leaving this summer, meaning he'd leave just before being a cover athlete for 2k19, the statistics tell a different tale. No cover athlete has ever left their team to join a different one in the summer before the release of their game, only after release. So unless LeBron does the unprecedented, this would indicate that he doesn't leave until at the very least the middle of next season.  I'm excited for the future of NBA 2K cover athlete soothsaying."
Hmm jordan once went 9-35 and had a TS% of under 40% and only scored 29.. Kevin durant once went 7 for 33 with a TS% of 29% and only scored 22 points. I know how TS% works. I understand lebron fg% was bad. Still averaged 35 13 and 8 (set record while doing so). I just gave 2 examples of the goat and Kevin durant not doing something that every single player in the NBA could do every time at minimum according to you. 
"Yes I'm sure of that. Draymond is their MVP (may also be league DPOY) and the floor general of their elite defense. His intangibles are also extremely valuable - leadership, hustle, communication - and simply makes the team much more cohesive and potent than not. The same cannot be said for Kevin Durant. You're right they'd have a harder time replacing KD with someone better than him than you would for Draymond, but that is not the discussion at hand. We are speaking of who is more valuable to the team's system not who would be more difficult to replace, which would obviously be Durant. Remember, the Warriors won in 2014-2015 WITHOUT KD, dissolving the notion that they'd even need to replace someone with KD as good or better because they don't need him to win. This has been proven, while the Warriors being able to win without Green has not.  Your last two points are completely contradictory and your last one essentially says what I was saying above. You're exactly right that any right-minded GM would take KD over Draymond, I would as well, proving he is better than Dray if you don't consider the system a la ""in a vacuum"". You say this means he is more valuable. Then you say ""I don't know what a player in a vacuum looks like, sorry. For me the talk only makes sense relative to a given system."" Do you not see how these are totally conflicting arguments?"
"Yeah, you already did that when you started complaining about Kevin Durant signing for the Warriors, in a thread about him paying for kids' tuition."
"This is true, and klay is arguably the second best shooter ever. Insane that the #1 and #2 best shooters ever are on the same team. Oh and they also have this rando named Kevin Durant. If I didn’t hate them so much for all the shit they talk (mainly draymond, sometimes steph) and just thinking they’re so badass they’d be really fun to watch. Klay is easily my favorite player on the team, best 2 way player for sure. "
Kevin Durant. He plays the Harrison Barnes role better than the original.
"""Remember Lebron if you cant beat em, join em"" - Kevin Durant"
"Overhype? I dont know what team youre watching, but this was a team that went 73-9 before they added Kevin Durant.  Theyve been cruising the entire season and most of the playoffs, and have made it to the finals again. Just to face Lebron and his YMCA buddies"
"They drafted well, rebuilt the whole team, didn't give on Curry when he was quite average and injury prone, and then when they became a 73 win team, but lost in the finals, they recruited Kevin Durant.   &gt;  Horrible for the league parity, but as a front office, they did everything right, which is quite rare these days"
He isn't like Kevin Durant dude.. He doesn't want rings handed to him.
I LOVE YOU KEVIN DURANT!!!
"By Kevin Durant, as told through burner accounts   &gt;Man, KD took the hardest road and was Finals MVP 3 times! Even if Steph won Finals MVP 5 times you can’t discount that KD is right up there with LeBron   &gt;KD has never been on a super team, he only teamed up with 3 all stars because they couldn’t beat the arguable GOAT even though KD is better than that guy anyway   &gt;The Warriors for KD were like how college was for a lot of other players in that they paid him a lot of money under the table to make it worth his while and they told him not to worry about any of the hard work as long as he would play basketball for them "
"It was a big deal that Derrick Rose went before Beasley. The year before Kevin Durant had put up unheard of college freshman numbers then Beasley put up even better ones. Beasley seemed like the guy, with Rose putting up good but more typical college PG numbers. By draft day it was expected Rose would go 1 but most people still considered Beasley the top prospect."
Kevin Durant frequently can't even beat his man off the dribble. I don't like it at all.
Kevin Durant is a pussy.
*Michael Jordan played against plumbers. Kevin Durant led the meager Golden State Warriors past the mighty LEBRON JAMES all by himself.*
"This is a great justification, if only he was David West and not MVP top 3 player in the league Kevin Durant."
"&gt;At that time in my career, I didn’t know how other people felt about my game...   For real? Says the 2014 MVP. Top-3 player in the game. He makes it sound like he's surprised the Warriors wanted him at all. Even the full quote would make more sense if uttered by Quinn Cook, not Kevin Durant. "
"&gt; So those Celtics didn't exist and the game 7s never happened I guess lol.  Lebron in Miami met the Celtics twice. One time they went 7 games, the other time it only went 5 games. I’m talking from 2011-2017 playoffs.   &gt; Warriors went like 16-1 last year so I guess the West is just as bad.  Warriors had KEVIN DURANT on their team, and had a super duper squad. They played a Portland team in the first round missing their best big man (Nurkic). And against the Spurs, as we all know, lost Kawhi during Game 1 and for the rest of the series.   &gt; Jordan never plays a game 7 in the Finals = proves his dominance.  Yup  &gt; LeBron sweeps playoff series = proves East is weak.  From 2011-2017, he was either on a super team in Miami, or playing with all-star Kyrie Irving...in a relatively weak Eastern conference. Seriously, this year is the only year where the Eastern conference was comparable to the Western conference in a long time. Still not as good though.   &gt; Wanna talk about how each of Jordan's 3 peats started during expansion years?  Oh, fuck this is your argument?? Lol  &gt; How he took off 18 months to recoup between title runs?  You honestly think he retired because he was TIRED?? Lol, his dad was brutally murdered, and he lost passion for basketball you moron.   From 1993: http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-06/news/mn-42811_1_michael-jordan  *”That only fueled a fire of further speculation, one that swept through this city like the Great Chicago Fire of the previous century. While Jordan himself was ducking questions at the baseball game, his coach, Phil Jackson, told the Denver Post that his superstar had indeed decided to play no more”.*  *”Jackson said that the death of James Jordan robbed his son of his desire to play basketball. According to the paper, a source close to Jordan said the star just didn't have the fire to play anymore”.*  &gt; How he ducked Houston in the Finals?  As if he could foresee Houston making it to the Finals?? Even so, there is no evidence of Jordan being scared of them and “ducking” them. Jordan wasn’t scared of anyone or any team.   &gt; How the only year he played Shaq in the playoffs he lost?   Jordan played the Magic in the 1996 Eastern conference Finals. The Bulls swept Orlando.   I’m done with this, already proved my point...and disproved yours. Take this L. "
"Heyyy I didn’t say that I hate them! But I’m saying that it’s a team that many nba fans just do not like them (Kevin Durant for joining a 70 win team, draymond for his antics, etc)"
Kevin Durant will be on the roster of the last two nba champions but still has zero rings

"And in a shocking turn of events, Kevin Durant is confirmed to have orchestrated 9/11. More on Hot Takes at 11."
"On the one hand, what you're saying logically makes sense. On the  other hand, Kevin Durant.  Soft is a mentality, not a physicality.  Of course staying in the NBA itself isn't easy, but talent can get you pretty far alone. "
"And LeBron never lost in the first round like Jordan did, so what?  None of those teams were as good as these Warriors and no player Jordan ever guarded or played against was as good as Kevin Durant. Craig Ehlo? Jeff Hornacek? Danny Ainge?  Bron has been torching Kawhi Leonard, Andre Iguodala and Kevin Durant for the past 6 years in the Finals and loses because his team just isn't good enough."
Kevin Durant and Monty python 
[Meanwhile...](https://www.google.com/search?q=Kevin+Durant&amp;ibp=askj;DHVq0lGp%7CBbwut1&amp;hl=en)
"If LeBron signs with Sixers in free agency, and Sixers trade for PG13/Kawhi, then, essentially, Sixers would've assembled a franchise with the same underpinnings as GSW's.  LeBron ~ Kevin Durant Andre Iguodala ~ PG13/Kawhi Embiid, Ben Simmons ~ Klay Thompson, Curry &amp; Draymond"
"How dare you, Kevin Durant shouldn't have gone to the Warriors because my feelings as a fan are more important that his. Doesn't he understand how I a grown ass man feels when he went to go play a kids game with a group of different grown men I didn't want him playing with?! Doesn't he understand how he RUINED the entire game?"
"I agree, the fact that it changes public image is rather obvious.  A lot of people denounced LeBron's ""decision""also (ringchasing in general), myself included.   However, Kevin Durant's move to GS was ever more egregious. I have no clue how people to try to defend it. It's the least defensible thing I've seen in pro sports in a long time.   There's a reason everyone calls Durant a snake, a bitch, soft...etc.  His actions and his words both speak pretty loudly to this.  I respect his game immensely, but I will never respect him. "
"how is that pathetic? this whole ""man up"" ""suck it up"" mentality is what is causing issues in our society. Dude felt like he got no appreciation from his peers, regardless of what we thought of him as fans. If he felt that way he had EVERY right to do what he wants.  Clearly he did not like that OKC culture, we dont know anything behind the scenes.    You guys call him pathetic and a bitch, how many players own up to their insecurities like Kevin Durant? None.  That aint a bitch move. ."
Kevin Durant paid me to fart in his face 
"Shut the fuck up about iggy. You literally have Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. If you want to pull iggy then we can pull mbah a dookie. If he was healthy."
"&gt;At that time in my career, I didn’t know how other people felt about my game.  2014 MVP Kevin Durant right here. 2 fucking years later and reporters are still trying to mansplain the Kevin Durant signing. "
Kevin Durant-uh! 
Kevin Durant is definitely that girl that posts vaguely intended statuses directed towards their significant others.
Deep down I still love Kevin Durant but this sounds like someone who is 18 and feels like they need validation from others. 
"Kevin ""Shelob"" Durant"
"&gt;By the way, LeBron's rosters are partly his own fault.  He puts pressure on his teams to sign undeserving players to large contracts, forces the teams to focus on short term success over long term planning.  People talk about coaches but low-key the biggest failure of LeBrons career is he has never found his Jerry Krause in Cleveland.  By the time of his 2nd decision he was old enough and had enough power where he could truly believe he could do it all himself. The saddest part is before Kevin Durant that was probably true.   "
Because the Cavaliers are so good without him on the floor...  The reason no one cares he does not actively defend is because; a.) he is still nowhere the point of being targeted with any regularity; b.) he still has multiple plays a game where he disrupts the opposing offence; c.) the Cavaliers are still better with him off the bench; and d.) he obviously knows better than any of us how he should expend his energy.  It is not a flaw that he cannot play nearly the entire game and up 35/9/9+ while also regularly defending a relatively rested Kevin Durant.
"Lebron said it best ""One of the best teams i ever played.. and then they added Kevin Durant"""
Kevin Durant is qanon 
"(mentally) injured guard JR Smith yelled out ""whats the score?  Whats the score?"" All-Star forward Lebron James gave a look of empty sadness.  Guard George Hill yelled out ""now no one will care that I missed the [expletive] free throw now!"" And before Smith sat down on the bench, former MVP Kevin Durant hugged him and said ""you're the real MVP!"""
"... This team was one shot away from 4 straight titles and you're out here comparing them to the 2011 Mavs.  Tell me who is using bullshit criteria for parity in the league.  ""There is usually only one challenger every season!""  Yeah, this is literally two times in four years, and both times they either won or added Kevin Durant.  Fuck outta here lmao, I'm not angry at them, you're just delusional."
"..the warriors are the best team in the nba, they were the best team before adding kevin durant, they don't need help from the refs, they would win this series easily on there own but the refs are handing it to them and making the nba look terrible."
"I don't mind the Warriors...  ...but goddamn, their fans are just god-awful.  Their unbridled optimism just shows how fucking immature most of them are. One hot Game 7 Win and they're ready to claim the the NBA finals over the Cavs without even playing and declare themselves ""Kings of Basketball"" again? Give me a break. That shit lasted a cool five minutes in 2016. The refs in the NBA are just horrendous. I appreciate the average Laker fan since generally they seem to be a lot more educated on the dynamic of a basketball season, especially during this 0-27 streak when the stupid Rockets aren't hitting from 3. The cavs certainly won't be hitting the panic button. But every Dubs fan I know will be quick to point out ""LOL youre 5 seasons removed from the playoffs, money doesn't buy wins"" like shut the fuck up our entire core is home grown you fucks. Fuck Kevin Durant. Talk to me again when your team can survive without cheatin’ refs or facing injured superstars.  And holy shit, I can't wait until their team fucking implodes because there's no way their players can maintain this against Lebron. But even guys like Jalen and Reggie that I respect are saying that this Dubs team is comparable to the Showtime Lakers like give me a break, in your dreams.  God, Warriors fans are the fucking worst.  "
"Players and coaches give non\-answers to avoid drama.  That's why they're always talking about generic crap like ""hustle"" and ""we got out\-competed"".  Imagine after Game 1 if Kerr had said, ""Kevin Durant wasn't even trying on rebounds"" or if Lue had said ""JR Smith cost us the game"" or something."
Lebron was 100% the main guy tho and he was great. Kevin Durant doesnt have to be great for the Warriors to win. he just has to be good
"I’m not tryna disrespect Iggy bro, he’s an elite defender, high IQ player who knows his role and won a Finals MVP. But you guys have Steph Curry, the greatest shooter ever and maybe the second best PG ever. Klay Thompson, the second greatest shooter ever and all-NBA level defender. Kevin Durant, possibly the greatest pure scorer ever, one of the greatest shooters ever and 1b to Lebron’s 1a since 2011. And Draymond Green, your 4th best player, is a DPOY, All-NBA all around player who also knows his role and plays it to perfection. I don’t wanna fucking hear that Iggy is the reason the Rockets or Cavs are being competitive. It’s such a slap in the face to the rest of the NBA.   “We’re the most talented team ever assembled in modern American sports, but you guys only gave us a fight because we were missing our 5th best player. If we had him we would’ve beat you easily.” "
"Because not every team can go out and get a Kevin Durant who will take pay cuts to get carried to multiple championships   This isn’t a GSW thing. I don’t blame that organization in the slightest. Every organization  in the league has the goal of wanting to have an unfair but perfectly allowed advantage over every other team. That team they’ve put together is the GM job of the century imo.   This is a KD thing. Everything about his choice is just really soft, lame, and killed much of the fun. A superstar has never been needed less on a championship team in NBA history. You can replace him with several solid role-players and the warriors would be just as good.   So yes, it’s a KD thing, not an organizational thing"
"&gt;Green leads the NBA with 14 technical fouls, according to NBA.com statistics. Kevin Durant is tied for second with 11. Steve Kerr has five, leaving him in a six-way tie for fourth place among coaches, which is a problem in itself.  Anyone want to guess how many LeBron has???"
"You can look at it either way. Me personally, I liked the 73 win Warriors better. That team was constructed mostly through the draft. They went through the shit together to get to the top. Through all Steph's injuries. I respected the hell out of that team and enjoyed watching them.   This Warriors team is a different story simply for the fact that Kevin Durant joined them. Steph, Klay, Iggy, Draymond and the like are the reason the Warriors are what they are today, and KD just hopped on board for the ride. It's like a team of engineers creating some fantastic new invention that revolutionizes the world, and one engineer joins after the fact but still wants all the credit after they release the new upgraded ""X invention 2.0""   Fuck that. I have a ton of respect for Steph and Klay and Draymond. This is their team and KD will never be seen in the same light as any of those guys.    "
"It's been an under the radar story that the warriors depth has not been as good this year as it was in previous years. Livingston struggled against the rockets, mcgee and west were unplayable. The Cavs abhorrent bench is a big reason why these guys are suddenly contributing at a much higher level.   Also the cavs' rim protection to start this game was unbelievable. So many blown switches, poor hustle, even some of those Kevin Love moments where he steps aside and doesn't even contest the shot. Despite that the cavs were ahead at the end of first.  On paper KD had a better game than Steph, but the Warriors go as Curry does. His 3s are what blew the game open while Durant hit shots to stifle Cleveland's momentum. Great showing by both but Curry is my picks for FMVP. Although if Durant shows out for the rest of the series we'll focus more on how efficient he was tonight.  The Cavs really need to figure out what to do with JR. Obviously they have no one to play, but you have to wonder if JR is better than an exhausted Hill or Jeff green taking on his minutes. LeBron/Hill/Green/Love/Thompson might be their best shot at this point. They gotta figure out ways to let LeBron take possessions off, with this lineup they can try and post Green, PnR with Hill and Thompson, something so LeBron can get a breather. Having JR on the court is making you play 3 on 3 against the league's best defense.  As for the reffing and commentating, I have felt bad for the Cavs at points, but the discrepancy is more about home court advantage than rigging. I expect Cleveland to get a lot more 50-50 calls at home.  Part of it is that it seems like more high-profile blunders are going against Cleveland. Stuff like the block and fast break gets thrown all over Facebook and ESPN. But JVG and Jackson are a big reason why these plays are getting blown up so much. The fast break foul  (awful missed call) gets ranted about. When LeBron throws Bell to the ground, they're silent. It's ridiculous.  Not to mention casual viewers think it's rigged because the refs are doing the same dumb shit as they do in the rest of the playoffs, but on a bigger stage. Remember the whole ""It's only a foul if you miss""? I think that's what was going to happen on the Curry shot, but it went out of bounds so they missed their chance to call a foul. Then they make a dumbass make up call. In these scenarios, Warriors are unhappy because they lost 3 free throws, Cavs are unhappy because it's their ball, and everyone else is either confused because they screwed up two calls or pissed because the broadcasters make comments on how it's Cavs' ball but never mention curry getting hit.   Anyway, I picked Warriors in 5 because I'm very confident that Cleveland can win one at home. JR will probably start because they're banking on his home splits and I expect more role players to show up.    Edit: forgot to mention this, I'm sick of seeing only black and white uniforms all the time. Warriors haven't worn blue since round 1, tonight was the first time the Cavs wore a non-black jersey since game 2 of the ECF. They each have 4 jerseys, can we get some variety please."
Kevin Durant
"It was fourth quarter, with less than ten seconds left and Golden State was down by 2. T h e arena was so loud, that Steph couldn’t hear his own thoughts.  He calmly walked the ball up the court and saw Russell waiting for him at the half court line, watching him intently with his eyes. Once Steph reached half court, he quickly passed the ball to Kevin and once Kevin touched the ball, every fan in the arena instantly booed.  ""CUPCAKE! CUPCAKE!” everyone chanted in the stands. Kevin calmly dribbled the ball and watched as his former teammate, Andre Roberson, checked him.  After passing the ball, Steph ran straight through the lane and took a screen from Draymond. Russell bumped into Draymond and then hurriedly moved to catch up to Steph, but this was enough space to give the sharpshooter room.  Kevin dribbled the ball to the top of the key and Andre followed. He gave him a quick in and out with the ball and then passed it to Steph once he saw him open. Steph caught the ball in the corner behind the three point line and quickly released it in the air. Russell moved to contest the shot, but was too late.  The clock was running down as the ball sailed to the basket. Steph had landed and watched as the ball moved in the air. He closed his eyes and silently prayed that the ball would sink in the net. When he heard the buzzer go off, he opened his eyes and saw the ball rattle in the hoop. The whole Warriors bench stood and watched. BUZZZZZ!!!!!  ""WOOOOO!!!!!” Steph yelled excitedly. He raised his arms in the air as Thunder fans booed. The team was running onto the floor to hug him and celebrate the game winner. Thunder players were shaking their heads at the sudden lost and standing in disbelief. Steph continued to stand confidently as Kevin was the first to reach him. He put his forehead to Steph’s and yelled.  “YEAH!” Kevin yelled out loud. He brought a hand to Steph’s head and smiled. Steph looked in his eyes and smiled, too. At that moment, Steph focused solely on Kevin and wanted nothing more than to kiss him. Kevin was leaning close to him, so Steph leaned up and kissed him.  It went silent in the arena, every fan either stopped cheering or booing and watched as Stephen Curry kissed Kevin Durant. "
If Westbrook ever wins a championship as the best player on his team I will eat an entire Kevin Durant OKC jersey.
"Oh yeah, [everybody on the planet](https://thesportspost.com/nba-warriors-champions-not-dynasty/) calls this Warriors team a dynasty. Right.  &gt; We will respect your opinion, laugh and move on.  Ok a) If you think laughing at an opinion and saying that the opposite of it is objective fact is ""respect"" then you need a dictionary, b) Who said respecting dumb opinions is mandatory? If someone was deadass about Hayward being best in the league I'd be like damn ur stupid if you really think that, and c) God fuckin damn bro I really hope you mean ""we"" in reference to Warriors fans in general, because if you think your individual opinion is the official consensus of an entire subreddit, that's lowkey kinda concerning... It's like you're *trying* to throw yourself into a hivemind. Maybe you aren't lookin for my approval, but you're definitely looking for someone's.  Anyways, ""we aren't looking for your approval"" is pretty ironic coming in defense of the team that signed Kevin ""I need validation"" Durant. Am I talking to a KD alt??"
"Sure, but blaming kevin durant for choosing it is silly. Blame the nba for letting it happen or other shitty teams for not being better at recruiting him"
"Second time now he has been insulted under pretense of jokes. . At the western finals another guy said congrats to GSW and Kevin Durant. Of course it was a weird move for KD to make. Being the face of your franchise, losing then going to the team after losing to them. He and Westbrook.was even laughing at Steph's defense that series. I think GSW sold him on the whole team untiy you dont have to be alpha where everywhere else he would have to. "
he cant even beat Kevin Durant 
Not really. Unless they miserably fail after he does it. Legacies are built on stories perception. Kevin Durant did everyone a favor when he became the leagues biggest Villain by joining the warriors. Anything that anyone does to beat the Durant and the warriors is considered acceptable at this point. 
"I think it should have been worded ""had a chance to draft Kevin Durant and did.""  "
"LeBron plays point guard, Anthony Davis used to play guard before he hit the league, and Kevin Durant is really just a 7 foot shooting guard. "
"Nope, everything staying the same, he's about on par with Kevin Durant at 7'6"". At 8 feet, he gets above LeBron. "
"nah, he will join Rockets to beat Kevin Durant"
"I didn’t lose respect for Kevin Durant like a lot of people say they did, and I think most people see now that it really wasn’t a super easy “I’m just going to coast to the championship” kind of move like people thought, but adding LeBron to that team would be just stupid. I think he would lose so much credibility and people would see the titles he won with the Warriors as cheap and unearned, and I think LeBron would see it that way too. He is very aware of and concerned with what his legacy looks like, and that would definitely leave a big asterisk for a lot of people."
"Damn, if this happens Kevin Durant will only be the 2nd best snake of all time."
"&gt;it doesn’t work out well for anyone really  This is the thing. People will attack Cavs or Rockets or whoever the Warriors are playing, and blame their style.   Lol it’s not their fault the Warriors stacked the deck by adding Kevin Durant. There isn’t much a lot of teams *can* do."
Kevin Durant with Kobe's mindset. Derrick Rose with an operation board game is a close second though
"It's the same to kevin durant. He's the one having to live that life. What if he genuinely enjoys being on the Warriors and living in the Bay? Beyond all the rings and success, what if he's legitimately happy because he's got teammates, fans, and coaches that show support and love? What if the dude is just trying to do what fulfills him as a complete person and not just a basketball player?  But fuck that shit I want some good basketball."
Kevin Durant is a two time champion and finals MVP because he plays with Steph Curry. It's that fucking simple. 
"i think his primary purpose is to make durant look good. I've seen this guy for a while across a couple accounts. Huge asshole, and loves kevin durant"
I thought they announced Kevin Durant as MVP even though Curry deserved it more /s
"&gt;They wouldn't have won in 2015 even with Kyrie and Love.     LOL don't be delusional kid. Actually, Cavs would have won pretty EASILY with Kyrie and Love. It's not even something new, almost everyone already know this, as a fact. Mainly because Curry, Klay, Dray and those boys had no idea how to win the chip yet, had no experience, and it showed big time. LeBron was playing with Dellavedova and Varejao, and still single handedly took that series to 6 games  &gt;   Bron was the best player on the court as usual, people were also talking about giving him the Finals MVP, despite the loss, but Iggy got it instead for guarding Bron, just how Kawhi got that FMVP in 2014  &gt;   Now add the superstar point guard and Kevin Love in that lineup with Bron, Cavs win it easily.    &gt;     Kyrie always matched up to Curry or outplayed him everytime they met in the finals. So with him and Love on the floor, Bron would have the room and freedom to operate. But since he didn't have anyone other than some rubbish players, GSW double and triple teamed him, forced him to give up the ball, and nobody else on the Cavs could do shit   &gt;  GSW never looked that invincible or scary in the post season until they got Durant. Before, they just looked cute. When they added Durant, then they got scary and unbeatable.   &gt;   FYI, Warriors always had that *opponent injury luck*. They had that this year as well, when they were down 3-2 to the Rockets, and CP3 gets injured. It was like a movie, just perfect timing. Perfect for the Warriors, i mean..  That's some unreal and exceptional luck. Just hilarious "
"&gt; The Cavs were stuck in a damned if you do damned if you don’t situation, made worse by the fact Lebron could leave at any time.  That's pretty much what it was.. and you have to default to running it all back and trying again.   And really... it wasn't a bad idea, but who thought that Golden State would pick up Kevin Durant?"
Lol remember when Kevin Durant left OKC and Westbrook proved once and for all that his insane ballhogging ways don't actually lead to wins?
[This is not exactly contested](https://thesportspost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/this-is-what-makes-kevin-durant-the-3rd-best-player-in-the-nba.jpg)
"Yeah LeBron wasn't ruthlessly criticized for losing in 2011 or anything (which is absolutely deserved).And LeBron is what made those teams a superteam. They absolutely needed him to win. GSW did not need Durant to win. They won in 2015 (granted this definitely would have been a different series barring injuries), could have won in 2016 if any number of different things happen like Draymond not getting suspended or Bogut not going down. So when you add the 2nd best player in the league to a team that already took Cleveland to their limit it's no wonder they defeated them, it's not nearly as impressive. And who did he beat this year? LeBron, Kevin love and who else? At the end of his career Durant should and hopefully will be remembered as someone who couldn't hack it on his own team so he joined an already established championship team to win a few easy rings."
Right because the warriors ONLY added Kevin Durant. No wonder people hate you if you’re that oblivious 
"What did Durant have to face to get his ring? How about the defending NBA Champions with Kyrie, Love, and Lebron? I say this as one of the biggest Dirk fans you will meet without the ring Dirk is remembered as a playoff choker. Lebron is an example for why context for a ring doesn't matter. Lebron won 2 titles as part of a super team in Miami and then formed another superteam in Cleveland and won again. And yet nobody talks about because why? Because Lebron won. The same way at the end of the day/career for Kevin Durant nobody will care that he joined the Warriors they will just say he won title with them and that he was right for leaving OKC."
"My theory is that the Warriors playing through KD are not as good as the Warriors playing through Steph. Stats back this up. I'm pretty sure their offensive rating is higher with Steph and no KD than the opposite.  Durant may be the better player (certainly the better all-around player), but your offensive ceiling is way higher when you let the all-time PG run a free flowing offense. The Showtime Lakers run through Magic, not Kareem.  By switching everything and presenting the Warriors with only one obvious mismatch, the Rockets enticed Durant to play iso basketball. And sure, Durant kills you. But then Curry doesnt, and Klay becomes an afterthought. It becomes far easier to win a low-scoring, ugly game. You also slow the game down, which is classic underdog strategy (less possessions). Which is another point--ok, let's say they put Luc on Durant, the Warriors are just gonna force the Harden switch anyway.  The Rockets couldve had their best defender chase Durant around, but they chose instead to switch everything, trying to limit the Warriors *team* offense, giving up favorable looks to the world's biggest matchup nightmare in the process. They *chose* to do that.  In the 2004 finals Detroit basically dared Kobe to try and beat them. Kobe (due to all sorts of reasons) took the bait. Detroit pulled off the upset, using Kobe to help keep the ball out of Shaq's hands. Even though Durant was actually very efficient, I would argue something similar could've happened here. The Warriors team offense is historic. Harden can't match it. But if you can turn the game into a series of isos--even *Kevin fucking Durant* isos--maybe Harden can win that match-up.  But Durant didnt have the entire world pressuring him into being MJ, and didn't take the bait.  I think the Warriors were, backs to the wall, always going to flip the switch. Get back to playing their game. If they hadn't won game 1 playing Rockets-style basketball, we probably see it happen sooner. "
"Is the math right on this? $167 million over 3 years is nothing.  People have speculated previously the tax bill could get up to [$115 million 2020 alone and $143 million in 2021.](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2017/10/2/16383160/nba-2017-golden-state-warriors-salary-cap-steph-curry-kevin-durant-klay-thompson-draymond-green)  That's $400 million in luxury tax over the next 4 years, and over $1 billion when you include salaries."
"&gt;Curry, Thompson, Green combined for 31 points on sub 30% shooting and were outscored by Rodney Hood and Kevin Love in game 3.   Lmao, shit man you're right. The Warriors might have actually needed 5 games to win the championship without Durant.  &gt; We’re not about to act like Durant is being carried here   Nobody has ever said Durant gets carried, only that the Warriors could win without him.  That's still true, no matter how good he is. "
"Take a look at this breakdown: https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2017/10/2/16383160/nba-2017-golden-state-warriors-salary-cap-steph-curry-kevin-durant-klay-thompson-draymond-green  While Draymond might be able to command max, he cannot command supermax on the free agent market, and that's a big difference.  The most I can see him realistically getting is $35m/year.  Assuming $35m/year with luxury tax applied, that would put the Warriors at around $320m/year total based on that graph, and $360m the following year.  Those are manageable costs.  People who are throwing around $300m on top of salary ($400-$500m) are wildly exaggerating the cost of keeping the core together.  It will never hit $400m total.  Warriors are fine for at least the next 4 seasons."
"It's an achievement LeBron has already played this well this long, but he's already on borrowed time. Check draft classes for stars from 2003 on and you have to go to 2007 and Kevin Durant until you get to a player where they can be the best player on championship contender.  Then there's Chris Paul who you'd probably consider a #2 on a championship contender.   Everyone else is retired or a role player.    "

So basically would I rather have Derrick Rose and Westbrook or Kobe Bryant and 2014 MVP Kevin Durant?  Not sure how that's a question...
"there is quite literally nobody else in the league who plays defense besides draymond green.   every basketball game is just a layup contest, except when the warriors come to town, where draymond just stands at the three point line and his presence alone forces the other team to hand it to kevin durant or steph, where they rain down threes from every inch of the court.  clearly, the only eligible player for DPOY is none other than Donkeh Teef himself"
How dumb can you be? Honestly.   Kevin Durant:  09-10 USG% 32 and TS% 60.7  10-11 USG% 30.6 and TS% 58.9 Usage went down but TS went down.  11-12 USG% 31.3 and TS% 61.0 Usage and TS both went up.  13-14 USG% 33.0 and TS% 63.5 Usage and TS both went up.   14-15 USG% 29.1 and TS% 63.3 Usage went down but TS stayed the same  No correlation between USG% and TS%. In fact KD's highest Usage Rate season with OKC (33%) was also his 2nd highest TS% with OKC (63.5) explain how that works? Because according to you the higher the Usage Rate the lower the TS%.   You are clearly uneducated when it comes to basketball and you just make random statements with no evidence to support them at all.   
&gt; Draft Kevin Durant  God damn it. 
Kevin Durant: League Is Better When I Have a Modicum of Self-Awareness
"Personally I disgaree. with Curry/Klay/Durant, the Warriors dont need Draymond's presence on offense. I'm not saying he wouldn't be missed, I swear I am not under valuing his offensive ability. But Curry/Klay/Durant is more than enough offense to get by.  Draymond is hugely valuable to the Warriors defense. He is above average or better at guarding any position more or less, which is crazy. He has elite BBIQ on defense and is always in the right place. That said, Kevin Durant is being largely under rated for his ability to guard multiple positions right now.  I believe that the Warriors could replace Draymond with a replacement level defensive minded player and survive much more than they could replace Klay and survive.  Replace Klay with an offensive minded replacement level guy and the defense suffers greatly as it will be much easier to take advtange of Steph/new guy. Replace Klay with a defensive minded replacement level guy and you lose a ton more floor spacing.  I'm not saying that Draymond is not hugely valuable. I just think their team would survive more in tact if they had to replace him rather than Klay. "
"The summer of 2016 told us to never dismiss anything when it comes to the Warriors and their ability to land a superstar.  The difference between then and now will be Golden State's inability to create space combined with the salary cap increasing only 1.9 percent. Two years ago, the Warriors were in position to sign Kevin Durant based on the cap increasing from $70 million to $94.1 million -- not to mention that Stephen Curry had a salary of $12 million and Harrison Barnes was set to be a free agent. If LeBron does decide he wants to join Golden State, the maneuvers won't be so simple.  Last June, Chris Paul notified the Clippers that he was not planning to sign with them as a free agent. Instead of the Clippers losing Paul for nothing, the point guard opted in to his $24.6 million contract and was sent to Houston for a package of players and draft picks. This scenario allowed the Rockets not to completely gut their roster to create cap space for Paul if he became a free agent.  For LeBron, the Paul scenario presents the best route if his desire is to play for the Warriors (or, possibly, the Rockets). When the season ends, James and his representatives can meet with the Cavs and let them know that he is not planning to return. Instead of losing James for nothing, Cleveland can take a proactive approach like the Clippers and ask James to opt into his $35.7 million contract (and waive his no-trade clause), with the understanding that he would be traded to a team like the Warriors. Of course, this scenario would need all three parties -- Cleveland, James and Golden State -- to agree.  The Warriors could put together a package that includes All-Star Draymond, wing Andre Iguodala and draft considerations. The Cavs would receive a package of players that would keep them afloat in the East. Keep in mind that if James leaves as a free agent, Cleveland will have limited options in free agency based on being right at the salary cap.   Curry,Klay,Durant, Lebron 🤯🤯😂  "

I agree dude that was an easy win against those d leaguers. Absolutely satisfying! Kevin Durant is not a snake!

Having major help responsibility in the NBA while simultaneously being asked to switch 1-5 is very demanding. You say that like it’s not taxing. "
**Kevin Durant**  Kawhi Leonard/Giannis Antetokounmpo  Jimmy Butler/Paul George  Gordon Hayward/Khris Middleton/Ben Simmons  Otto Porter Jr/Aaron Gordon/Tobias Harris/Jayson Tatum  Joe Ingles/Robert Covington/Brandon Ingram/**Harrison Barnes**  so about 11-14 small forwards/swings  
TIL Kevin Durant is better looking than Chandler Parsons (7.75 &gt; 7.45)
Kevin Durant translation: The thing I did was the right thing... please believe me and like me again. Sssssssss.
let's just do small forwards  1. Lebron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo (3/4) 5. Jimmy Butler 6. Paul George (interchangeable w/ jimmy butler) 7. Gordon Hayward (would be higher but is hurt) 8. Jaylen Brown (2/3?) 9. Jayson Tatum 10. Joe Ingles 11. Tobias Harris 12. ~~Andrew Wiggins (2/3?)~~ Otto Porter 13. Harrison Barnes  I'd put ~~8~~ 10 small forwards between Kevin Durant and Harrison Barnes. lmk if i missed anyone.
"&gt; he led this team  Honestly Draymond is probably the best leader this team has. Is Durant their best player? Debatably yes but he's definitely not their leader. And let's see, LeBron left a terrible team after dragging them to the finals, left Miami after leading them to 2 rings, and then will leave this Cleveland team which will probably miss the playoffs without him after leading the team in 2016 to a ring. Kevin Durant left the Thunder after being up 3-1 on the Warriors and then joined them after losing. "
"Notice how I literally never mentioned LeBron and here you are bringing him up lmao. And those moves are absolutely nothing alike. Try LeBron joining the Spurs after his loss in 2007. And guess what? LeBron joining those teams is what made them a superteam, Kevin Durant joined a superteam that already existed. If you think the situations are anything alike then I don't know what to say."
Would it have been better for Stockton or Malone to go the Bulls then? In my opinion it's not all about rings and I respect any of those players a whole lot more than Kevin Durant as it stands right now. OKC is still a playoff team without Durant but with him they were legit title threats and could potentially have won it in 2016 but instead of coming back stronger the next year after a tough loss he just joins them. Any of those guys would have multiple rings if they just teamed up an already title worthy team but they didn't

"&gt; KD helped turn OKC into a title contender.  Absolutely agree, even saying he helped them be a title contender is an understatement he was the whole reason they were a contender  &gt; When he realized there was a glass ceiling to what he could do there  Disagree. He was up 3-1 against a 73 win team but didn't manage to close it out. Other all time greats would get criticized for losing that series in that position and rightfully so. But many all time greats take adversity in stride and overcome it. Did Jordan join the Bad Boys? No, he beat them. Did Kobe join the Celtics after 2008? Did Magic join the Celtics?  Maybe those aren't entirely fair comparisons but what Kevin Durant may have been in good sense but so would have any of the moves above right?"
I couldn't disagree more with this. KD helped turn OKC into a title contender. When he realized there was a glass ceiling to what he could do there he left joined a championship quality team and became a 2x Finals MVP. What Kevin did is called having good sense. Durant shouldn't have to basically do what Lebron did this Finals to show he can do it on his own.
Kevin Durant gets frustrated and returns to OKC and is reunited with Russ. They win back to back titles. 
"Nobody thinks that. In fact, it's the exact reason *why* people hate the Warriors now. They were already a 73 win team before they added Kevin Durant."
http://news.nike.com/news/kevin-durant-kd11  Love the blue ones 
"The Warriors were -168 to win the finals before the season started.  The 1996-1997 are the only Bulls team that had comparable odds at -125 (year after they won 72 games).  I literally cannot find data that goes far back enough to find a team that was a bigger pre-season favorite than this year's Warriors team.  In a typical year, the favorite to win the NBA is usually around +200  People were comparing the Warriors to the Jordan Bulls BEFORE the got Kevin Durant.    The 2014 and 2015 Warriors won insane amounts of games, won a title, and were two of the most statistically dominant teams in the history of the NBA.  In 2016-2017 they were even better.  This year they didn't win as many games, but the second best player on the team/probably third best player in the NBA missed like 6 weeks.  They're 32-6 in the playoffs over the last two years with half of those losses coming in one season.  The NBA has been defined by dynasties and a lack of parity.  The Warriors were on the path to start one of the greatest runs in NBA history before they got KD.  Now they might literally be the best team ever.  "
How is no one talking about the most interesting part of this? Steve Nash doing in-depth one-on-one training with Kevin Durant is a basketball fan's wet dream 
"&gt; The same team that threw away a 3-1 lead  Lol, not the same team. They added Kevin Durant after that."
"&gt; The league cannot be expected to legislate its way out of every crazy situation. Some level of control has to be entrusted in players and teams. Most players would not expect an MVP who just lost a 3-1 lead to join the team he lost to.  Why? LOL teams have no such notion of 'control', I'm sure the Warriors, Celtics, or whatever will LOVE to have AD if they can get him for cheap. And players shouldn't either. So long as they are not screwing over their peers by massively underselling themselves for multiple years, things are fine. Don't kid yourself with this.  &gt; Kevin Durant took a $10 mil paycut for at least two years in his prime - and more if you consider the supermax.   Yeah, and he's getting his due this year. Calm down, this is not the first time, and this won't be the norm.  &gt; Competitiveness between players (i.e. ""being the best"") stems from comparing them in the context of their situations.   You mean fake competitiveness right? Because everything you wrote there was bullshit. Trying to self-police to ensure parity and such are not things professionals do, and certainly not things professional sportsmen do.  Show me a real world example of a player moving to a new team or doing anything MAINLY to ensure parity. Not loyalty, not money, not being the guy, show any move that is about ensuring an even playing field. Let me laugh now.  &gt;  Is it the best situation for him if he wants to prove himself above his peers? No. His wins, rightfully so, come with the context of how strong his team is independent of him.  Yeah right. Rings come first, then the discussion if you're the top guy. Multiple rings aren't split between two HOF players in a team. Bill Russell dominated with multiple HOF teammates. So did Kareem and Magic. So did Jordan. So did Shaq and Kobe. So did Duncan. So will Lebron.  &gt; Liking the NBA product in a different way than you do does not imply immaturity or not understanding how the real world works,   Nope, the majority are hypocrites and expect players to enforce parity and whatever bullshit you were saying, as if they are living in a bubble and not the real world.   And I don't think too highly of myself by knowing that the majority have this ridiculous double standard of players (and not teams, mind you, just players are expected to enforce parity).  "
The next most worthy is the second best player in the NBA called Kevin Durant
"At least someone on that team wants to get paid.     Looking at you, Kevin Durant."
Going by MVPs and Championships:  1.) Steph Curry 2.) Dwyane Wade 3.) Kevin Durant 4.) Chris Paul
"&gt;So what? Whose job is it to ensure fairness in the league? Not the players, not the teams. It's the league that should aim to fix these 'loopholes' if you wanna call it that. KD joining is a complete fluke, it took a lot of luck to build a 73-win team through a draft, and even more luck to have cap space to get a top free agent.  The league cannot be expected to legislate its way out of every crazy situation. Some level of control has to be entrusted in players and teams. Most players would not expect an MVP who just lost a 3-1 lead to join the team he lost to.  &gt;Also, don't be so dramatic, no superstar is gonna go on a vet min, now that will be a bad precedent for every player. The player's association won't condone this. KD is gonna get paid.  Kevin Durant took a $10 mil paycut for at least two years in his prime - and more if you consider the supermax. As endorsement money grows, superstars can afford to take a vet min, MLE, or millions below the max to win - especially after 7 years of amassing wealth due to the RFA. A superstar in his prime taking a very low salary for one or two years to win an easy ring is not inconceivable, especially now.  &gt;Nope.  You wouldn't find the league more entertaining if there weren't just one team that is prohibitively better than everyone else? Wasn't the league's landscape in, say, 2016 more entertaining than now to you?  &gt;Doing whatever you can to win/be the best. And yes, it is huge pussy move to NOT take advantage of a situation that's to your favor. So long as you're not doing a crime, why self-sabotage.  &gt;What is competitiveness to you? Putting fake obstacles just to show how hard you tried? Immature.  Competitiveness between players (i.e. ""being the best"") stems from comparing them in the context of their situations. Comparable situations are when response to in-game adversity, mid-series swings, etc matter more. Comparing players - not just teams - is a huge part of the sport's competition. If a superstar is in a far and away better situation than his peers, comparisons become muddied and meaningless. Think about it - if you're trying to compete with someone and prove that you are the best, ideally you'd want your and your competitors' situations to be comparable. This is obvious, and is why everybody loves close games and series more than blowouts.  The Warriors were clearly the best situation for KD if all we're talking about is getting rings, but that isn't the only facet of competition. Is it the best situation for him if he wants to prove himself above his peers? No. His wins, rightfully so, come with the context of how strong his team is independent of him.  &gt;Huh? Let's read their take then. This isn't an argument. You can criticize the product, but I can point out how immature that criticism is.  Liking the NBA product in a different way than you do does not imply immaturity or not understanding how the real world works, whatever that tired phrase means. Unless, of course you think that a significant proportion (majority, even?) of the NBA fan base doesn't understand the real world. In that case, you think too highly of yourself."
"&gt; Kevin Durant is not your normal NBA player. He is supposed to be a superstar. The expectation of a NBA Superstar is not 'wins rings however',  Uhh, no, that is the expectation. More importantly, the expectation is to win rings as the top dog. Think Kareem or Shaq or Lebron, or even Nash (though he didn't win). The only reason why there are more homegrown top 10 is because drafting talent is cheap, and maximizing your cap space through drafted superstars is the surefire way to a championship.  Trudging through a shitty organization is a dead idea, and players like Kevin Garnett played dearly for that (ask him) before he, Lebron, and now KD thoroughly killed it.  Superstars everywhere owe them a debt of gratitude for that. From now on, they won't be shackled to the arbitrary nature of draft day."
"In an effort to save face Kevin Durant has moved to Panama to play basketball, league sources say."
"You're either being obtuse, or willfully ignorant.  Kevin Durant is not your normal NBA player. He is supposed to be a superstar. The expectation of a NBA Superstar is not 'wins rings however', it is, explicitly, 'win rings with the team that drafts you' (allowing for shit like Kobe getting traded on draft day). In order to be considered at the very top of the NBA ladder, that is the standard, and actively choosing not to follow that path shows a lack of competitiveness compared to the guys that did.  I really don't know how this is hard to understand, just compare Durant to Michael Jordan, or Kobe, and you'll see exactly the difference in competitiveness everyone talks about."
"&gt; No, it was created through personal competitiveness, a drive to prove YOURSELF, which meant being the lead guy on a championship team.   Nope, that was fostered by trades and drafts to build great teams. Every player in the NBA are already competitive, this is professional sports, don't kid yourself. The expected lifespan of an NBA player is under 5 years. Whatever team you're on, you're expected to compete and pull your weight.  &gt; Kevin Durant obviously did not give two shits about that (and cool, you do you), but it's what people mean when they criticize his competitiveness.  LOL and what, do a Garnett? Waste his prime?   Or are we forgetting how the OKC couldn't make all that talent work? Oladipo? Harden? KD? Paul George? Are you forgetting Westbrook?  Also, KD is doing fine on his superteam. Lebron did just as great. Garnett too. But sure, they weren't real competitors. James Worthy should have refused to be drafted by the Lakers too. So immature.  &gt; Joining the top team because you don't think you can beat them isn't someone who cares about competition, because you should want to BEAT them, that's the whole point of competition.  This is fake competition. And only you thought that KD joined the Warriors because he doesn't think he could beat them. Nope, he joined because they are a great organization. That's REAL competitiveness, wanting to win always. You just want petty self-sabotage, fake competition. You'd rather have KD play with one hand just to make things more exciting for you. "
"No, it was created through personal competitiveness, a drive to prove YOURSELF, which meant being the lead guy on a championship team. That is the established expectation for a superstar in the NBA, that you want to be the top guy on the top team. Kevin Durant obviously did not give two shits about that (and cool, you do you), but it's what people mean when they criticize his competitiveness. Joining the top team because you don't think you can beat them isn't someone who cares about competition, because you should want to BEAT them, that's the whole point of competition.  Edit: Just saw your edit.  It's not 'fair', and I've never complained about parity in the NBA, it would be pretty hypocritical of me as a Laker fan. I'm just trying to offer an explanation as to why people reacted the way they did, while soapboxing a bit about how I personally think it will effect his legacy.  If rings is all he cares about, cool, but I, personally, will never see those as 'his'. He didn't lead a team to them, they don't carry the same weight as if he did. Just my opinion.  Edit 2 the Edit: Besides, didn't LA get the pick they used on Worthy in a trade that happened like two years before, so that's about as 'fair' as you'll get without actually being the worst team in the league."
"&gt; Chandler Parsons (7.45)  Uhh...  &gt; Kevin Durant (7.75)  Wait, you actually think Kevin Durant is more attractive than Chandler Parsons? C'mon man."
"&gt; Problem with lazy, childish takes like yours  &gt; childish  Hope the irony isn't lost on ya. But just to humor you.   &gt; some of us actually remember the 12-13 season.  Do you? Cause in the 12-13 season the Spurs played the Heat in the finals.   &gt; OKC wasn’t even a contender going into the season  The 12-13 season, or 11-12? 12-13 they were ranked #2. 11-12 most people had them pre-season around 6-8. [Here's a pre-season ranking from BR for you in which Kevin Durant was predicted to win MVP.](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/959325-nba-power-rankings-a-look-at-2012#slide24) There's more where that came from.  &gt; only became favored over Miami after the later stumbled through the post season  Wow it's almost like the odds of winning a game or series could change based off of mitigating circumstances. Sports!  &gt; This board is truly a cesspool. Do better r/nba  Refer to point 1."
"&gt; and yet people today like to claim that their dominance was *different.*  It *was* different. The Warriors were already dominant, and then they went out and signed Kevin freaking Durant, destroying one of their only legitimate threats in the Western Conference and putting them over the top of near-invincibility.   That would have been like the Bulls signing Shaq in ‘96 instead of the Lakers. "
Kevin Durant. To prove he ain’t a snek
"I like how on Reddit you see these upvote/downvote patterns in response to comments they don't like when the response is just as nonsensical.  Say KD shouldn't be blamed for the decision he made if you want. Say you're of the opinion that KD's happiness outweighed the negatives of his decision or whatever. But don't pretend to not know what he means by lack of competitiveness and let's not give BS justifications about other teams and the level they're playing at. We *just* witnessed a LeBron James led team get destroyed by GS because they were outclassed. And LeBron plays with professional basketball players as well, believe it or not.   A certain personality would have said no to joining GS for xyz reasons, and a certain personality will have said yes. Ask yourself which one is Kevin Durant in terms of competitive pride and you'll have the answer to your question. It's not this great mystery. "
"This is so misleading.   Had the Warriors remained as they were and not signed KD but kept making the Finals, it'd be a much more apt comparison.   If the Bulls were a 72-10 team and then went and added Shaq (and/or Karl Malone) to the team the way the Warriors were a 73-9 team that went and added Kevin Durant I could see the similarities but that's just not the case.  The Bulls *trading* for Dennis Rodman was a total gamble at that time. Rodman was like Metta World Peace on drugs in 1996 so while they were able to get a legendary couple of seasons out of Dennis Rodman, adding him to the established roster of Jordan and Pippen and Kukoc is not the same as adding KD to the established roster of Steph, Klay &amp; Draymond.  Final point, Jordan was two years away from retirement (and just two years in to his post retirement return) when this article came out, Pippen's back was about to betray him and neither were set to play another 5-10 years at a championship level. Can anyone say the same about the GSW core? (Pippen did make it a few more years but was not the same player and there was that dude with the same name as MJ who played for the Wizards but that wasn't *the* Michael Jordan)  *That's* why GSW is bad for the league."
KEVIN DURANT A 7.75?  Are you an insane person? He looks like an alien - from a planet where intelligent life evolved from squid - with a mental disorder. He's fucking beat m8.  Jesus Christ.
"I mean context always matters. But what LeBron did in Miami and what Kevin Durant did in Golden State are meaningfully different from what Ray Allen did in both Milwaukee and Boston, yes."
"Tatum: Smarter Paul Pierce  Kevin Durant: better and snaker T-mac  Jr Smith is a Kobe Bryant who forgets his mind in the closet.  DeMarcus Cousins is a lesbian Shaq who also can't create difference with his physical power. Still a Shaq though.  Klay: better version of R.Allen  Draymond:Smarter and smaller D.Rodman  Cp3:psycho chocolate version of J.Stockton  Markkanen: Dirk with better defense and playmaking  Anthony Davis: Evil monster version of Tim Duncan  Lonzo: Magic Johnson with better passing and defense (You'll see when he retires, not now.)

David west and Zaza pachulia come knocking on my door on a stormy night.  I answer... “Hello?” Zaza then replies “nothing eazy” and then him and d west step to the side. Stephen curry and Klay Thompson starting raining sniper bullets on my front door as javale mcgee and Kevin Durant starting dropping bombs on my roof. I ran to the back in the dark and there is draymond who stuns me by kicking me in the groin. Nick young comes to deliver the finishing blow but misses the shot. I stand up and run to my back door to be met with an ominous presence. It’s Steve Kerr. He tells me it’s better to just let them take over. He leads me to the back yard as Shaun Livingston does a turn around jumper and it’s the end.
Doncic plays in the Euroleague which as a league is at a higher level than D1 college basketball. Doncic won the Euroleague MVP at 19 (he would have been a freshman in college). In college the only freshman who have won College Player of the Year (a less impressive award than Euroleague MVP) are Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis.  If he goes 4th that will truly be ridiculous.  
"The cutoff is just so arbitrary though. If you're a Top 4 player you can sign whenever you want, but if you're Top 3 you can only sign with teams that are good but not too good?  The Kevin Durant signing was the Warriors first max contract signing ever. The other 3 All Stars were passed on by many teams before being drafted by Golden State.  We have rules that keep the teams balanced. Within those rules, everyone, both players and teams, should be doing whatever they can to win. Anything else is moving the goalposts."
"Not comparable for a couple of reasons.  1. Harrison Barnes and Horace Grant had far different values for their respective teams and their overall success.   2. The Warriors ""lost"" Barnes the week after Kevin Durant signed with Golden State. The Warriors were never weakened. They got a massivge upgrade. Grant left the Bulls via free agency in the summer of 1994 and didn't fill that massive hole in their front court until over a year later when they traded for Rodman before the 1995/96 season.  There is just no logical way to say that Rodman was added to a title winning team. In fact when Dennis joined the Bulls only two players remained from that 1993 championship roster. The team was entirely rebuilt around Jordan and Pippen during the two non title years."

Why wouldn’t he sign with a younger team where he can be the best player instead of join a championship dynasty?  Not everyone is Kevin Durant lol
Kevin Durant finds a new team 
"&gt;  Klay's goatee is straight up cartoon-like. Kevin Durant has a triangle on his chin, and Steph well...   You're right about KD, I can even accept the Klay slander, but come on... Steph is hot. His fashion choices might not be ideal, but the whole internet agrees his mom is smoking and he's basically a male clone of her. Even if you personally prefer the rugged type, you gotta admit that Steph is good looking. Source: straight girl who follows Ayesha Curry on Instagram for the cute/occasionally shirtless Steph pics"
"How they formed is the salient point.  If Kevin Durant joining the Warriors does not blemish the rings that he wins with them, then this is a blank check for superstars to join established championship teams and rosters - and I'm not talking franchises that have a history of winning, but franchises whose rosters have already won.  LeBron was toeing the line in 2011, but at least that team was totally new. It also just is not as talented as the Warriors by virtue of depth and having one less all-star.  LeBron's move crossed some line and pushed it ahead. KD pushed it even further. Where do we stop? If we're talking about getting the best basketball fit or whatever other bullshit canned phrase is used to justify KD's move, then signing a vet min to join the Warriors seems like the best option for any superstar free agent in the league.  So, If LeBron signs with the Warriors for the vet min, would people who defend KD's move still be okay with it? If he goes on to win 5 rings with that Warriors squad, do we not consider them blemished? Do we want a league where MVPs leave and join teams that won a championship a year or two before, and has maintained the same roster?  Parity is one issue, and while this Warriors team is something else in that respect, at least parity has always been an issue. The bigger problem is Kevin Durant and what he did. If his choice is acceptable, and other players start doing it, I really don't see why we have 30 teams in the league."

"After his NBA career he uses his money to fund research into time travel. Eventually in 2062 there is a break through and the first time machine is created. He uses the time machine to go back in time and prevent his younger self from ever joining the Warriors. He comes back to the present and finds that while he did leave OKC he went on to join the Hawks instead of the Warriors. He led the Hawks to five titles, ended the curse of Atlanta sports and was beloved by all. No one in this new time line knew the sacrifices he made but seeing what he was capable of accomplishing on his own brings him inner peace. He dies one day later and governor Quavo Jr declares that day a state holiday in remembrance of Kevin Durant."

Kevin Durant- r/durags
"I'm not even a warriors fan but watching him win, seeing people here lose it and call him soft, is probably the greatest justice served on this website  God bless Kevin Durant"
I totally get it. And I have friends that are warriors fans and even they secretly wish they could've had a couple more seasons of Curry playing like that unanimous MVP Curry.  Only he knows if it was the right decision. I just hope Kevin Durant the person is happy.
"That's wild because I'm in the total opposite boat.  I'm sitting here thinking damn if that was me and I could play somewhere that I would win a championship AND make money AND get involved in silicon valley etc AND most importantly have fun? Sign. Me. Up.  I think I'm celebrating Kevin Durant the person for living his best life with his family, whereas you're thinking of Kevin Durant the player who abandoned his squad.   But the player isn't *just* a player he's a whole person BUT the person isn't greater than or ""more than"" the player those actions still reflect their character.   It's so damn complicated I don't know who's right all I know is it made for a great story."
"But, 70 points is a huge milestone in a career. Michael Jordan never reached that, LeBron hasn’t, Kevin Durant, and hundreds of other great scoring players. He was also the youngest to do so. It was a important game to remember (even though his team still lost)."
probably started watching basketball when Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors. bet he doesn't know any of the Warrior greats like Andrew Bogut or Leandro Barbosa smh
"&gt; would be cool if we had more parity tho  Do you really, though?  I think parity is always nice in theory but it's not as fun in reality.  In my opinion, the ""parity"" argument generally comes from the so-called Small Market teams who feel as if they are unable to financially compete with the Big Market.  But with the way the NBA has been structured, the financial power of the Big Market teams have been neutered.  My Lakers have been terrible the last handful of years and the Knicks have been even worse for far longer. No amount of financial muscle has been able to help them.  In fact, there actually *is* parity.  The GSW were awful, they built their team through the draft, got lucky in the draft and turned their franchise around, and created a financial situation in which they can sign a player like Kevin Durant at the peak of his powers, *and* created a culture that makes guys like KD and Klay actually *want* to take pay cuts for the good of the team and maintain continued success in the prime years of their careers.  A small market team under the shadow of the Los Angeles Lakers for so many decades, under the current system, were able to be better than the Lakers and position themselves to be better than the Lakers for many years to come.  And the Lakers haven't been able to simply buy their way out of down years. (This is a different discussion, but that inability to adjust to the changing financial landscape of the league has set the Lakers back many years and they're only just starting to turn things around).  The NFL famously has parity and the common argument is that too many teams are just ""average"" and less-than-stellar teams are making their way into the playoffs and the product as a whole can sometimes be ""meh.""  Thankfully, a common ""enemy"" like the Patriots have been able to keep things interesting from year to year.  But parity can be frustrating because so many teams in the NFL can get close, but not quite get there. And be financially handcuffed to get there. And then there's a lot of one-step forward, two-steps back situations. It's harder for teams to build fan bases because it's harder for them to string successfully seasons together. The Falcons make the Super Bowl one year, and then don't get close the next year. A whole generation of potential new fans are now bummed out, thinking maybe it was just a fluke, and because of parity there is no chance for them to really get back and compete again.  Parity can limit a team's ability to bring together elite talent together leaving fans and pundits thinking what could have been if such-and-such team could have kept a particular group of players together for an extended period of time.  Parity is something that I think hardcore fans want. But there are far fewer hardcore fans versus the casual fans that make up a majority of the fan base across any sport.  ---  All that being said, I think there is just way too much risk in constructing a NBA roster. With the smaller sizes of the roster, the margin of error is far too narrow. Screw up one of your two picks in the draft? You're fucked for another season. And you're also putting the hopes of a franchise in the hands of a 19 or 20-year-old kid.  A lot of times, too many eggs end up in one basket.  I think one major improvement -- which I think is currently happening -- is to seriously expand and develop a sort of ""minor league"" system for the NBA and expand the draft.  With that, teams aren't banking on success in the draft and/or free agency but they can actually create a larger of pool of players to draw from and, more importantly, develop and evolve in their system and philosophy.  This also creates a natural evolution of a player who opts to skip college.  I think this could reduce instances of tanking, reduce the Luck Factor in a draft, reward teams who develop from within, etc.  This isn't to necessarily create parity per se, but just put more teams in better positions to succeed both in the short and long term."
"This Dwight thread is absolutely gold.   &gt; BUT FUCK YEAH ANDREW BYNUM.  &gt; Mitch Kupchak deserves a lifetime achievement award.  &gt; Enjoy your decade-long rebuilding process.  &gt;Holy crap...

These are my favorite posts because all these 13 year old kids cry about kevin durant and they get upvotes
"Comments from August 2012.  &gt;Tank, get lucky, draft a Kevin Durant, and hope he stays healthy  &gt;Or they can hope their one star becomes best friends with two other players.  &gt;But it has to happen during the Olympics when they realize how awesome it would be if they played together. Simple stuff.  &gt;You think KD will leave OKC in the near future? I don't.   "
Kevin Durant = r/incels
"Jaylen Brown obv isnt the better rn, but for me, this really shows what a joke Melo's eventual HoF induction is going to be  the guy was so overrated at his peak. People thought he was top 5, maybe even top 3. Never made anyone better, never won anything. But he had all the hype. Melo was *supposed* to be what Kevin Durant is.   He was the last bastard son of the Jordan era. Drafted right as the new zone defense rule was making isos less profitable. Right as analytics were discrediting the long two. Right before the new handchecking rules empowered smaller players. While LeBron was redefining how to play superstar basketball in this new era, Melo was doing a poor imitation of the past.  Had he been drafted a decade earlier, he might have been a legend like Iverson--still wouldn't have won a title, but would be at least remembered for his talents, rather than his deficiencies. Melo surrounded by 4 guys who play defense and hustle for him might have gone on a memorable playoff run  In *this* era, every passing year Melo stands out more for the things he *doesnt* do, like make the extra pass,  move without the ball, or win playoff games. "
If you didn’t love me for my Mike Dunleavy and Andris Biedrins than you don’t deserve me for my Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. 
Kevin Durant: k now what
"Porter Jr is massively overrated, even when healthy. He's got more in common with Ryan Anderson than Kevin Durant. His ceiling is not high, he has zero chance of being a franchise player, but he'll still be around the league for a long time."
"No, Kevin Durant is loyal"
"Kevin Durant, dude IS NOT HUMAN. "
You have had one hundred and eighty comments disparaging Kevin Durant. This post is an obviously foolhardy attempt at creating and reinforcing negative stigma against him. Take a chill pill.
Is this a Kevin Durant joke?
"it's not about winning with stars, it's how you win. in their toughest series v. the rockets, kevin durant wasn't the deciding factor. curry/klay were. and dray is their most important defensive player.  to be considered a top 10 great, you can't be of secondary importance throughout a season and the playoffs. and that's what durant had been for the past 2 seasons. they just need him for a handful of games for the entire year. "
Didn’t Kevin Durant call himself the servant or some shit?
We had a meme in a offseason of Kevin “The Minion” Durant and it was the worst
"Good find. I had no idea about that. [This was the best I could find supporting my statement, but you never know the concrete details.](https://www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/9/19/16335582/kevin-durant-confession-tweets)"
"Not sure why you chose Robinson as the comparison. Robinson was definitely a better player than Durant, if we're talking peak/prime. He also had insane scoring efficiency, but he was also one of the best defenders of all time.  You can see KD's career (up through 2017) and how it stacks up with David's here:  http://www.backpicks.com/2017/12/11/the-backpicks-goat-the-40-best-careers-in-nba-history/  [Durant](http://www.backpicks.com/2018/03/05/backpicks-goat-26-kevin-durant/) and a chart of his [""Seasonal Valuation""](http://www.backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Durant-seasonal-valuations.png)  [Admiral](http://www.backpicks.com/2018/02/05/backpicks-goat-15-david-robinson/) and his [""Seasonal Valuations""](http://www.backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/David-Robinson-seasonal-vauations.png)  Just for reference on those charts, here is LeBron's and Jordan's.  [LeBron](http://www.backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/LeBron-GOAT-seasonal-valuations.png)  [Jordan](http://www.backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Michael-Jordan-seasonal-valuations.png)"
"The Warriors are an awful villain, the only one on that team you can really demonize is Draymond Green. Being upset at Kevin Durant because you don't like where he decided to sign or Steph Curry because he shimmies or chews on his mouth piece is lame. "
"Which makes my point even stronger because Chauncey had no problem with comparing other players to Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, etc "
No the fuck he isn’t. LeBron is at worst too 3 all time. KD can’t touch LeBron. LeBron beat the team that Kevin Durant couldn’t. He’s helping his legacy if anything 
"Sure he is all those things, but here's how the optics of KD's career will read:   Kevin Durant can't when without 3 stars and one of if not THE best coach in the league.   He's not in the top 10 conversation because if you honestly put any player from the top 10 in his spot they do the same thing.   Also don't disrespect Kobe like that or we fighting. "
Because one had kevin durant and the other didn't. Trust if westbrook had his own team set up like Rose did it would of been a conversation back then.
KeViN dUrAnT fOr DpOy GuYs
"yeah yeah gloat all you want about your 3 rings and your next 20. Yes, you can bring up iggy all you want but how much help does Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and DG need? That’s literally 2 MVPs, 3 GOAT shooters, and a DPOY, 4 all stars. Like shit, it was 3-2 and the rockets were running a smaller rotation. Kinda hard when GS has at least two all stars on the floor at one time. The midget was very well needed in those two games"
"""What would happen if you replaced **KEVIN DURANT** with **HOODIE MELO**?? 🤔🤔🤔 Comment below"""
"My first time seeing an NBA game was the Sonics last year in Seattle. April 6th 2008. I had to dig through so much crap to find this game. https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4zp94  20 year old Kevin Durant scoring 37 points to the lead the Sonics over Carmelo and Iversons’ Nuggets. He hit the game tying 3 to go into double overtime and the go-ahead to win it. The entire game was a shit show, our defense was terrible as always and you can imagine Melo and Iverson pretending to guard Durant. This is my favorite basketball memory and I am excited to see Durant return to Seattle later in the summer to play the kings in a warriors pre-season game. "
Looool... so Kevin Durant isn't an elite athlete??? Is that what we've come to on r/nba 
"2007         1. Kevin Durant        2. Al Horford         3. Joakim Noah      4. Marc Gasol      5. Greg Oden       6. Yi Jianlin      7. Tiago Splitter       8. Spencer Hawes       9.

"If the sixers win it next year, I’ll preorder my new Kevin Durant jersey so I’ll have it for the next season when he comes to Philly "
"Based on last year? Fuck no he's not. He's a boxscore gangster. He hurts his team so much, he shoots selfishly. He's horrendously inefficient and yet will take shots that   1.) Are well contested   2.) He struggles with anyway  He takes the most shots in the NBA by a mile, and yet has en EFG that's 5% under league average.  There are so many possessions where he will hold onto the ball and only pass it if he sees a surefire assist. He had the most touches per game in the entire NBA, and played in a system that encouraged him to get the best stats possible.  He's also atrocious defensively.    LeBron, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Curry, Harden, Giannis, Kawhi, Gobert, Embiid, Dame, Butler, Paul, Oladipo,  KAT, and Kyrie were all better players than Westbrook last season. I could probably name more, but I'll stop at fifteen."
"My Personal List, if everyone is healthy:  1) Lebron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Steph Curry  4) Kawhi Leonard  5) James Harden  6) Anthony Davis  7) Giannis   8) Russell Westbrook  9) Paul George  10) Chris Paul  11) Jimmy Butler  12) Damian Lilliard  13) Joel Embiid  14) Demarcus Cousins  15) Kyrie Irving  16) Kristaps Porzingis  17) John Wall  18) Demar Derozan  19) Victor Oladipo  20) Gordon Hayward "
"He was like a Kevin Durant clone in high school. That may be derailed with the injury, but the talent was definitely there prior. "
"Once people see RJ in college I think he's going to be considered in that Anthony Davis, Greg Oden, Kevin Durant-tier of can't miss prospects"
Just like playing Kevin Durant at the 2
Only that Steph told me - Kevin Durant IS BETTER AND SMARTER THAN YOU LeBron #FakeAccount #BurnerAccount
Kevin Durant =&gt; Cock shit fuck dickass  hahaha wow funny how that worked out!
"Sh*t '12 has Peak Lebron, MVP Durant, James Harden right before he breaks out, Westbrook, and not fat Kevin Love, also Kobe was still 1st team All-NBA that season.   So it's Prime Wade vs MVP Durant... Wade was great but Durant is unguardable.   The redeem team was a better team, '12 would beat them in 7.    "
Kevin “the duck” Durant 
"&gt; allows Kevin Durant to slide back to his natural position as a shooting guard  By gawd, that's PJ Carlesimo music"
Khris Middleton is Kevin Durant with shorter arms 
"False. Kevin Durant is in fact a basketball-playing robot, therefore you should not count his statistics about efficiency."
&gt; Judas Antetokounmpo  You mean Kevin Durant? 
They were a good team because of Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is a superstar which is the most important thing to have in the NBA. Jimmy Butler is just an all-star caliber talent.

Kevin Durant is 29 and has only played 82 games once in his career. That was 9 years ago.
"I don't know, I think I'm a mix of LeBron James and Kevin Durant."
Is Kevin Durant the real life version of Sasuke Uchiha?
"[It was 185](https://hoopshype.com/2017/05/11/kevin-durant-nba-combine-bench-press-poor-performance/), but that's still pretty bad. An adult man should definitely be able to max his own bodyweight on bench, even if he doesn't workout much."
Kevin Durant is vehemently rubbing his nipples right now.
"Do you guys understand that player comps are just about play style and physical attributes? It doesn't mean the player will have the same success level. If you compare a player in the draft to Kevin Durant, it basically means a 7 footer with guard skills who can shoot. It doesn't mean that the player will follow the career path of the comp."

Kevin Durant 
I'd love to see them against the Kevin Durant Warriors. Or 1995-96 Bulls. Phil Jackson's team's were also notorious for not letting opposing teams get easy baskets or rest on defense.     
"Well as I said Doncic has been said to be 6'8 barefoot by a journalist who follows the team (previous listed heights are obsolete based on that) so not that crazy in this case, but yeah, for sure there are cases of players shorter than other guys with lower listed heights. Kevin Durant for example, I don't know if the guy has had his listed height of 6'9 updated since he entered the league (I'm too lazy to look it up), but he picked something like his barefoot height, rounded down, and has since grown. Basically a 6'11, 7 footer walking around with a listed height of 6'9. It's especially funny in games like NBA 2K where a few players (Durant, Garnett, Gasol) just look much shorter  than real life. "
Kevin Durant fell all the way to 2
EHAT IF KEVIN JAMES THE MALL COP WAS AS GOOD AS KEVIN DURANT AND LEBRON JAMES COMBINED!?!?
Michael Porter is Kevin Durant/Tony Romo
"That is what I don't get about players going from teams that are proven, to a ""big market"". Like, yeah, New York or LA is cool and all...but you aren't gonna be there pretty much at all during the season, and you could just buy a house literally wherever you wanted in the off season. And the marketability thing is irrelevant these days because of the internet. OKC is about as small market as it gets, and Kevin Durant signed one of the biggest sneaker contracts in OKC and Russ has Jordan, True Religion, and Mtn Dew and literally everyone knows who they are"
"I guess Steph Curry and Kevin Durant are the only guys who can trash talk, Lebron was dow 0-3 too."
I guess Kevin Durant is not a hardcore fan of basketball 
OKC have found their Kevin Durant replacement
"Dude he was up 3-1 for a championship(basically) and lost. Instead of trying to get better to figure how to win, he ducking ditched his team. This is an absolute dick move. Have you been involved in any competitive team sport?? What would you think of this??  Not having an East Bay connection just sells what a soulless bitch-add mercenary move this was. By a total fucking coward.  Fuck Kevin Durant "
"There’s 30 teams in the NBA. Dude has ZERO connection to Oakland. If he went to DC, or Texas, or even Portland... I’d get it.  Instead he went with an ego-stroking in the fucking Hamptons and cutting the throat out of the rest of the NBA by abusing a one-off cap loophole.  He’s the ducking “Hamptons 5.” Sell-out with no spine.  Fuck Kevin Durant."
Would you respect a coworker or teammate who pulled something on this level? He was on absolutely elite-level team and bounced to their biggest rival. And took a pay cut to do it. So that he could pat himself on the back knowing that he neutered the entire western conference. Because being an MVP on a championship level team was too scary or wasn’t enough for him.  He’s an absolute pile of shit. What would you think of a co-worker or teammate who pulled some kind of garbage like that?  Fuck Kevin Durant.
"This is a load of horseshit.  He didn't want to win.  He didn't want to prove himself.  He ""needed that validation from my peers and teams and GMs, people that are really into the game, to really help me feel good about myself and help me feel confident and let me know that what I was doing was working.""  (his words)  He's a narcissistic sack of shit who was unwilling to figure out how to work with his teammates, and instead took a paycut to join HIS ONE SIGNIFICANT RIVAL to win championships, and to feel nice about himself.  KD is a goddamn coward.  Fuck Kevin Durant."
"KD was a free agent. He was free to sign with whoever he wants. And the reason he went to the Warriors is because they made him feel welcome (https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-offers-reason-for-signing-with-warriors-i-needed-validation-from-my-peers/amp/). If he was not happy in OKC and they Warriors welcomed him with open arms and he wants to be there, why shouldnt he go? Like I said, from a fans perspective people may feel theres no parity but at the end of the day KD was a free agent just like anyone else."
"The only way they did ""nothing wrong"" is if you're going off whether they violated the CBA or not.  KD did absolutely everything wrong in terms of being a basketball player and a competitor.  He made it to the WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS and had a 3-1 lead.  That is rarefied air for just about all NBA players.  And then, after choking away that lead, he went and joined the team that beat him.  As an MVP, joining another MVP.  This is absolutely unprecedented, and the bitch move of all bitch moves.  I don't give a fuck about whatever your metric of ""right and wrong"" is.  A bitch move of that magnitude must never be forgiven, and must never be forgotten.    Fuck Kevin Durant."
"&gt;In the 2017 series, he still had two other franchise players with him.  No he didn't. Kyrie is such a ""franchise player"" that the team that traded him made the Finals without him, and the team that acquired him faced them in the Conference Finals without him. And Kevin Love a franchise player? Kevin Love's dad would even laugh if he heard that.  &gt;Why don't people consider the same logic when Lebron and his teams were running through the east against much inferior teams?  When did Kevin Durant ever play in the East?  &gt;Did Paul George have the supporting cast Lebron did when they faced eachother?  What does Paul George have to do with anything? Also, the Pacers supporting cast around Oladipo this year was better than the supporting cast around Lebron. The Cavs only won the series because of Lebron.  Make some sense next time."
IT'S KEVIN DURANT!
Kevin Durant / LeBron James / Draymond Green / Paul George / Devin Booker  Truly positionless  
Steph Curry   Kevin Durant   Paul George   Joel Embiid   Jamal Murray
Ricky Rubio $1  Jimmy Butler $3  LeBron $5  Kevin Durant $5  Joel Embiid $3
"Try Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Anthony Davis. Those players are in the NBA and there are hundreds of players that are better than the white boys you mentioned out of the NBA"
i'm actually a kevin durant alt
"My b, I just remember that Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin won the award recently before him"
A white Kevin Durant. Okay.
"Portland did NOT have a laser on Kevin Durant, league sources tell ESPN."
kevin durant feels vindicated
"Silver: This just in, Kevin Durant has joined the Golden State Warriors."
If you’re viewing his college tape you’re looking at 5 healthy minutes and two rushed games back.   If you watch his High School tape he looks like Kevin Durant. 
"Every 6'10"" shooting wing (I know there's not a lot) will inevitably get compared to Kevin Durant and none of them will live up to that comparison. "
Kevin Durant has a back tho.
"I remember tormentig my cousin back then that LeBron (his favorite) could very well be a Laker in 2010 because Phil Jackson is entering his final year coaching, and Bron's desperate for a title so why not join the defending champions to try to give Phil a consistent 3-peat record, as in whenever a PJax team wins a title it's always in threes. He counters with salary and I said ""he can always take a paycut to play for just a year"" and i bring up the MLE or some shit. ""But people won't like that"" to which I say ""it's only a one-year contract, plus he's out to get a championship, he's failed for how many years now?"" then he brings up if that should be illegal, which it isn't, because what's wrong with a top NBA guy joining championship contenders? Those conversations always end with him storming off because he's convinced that it could happen and his hero might be a coward because of it. He was like 12 at the time.  Then LeBron ends up joining the Heat, which he viewed as a cowardly move, so he shifted his support to...Kevin Durant  "
Bro go on YouTube and type in Kevin Durant game winners and then we will resume this conversation once you promise you’ve watched all of them 
"I don't know why we're saying that the West is overwhelmingly better than the East in the NBA right now. The East has 5 teams we could see in the finals next year: Celtics, Pacers, Bucks, 76ers, or Raptors. Meanwhile the West is only trending on 4: Warriors, Rockets, Pelicans, or Jazz (Lakers aren't there yet, sorry).   Now of those Eastern teams projected to compete there are 10 all stars and the Western teams have 9. Meaning that when it comes to teams competing for a title the East averages 2 all stars per team and the West averages 2.25. BUT WAIT the Warriors have 4 of those 9 all stars. So the 3 Western teams remaining actually average 1 per team while the East still averages 2 because of the even distribution in the East.  But wait, all stars are divided by conference anyways so maybe all the really good players are in the West already. We need something more universal. Let's see who was polling highest in the MVP voting from December-April. The East had 6: Kyrie Irving, Victor Oladipo, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Demar DeRozan, and John Wall. And of those competing teams in the West there are 4- Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, and James Harden. Mathematically speaking that means we have 1 team in the West competing for a title consistently without an MVP candidate- good work, Utah.  Another thing to note about the East are the rookies this year. 76ers have Ben Simmons, the Celtics have 40,000 all star rookies, the Raptors had 2 candidates that were trending near rookie of the year criteria throughout the season. Annnnd then those Western conference teams just had Donovan Mitchell with some mild sparks from Jordan Bell.  In terms of the post-season, the only season that counts, no one is consistently challenging the Warriors and everyone is challenging the Cavs. LeBron struggled to compete in the East this year despite having the average number of all stars on his roster and one of the greatest collection of role-players in the league. LeBron left the East because he wasn’t competitive enough to stay there.  Yeah.. that’s the end of my rant"
Yes as an unbiased bystander Kevin Durant should come to New York
"A few years ago, Kevin Durant (playing for the Thunder) lost to the Warriors in the final four of the NBA playoffs. It was a tough loss because he was extremely close to the finals. The Warriors team that he lost to also had the most regular season wins in league history, though they ended up losing the championship. Durant left the Thunder for the Warriors that off-season, which resulted in an /r/nba riot of sorts; it was seen as a ""real bitch move"" to join a super team. In a way, the decision to join the Warriors was seen as an admission that Durant could never beat them so he had to join them.  The joke in this thread is that LeBron's Lakers situation is similar. OP tricked people into believing that he was serious until the body text was read. The Lakers have been bad for awhile now, so the idea that they're similar to the Warriors is ludacris. The summer league competitions are really for testing new talent, no one cares about winning it as a measure of team dominance. The closest thing I can think to compare it to is bragging about doing well on a class's pretest when you ended up getting a D in the class.  Another note, people are on edge because one of LeBron's previous moves to the Heat has been compared to this. That situation is a lot murkier - some would tell you it's similar to or worse than Durant to the Warriors, but I wouldn't be one of them. Either way, there's an expectation that nephews (the /r/nba version of youtube commenters) are going to start making these comparisons so people are ready to get on the defensive."
I heard Kevin Durant is a great guy. Active in the community. Generous to charities. Takes care of his mother. Kevin Durant sounds like the type of guy I want to be. Find a new slant

"Lakers bench is way better On god Warriors don’t have enough wing depth to run with the Lakers.  Lakers wing players: LeBron Brandon Ingram Josh Hart Lance Stephenson Kyle Kuzma all great wing players  Golden state Wing players: Kevin Durant Andre Iggy And who else? Quinn cook? LMAO. Swaggy P? Nahhhh  Lakers got some great defense guards too in Lonzo and KCP, to try and slow down Steph and Clay. Julius randle Zubac and McGee handle the inside."
Depends on whether you think SAS makes up sources or not.  https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2018/06/28/report-lebron-james-asked-kevin-durant-about-going-to-la/  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5897235/LeBron-James-texted-Kevin-Durant-joining-Los-Angeles-Lakers.html  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2018/6/28/17514156/nba-free-agency-rumors-lebron-james-texted-kevin-durant-la-lakers
"The spurs won’t make a deal that will create a second dynasty in the West. Any deal between the Lakers and the spurs has to appear to cripple the lakers. Spurs think they have all the leverage, but the Lakers will be willing to wait a year get Leonard in free agency. Still get three years of potential championships.... plus potentially Kevin Durant. So now the spurs are faced with possibly seperating with Leonard and getting nothing but cap space in return. "
Giannis lock to win multiple MVPs bruh. You’re underestimating how hard it is to win an MVP. Kevin fucking Durant only has 1
"LOL  I see what happened - you look at the comments of a RAPM sheet from Nov 2017 when he was only better than JR. If you look at the updated stats:  &gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSzp3G5rwP9xgCgluVGmR3Qj4-BMoGSYiuTKM6o_pzES6s95oQE1nQvB2CXed-4fRc_MMGgpULtDaJ_/pubhtml?gid=1825430955&amp;single=true  He's listed as better on DRAPM than Kevin Durant someone you literally said he wasn't as good at defense as in the course of your argument. Still not good - but his ORAPM is pretty good, and puts his overall RAPM pretty high considering.  That's embarrassing for you."
ALSO KEVIN DURANT
"I Feel Like MY (Emphasis On MY, I Am A DIEHARD Lakers Fan Always Have Been Since We Drafted Kobby and Shack) Lakers Can Sign Geyanis, Kevin Durant Steve Curry And Paul George."
"I mean, that happens.  Kevin Durant left 10 million on the table last year so the Warriors could resign Iguodala and Livingston. Also, David West took the minimum the last 3 years to try to get a ring, but gave up about 10 million a year to do so. It worked out for him, since he got 2.  When LeBron went to the Heat, he, Bosh, and Wade all took less than they could have. Tim Duncan had team-friendly contracts for his entire career.   And it worked. Every player i mentioned above has won at least 2 championships playing for the teams they took a pay cut to help. So far, in Durant's case.  Some guys want to win, other guys just want to get paid. There are definitely players who relegated their team to the lottery because they took up too much cap space.  "
rest of nba OWNED!!1! Kevin Durant resigned!!
Kevin Durant is the Kwisatz Haderach.
"What do you mean? A Lakers squad with Kevin Durant, LeBron and Kawhi on it would surely be beloved here on r/nba!"
"People said they exact same shit about Kevin Durant. He will still always be known as a Snake and a weak contender. Those labels aren't going away, and they wont for Kawhi either."
they will know him as Kevin Wayne Durant
"As well as Anthony Davis, Shaq, Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden and loads of better players that didn’t get the opportunity to get carried by Shaq and a loaded roster in 09-10.  Are people really forgetting Kobe shot below league average TS% in every finals he ever played in except 1? Dude consistently choked in the finals and got carried by his teammates to rings. "
"That's my point though. They didn't do it. Perennial superstars Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Chris Paul did. Nick Young signings don't make or break the NBA."
"[As I said here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8vb6gu/espn_nba_the_lakers_have_not_been_aggressively/e1m3z4a/) the Lakers would be stupid to throw the bank at the Spurs. They are going to get Kawhi no matter what. Draymond Green and Kevin Durant will be FA's next offseason as well. The Spurs have no real leverage. They can trade KL to LA or they can get nothing, no one else is going to trade for a guy who is guaranteed to not reup. "
I thought captains can't repeat for a year? So high chance it becomes Kevin Durant
"Wonder how many on the Kevin ""Snek"" Durant and James ""literally Hitler"" Harden hate camps are going to switch sides when they play the Lakers."
But fuck Kevin Durant for stealing all those potentially epic Thunder v. Warriors matchups.
"LeBron leaving the East is a smart move for ""The Legacy"" when you think about it.  ~~0-3 against Kevin Durant in the Finals sounds WAY worse than 1-3 against Kevin Durant in the playoffs.~~ Nope. I was wrong. My b. Got too excited there.  The NBA Finals are now officially to the Western Conference finals what the Pro Bowl is to the Super Bowl.  Plus, did I mention LeBron's outta the east? I like everything about this."
*Kevin Durant signs with the Lakers next year*
"If you think that roster of the Warriors was their best iteration, then you are a special one.   There's a difference between leaving Harrison Barnes alone and having to guard Kevin Durant. "
So let’s take away every gms signings? Lets take away jerry west signing kevin Durant. It wasn’t cause of West it was cause of draymond calling him. Stupid logic you’re just salty lol 
They're pretty safe assumptions to make. Here's another: your ass gets chafed when reading about Kevin Durant signing deals with GSW.
"Active players who've made All-NBA 1st team, by current conf.:  West LeBron James Kevin Durant James Harden Stephen Curry Anthony Davis Kawhi Leonard Chris Paul Russell Westbrook DeAndre Jordan Marc Gasol Dirk Nowitzki Derrick Rose  East Joakim Noah  TBD Dwight Howard Dwyane Wade"
I don't understand why he didn't sign with Golden State.  Kevin Durant is the only sensible person evidently. 
we drafted a kevin durant.  he's always 2 years away from being 2 years away.  so we traded him to sac.
Kevin Durant
"Reply in the thread: ""Tank, get lucky, draft a Kevin Durant, and hope he stays healthy"""
Some dude said draft a Kevin Durant as advice. He knew the future
"LeBron leaving a team that's not there. LeBron leaving his no support.  There ya go. The man wants to win. How you gonna be a dick and hate on a man looking to add more trophies and further cement being one of the greatest of all time? You know who else is a great, and not a life timer for one team? Michael Jordan. Also Kevin Durant. Not as great, but left when it ""Got tough"" and joined the powerhouse GS was already."
Kevin Durant ruined the NBA
Let’s go Kevin Durant and the warriors 
Like Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant would be sine/cosine waves due to their resemblance to snakes
"Another one says ""Tank, get lucky, draft a Kevin Durant, and hope he stays healthy"""
The 73-9 team led by Unanimous MVP Steph Curry who then added Kevin Durant and won 4 championships in a row.
"""Win a championship, get a cap spike, sign Kevin Durant"""
Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard
Kevin Durant or Klay gone in a year. Could certainly beat them year 2
&gt;Be as talented as Kyle Singler but look like Ricky Rubio  &gt;Be as talented as Kevin Durant but look like Kosta Koufos  Pick one
"LOL one of the replies says:  &gt;Tank, get lucky, draft a Kevin Durant, and hope he stays healthy  I hate this cruel world"
"&gt;Tank, get lucky, draft a Kevin Durant, and hope he stays healthy  Is what someone told that Warriors fan. "
" ""Tank, get lucky, draft a Kevin Durant, and hope he stays healthy"""
"And the response was ""Get a Kevin Durant""   Pretty amazing"
"Ah taking the Kevin Durant ""if you can't beat them, join them"" approach, eh?"
Oh the fan base that trashed Kevin Durant? You mean the NBA fan base then
"I'm not saying you weren't. I was just giving an alternate way of thinking about it.  Look at the sorry state Kevin Durant is in: yeah he won, but he probably is extremely distressed because of the all the hate he gets every single day. Is he happy? I'm not his psychologist, but clearly this whole pressure cooker is a factor.  Being happy has value. "
&gt; Worst fanbase in the NBA  Says the fanbase that trashed Kevin Durant for making a simple decision in free agency he was allowed to make. 
"Because Paul George is a proven all star and he’s still young. Let me give you a list of # 2 overall picks from the 2000s since we’ve had time to step back and let their careers develop.   Hasheem Thabeet, Michael Beasley, Kevin Durant, LaMarcus Aldridge, Marvin Williams, Emeka Okafor,Darko Milicic, Jay Williams, Tyson Chandler, Stromile Swift.   Outside of KD none of those guys are better basketball players than PG and LaMarcus is probably about even. You’re putting too much faith in your young players. At absolute best they become PG - if they become the next LeBron, or Kobe, or Magic it’s a complete anomaly. PG isn’t any of those guys, but he’s also at best what one of your young guys might turn into"
"Is sign for the league minimum so the front office can have the money to fill the team with good role players like Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant. "
You make it sound like Kevin Durant didn’t answer that question already? 
"I never said that. They lost fair and square. They were still an amazingly strong team, that barely lost anyone to add Kevin Durant etc etc. Basically everything I've said.  The only way you can argue against what I said is by attacking something I never said. The Warriors have 4 all-NBA caliber players all in their primes right now. That's basically never happened before.   If you can't see how LeBron joining Boston in 2011 would be awful, there's no point arguing. The Warriors were/are even better than Boston on top of that."
"Jesus, OP, this is an awful thing to look at... take this instead....  |TEAM |MVP PLAYERS DRAFTED (*TOTAL MVPs*) |Players| |:-|:-|:-| |Atlanta Hawks|1 (2)|Bob Petit| |Boston Celtics |4 (10)|Bob Cousey, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens, Larry Bird| |Brooklyn Nets|0 (0)|| |Charlotte Hornets|0 (0)|| |Chicago Bulls|2 (6)|Michael Jordan, Derrick Rose| |Cleaveland Cavaliers|1 (4)|LeBron James| |Dallas Mavericks|1 (1)|Dirk Nowitzki| |Denver Nuggets|0 (0)|| |Detroit Pistons|0 (0)|| |Indiana Pacers|0 (0)|| |Golden State Warriors|2 (6)|Wilt Chamberlain, Stephen Curry| |Houston Rockets |1 (1)|Hakeem Olajuwon| |LA Clippers  |1 (1)|Bob Mcadoo| |LA Lakers |2 (4)|Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant| |Memphis Grizzlies |0 (0)|| |Miami Heat  |0 (0)|| |Milwaukee Bucks |2 (7)|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving| |Minnesota Timberwolves|1 (1)|Kevin Garnett| |New Orleans Pelicans |0 (0)|| |New York Knicks|1 (1)|Willis Reed| |Oklahoma City Thunder|3 (3)|Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden| |Orlando Magic|1 (1)|Shaquille O'Neal| |Philadelphia 76ers |2 (2)|Charles Barkley, Allen Iverson| |Phoenix Suns|1 (2)|Steve Nash| |Portland Trailblazers |2 (4)|Bill Walton, Moses Malone| |Sacramento Kings |1 (1)|Oscar Robertson| | San Antonio Spurs |2 (3)|David Robinson, Tim Duncan| |Toronto Raptors |0 (0)|| |Utah Jazz|1 (2)|Karl Malone| |Washington Wizards|1 (1)|Wes Unseld|"
"Am I the only one who thinks this is the right play? Lebron is going to sign there regardless, there is no reason to break the bank. They could tool around Lebron and be competitive this year, sign KL next year and immediately start competing for titles while GSW very likely loses Kevin Durant and *definitely* loses Draymond Green.  The Lakers have the leverage here. They don't NEED to trade for KL. The Spurs NEED the Lakers to trade for him because otherwise they're getting nothing. If I'm Magic I offer one player and a pick and tell them to go fuck themselves when they counter. KL is a distressed asset that refuses to even step foot in their locker room who will be a FA after next season.   "
"Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Draymond Green all know the day will come. They worry about Chris Paul returning, LeBron going to the Lakers, and Paul George resigning with the Thunder. All provide obstacles in the West for them to overcome. They hadn’t been expecting their dynasty to come to an end this early however, and certainly not at the hands of Michael Carter-Williams. "
"None of that matters. Did you see or hear about some of the things they said to LeBron when he played his first game in Cleveland as a member of the Heat? Shit was terrible. Throwing batteries at him, making comments about how he didn't have a father, etc.   In OKC they called KD a cupcake. Oh my god so horrible. He's Kevin fucking Durant, they'd be glad to have him back. "
Kevin Durant more recently
"We know that it gets harder every year. The money, the personalities, the injuries, teams adjusting to what they do. Kevin Durant could break a tiny bone in his foot in April and that's that. Or Steph and Klay could both get very minor, nagging injuries (sprained ankle for Steph, some sort of leg contusion for Klay) at exactly the wrong time in the playoffs.  Every dynasty is a house of cards - you can do a thousand things right and have it fall apart in an instant because one dude pulls his hamstring in Game 5."
"Isn’t r/nba hilarious?  Paul George: Praised for: Doing him, personal decision of being happy, playing alongside people he likes  Kevin Durant: Criticized for: Doing him, personal decision of being happy, playing alongside people he likes"
"So great to have him on my team :D  Kevin Durant, a freaking Warrior. Unbelievable. I hope he does come back though to his home team that drafted him during his twilight years  When Seattle get a frachise of course "
"Yall had 3 MVPs and no championships to show for it lol so no.   And one of them, Kevin Durant, made the Warriors even better by leaving the Thunder  KD won two championships after leaving your supposed spoiled fanbase lol"
He does do that but the warriors are so talented that steph and klay could be having a shitty night but have Kevin Durant to save them. That's why it will always be dumb to say that Kevin Durant is bad for the warriors.
"As we speak Bill Simmons is trying to create counter-narratives about how Westbrook can't get along with stars.  I forgot what podcast that was but I was like, ""Bill, he literally played with Kevin Durant, I think he can manage."""
Kevin “Snake” Durant 
"He's still friends with Westbrook apparently.  [Kendrick Perkins wanted them to speak to each other, because he felt as if people tryed to make the beef between them more serious than it actually was](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/07/15/paul-george-says-kevin-durant-and-russell-westbrook-are-buddies-again/?noredirect=on). So KD and Russ had a good conversation and PG confirms they are buds again."
Well I mean there “existence” started with Kevin Durant already one year in. They weren’t an expansion team
Kevin Durant is a bitch
Kevin Durant is a cunt.
"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Aron Baynes. My man's out here slanging that 1+1 wood."
"So they're lucky they drafted well after being in the lottery for 3 years while teams were drafting Hasheem Thabeet and Michael Beasley? They're lucky they traded for Paul George and convinced him to stay in OKC after he had pretty much confirmed he was going to the Lakers after the season?  Why not talk about the Cavaliers getting 3 1st overall picks in a row that led to them getting Kyrie, Love and LeBron, eventually leading to a championship? How about the Warriors lucking into Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, and then end up signing Kevin Durant in free agency? What about the Celtics making the trade of the decade, getting numerous lottery picks that lead to them getting arguably the most promising core in the NBA along with one of the best coaches today?"
Alvin Gentry would have won it. He was a lead assistant for the Warriors back in 2015. Adding Kevin Durant? Do you see the pace the Pelicans played at after Cousins went down post-Mirotic trade? They blasted Portland.
"No one cares, it's Paul George not Kevin Durant. "
"“After winning that championship (last season), I learned that much hadn’t changed. I thought it would fill a certain [void]. It didn’t. That’s when I realized in the offseason that the only thing that matters is this game and how much work you put into it. Everything else off the court, social media, perception, isn’t important. What people say, how they view you, it’s not important.”  -Kevin Durant  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kevin-durant-i-thought-championship-would-fill-void-but-it-didnt/"
Jaime foxx should be kevin durant
FUCK KEVIN WAYNE DURANT
PG - Steph Curry  SG - Klay Thompson  SF - Kevin Durant  PF - Draymond Green  C - Zaza Pachulia  Fucking burned them damn haha
I dont want to wish specific injury on anyone but small to medium size asteroid hitting Oracle Arena on a non- game day or possibly only killing Kevin Durant would be nice 
Kevin Durant. He's now 2-1 against LeBron in Finals. 
"Yes, by not signing more than 1 year deal, he's holding them hostage. They can't make 3 or 4 year plans if one of their stars is only signing 1+1's. It means they have to scramble every off-season to make sure they have enough cap space.  You do realise it's the players that are wanting the 1+1's, not the front offices?  &gt; And if things go bad they're not stuck paying a player on a 5 year deal.  No FO in the league is going to feel this way about Lebron James or Kevin Durant. Any team would happily be 'stuck' with either for 5 years instead of being forced to plan around a 1+1."
So are you saying you think Kevin Durant is ruining the warriors?
"&gt; I think he might try to challenge himself  Holy fuck this guy literally just uttered the words ""I think Kevin Durant may try to challenge himself"". This is going straight to /r/nbacirclejerk my friend, comment of the offseason right here.  &gt;He wants to see if he can do it as the number 1 guy or as the leader  HAHAHAHA OH NO NO NO LOOK AT THIS DUDE HE JUST SAID KEVIN DURANT WANT TO BE A LEADER HAHAHAHAHA"
was just doing the math for if Kevin Durant signed the exact same deal in 2020... the final two years of that deal will be over $50M/year. Jesus H. Christ.
Kevin Durant.
"Good decision, free agency is a little crowded this summer without a lot of money teams can spend.  We will be ready for you next year, Kevin Durant."
I respect Kyle Singler more than Kevin Durant.
Are *you* kidding? The media has never loved him like Lebron. He actively talked shit about the media while in OKC and never was close with anyone outside of Bill Simmons. [Remember this?](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-rips-media-you-guys-really-dont-know-s---/) KD has always been outspoken and real about not having a high opinion of the media.
"Your reasoning is flawed trying to make this argument.. Just because people aren't lining up to sign with the Cavs doesn't mean they don't want to play with Lebron  How come stars don't want to play with Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Paul George, etc?"
"But technically you've struck out on much more than just the ones you were in talks with. LeBron, Michael Jordan, Kevin Durant, Shaquille O'Neal....just because they wouldn't even listen to you guys doesn't mean you didn't stike out on them. "
I’ve got it on good sources that Kevin Durant is beside Kyrie. They are both driving thru downtown hardest road begging (thru conspiracies) James Dolan for address to Knicks superteam
Every Steph Curry and Kevin Durant want to pay with LeBron.
Kevin Durant 
"Kevin Durant is also pretty great in game 6s, like in 2016 when he shot 10-31, 1-8 from three, and didn't attempt a shot in the 4th quarter during a closeout game while his team was ahead 3-2"
And this happened that first year: hmm interesting conspiracy:  https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2017/9/12/16288858/2017-nba-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-kevin-durant-under-armour
"Why do you care so much? He's obviously not literally a puppet. That was just a loose interpretation from a fan that is willing to call Kevin Durant ""Snake Boy"", so u/PapaKazoonta clearly is biased in how he sees KD.  Also, you can be an unwilling ""puppet"" in a bigger scheme. You may not know but you may be part of it. For example, I bet that if you buy Coca Cola products, you are unwillingly helping Coca Cola fund the next World Cup in Qatar, which has been know for abuse of foreign workers' rights who are building all their infrastructure. So, you are a puppet for Coca Cola and the Qatar government in that case."
OP's article directly contradicts your claim      &gt; Outsiders have often wrongly assumed that Nike is deeply involved in team conversations with its players. The Swoosh simply isn't steering Kevin Durant to Golden State to stifle Steph Curry's growing Under Armour presence or pushing James to Los Angeles this time around to build upon the legacy that Kobe Bryant recently bookended and tap into a market it has long found success in.
It most certainly did happen  https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2017/9/12/16288858/2017-nba-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-kevin-durant-under-armour
Chris Paul could've saved this team.  But insisted on making 40 mil a year.  Makes you really appreciate a guy like Kevin Durant
So did [KD](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12596449/kevin-durant-says-love-stick-oklahoma-city-thunder-whole-career).
"&gt;Kevin Durant's legacy not impacted at all by joining the Warriors, say multiple anonymous Hall of Famers. Durant very brave to not care about what anyone thinks.       Was Charania just one of Durant’s alts this whole time?"
The two guys who can defend both Steph Curry and Kevin Durant as primary defneders(note not on switching but as primary defenders)   Ive said for a week Hou can tolerate the loss of Ariza if they resign Luc Mbah Moute who overlaps the skill set of Ariza in many ways and honestly before his 2nd shoulder injury might have been better than Ariza. But now that they dont have him.........yeah Houston fans should really start worrying.   A huge part of their switching identity and team just went away with the losses of Ariza and Luc. Now theyve actually really screwed themselves in a matchup vs GSW   Also a side note a Beverley/Bradley/Mbah Moute defensive trio on the perimeter is just filthy.
&gt;Who's your favorite basketball player?  &gt;Kevin Durant  O no
Is kevin durant a free agent every summer ?
Only if Kevin Durant changes teams. 
"imagine thinking a top 3 perimeter defender isn't important to a team hoping to contain Kevin Durant, James Harden, and LeBron James in their own conference"
"Is this some copy and pasted old post. Kevin Durant the 27 year old, and Lebron's 14 year career? "
"The Warriors in the past several years have done nothing beyond what any NBA teams have done in terms of how they operate.   Kevin Durant, however, decided that the hardest road in basketball life is to join a 73-win team. That's something that we've never seen before in NBA history. "
"Kevin ""snake"" Durant"
"In fact, the article provides evidence for the complete opposite of OP's implication.  &gt;"" Outsiders have often wrongly assumed that Nike is deeply involved in team conversations with its players. The Swoosh simply isn't steering [Kevin Durant](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant) to Golden State to stifle Steph Curry's growing Under Armour presence or pushing James to Los Angeles this time around to build upon the legacy that Kobe Bryant recently bookended and tap into a market it has long found success in.   &gt;   &gt;""It's not our job to figure that out,"" Petrie said in 2010. ""It's our job to provide for him wherever he decides to go.""  Like always 99&amp;#37; of Reddit comments didn't even bother to click open the link."
"so players who experience a sequence of 1) no longer playing with westbrook 2) entering the prime years of their careers and 3) get more touches are the only ones who show a trend of ""getting better"" or posting better stats. i didnt find it too surprising.    &gt;The individual improvements from this year’s class of OKC exiles don’t represent a constellation of coincidences, but rather serve as a testament to what players can accomplish once they escape Westbrook’s orbit. Much of the improvement can be attributed to greater on-ball presence; NBA players are always developing, and the best way to acquire new or enhance existing game skills is to practice them in real time against competitive defenses. And almost everyone adds to his creative workload after leaving OKC: Of the 17 players in the sample, Kevin Durant — the one player whose touches Westbrook didn’t deflate in OKC — is the only one whose assist percentage decreased in his first post-Thunder year.  so everyones assist percentage increased after no longer playing with a player who has been in the top 5 in assists every year? not especially surprising.   itd be cool to see this compared to a sample of more players after leaving a high assist percentage teammate like rondo, harden, cp3, or john wall.   &gt;Splitting the group into younger and older players reveals sharp, age-based differences between their last year in OKC and their first year elsewhere. Eight of 11 players in their 20s have increased their points per game in their first post-Thunder season, while just one of six in their 30s have; nine of 11 players in their 20s have boosted their PER, versus just three of six in their 30s.  for every oladipo and sabonis, there is a sefolosha and ibaka. in addition to those two, there are a lot of players who's careers weren't noteworthy pre and post thunder... dion waiters, reggie jackson, jeremy lamb, cam payne, taj gibson etc...  also, i would like to see the bar graph in the article broken down by player. i have a feeling oladipo and hardens numbers are skewing it pretty hard. esp the assist and ppg numbers. "
"Warriors were loved, then we were just tired of them after so much of Espn shoving them down our throats. Hating a team and being tired of them are two different things. I loved the 73 win Dubs, even though I was cheering for LeBron because I fucking hate Jordan Jabronis. Sure i got tired of them, but same goes for any wildly successful team. But KD moving turned the warriors from a super fun team to an OP team that kind of made the next 3+ seasons pointless, and that fucking sucks for everyone who isn’t a warriors fan.   Don’t get me wrong, dubs fans have every right to defend their dynasty, because it’s possibly the best dynasty in basketball since Russell’s C’s when it’s all said and done, but KD moving made basketball not fun to watch. Every other super team was built in 1 year, and the warriors were a super team that added fucking Kevin Durant. Nobody in the history of sports, aside from maybe Barca, ever gave their respective sport the finger as much as the warriors did. That is why the warriors get so much more hate. "
The Kevin Durant story
"&gt;[Charania] Stephen Curry in strong consideration for first team All-Defense, according to league sources.      &gt;[Charania] Kevin Durant's legacy not impacted at all by joining the Warriors, say multiple anonymous Hall of Famers. Durant very brave to not care about what anyone thinks.       &gt;[Charania] Exclusive: Draymond Green has struggled to keep Tourette's syndrome from public. Also suffers from IKR, or Involuntary Kicking Reflex, stemming back to a tragic childhood doctor's visit.      &gt;[Charania] Klay Thompson does not have off nights, only nights when he is less on.      &gt;[Charania] League sources believe DeMarcus Cousins deserves full max contract after contributing 3 points and 2 rebounds per game during Finals sweep of Boston Celtics.       &gt;[Charania] Leaguewide consensus: The Golden State Warriors saved the NBA.  "
"which means that players can and should sign with teams they want like kevin durant. This sub is so quick to praise dick moves by GMs and turn around and say KD had no ""right"""
"Whether or not Draymond gets All NBA and becomes eligible for the super max, there's a lot of rumors swirling that Kevin Durant is going to leave next summer anyway, possibly to the New York Knicks"
Kevin Durant on the Warriors 
Steph Curry to Washington  Kevin Durant to Washington  Klay Thompson to Washington  Draymond to a Kingdom Far Far Away.
"Kevin Durant was making between 30 to 35 million per season from endorsements when he left Oklahoma City. That amount hasn’t really changed since joining the Warriors.  Russell Westbrook and Damian Lillard each earn approximately 15 million per year from endorsements, even though each of them live in a small market. They are both among the top 15 highest paid athletes in the world.  Market size has very little to do with it. It’s all about his ability, personality and marketability."
"Not surprising. He was a spark plug off the bench. A lot of guys like that have really high usage rates. For example, in 2016 Mo Speights had the same usage rate as Kevin Durant. "
"I’m going to go with non-obvious answers, not necessarily the absolute best:  1 year: Tracy McGrady 2002-03 (one of the best scoring seasons ever and led a horrible Orlando squad to the playoffs... averaging 32 PPG on that efficiency in that era with that supporting cast is insane)  3 year: Kevin Garnett 2002 to 2005 (MVP caliber player all 3 of these seasons, one of the most dominant defenders ever while also being one of the best offensive players in the league... Up there for best peak for a PF ever)  5 year: Steve Nash 2004 to 2009 (averaged 17-11-4 on 63 TS% to put into perspective how amazing he was in this stretch)  10 year: Kevin Durant 2008 to 2018 (I don’t think people realize how amazing he has been, arguably the 2nd best scoring stretch of 10 seasons ever and should be higher on all-time lists imo)  20 year: There’s not really a non-obvious pick here but I would say Duncan, Kareem. Dirk in that order"
"&gt; The league held onto the idea of the giant, plodding Center of the 80's and 90's for WAY, WAY longer than it should have after the early 2000's rule changes.   See Greg Oden over Kevin Durant, even after KD almost unanimously won AP player of the year.  "
They were a couple of kevin durant 4-point plays away from winning the following series vs OKC too.
We meme the shit out of game 1 of the finals so much and I felt like we never got to appreciate what Lebron actually did in that game. It takes 4 All stars to stop a Lebron led team. And lets not forget one of those All Stars was the 2nd best player in the world in Kevin Durant.
Kris Dunn - KD Kevin Durant - Snek 
"Let’s talk solely about Lavine and the Bulls then. The Bulls traded away Jimmy Butler for an injured Zach Lavine, Kris Dunn (who averaged 5 PPG as a rookie) and a rookie because they wanted to win? No because they wanted to tank. They purposely sat players like Lavine, Lopez and Holiday because they wanted to lose. They traded away Mirotic who was the reason they went on a 5 game winning streak because they wanted to lose. THEY WERE TANKING. Just like the Kings were tanking and just like the Suns were tanking. You want Zach Lavine to lead the Bulls to 60 wins, while only playing 24 games and coming back from an ACL injury? Kris Dunn, Zach Lavine, Lauri Markkanen are all bad players to you? Devin Booker, Josh Jackson and TJ Warren are all bad players to you? De’Aaron Fox, Bogdan Bogdanović and Buddy Hield are all bad players to you?   By your logic any team that was ever bad was because the players were bad. Meaning Kevin Durant is bad, Steph Curry is bad, MJ was bad, Tracy McGrady was bad, KG was bad. If you’re on a bad team it’s because you suck and nothing else. Right? STFU."

Bird formed those celtics and they became hall of famers because of him. Kevin Durant was a great player who joined literally the best team of all time and it's now collecting rings with no effort. 
"I'm reading the comments and it's odd. Most don't have context to LeBron's popularity. He is the first of his kind. He came into the league as the frontier to the media age. LeBron was a star since 16. His high school games were on ESPN. High school teammates had a documentary about them before he'd even reached his prime: [More Than a Game (2008)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1286821/) The scrutiny his career has experienced is beyond any other athlete in existence due in large part to him embracing the expectations, after his high school \*junior (\*not senior) season:  &gt;James was tagged as ""The Chosen One"" on the SI cover, and the story [profiled the then-high school junior](https://www.si.com/vault/2002/02/18/318739/ahead-of-his-class-ohio-high-school-junior-lebron-james-is-so-good-that-hes-already-being-mentioned-as-the-heir-to-air-jordan) and his rise to the top of the prep basketball scene   &gt;   &gt;""I was worried, that we were going to ruin the kid’s life by putting him on the cover,"" SI writer [Grant Wahl](https://www.si.com/author/grant-wahl), who wrote the cover story on James, [told Jesse Washington of The Undefeated](https://theundefeated.com/features/cover-stories-lebron-james-sports-illustrated-2002-all-star/) back in 2017. ""It’s one thing to do a feature on somebody inside the mag. But when you put a young kid on the cover and proclaim him ‘The Chosen One’ – maybe ‘ruin his life’ is a little strong, but it took things to such a level that I felt like his life was not going to be the same after that. The pressure would get a lot higher.""  Sebastian Telfair [was also on a cover.](http://dsz7vodgjx60a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bil-telfair.jpg)  It was only SLAM magazine, not the world renown Sports Illustrated. He also was drafted into the league from high school. He also had a documentary about his decision to forgo college. He is also out of the league. The pressure was high, and he couldn't meet it at all. I rooted for him like I rooted for LeBron. Many root for LeBron because of these expectatins and hoped which he has met, but the backlash is the expectations don't stop just because he goes quiet or says the ""right thing"". Of course he's culpable in his own popularity and drama at times, but not much of the intrigue would be diminished by a lack of personality -- nor would he be himself.  I've watched LeBron's career from the first game. I was in elementary school. He was playing the end of the King's era his first game. LeBron has always been a joker. A lot of younger fan's don't know him as an [egegarious character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAPF09OHkE) \--  &gt;Kobe says, ""Thats Bron though. Thats who he is, man, laughing, joking, he just loves having a good time;[ he's hilarious.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kSc22al4ag)""  he's just *corny hashtags* on tweets &amp; instagram to a lot of younger fans. I recall fans being thrown off by him cussing on here. LeBron is not a Will Smith of basketball. He's a Jay-Z, which is why he is such a controversial figure, because off the court he moves so shrewdly, quietly, and meticuliously, for the betterment of the CBA and himself. The culmination of all these personality traits, his business acumen (being the first superstar of that kind), a long with his political statements, its no wonder the whole world is watching. However, he is being himself. To curb his greatness, his personality, or any other part of himself would be doing the fans a disservice. Yet, everyone next to him is up for attack. YouTube LeBron's mom and [her ex is bashing LeBron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTjoVllks7s). Steph Curry doesn't get this hate. Kevin Durant does not get this level of attention. They're on pne of the most hated teams maybe of all time, two of the other 3 best players in the world who participated in the last season, and no one cares to that degree about their life. Delonte West rumors continue to swirl like they're guranteed facts ([Anatomy Of a Rumor](https://deadspin.com/5544653/anatomy-of-a-rumor-how-the-gloria-jamesdelonte-west-sex-story-went-viral)), despite [how LeBron helped him through hard times. ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-helped-former-teammate-delonte-west-through-stressful-time/) Theres no rumors like that about Anthony Davis, all we know is he smiled too much [while they spanked him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bc2laTUMY8)  Often in threads about LeBron's superstardom and the consequences of it, most note Jordan couldn't exist in this era. He could. He'd just be more Kobe (beloved by players and his city) instead of LeBron (beloved by the world). Jordan and LeBron never cheated the fans out of entertainment, on or off the court, so anyone next to them is going to be hit by the criticism people want to lay on them.  **tldr;** LeBron James is the first American basketball superstar of the social media era and personality &amp; success only amps up the unrealistic expectations no man can control. Those next to him, whether on the court or off, are always going to be subject to a lot of undue criticism."
"His rings feel cheap but Magic had Worthy and Kareem, Larry had Mchale and Parrish, and Jordan had Pippen  On the flip side they all kind of built their thing together and didn't hop on to each others teams when things got tough  Kevin Durant could have beat the warriors if he stayed in OKC I firmly believe that, they had athletic perimeter defenders and strong rebounding two things warriors struggle with even now and they could have added another all star that offseason  Unfortunately as good as he is he robbed himself at a chance at being a top 10 player of all time by joining them it cheapens his whole career because sport is competition and that move he did was not competitive in my eyes it was a cop out "
"i will say ""good job kevin durant on winning 7 nba championships"""
"I'll defend him all day over Kobe (a topic that seems to come up fairly frequently) because he's obviously the superior player. He's probably a top ten player all time if you care about ability to play basketball. But there is also no question who will win the title for the next three years, barring major injury or Durant changing teams, and that's pretty lame, considering they'd be the favorites without Kevin Durant.."
"You have to view the players in respect to their eras. If you want to look at it as straight up who is the best I could name 10 players better than Kobe in the NBA right now (same goes for Jordan.)The NBA is constantly evolving and improving. The players get better and they’ve all adjusted schematically to fit a brand of basketball that has been proven to be more effective. If you were building a team today I just don’t know how you could justify picking Kobe over Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, etc. "
"You think I wouldn’t tell Kevin Durant his accolades don’t matter? What?  He’s not going to fight me wtf, neither are GSW fans. What does the first part of your comment even mean, how else am I supposed to respond to a reddit thread other than on a screen lmao."
Lol Save this post. This dude is gonna be the next Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant loses a shoe all the time during the game
"The clock’s ticking down in the NBA Finals. It’s Warriors-Celtics and Isaiah has the ball with 5 seconds left. “I left everything on the floor for you, yet you betrayed me,” Isaiah yells as he sprints down the floor. He crosses over Kyrie, runs by Tatum, and lays it in just over Al Horford’s outstretched fingertips as the clock expires.   As the buzzer sounds, Isaiah collapses to the floor. Danny Ainge is overheard saying, “That fucking Isaiah boomed me,” repeating, “he’s so good,” four times.    Warriors win 135-83 to complete their 4-0 sweep.  Kevin Durant wins his third straight Finals MVP, while Isaiah finishes the series averaging with an average of 5.3 ppg in 16 mpg and is added to Danny Ainge’s list of players he wants to sign to a vet minimum in the summer."
Kevin Durant 
"Loyalty by an employee to an employer should never be an expectation. Everyone is entitled to make the best decision for themselves including both employees and employers. Nobody owes a team anything except their services as a basketball player for the duration of their contract.  Having said all that, Kevin Durant is still a bitch."
They only played 7 because Luc was unplayable due to his injury but he was a big part of that team. Basically the Rockets version of Iguodala. The Rockets were a lot better in terms of on/off when it was Luc+ Harden vs Ariz Harden or Luc+CP+ Harden vs CP+Harden+Ariza. Frankly there was a very real case before his 2nd injury he was having a better year than Ariza which is something a number of Hou fans agreed with me on when I said it around April.   Luc in many ways overlaps the skill set of Ariza. You lose Ariza as long as you keep Luc you can replace what he does you just have one less body in the rotation. Not great but you can also trade Ryan Anderson and a future first for a guy on a poor contract but whos at the same general level of Ariza like Kent Bazemore.   But lose Luc and you have big problems. Luc and Ariza were the two guys on that team who could be the primary defender(note switch but actually be the primary guy) on both Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. You lose both of them you've screwed yourself in a matchup vs GSW   This whole situation is just so bizarre. Either a) You pay CP3 that max because you are willing to spend and do whatever it takes to win it all in the next 2-3 years. b) You don't want to pay what it might take. In the case of b) then don't sign CP3 to that max. You either don't sign him or do and commit to going all in and that means spending to bring back the Luc's Arizas and Capela's of the world at all costs. This weird in between of playing with fire and potentially losing the pieces you need to seriously compete for a ring but also hamstringing yourself to $43 mil of CP3 in 2022 just makes no sense. 
"By ""this generation"" do you mean Kevin durant? Cuz joining a 73-9 team sure sure invalidated anything he could ever have accomplished with them lol."
Kevin Durant (4x scoring champ) and Allen Iverson (4x scoring champ) &gt; Kobe (2x scoring champ)  /s
Or is he unlucky that he had an abysmal front office his first 8 years and Kevin Durant is a complete bitch? Goes both ways
&gt; A 7 footer who can shoot like Steph?  You've just described Kevin Durant. 
"If I had to describe Larry, he was Lebron without the explosiveness, but could score like Kevin Durant. I don't know if he would surpass Jordan, but he probably would've been labeled GOAT up until Jordan won his 6th. "
"&gt; Now, if KD used his public account you'd have a point.  The account used is irrelevant. If the intentions of his comments were to make the kid feel bad, it's bullying.  &gt; False generalization? Nope, it's true, evidence is this sub.  You realize that's not how evidence works, right?  &gt; As for false dichotomy, it doesn't matter what you call out, I know what I wrote.  And if what you wrote is a blatant fallacy, I'll continue to discard it as bullshit (which it is) and let you know why.  &gt; It's not being presented as a fact, but an opinion. Your criticism here makes no sense.  Lol you can't state something like that with certainty as if it isn't questionable and then backtrack by saying you presented it as an opinion. You clearly did not.  &gt; Notice I didn't tell you what you can dislike him for. And it's not what I know but what you're showing.  Telling me that I'm lying about the reason I dislike him (which you did) while also telling me that I *can* dislike him for that reason is paradoxical. You're using the latter to save face.  &gt; I can't make a false assertion about something I literally didn't assert  I assumed you were familiar with the Instagram incident considering it was mentioned multiple times and you never stopped to research it or even inquire. So when you say ""what he did wasn't bullying"" when you aren't even familiar with ""what he did"" is definitely a false assertion.   &gt; Of course I didn't know what you were referring to, are you helping me out?

Kevin Durant and Oladipo are from Maryland they'd be in the north east
"Kevin Durant is about to lose a game 7 on the road.  In the last 10 seconds,  arena plays ""call me maybe"""
"MANILA, Philippines – Kevin Durant is all for opposing NBA teams creating rosters specifically built to beat his Golden State Warriors, especially if it means players having complete power over their respective careers.  The back-to-back Finals Most Valuable Player, who is still heavily criticized to this day for leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder and joining the Warriors in 2016, said he “loves” the player movement in the league.  “I think it’s amazing that players are starting to take control of their careers, prioritizing winning is what basketball has always been all about,” Durant said in a Nike press conference at the Whitespace Manila in Makati on Sunday, July 8.  “That’s why we all started to play, because we want to win and have some fun out there. I love what’s going on right now.” (READ: Durant on Warriors landing Cousins: 'I guess we ruined it')  “It’s a great time to be a basketball player, not just in the NBA, but as a grassroots player. There’s so much energy around the game and it’s the best place it’s ever been in,"" said Durant."
"I get that OKC was young but in retrospect, they had Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, and James Harden going up against Lebron, Wade, and Bosh. Which favored the Heat, but not by *that* much. And then behind that the Heat had Mario Chalmers, Udonis Haslem, and Shane Battier, vs. OKC playing Serge Ibaka, Kendrick Perkins and Derek Fisher.   If you took Lebron and Durant off those teams the series would have been in favor of the Thunder by a pretty great margin. Their roster was just deeper. The issue for the Thunder is that they had no answer to prime Lebron - that was right in the thick of Lebron’s best career stretch as a two-way player. "
KD is a [Sultan](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2017/9/18/16327672/kevin-durant-private-instagram-account-arguments-nba-warriors) of Instagram

"Yes, Trae will be facing better defenses. Every player coming into the league will be facing the best defenses and defenders they will ever play against. That doesn’t mean they’re going to all bust though. Players are supposed to rapidly develop when their competition gets better. Steph Curry didn’t pop into the league as the best shooter of all time. Kevin Durant was awfully inefficient his rookie year. But like every star player does, they grew and developed. It’s like natural selection. Your competition gets better and you have to adapt by becoming a better player.   The Hawks have a really solid young core around Trae. Collins, Prince, Huerter, and Spellman are all good players who will coexist well with Trae. They’re young, but that is a pretty damn good core to build around. And they can all space the floor for him.   I wouldn’t be surprised if Young has a really bad rookie year, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he has a great rookie year. I expect his shooting to be bad to start but at the very least his court vision will translate very well. "
Lmao and then **with** Westbrook and an immensely better supporting cast they still lost in the Conference Finals.   Kevin Durant couldn’t win a ring with another superstar and a perennial 60 Win team around him. Couldn’t even reach the Finals more than once. You seriously think he could’ve carried that Cavs team to the Finals? Lmfao. 
Kevin Durant
And Kevin Durant could have gone to 29 other teams.  The fault's not on the team for drafting. It's on KD and Cousins for being soft.
"Lmao what does he need to shut up about? This is a mild joke, how are you guys getting this upset  *Kevin Durant exhales*  /r/nba: smh this snake bitch, can’t even respect him when he does stuff like this"
"Kevin ""Cheat Code"" Durant "
"AD would be an MVP candidate every year if he was on a good team. I put him in the Harden/Kawhi tier, just under Curry/KD/LeBron. Curry/LeBron/KD are all capable of exerting their will on a game more so than Harden/Kawhi/AD. Just look at the Warriors third quarter runs - that's Curry at 100 is basically the shimmy quarter. Dubs were +500 in the third last year.    [&gt; Curry was the NBA’s best third-quarter player this season. In the regular season, he averaged 10 points in third quarters, nearly two points more than any other player in the league, while shooting a gaudy 54 percent from the field and 51 percent from beyond the arc. In the postseason, he’s averaging nine points per third quarter and his percentages have gone up — 58 percent from the field and 57 percent from beyond the arc.] (https://www-mercurynews-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.mercurynews.com/2018/06/03/nba-finals-2018-game-2-golden-state-warriors-vs-cleveland-cavaliers-cavs-lebron-james-stephen-curry-kevin-durant-schedule-news/amp/?amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQECAE4AQ%3D%3D#referrer=https://www.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mercurynews.com%2F2018%2F06%2F03%2Fnba-finals-2018-game-2-golden-state-warriors-vs-cleveland-cavaliers-cavs-lebron-james-stephen-curry-kevin-durant-schedule-news%2F)"
&gt;If you have ever watched him it's pretty clear he is gonna be a **star**  Uhh that’s not what he said. He said superstar  I think most people would agree that Tatum has all star potential but I’ve seen people say that he’s going to be a top 5 player. Dude is a good scorer but he gets talked about like he has a Kevin Durant-skillset. I understand part of that is the Boston media hype but still
It’s not often that I hate players but I really hate Kevin Durant.
"&gt;	Nobody, anywhere, considered that a 24-year-old who was still getting carded at California Pizza Kitchen was the impending nightmare of both LeBron James and Kevin Durant.  I got a good laugh out of that. "
"While I'm ranking 1-10, it's fairly fluid as, albeit it a controversial take, the NBA has a lot of TALENTED guys in it! Therefore it'll be incredibly hard to project as there'll probably be roughly 20 guys who have a shout at top 10.  1. Anthony Davis 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. LeBron James 4. Kevin Durant 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. James Harden 7. Joel Embiid 8. Kyrie Irving 9. Luka Doncic 10. Jayson Tatum  One thing I've learned while being an NBA fan; it is wise to NEVER doubt or underestimate LeBron, and I have little doubt that he will be easily a top 3 guy even in 3-4 years time. Giannis and AD are freaks of nature who will be (and are) perennial MVP candidates because they can dominate both sides of the ball, and are even slowly adding jumpers to their games. KD and Harden are both unguardable, and Kawhi is the best two-way player in the league right now and will still be dominant on both sides. Embiid, if healthy, is probably the second best big man in the NBA right now and as he matures and gains those savvy veteran moves and intuitions, he's continue to be a beast. Kyrie is young and already a top 3 point guard, and will surpass Steph by that time (as he declines). Doncic is going to be a top 3 playmaker, very Harden and Manu-esque, while having vision that will be rivaled by few, and has the fiery competitiveness to will his way into MVP discussions. Then there's Tatum, who oozes confidence and his the love child of Kyrie, Paul George, and Paul Pierce, and will only make his way further up the NBA hierarchy considering he's so young but already so good."
kevin durant
"There is no cosmic retribution, and Adam Silver wants to change the CBA because KD to GSW was anti-competitive. http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/17032907/adam-silver-says-kevin-durant-signing-golden-state-warriors-shows-need-change-league-cba"
"Lmfao, who cares. Curry didn’t do it. It was Durant. He had to ADD Kevin DURANT TO HIS TEAM TO BEAT AN AGING LEBRON JAMES."
"Harden was traded and said multiple times he wouldve happily stayed. Oladipo improved by mirroring Westbrooks work ethic and was very sad to be traded because he wanted to be in OKC. Durant is just a bitch, and Kevin Martin hated playing with him, saying he likes it better elsewhere because no one is trying to win a scoring title.   But please, keep regurgitating senseless bullshit you read from other people without any sort of research or knowledge"
"&gt; If GSW being good now is karma, then how do you explain the Cavs getting good with LBJ only to be stymied by GSW, injuries, and the fucking refs over and over until LBJ goes looking for greener pastures?  Dude brought a championship to Cleveland. That in itself was thought to be an impossibility.  &gt; There is no cosmic retribution. There is an uncompetitive trade that should've been blocked by the league.  Kevin Durant was a FREE AGENT.  He could go anywhere he wanted."
Kevin Durant looked like ass in his first SL and he's a surefire hall of famer. SL doesn't mean a lot
"Durant also bristled at the notion that the Warriors coasted to the title last year, even though they won their first 15 playoff games and finished the postseason 16-1 after a gentleman's sweep of the Cleveland Cavaliers.  ""Do you know how hard it is to be good every night?"" he said. ""Do you know how hard it is to play against LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love? We couldn't bulls--- with them dudes. We could not. They're too good. They're too good to come in the game and not try to win.  ""We couldn't come in the game and say, 'Alright we'll play in the second quarter, third quarter and win.' We had to be on point against those dudes. If weren't we were gonna lose."""
it hard when no easy  -kevin durant
"The antecedent of ""you"" in this case is ""everyone who isn't Kevin Durant"" "
"Yeah Curry in 2016 made it to Game 7 of the finals. Other recent players who made the Finals were Kevin Durant in 2012, Allen Iverson in 2001, Shaquille O'Neal in 1995 and Jerry West in 1970."
Kevin Durant is a snek.  That is so ridiculous.  Kevin Durant is a saint.  Does so much good on and off the court.  
SAS: Kevin Durant is better than MJ  
Yes Kevin Durant did.
"The next best states would probably be:  Ohio (LeBron James, Steph Curry, CJ McCollum)  Maryland (Kevin Durant, Victor Oladipo, Will Barton)  Texas (Jimmy Butler, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan)  New York (Donovan Mitchell, Kemba Walker, Andre Drummond)  Illinois (Anthony Davis, Robert Covington, Fred VanVleet)  Michigan (Devin Booker, Draymond Green, Kyle Kuzma)  North Carolina (Chris Paul, John Wall, Brandon Ingram)"
That 2016-17 Cavaliers team was really good too. They just ran into a brick wall with the Warriors hyper-focused to erase 3-1 memes and Kevin fucking Durant. It would have been another great 6 or 7 game series w/out KD.
"You laugh, but just wait till next summer when we trade our warchest of 35 2nd rounders we've accumulated from like 10 different trades and acquire ~~Luol Deng~~ Kevin Durant with it.   "
I think you’re overating an average redditor’s abilities. You’ll be lucky to get two guys competent enough to attempt what you’re saying. If it was /r/nba specific you’d have better odds and maybe even get lucky and have Kevin Durant or Klay on that team. 
"Kevin Durant or Draymond Green, obviously "
Kevin Durant is *definitely* not Will Smith in this analogy.
Kevin Durant
"He didn’t.   LeBron, Wade, and Bosh assembled a brand new core that hadn’t been tested in the nba before. And the team they assembled it on only won like 40 games and got bounced early.     Kevin durant joined the already well-established core of Curry, Klay, and Draymond. Those three had already been playing together had had proven to to be a trio that could win rings and break nba records for wins in a season. They also had the reigning two time mvp and had just beat Kevin durant.     LIKE THATS NOT THE SAME DUDE!!!"
When Kevin Durant dies from old age or when he’s older he will get a statue for sure. 
Kevin Durant talent wise is top 10 all time  He will end up better than Bird 
you don't want Kevin Durant to come back. Foh.
"The Warriors are a really good team with their star draft picks, but they're not unbeatable. We don't have a problem with that - in fact, most of us really respect that. We have a problem with stars in their prime taking huge paycuts to join a 73-win team. Why don't the people who argue for the Warriors see that? Our problem really isn't with the Warriors. It's with Kevin Durant and now Boogie Cousins."
"&gt; I think every single championship couts the exact same no matter how it's aquired even the Cavs and warriors because every championship team needs a little bit of luck  Objectively, yes.  Every championship counts the same. But when it comes to the legacy argument?  Not at all.  The Warriors rings will be seen as watered down once Kevin Durant joined, whereas Dirk's ring and now LeBron's Cleveland ring will be seen as much more significant given the circumstance and who they defeated.  I agree, there is a lot of luck and near losses.  My point is that given the competition they faced, the luck they had, all of that, this Warriors team from a legacy standpoint is overrated considering they may be the most stacked team, especially now, from a roster standpoint.  A team of Steph/Klay/Green/Durant should not be getting pushed to a 7 game series and nearly lose it to a Harden/Cp3 (who missed the final few games) led team.  This is why I believe given their talent levels, their legacy is being overrated.    Again this is a hot take.  I have no idea why you consider this ""salt"" instead, because it's literally my opinion which is definitely unpopular.   "
even kevin durant used to be a sweet dude
"This kid reminds me of Kevin Durant while Nkilikina reminds me of Mike Conley. If these two develop into even a fraction of those two guys paired up with zingis, basketball could finally come back to the MECCA"
"What is with these posts today not understanding one simple fact. LeBron did not join a 73 win team who he lost to prior to going there.           Kevin Durant joined an established championship roster, LeBron didn’t."
Boo hoo this is garbage   no surprise the guardian ran the story   You can't compare Kevin Durant with Leonard and Anthony Davis com on   
"Nope. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mercurynews.com/2018/01/15/steve-kerr-says-lebron-james-kevin-durant-will-become-two-of-the-greatest-players-of-all-time/amp/  When their own coach is saying Durant and Bron are the two best players of all time, you’re wrong   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/does-curry-care-kerr-believes-durant-second-best-player-nba%3famp  Or Kerr saying he’s the best player on the team period in the postseason "
Kevin Durant is a bitch and so are you
So you’re comparing prime Kevin Durant to role player at best Ray Allen? You need to re-evaluate. 
"I think the person who cares the most about Durant's championships being hollow - is Kevin Durant.  Everything this guy says and does suggests to me that deep down he doesn't feel fulfilled or accomplished.  As much as he tries or shows externally, I don't think Durant respects himself or his unearned championships.    I think for that reason, you can't rule out the possibility that he leaves in the next couple years to go try to earn a championship somewhere.  It's going to eat at him if he never actually wins one in a competitive environment.    "
So things we accomplished in 2015 makes us the best team in 2017? Every other team in the league stayed put and didn't try to match our level? We didn't just get taken to 7 WITH Kevin Durant? 
It's an unpopular opinion only because Kobe had a licence to shoot as much as he wanted for years after Shaq left and Kevin hasn't had that opportunity YET.    Seriously imagine the stat lines we could see if Durant played for the Kings and was allowed to shoot 30 times a game with EVERY shot being a quality one with him being 6 10. 
"This is truely one if the worst comments I've ever read on this sub, I'm definitely saving this for further use.  People who have 0 competitive bone in their body, that's who appreciates what Kevin Durant for his move. You keep linking a quote to his own damn coach LMAO. This is next level delusional "
"If you define ""playmaking"" as ""scoring off the dribble and **passing**"" and remember that the original comparison was to **Steph Curry and Lebron James**, then it's actually very easy to say that Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, and (especially) Anthony Davis are deficient by comparison."
kevin durant fighting with randoms on twitter  strange
"&gt; Ray Allen already proved he could win a championship without joining a previously winning team, in 2008.  Kevin Garnett was the best player and Paul Pierce was Finals MVP.   &gt; He joined the Heat when he was like 36, versus Durant being in his prime and deciding he’d rather get an easy ring.  That makes Allen's ring easier since he could just come off the bench versus Durant becoming the best player. "
"Kevin Durant gave this kid legitimacy. Yeah, he is just saying inflammatory things to spark arguments and get attention, but KD acknowledged it. The Guardian let him write an article because KD was too insecure to ignore something that 99.9% of the league, including both Kawhi and AD, wouldn't respond too. I think this says more about KD than it does about media or the internet in general.   Also, I really don't think Kevin Durant responding to an inflammatory Instagram account has any connection with the current president of the United States. "
That reminds me!   Fuck Kevin durant 
I hope you're not trying to compare an old Ray Allen joining Miami to prime Kevin Durant joining a 73-win team
"I don't have an argument because there is no argument. Kevin Durant will never be respected as he made the biggest bitch move of all time and Stephen Curry is the reason the Warriors got to such a level in the first place, he is their most important player especially considering having him allows Durant to not be consistently doubled. These are facts, not an argument. Just cold hard facts, if somebody can't comprehend this, like you, they have 0 knowledge on the sport. "
TIL Ray Allen in his twilight years = Kevin Durant in his prime 
"Am... Am I Kevin Durant?  Oh fuck, I *did* get into am online spat with some 15 year olds the other day..."
"Yeah, Kevin Durant is clearly the better basketball player than Kobe, but he entirely sacrificed his ability to be considered an all time great like Kobe when he joined Golden State. "
"Nope. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mercurynews.com/2018/01/15/steve-kerr-says-lebron-james-kevin-durant-will-become-two-of-the-greatest-players-of-all-time/amp/  When their own coach is saying Durant and Bron are the two best players of all time, lmfaooooo.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/does-curry-care-kerr-believes-durant-second-best-player-nba%3famp  Or Kerr saying he’s the best player on the team period "
"Could also be ""Gerald Green blew Kevin Durant at the 2008 Dunk Contest"""
"kevin durant is a thin skinned and cowardly snake, but this kid is a complete pussy "
"Not arguing for either player, my point is that nobody could title a thread ""Kevin Durant is better than Kobe Bryant"" today and get over 400 up votes even though Durant has improved as a player over the last 4 years. "
"Well, I think there is a discussion beyond rings and FMVP. I'm less concerned with when people in general thought someone was better than someone else. It sometimes takes a ring or two for us to realize how good a guy is. Just from watching them play and the nunbers it looks like there is an argument to me. It's worthy of more than these lame, low effort comments we see here.   I'm also not dismissing those performances on the Warriors, it's just not like that's the entire argument. Kevin Durant was arguably the best player for the Warriors. Some of that is helped by playing with such a great team, but he's also outplayed the star next to him on various occassions. You dont just play on that level because the guys around you are good.   How much to take away from a guy because his team was really good is shaky. No team has been on this level, but other greats benefitted, too. That we value so much winning a ring and then criticize how you win It is part of the reason we're where we are now."
"The Warriors starting 5    Steph Curry    Klay Thompson    Kevin Durant    Draymond Green   DeMarcus Cousins    You think DeMarcus's first ring this season will have as much meaning as Kobe's rings in 2008 and 2010, or Wade's first ring in 2006, or Dirk's ring in 2011?    You can't just join the greatest sports team in history, get a ring and then be like 'okay I have ring now, I'm better than Kobe"". It CANT work like that    "
"Kevin Durant is the more talented player, but KD is never gonna surpass Kobe in all-time rankings at this point, but he's probably going to be more decorated of  the two when it's all said and done though"
Kevin Durant &gt; Kobe Bryant confirmed
"Don't even go there, Kobe Bryant is better than Kevin Durant"
"""Remember when we got to see LeBron James vs Kevin Durant in back to back finals as well as four times every regular season"".  Anyone old enough to remember feeling deprived of an LBJvKobe final should get this.  To be honest most of the shit people complain about rn they'll probably miss. "
He shouldn’t have apologized to Kevin Durant. He was being a massive piece of shit.
&gt; I’m just saying the playmaking difference isn’t as big as everyone says it is  This is one of the most rash takes I've read on here. Bird is up there as one of the best passers to ever play the game. Kevin Durant isn't even one of the best passers in the league right now. 
This kid parlaying his dumb squabble with Kevin Durant into a career as a sports analyst is up there with Kim Kardashian parlaying her sex tape into massive fame and wealth. Interpret that however you want.
Play above average defense like Kevin Durant level. Oh and stop shitting the bed in playoff games. 
murder Lebron James and Kevin Durant
"Kid, you are all over this fucking thread trying to justify your illiterate horseshit of a comment, and you apparently also on every other subreddit commenting nonsense and making people laugh at you. So you are a full blown troll, so i don't expect you to understand whatever logical shit i'm about to say, but it's alright. I'll do it anyways  &gt;  &gt;I actually think the 2016 victory is by far the most overrated championship I have seen in a while.     This comment of yours, shows that you are actually one jealous as fuck delusional hater, who knows nothing about basketball. I mean, you are bandwagoning the Timberwolves, i don't expect you to know much about ""championships"", but still, don't be so stupid.   &gt;   Warriors broke a historical record held by MJ's Bulls, which was to win 72 or more games in a single season. Warriors won 73, and guess who beat them in the Finals? LeBron and the Cavs.   &gt;   No team in NBA Finals history came back after being down 3-1, but guess who can back and won the whole fucking thing? LeBron and the Cavs  &gt;   Cleveland never won a championship in history of the game, they actually won no championship in literally any fucking sport since the 1940s, but guess who ended that drought and brought them their first ever championship? LeBron did, just like he promised he would do, before coming back to a 33 win Cavs team   &gt;   So gather all of that together, and that's why everyone, atleast most people in the world say the Cavs 2016 championship was historically the greatest accomplishment and moment in this sport, kind of like a cinderella story for LeBron.    &gt;   So i understand that you hate Bron, and really hate that Cavs did what they did in 2016, but atleast stop being a bitch and show some fucking respect kid. Don't trip  &gt;  &gt;Except Lebron did that against a completely different team from the first four games.  &gt;Bogut was out   Yeh, because he was like Prime Shaq right? Real game changer. Even Javale McGee was with the Warriors longer and did more for them than Bogut. Fuck off  &gt;  &gt;Andre became injured   Don't lie. He wasn't injured, just old, and worn out, but he was still great.     &gt;  &gt;Green was suspended for bullshit   Yeh, this also shows you are one big imbecile. Green hit Steven Adams in the nuts, in the WCF. That was a clear cut blow, and he should have been suspended right then and there, but the league for some reason gave him another chance, and let him go with a warning. But dude did almost the same thing to LeBron of all people now, so he was suspended. I mean, he got suspended because he can't keep his hands and legs off of people's nuts. That's not ""bullshit"" kiddo. Stop being so delusional  &gt;   &gt;Curry was clearly limited for that entire series   Why? Because he sucked ass? He sucked ass in 2015 as well. Then in 2017 and 2018 Durant covered him. But stop with the injury excuses just because he got locked down by Kevin Love and got outplayed the entire series by Kyrie. FYI, Kyrie was the one that was coming off a damn surgery, remember?  Have you ever even played sports IRL? Nobody in the post season stays 100% healthy. So just fuck off with the excuses.    &gt;   &gt;Except Lebron did that against a completely different team from the first four games.     This literally makes ZERO sense. At the end of the day, GSW had their 2 time MVP, 3 all stars. Curry and Klay was playing, and Draymond only missed ONE game. Andre was good, Livingston was good, and everyone of them played. Again, Bogut wasn't prime Shaq. Don't use that as an excuse   &gt;     &gt;There’s a reason the entire Cavs team had a huge offensive boost, it’s because Warriors literally just crumbled.     Yeh, that's called ""momentum"", it happens when a team is making a comeback. GSW should have known better, they made the same comeback against OKC in WCF, and OKC crumbled. Then Durant decided to join that team instead, now that's the softest and most cowardly move in NBA history. But it is what it is  &gt;   &gt;Just for more context, Kyrie was even more efficient than Bron in that last three games.    That's not saying much, but you love context? Here's a fucking context for ya. Bron was shooting 50% and above from the field regardless, while carrying the whole fucking playmaking duties as well. So fuck your delusional ""context"".   &gt;     &gt;Dirk’s 2011 was sooo much better.    No it wasn't. Dirk was a GOD that year, no doubt. His one and ONLY great season. But he was surrounded by great pieces as well. But the Heat team that Dallas faced in the finals, was just newly formed and had chemistry issues. The Heat's starting Center was Joel Anthony. That team basically had 3 great starters, and just a non existent garbage bench. So that 2011 title was certainly not better than the 2016 one, where a 73 win historic team was destroyed, and a 3-1 comeback was made as well. Too much unrealistic shit happened in 2016 that will never happen again. So it's not even close. Bron's 2016 title was far greater   &gt;  &gt;I feel like people refuse to see context sometimes.   Again with your fucking context. Yeh, everyone can see your ""context"" on this whole thread and other subreddits. You basically just love to make a fool out of yourself. That's cute  &gt;  &gt;That cav team was also so far above the Mavs...    That's literally not saying much, because a 73 win Warriors team was also a far greater team to face than the newly formed Heat team with no chemistry or identity. 2012 Heat was a totally different monster, LeBron realized he's LeBron, and everyone had chemistry by then. So that's different  &gt;   &gt; but he damn sure didn’t beat a 73 win team in the finals.    Um, last time i checked, that same team won 73 games.. Are you saying just because Draymond missed ONE game, and fucking Bogut was out in the end, they were not the 73 win team? That team literally would have been the greatest of all teams if they didn't lose to Bron in the finals that year. And now, kids like you saying ""oh no, they were not a 73 win team, because Andre fucking Bogut didn't play"" LOL fuck outa here kid. You are just embarrassing yourself   &gt;  &gt;I mean the Warriors essentially lost their 3 best defenders because of some bullshit or injury .   They were also up 3-1 LOL Plus, Dray missed 1 game. That's it. Bogut? Are you really fucking going to keep on using him of all people as an excuse? Why don't you just use your bandwagon GSW flair instead? Hell, even the GSW fans ain't this bias and delusional. This is just pathetic  &gt;   &gt;Lebron was also consistently failing to cover his track defensively as well.    Really? So you wrote 8-9 horse shit comments, and then ended with this? That's just sad. LeBron literally had the block of the year, and arguably the greatest block of all time, which kept the score TIED, and then Kyrie's shot was actually a meaningful winner, because that score was tied. LeBron was carrying the whole offense, as usual. Scoring, and especially playmaking. Kyrie was the point guard, but he doesn't know shit about playmaking.   &gt;  So when a man is carrying so much load, he will rest a bit on the defensive end. That's normal. But he showed he can be a monster defensively when he wants to, which led to that game saving, NBA Finals winning, chase down block. So again, just show some fucking respect kid.   &gt;   Your username says Im pretty real, but instead it should say Im pretty fucking delusional. You are by far the worst type of bias, delusional, disrespectful  and imbecile hater that i have ever seen on this sub. Congrats kid, you played yourself. Delete your account fool"
Kevin Durant is so thin-skinned I’m shocked you can’t see his insides.
" &gt; Then I proceeded to write an article for The Guardian, further embarrassing all-star small forward Kevin Durant for the time he had a moment of weakness and responded to my shitpost about him. Since I added a paragraph at the end stating that he went out of his way to speak to me about basketball in a civilized way, even though I'm nobody and he's Kevin fucking Durant, this article shitting on him once more is justified.  "
What is a 73 win team 3 points away from a championship supposed to feel like they can win without Kevin Durant?  You tell me. I don't see how you can rationalize it as anything other than being scared of competition.
Lol Wikipedia is already pretty friendly towards Kevin Durant if you read his page
"by running to kevin durant crying after losing one of the only competitive matchups they had to face in the playoffs.  Warriors were a good team based off a system, but we never really got to see what they could do because they all decided to take the easy road together. And it's fine if they don't want to compete, but don't expect people to grovel at their feet like they're accomplishing something special."
"I suppose those poor warriors will have to make do with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, ^Kevin ^Durant, ^^Draymond ^^Green, ^^^Boogie ^^^Cousins, ^^^^Andre ^^^^Igoudala....  Edit: come for the shit-talk, stay for the shit show of triggering the warriors base"
I know for a fact that the 2x Finals MVP Kevin Durant is still thinking about the same thing after he swept the Cavs
"But he can't win with those cats, just like the great Kevin Durant"
&gt; I thought about Kevin Durant and Steph Curry but I am not sure if they are top 25 yet.  Wtf lol. They're both easily top 25 right now. Really putting Wade/CP3 over KD/Steph?
"This kid has been copy/pasting comments off here and posting them @ Kd on twitter for literal months   Imagine how happy he was when KD finally replied  ""OMG MOM KEVIN DURANT RESPONDED!!@!@!@!"""
"You're telling me the GOAT gets to play with Hakeem, Kevin Durant-lite, a generational point-guard, and Javale McGee. SMH unfair "
"I just went to bullshit because it’s pointless in this sub to argue.  All everyone sees is the warriors and instantly is horrified at any prospect of another team to beat them because it’s much easier to get upvoted if you follow the general consensus.  Whenever anything is challenged it’s like the most preposterous thing ever.  But like I said, we’ll see, all I know is the C’s have split the season matchups with the warriors every year for the last 3 years. But go ahead and say “*BUT KEVIN DURANT IS REALLY GOOD*”"
"Antoine is good, but not as good as Kevin Durant"
“Kevin Durant is overrated and unlikeable. How can you even like this man? He’s so arrogant”  u/scootermagruder is a prophet

Does it hurt LeBron's image? If so ignore or cry out fake news.  The news about LeBron calling Kyrie soft after Kyrie suffered an injury in the 2015 playoffs? Fake  The news that LeBron called Kevin Durant to team up in Los Angeles? Obviously fake.  The news that Kyrie didn't want LeBron to come to Cleveland that came from the same report as the one about LeBron calling Kyrie soft? That is totally and absolutely true. No need to confirm with any other sources.
Ive been saying this. He will be the next Kevin Durant 
Who is Kevin and why was he violating Durant?
&gt;Ingram wins the matchup against Kevin fucking Durant  &gt;Lakers lose by 4  🤔🤔
"Yes. And I fucking hate Kevin Durant. However, Jordan might be able to make him cry with trash talk and that is certainly not beyond MJ."
"He is sleepy Kevin Durant, watch out when he finally wakes up.."
So it's not disrespectful to rank Kevin Durant over LeBron?
Kevin Anfernee Durant. 
"Kevin Garnett, Durant, Vince Carter, Steve Nash, Curry, Iverson, Dirk, and LeBron sometimes 😭"
Kevin Durant and it's not particularly close 
"First time Mario Hezonja played the Thunder he started to tie his shoe when he was supposed to guard Kevin Durant. Surprising to nobody, Kevin Durant scored and Mario Hezonja has barely played since."
"Lebron is the all playoff points leader, has the 2nd most 40 point playoff games (Jordan #1), and is 7th all time in regular season points. Lebron also has a higher regular season and playoff ppg than Durant and Kobe.

So by every measure, yes, Lebron is a top 5 scorer of all-time."
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant has absolutely no argument against Bird. Zero. 
War Kevin Durant
"Pacific: Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins  There’s your winner"
"Love Ingram. Something about his look and demeanor. He reminds me of a slower Kevin Durant, but I think he's going to bud into an All-Star over the next few years."
Posting content other than “MY PROPOSAL FOR A FIVE WAY TRADE FOR PORTLAND TO ACQUIRE LEBRON JAMES AND KEVIN DURANT FOR UNDER $11 MILLION” does not automatically make it a troll post. 
"#KD VS BIRD  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Larry+Bird&amp;player_id2_select=Larry+Bird&amp;player_id2=birdla01&amp;idx=players  There, now use this comment chain to argue that since I gave you guys the stats."
Don't forget Kevin Durant! 
"SF Kevin Durant (6'11"")"
"Gunna disagree , the boston depth is amazeing.  Also your assumeing the Knicks gain 2 max players without the Celtics replaceing Kyrie.  In this Hypothetical you also have to account for what player takes Kyries spot.  If its an Anthony Davis or or a Kevin Durant or something crazy like that then the Knicks wouldnt even hold Bostons jock."
Steph Curry - Klay Thompson - Kevin Durant - Draymond Green - DeMarcus Cousins  No way GSW is beating that group!
Ok you pulled out one post with 100 upvotes to back yourself up.  I think everyone acknowledged the defense on Steph Curry in the final minute of Game 7 in the 2016 finals.  Love wasn’t great these past playoffs but to say his reputation is that he was carried by Lebron is a huge stretch.   Love was a game high +19 in game 7 of 2016 finals https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/06/20/kevin-love-nba-finals-game-7-cavaliers-warriors/86129026/  2017 Playoffs news article appreciating Love https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-playoffs-2017-cavs-trusting-kevin-love-more-than-ever-and-hes-delivering/  The main reason people called for Kevin Love to be traded was because the Cavs needed a LOT more star power to compete with the Warriors.  But it’s painfully obvious that in the last two years the Cavs were clearly outmatched and outside of getting Anthony Davis no one could have helped them beat the Warriors with Durant.  
But Ariza is the greatest player of all time now that he left the Rockets. Also he's the reason they were beating Golden State holding Kevin Durant to *only* 30.4 pts a game. 
"ok fam i forgot all sixers fans are experts on winning basketball now. it seems like i’m catching the same lecture from a sixers flair any time i say something positive about a player not on their team.   kevin durant said Beas was on his level offensively. a lot of people agree that his offensive talent is on that level. his combined ts% from the last 2 years would be second to only Redick on your squad. the dude is a monster on offense.   yes he had a high usage rate, but i said in my original statement he’s a bench unit guy. "
"A buddy of mine said he saw Kevin Durant take his shirt off in the shower, and he said Kevin Durant had an 8-pack, that he was shredded."
"These lists are always subjective but I would definitely include the Oklahoma City/Golden State WCF’s playoff series in 2016 for these two reasons:  1. The performance by Klay Thompson in game six was just extraordinary  2. The loss by Oklahoma City likely lead to Kevin Durant leaving the Thunder and completely changed the league..  On the downside, there were several games, especially Games 3 and 4, in Oklahoma City, that were complete blowouts."
"In my personal record book, Kevin Durant has NEGATIVE ONE NBA championship.  How bout that?"
Lol this sub is a giant circle jerk of shitty instagram/fortnite/anime memes set to a shitty Drake soundtrack and finished off with a heavy helping of Lebron James Crème Fraiche with a fuck Kevin Durant is trash cherry on top.   It really speaks to the age and maturity level of the average user here. 
All Time- Rashard Lewis  Current- Kevin Durant/Jonathan Isaac   
As a team they are better but it comes down to the question of who is going to guard Kevin durant and can kyrie guard steph?
Kevin Durant is a great player btw. The problem was that he could not win with the cats that were in OKC. KD is the best Kevin out there.
"So basically, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Hakeem Olujuwon and Kevin Durant are the best in every game of a playoff series, especially the formermost two. "
"Could a team of 11 LeBrons beat the Warriors?..... BUT... Steph has to play in a wheel chair, Draymond is not allowed to speak or else he’s ejected, Klay Thompson has to take a max contract, Kevin Durant has to play in a snake costume, and they sign Jahlil Okafur to play center?"
Kevin has kate   Kevin is handsome   Kevin is built   Kevin but not Durant
"Second best in the league at worst, and I'm someone who thinks much more highly of Kevin Durant than most.  I consider LeBron's career to be significantly better than Bird's, and I consider LeBron's prime to be slightly better than Bird's. However, although LeBron is still putting up unprecedentedly impressive numbers for his age, I think his overall impact as a player has decreased from his peak in 2012-13 (masked partly by an increased usage rate last season and less effort on defense). I would probably rank 1985-87 Larry Bird on par or slightly above 2018 LeBron, but behind 2012-13 LeBron."
Kevin Durant was ok to make his move 
Kevin Durant. 
"1. LeBron  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. James Harden  (Davis, Giannis, Westbrook are on the outside for me)"
"&gt; But 20 years from now people aren't going to be saying ""lol KD a snake bitch with a burner account and joined a 73 win team.""  &gt;They'll be saying ""NBA champion Kevin Durant.  idk about that. We live in the social media era. Nothing gets erased anymore. I don't see people fotgetting KD joining a 73 win team"
"snake or not for his legacy it was the right move....second best move, behind staying in OKC and getting a chip there. He would've been an NBA legend for that.  But 20 years from now people aren't going to be saying ""lol KD a snake bitch with a burner account and joined a 73 win team.""  They'll be saying ""NBA champion Kevin Durant."" Hate it or love it, that's the reality we've created. And losing in the finals even once puts a dent in legacy too now. People used to be allowed to lose in the finals, but Jordan had to go 6 for 6 and fuck it up for everyone else."
Greatest small forward to touch the hardwood? Uhhhh... Did you forget Kevin Durant exists? 
"I’ll tell you who I wouldn’t want to sleep over, Kevin Durant.  That man gets up way too early for me."
Kevin Durant side effects
I always wondered about this. Anyways hi Kevin Durant
"In recent memory, Kevin Durant in 2017. I really felt like I was watching one of the most efficient and skillful offensive displays that I've seen in a while.   His performance was an exclamation point on the fact everyone knew- his addition brought them to an unbeatable level. "
1. Lebron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Anthony Davis 4. Chris Paul 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. James Harden
Kevin Durant is 9-5 against LeBron in the playoffs. Their statistical numbers are pretty close.
Kevin Durant: It's called *Free* Agency for a reason 
clearly its kevin durant.
Also [a weekend trip to Montreal](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/presents-19505704/nba-playoffs-why-kevin-durant-sees-world-differently-now) helped him mentally with the recovery from his injury in 2015.
"I can't speculate what they would do but only by their actions. They both didn't. Kevin Durant did.  Kobe had 3 rings but always chasing 6 or more rings against the GOAT. Kobe could have have join other super team to get more rings but he didn't. He stayed with the Lakers even during those painful rebuilding years after Shaq left &amp; Pasol trade.  Lakers had Kobe, Smush Parker, Kwame Brown, Devean George, and Lamar Odom as their starting players. If he would have jump ship, I wouldn't blame him."

I think yesterday proved it's Kevin Durant. And it's not really close 
"Kevin Durant doesn't have any defensive accolades and Michael Jordan has about 13 in total (1 x DPOY, 9 x NBA All-Defense, 3 x Steals Leader), plus KD would have to win at least 4 more MVPs in the next 5 years. TL;DR **NAH**."
"Here, it's Kevin Durant. Among all fans, I'd say LeBron."
It's objectively Kevin Durant.
"Uhh,  kevin durant? "
"""Contrary to seemingly popular belief, the phenomenon of marquee players forcing their way elsewhere didn't begin with LeBron James or Kevin Durant or Paul George. The list actually goes all the way back to Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain and Earl Monroe and includes Charles Barkley, Jason Kidd and Alonzo Mourning as well. """
"Kevin Durant told me my mom was ugly and he said ""at least I got a ring"" 😭"
Kevin Durant has been in the league longer the local wing stop has been opened 
The whole thread is a stretch. There’s a difference between Kevin Durant obsessively checking social media to talk shit on random teenagers and the average user of /r/nba obsessively checking social media to talk shit on Kevin Durant. I don’t really see the Black Mirror comparison tbh.

It's funny that my 10yr old got a snake for a pet and named him Kevin Durant.
"Honestly, I find that to be fucking crazy. I don't use Twitter so I'm not sure if it's a common occurence, but I really did not expect to see a random dude get more likes than Kevin fucking Durant. "
"Can confirm, watching 2015-2016 Curry lead comeback after comeback and taking over games in a matter of like 4 straight possessions from deep was the most fun season of basketball in my decade of watching. Sad we got robbed of that magic with Kevin “The Automatic Bucket Getter” Durant showing up."
It still is except for a few - KD &amp; Cousin.    &gt;Now everybody wanna play for the heat and the Lakers? Let's go back to being competitive and going at these peoples! - Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant went from hero on the basketball court to someone I legit don't like as a human being
Are you.....are you Kevin Durant? Or do I need to find a new slant? THIS NEW SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD IS TOO CONFUSING FOR ME
"I think it has a lot to do with the publicized personalities the players have, which doesn't happen as much in the MLB or NFL. Pretty much everyone who watches basketball (and many that don't) know who Lebron is, may remember the Decision, etc. Similar with KD and his move to Golden State. There's a lot more soap-opera-esque interactions, as well as visibility of those, in the NBA than any other American sport. Meanwhile, outside of my local MLB team most of what I could tell you about players are stat-related, not ""haha Kevin Durant argues with kids online""  "
Yeah that cou- *notices username*     Nice try Kevin Durant.

"Serious, what would happen if Kevin Durant in response penned a ""depression/mental health is serious"" article in My Player's Tribune in response?"
"&gt;Right now, KD's reputation is basically at the lowest point it has ever been  Ehh... don't know about that one chief  [Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Kevin Durant Top Most Popular NBA Jerseys List](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2770986-stephen-curry-lebron-james-kevin-durant-top-most-popular-nba-jerseys-list)   "
It's twisting the narrative because you're trying to make it seem like lebron just joined a regular 47 win team while you make sure to label all the accolades the Warriors had. Why don't you call it like it is like you did with Kevin durant. Durant joined 3 all stars.. Lebron joined a top 3 player at the time who already won a ring and finals MVP and and a top 15 player in Miami. 
"HUGE UPDATE! Kawhi might re-sign with the Raptors, or he might sign with the Lakers. Also, Kevin Durant congratulated LeBron on his move to LA."
"All these comments explaining to me how valuable Iggy is. I'm not stupid, I know how valuable Iggy is.  The fact is that they still had Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Kevin fucking Durant for all 7 games. The amount of mismatches that alone creates is more valuable than anything Iggy can provide to that lineup. That doesn’t mean Iggy isn't valuable. But Iggy guarding a wing is not nearly the same in value as KD being able to pull up over Ariza whenever the hell he wants.   The other fact is that Chris Paul missed two games as well. If CP3 plays game seven it's very likely they win the series and end up champions. If people want to defend GS using Iggy for games 4 and 5, why does Houston not get an excuse for missing CP3 for the last two? "
"That's 2x NBA Finals MVP, Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant is an idiot. 
[Spears] Kevin Durant on my dick
"If Kevin Durant pulled this nonsense in the '80s, he would be getting physically destroyed in every game he played in.  Bill Laimbeer, Charles Oakley, and company wouldn't tolerate these antics.  It's time to implement the Jordan Rules... but against string bean Kevin Durant.  The trick to beating the Warriors?  Beat the crap out of them during the regular season with clean, hard fouls possession after possession.  NBA teams have 15 players for a reason..."
It's outrageously lame for multimillionaire NBA champion Kevin Durant to care what AssStalin69 says about him on Instagram.  It's much less lame for /r/nba to offseason shitpost about Kevin Durant while they poop on company time.  How is the lack of equivalency difficult to grasp?
"Lol how many people on this sub who weren’t even alive at the time say we shouldn’t compare Russell’s rings to Jordan because there were only 8 teams and he only covered short white guys like Wilt Chamberlain? That was 50 years ago  Yeah people will remember the context, and when they forget nobody will care enough about Kevin Durant for his legacy to matter "
"I have yet to see or listen Kevin Durant say or do anything interesting outside the court, the guy's just boring, he tries too hard to be cool and he always fails."
"Players don't get Jersey Sales. The proceeds for those sales are ""Basketball Income"" which is then reflected in the salary cap of the CBA. Players sign away their naming rights in the NBA.   &gt;There is also the fact that living in Cali is probs a whole lot nicer than Oklahoma.  Kevin Durant loses over 50% of every paycheck in California. Northern California has the highest or one the highest rents in the country. The cost of living is incredibly high. His post-career options will now be more limited because he is not the NBA's darling. His endorsements haven't increased.  You're argument wasn't that Cali is nicer and his Jersey sales are up. You said ""It was a business decision"". How is it a business decision if it hurts him financially, cost more to live where he does now, and causes him emotional/mental stress? It's obvious he can't handle the criticism. He wouldn't be lashing out if he could. "
"Kevin Durant is top 5 most insecure athletes of all-time. Jesus Christ, take a day off."
* 1) LeBron James * 2) Kevin Durant * 3) James Harden * 4) Kawhi Leonard * 5) Anthony Davis * 6) Stephen Curry * 7) Russell Westbrook * 8) Giannis Antetokounmpo * 9) Paul George * 10) Joel Embiid 
Kevin Durant passive aggressive on the pod. A comment later came out separate from the pod of cj calling Durant weak. Drama.
"He's a small forward, meaning he would have to play under Kevin Durant. There's a difference in making sacrifices to win and completely devaluing yourself."
What? Am I missing something? Kevin Durant tweeted that something CJ did was soft after he got roasted by the internet when everyone heard KD basically call Portland trash to his face? Or did CJ tweet something  that KD did was soft and then KD replied. Yalls biases cloud you alls judgement 24/7.
"1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Steph Curry   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard  6. Russell Westbrook 6. Anthony Davis   7. Giannis Antetokounmpo   8. Chris Paul   9. Jimmy Butler   10. Paul George  Kawhi needs to be top 5 at least. He gets a lot of flak for how he sat out last year (and deservedly so), but that doesn't take away from his game on the court. He's suffocating on defense and has a complete game on the offensive side.  Dame is a top 15 player to me. Fantastic shooter and scorer, but leaves a bit to be desired on the defensive end. He's stepped up his defensive game, but he's no Chris Paul when it comes to D. On top of that, CP3 is a better floor general who can run an offense and get others to score. This makes him more valuable overall since he improves the entire team, whereas teams who play the Blazers can focus on stopping Lillard in particular.  Embiid is fantastic early on in his career, however we need to see his high level of play sustained. I don't think he's quite there yet, but with another strong year under his belt this year I think he can crack the top 10. He's a tough matchup for anyone, but others have gotten the best of him whereas guys like Jimmy Butler and Paul George are permanent threats. It's tough to compare a center to a wing and argue their value. All of Butler, PG, and Embiid are fantastic defenders, but I think Butler and PG can shut everyone down whereas Embiid still struggles against some matchups.  Butler and PG make the list due to their suffocating defense paired with a very strong offensive game. They're similar players overall that just do it all and always find ways to score."
Without much thought into it:  1-LeBron James  2-Kevin Durant  3-James Harden  4-Steph Curry  5-Kawhi Leonard  6-Anthony Davis  7-Russel Westbrook  8-Giannis  9-Kyrie  10-Embiid
"Kevin Durant is 1 month younger than me.   I cannot imagine being that successful, good at my job, and Wealthy and still let This stuff bother me. I barely deal with social media as it is But I damn sure wouldnt bother reading comment sections with trolls. Go play video games Kevin, Go travel, go hang with friends and family,  Go do charity work, go play basketball, go watch some movies, go watch some TV, go take a nap, Go shopping, Go to the beach, to take some classes. Literally do anything because you have the resources to do anything, but stop crying about social media. "
Not a bad list.   Personally mine would be   1. Lebron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. James Harden  5. Antony Davis  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Russell Westbrook  8. Kawhi Leonard  9. Joel Embiid  10. Damian Lillard.   Really just comes to perception.   The 10-20 range however is really tough   
 * 1.) Lebron James   * 2.) Kevin Durant  * 3.) Stephen Curry  * 4.) James Harden  * 5.) Kawhi Leonard   * 6.) Anthony Davis   * 7.) Russell Westbrook  * 8.) Joel Embiid   * 9.) Giannis Anteokoumpo   * 10.) Kyrie Irving 
"I'm confused at how Kevin is wrong to keep responding but CJ isn't? Or is it just the thing to pretend everything Durant does is immature, even if the other person keeps doing it too? Durant seems a little peeved that CJ would act cool to him to get him on his podcast if this is how he really feels. I wouldn't want someone assailing my character either, especially after they used me for profit."
"people forget but him going to GSW wasn't a shocker out of no where, It was rumored for months that it was getting more and more likely and by the time it did happen no one was really surprised.   I don't expect you to read them, but because im bored and to back up my point, here's three articles speculating KD to GSW, all before the WCF of that year  Nov. 2015 - states the move is unlikely, earliest article I could find in a few minutes of looking http://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-warriors-free-agency-thunder-wizards-stephen-curry-golden-state/1t6dmolxwdo8a1aldv684guf3c  Here's two from May 2016 https://www.si.com/nba/2015/05/01/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-klay-thompsons-dad  https://thunderousintentions.com/2015/05/02/kevin-durant-rumors-is-golden-state-an-option-for-kd/  "
There's a difference between the average user here and Kevin fucking Durant lol.
"All I was trying to say is that mental illnesses don't magically appear because people talk about them. Most go undiagnosed. And while it's true that most people don't have mental illnesses, the contrary is true when we talk about mental health issues.  That being said, if you were to ask my ""opinion"", I don't think he has a mental ILLNESS. I think he's just going through a rough time, mentally. His behavior has certainly gotten more erratic over the years.  Also, my main ""assumption"" was that a ""lot of people"" wouldn't believe Kevin Durant. Didn't mean to lump you in on that assumption. Sorry for that."
"What a load of shit. I’m not ‘assuming’ anything, quite the opposite in fact. Most people don’t have mental illnesses. Durant has never spoken publicly about suffering from mental illness. To attribute his sensitivity to possible mental illness would be ‘assuming’.  You’re also *assuming* I wouldn’t believe him if he said he did have a mental illness. Why? What in my prior statement, or my post history if you’re one of those types of people, would suggest that I wouldn’t believe him? I don’t give a shit about most people or what they would do or assume. Until such time as Durant opens up to the public about mental illness, I’m not going to attribute any of his actions to mental illness. If he chooses to open up, and in particular if he explains his sensitivity to criticism as a symptom of mental illness, then it would be reasonable to compare him to Kevin Love.  Armchair psychologists are the fucking worst, and I have no interest in being one. If I don’t know somebody has depression, why would I try to diagnose it based on a few tweets? "
And he means that the Big 3 even in it's prime wasn't even close to the team that Kevin Durant joined.

"I’m not holding Jordan’s first round losses against himself as a player. It just shows how much of basketball is a team game. Jordan’s teams were completely stacked including his organization being competent and coaching staff. Way better than LeBrons teams were in my opinion. If the 3 pointer was nonexistent back then, just shows you how much harder it is to defend since you have players like Kevin Durant that could shoot 3s and slash. You have players like Steph Curry who made more 3s in 2 seasons than Larry Bird made in his career.  So Jordan would win more finals than LeBron did in his situation and LeBron wouldn’t win in Jordan’s situation despite playing with Phil Jackson as his coach and multiple hof players around him. You really believe Jordan could win against the 2017 warriors when LeBron averaged 34/12/10/1/1 on 63%ts. Do you realize how much LeBron brings to his team? He’s possibly the best all around player and teammate ever. Have you not watched basketball since he was drafted?   To come back 3-1 against the warriors LeBron literally had to average more points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals than anyone on either team to win a 7 game series. Jordan wouldn’t be able to do that. Especially against a 73 win team."
"Well this is a shitshow of a serious thread lol. I'll throw my two cents in anyway though.   &gt; Clearly KD's rings are (rightly) discounted more.  Why? (I'm asking because I just want to know more of your argument not because I inherently disagree.)  &gt; But it seems like LeBron's 2 rings in Miami aren't discounted even though he joined 2 other superstars like KD did.  A lot people say their rings get discounted, but I really don't think they do. For example, when KD first joined the Warriors a lot of people had him as a T25 player of all time, but today I see people throwing him in T15 range. And since his regular season performances have been worse with the Warriors the rings can be the only thing putting him forth that much.  Also, what constitutes a discredited ring? Of course, the super-team argument is based around having players around you so good that you didn't need to work for your ring like other players did. With that being said, are Russell's rings discounted? The skill gap between the Celtics (and Lakers to a good extent) compared to the rest of the league was far wider than the gap between the Warriors and the field today. The Showtime Lakers (in the mid 80s specifically) had a big four just like the Warriors. Does that hurt Magic's or KAJ's rings?   For clarity, I do think championship rings weight differently. And I do think KD's holds less weight than Kobe's final two, Dirk's, Pistons, etc. But I also think there is a huge exaggeration of how good the Warriors were before KD joined. They were a true competitor, but they certainty weren't a super-team.  Here are rotational players today from that team:  - Bogut - out of the league  - Barbosa - out of the league  - Ezeli - out of the league  - Clark - Minimum player for the Pelicans  - Livingston - still a very solid backup pg  - Iguadola - still a great 6th man   This leaves Draymond and Steph who had (and probably will ever have) their best seasons in 2016. And Klay was great as well.  So, to me, the arguments *for* calling the Warriors a super-team before KD joined ends with 73 wins. Our big three was no better than the Bulls, Heat, Thunder, or Spurs. And our supporting cast was never an all-time great one.   *(Granted, it was certainty better than the Cavs throughout these last four years.)*  Kevin Durant's 2017 Finals performance was the greatest performance made by anyone in a Warriors uniform. (Rick Barry's 1975 playoff run would be a close second.)   Had Durant not signed with the Warriors, we're still a T5 team in the league, but we're the clear 3rd best team in the conference. It's important to remember than if we don't give KD...  - We give Harrison Barnes the max. Who notably hasn't been as good as at least Warriors fans would've guessed in Dallas.  - We still lose important veteran bench players that weren't even aging well anyway   - And we don't get Zaza or DWest for the ring chase.   Thus, we have a worse starting lineup and worse bench from the 2016 season in which Draymond and Steph will never had repeated their performances as it is.  My point in all of this? **KD ring's hold less weight compared to the majority of the rings won in the 21st century, but Warriors haters over-exaggerate how good the Warriors were before him.** If KD doesn't come the Warriors it's very likely Steph's Warriors only win that 1 ring in 2015.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Last thing, because I want to address the Lebron part of your post too. His rings shouldn't be discredited there at all. He should've left Cleveland, but he should've done it the same way any other player did it instead of revealing it on national TV and then having that hype event a week later. His talents were being wasted in Cleveland. Even today, there's no excuse for a T2 player of all time to have one won 1 ring in 11 seasons with the same team. **He made the move necessary to match-up with the Celtics, because Cleveland was failing to do so.**  This post is long enough, so I won't go too much further, but I also believe people's hatred for KD's move and his sensitivity to his hate has caused people to dismiss what actually happened and what was at stake during the 2016 free agency. I also think there is an argument (pro-KD) about why his rings shouldn't be discredited as much as people think they should. Nonetheless, if there are people that disagree with me I'm all for the discussion.  "
"&gt; he sleeps very soundly until 8:30am  That's not true, KD argued on his burners [and even questioned the worth of his 2nd ring](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kevin-durant-i-thought-championship-would-fill-void-but-it-didnt/)"
Lebron created a new threat. That's like saying trading for an all star is ring chasing. Kevin Durant went to an established winner that clearly didn't need help
yea but fuck kevin durant tho
"Yeah, I'm kind of over it. Making judgement upon people puts me in a .....negative mood. Time heals everything and I'm still a Kevin Durant fan (although, I do find his twitter antics absolutely HILARIOUS)"
"No it's not. Yall nerds take your basketball heroes way too fucking seriously. Kevin Durant went from one team that puts a ball in a hoop for money, to another. That's it. Nobody got physically hurt. Nobody got ""jumped"". Everyone is still a millionaire. KD is saying ""wow, you're really gonna compare me going to a different basketball team, to turning on my own brother in gang violence""? Even if it was just a metaphor, there were PLENTY of other ones to use.  I mean I was the biggest Lebron hater every since his move to Miami, but wasn't loser enough to take the move outside of basketball. "
I honestly don't believe Kevin Durant respects himself deep down.  How could he?
You know who did choke though? The Warriors that won 73 games. They choked like a motherfucker. They choked so damn bad that Draymond Green had to BEG for Kevin Durant to come help. God damn. 
"As KD's agent put it, ""Why the fuck did you let me do this to my life"" and ""rock bottom"" were some words used to describe KD's immediate reaction after signing.  &gt;He [Durant] was feeling the full brunt of the Internet’s fury about his perceived betrayal of Oklahoma... and the flak he was taking from people in Oklahoma City who had once professed deep affection for him was overwhelming. “To have so many people just say, ‘F— you,’ that really does it to you,” Durant tells me, still clearly anguished. “Because I truly had invested everything I had into the people I played for... And for those people that I know and love and trust to turn their back on me after I was fully invested in them, it was just... more than I could take. I was upset.  &gt;“That was before I met anybody from the Warriors and dove into the culture. I was basically on my own,” Durant told Steinberg.  &gt;Kleiman said a panicked Durant called him early one morning from his hotel room in China.  &gt; “I was up at 6 a.m. and he [Durant] calls me and says, ‘Yo, are you up?’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, what’s up?’ And he’s like [yelling], ‘Why the f— did you let me do this to my life?’"" &gt;  &gt; “That hotel was rock bottom,” Durant told Steinberg. &gt;  &gt;“I was worried about how my peers were going to feel about me,” he told Steinberg. “In my profession, that’s the only thing I care about. So when I was talking to Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, and they were like, ‘Congrats, man, do your thing,’ and Paul George was like, ‘Congrats, man, I am happy for you,’ and Kevin Love was like, ‘Shoot, do what you gotta do,’ that eased my mind a little bit, because I want that from my peers.”   "
Rooting for a player just because he’s good is the Kevin Durant of basketball fandom
Kevin Durant is no doubt da best player in da league if u disagree u a blogboi n don't really hoop probably don't even got some 💩 with u or a step back hesi jimbo
Watch out for his apologists. We should just understand what he is about... it's illegal to hate Kevin Wayne Durant.
Neither does Kevin Durant apparently
"That’s fair, as a Thunder fan I think he was the 2nd best player but I can definitely see how it’s not undeniable. But that does not ruin my point whatsoever he is still Kevin fucking Durant possibly the best scorer of all time."
"Do you have PJ Tucker over Kevin Durant at small forward because of ""small""?"
Kevin Durant is such a drama queen
"I dunno... I honestly think KD is feeling a way... maybe on the podcast it was chill, but seems it’s not now   https://www.yahoo.com/sports/kevin-durant-ugly-twitter-feud-c-j-mccollum-called-move-warriors-soft-014402147.html"

Hmmmmm probably Kevin Durant.
I hate Kevin Durant with the fire of a thousand suns but if I became a billionaire tomorrow I'd still browse reddit. Why wouldn't I? Sure I'd be out doing cool stuff more but having a bunch of money wouldn't stop me from browsing r/nba while taking a dump.
Kevin Durant is winning though because he is a winner.
"Tbf he briefly considered whether to include Magic but was pretty assured in his final response.   Downvoted? :(  Listen to the response at 1:30, he briefly stuttered Magic then decided on the 4 pretty confidently.  https://player.fm/series/pull-up-with-cj-mccollum/kevin-durant-part-2-nba-mount-rushmore-playing-college-ball-and-the-toughest-players-to-play-against "
"Next season on ***The Defenders***, Daredevil, Power Man, Iron Fist, and Jewel must team up to defeat their most evil villian yet.  The one and only  #Kevin Durant  His powers? Hes a snake that's taken human form. So hes long and skinny with no genitals."
"Kevin Durant is an amazing basketball player, world champion, scoring champion, MVP, assassin. Off the court, cupcake. Forever and always."
"Kevin Durant Highlights 7/25 vs CJ McCollum, SAVAGE MVP SNAKE MODE!! "
"If you get all your information from r/nba, which it kinda seems like you do, you're going to get a very biased narrative about the kind of person Kevin Durant is.   If you actually listen to him speak, not just read the aggregated quotes on twitter, you'd get a much better sense of the kind of person he is.   You just seem fragile and insecure when you attack somebody constantly for making a sports decision you don't like. But this entire subreddit is full of kids who don't experience reality, so none of that matters to them and likely to you."
And you could be hustling and doing something productive to get that million but instead you're arguing online. Who's honestly sad now? You've gotta have some kind of warped logic to think what you just said makes Kevin Durant sound worse than you. He can go do that when he's finished arguing online. You can't. You're the sucker.
"I personally love the mental image of Kevin Durant, on a yacht, surrounded by beautiful women, being served the finest food and drinks...and being totally focused on putting some unemployed teenager on the internet in their fucking place. "
"Not sure what's the craziest thing from the video. The fact that Kevin Durant is in a Thunder jersey, the fact that James Harden in a Thunder jersey, or the fact that Jeff Van Gundy called Clay Bennett a great owner right before Bennett's cheap ass traded Harden."
That if the Warriors could go back in time they wouldn't sign Kevin Durant.   There really isn't a close second. 
"- In response to: Hey @CJMcCollum permission to start using the B word again for KD? (Kevin Durant straight up laughed at the Blazers getting swept and Boogie signing with Golden State to CJ McCollum on CJ’s own podcast. https://twitter.com/KrisHansonRCF/status/1021976548746899458 )   - CJ: I still think the b word is harsh and shouldn’t be used. . He know that decision was soft but I respect it. It’s like getting jumped with ur brothers by a gang you should’ve beat then joining the gang that jumped u and ur brothers 2 months later &amp; forgetting about your bros  - KD: So,I would get into a gang fight, lose, plot on my brother for 2 months in our home and then go get the gang we lost to and beat him up? U think that low of me CJ? I just did your fuckin podcast. Snakes in the grass boy I tell ya 🤣"
tell me the truth  are you secretly kevin durant
"Agree. Lebron takes way more heat than Kd *even now*, but he is mature about it and just does his thing. Most people would go mentally ill with all the attention Lebron gets. Imagine people talking about you and analyzing you everyday on TV. Look at celebs like Britney Spears and Bieber and Miley and Michael Jackson. And of course, Kevin Durant."
Yeah and he got to the finals and lost to an incredible Miami team with peak LeBron plus Wade and bosh and a great roster.   His team against GS had plenty more talent than McCollums. Namely him being an MVP and Westbrook being a better second option than McCollum.  But they also did a lot better than this Portland ever has so not really sure of your point.  Kevin Durant left OKC. They replaced him with PG and added Melo and got bounced in the first round.
"Kevin Durant calling CJ a snake, lmfao.  Pot, kettle."
The fact that people will never let this go Kd just needs to stay off social media and stop carrying about what other people say about him. He’s the second best player in the league way far ahead of Cj and Cj is my guy but it’s true. Most of these people push KD hoping he responds and honestly every-time he does he looks very childish by the things he says. Fuck what other people think about how you go about your job that you get paid millions for because most of those people wake up everyday with the words I Hate Kevin Durant being the first that comes to they mind
Well most people on r/nba are likely unemployed teenagers who have nothing better to do. Kevin Durant is a professional basketball player that makes millions which is why it’s sad lol
"""They're just having fun,"" increasingly nervous KD fans stammer as Kevin Durant starts DMing fifteen year old kids to talk shit"
Kevin Durant is a living delusion

And btw saying kawhi was the second best player isn't revisionist history, the majority of these are from 2016, 2017 before he got injured."
"Ring weight is a thing now. Kevin Durant has shown us how rings can be essentially worthless and thus his accomplishments are meaningless. He knows this deep inside. No matter how many rings he wins, they are going to be worth as much as Robert Horry's rings. "
I'm not surprised to hear this from CJ. Isn't he good friends with Kevin Durant? 
I hate you Kevin durant 
Half of those are from Kevin Durant. The other half are from Eric Jr.
"Kevin Durant causes a fan to commit suicide after taking shots at the fan after the fan says, “Your championships don’t mean anything, that was a soft move, get your own team man.”"
"The third time I ran into Kevin Durant I was working at the old arcade off route 67 back home. Man I loved that place - mostly locals with their families or groups of kids coming in to check out the old Atari machines or play Snake. Felt like a real community, you know? One day, must have been in the summer because I remember it being so hot the pizza delivery actually got hotter just sitting outside, this rusty truck pulls up and a 7-foot-tall string bean gets out and claims he's here from ""corporate.""  So I tell him that I didn't hear anything from corporate saying that I should be expecting someone to swing by. He just shrugs and laughs at me and pops open his trunk. I ask him what he's here to do and he takes off his sunglasses and turns to me and says ""tech support"" and pulls a huge toolbox out of his trunk and starts walking towards the arcade. His hands are full so I offer to help carry stuff, but he insists on taking it all inside alone. About 5 feet from the entrance his wallet falls out of his pocket and lands on the ground in front of me. A card had fallen out of the wallet so I pick it up and look at it, and it's just a bunch of random usernames and logins, possibly up to 50 of them, with passwords next to them. Flustered, KD snatches the card out of my hand and storms into the arcade.  I follow him inside but he turns to me and tells me ""don't worry about this I got it."" Suspicious, I walk out and resume eating my scalding pizza in the dusty parking lot, but I keep an eye on him. I notice that he's going to every single machine and unscrewing the control board and typing something in. At one point, a bunch of kids show up and try to head inside to play some games, and KD shrieks at them and locks the door, flipping the OPEN sign to CLOSED and snarling.  About two hours later, KD finally emerges and says ""all set, thanks boss"" and walks towards his truck. I quickly shuffle inside and take a look at a few of the machines. Horrified, I immediately notice that every single one of the top scores on every single machine has been edited to say ""&amp; KD"" at the end. Billy &amp; KD, Pauly &amp; KD, Deb &amp; KD...every single one..some of those scores had been there for 20 years!  I run out to KD and scream at him ""YOU DIDN'T GET THOSE SCORES, YOU PIGGYBACKED ON SOMEONE ELSE'S SUCCESS!!""  He rolls down the window of his truck and looks me dead in the eyes and says ""in 20 years nobody will remember how I got those scores, they'll just count the wins"" and drives off into the distance. That was the third time I ran into KD."
Kevin “I started listening to top 40 radio in 2008” Durant. 
Then why did he get [Tupac's face tatted on his whole lower leg](https://www.sbnation.com/2016/7/21/12251402/kevin-durant-tattooed-tupacs-entire-dang-face-on-his-leg) if he doesn't even consider him top 5?
Unpopular opinion: Who gives a shit if Kevin Durant responds to negative attention on social media or not? This tweet shows that he's at least somewhat self-aware of the image he's formed for himself in responding to stuff like this. It's not like he's saying anything malicious or out of line.
Sure but would Kevin Durant?
2008:     MVP: Kobe.     DPOY: Garnett.     ROY: Kevin Durant.      6MOY: Manuel Ginobili.      MIP: Hedo Turkoglu.      That's 4 hall of famer plus a decent role player.
"I misread the title as Lebron James, Kevin Durant called Draymond Green, Tristan Thompson Fight. "
WOW Golden State Warrior got great starting 5 line up Stephen Curry Klay Thompson Kevin Durant Draymond Green and Demarcus Cousins 
Having Kevin Durant helps.
Not entirely. Lowe talked to Durant's father and other people around him for this article  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23766415/zach-lowe-kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-dynasty-nba
"KD's teams have been as good or better than LeBron's since OKC was title favorites against LeBron in 2011-2012. From that point on Wade only declined in talent the next 2 years. Kevin Love wasn't even an All-Star his first year in Cleveland. You interestingly only talk about record when it's convenient for your argument.  Simple fact is Kevin Durant left a top 10 player in the league to join a 73-9 team, LeBron has only had the luxury of playing next to a top 10 player his first 2-3 years in Miami depending on how much you think Wade had fallen off by LeBron's 3rd year in Miami."
I think the criticism Kevin Durant is getting is undeserved. So what if he switched teams.   Yes. I am Kevin’s Durant
"I think he can step his playmaking up. He averaged 4.6 assists (with only 2.2 TOs) in the playoffs the last year he was healthy.   By comparison, Kevin Durant didn't average 5+ assists until his age 25 season. By the time Kawhi turned 25, the Spur's formerly pass-heavy offense from their 2014 championship had become more post and isolation-focused to better fit Lamarcus Aldridge.  I think Leonard will average between 4 and 5 assists per game this season in Toronto."
"Kevin Durant, who is the match up for Roberson, has shot 55% from the field and 52% from three since being on the warriors against okc. Still without a starter and replaced by a g leaguer. "
"&gt;	In what would be best told by the late great storyteller Charlie Murphy, the “streets” turned out to be the swanky Delilah restaurant in West Hollywood on July 18. Both Green and Thompson were guests of LeBron for this ultra-exclusive affair — which prohibited phones and cameras. None of the attendees expected the on-the-court drama to flare back up in this setting.   &gt;	Which is why everyone was stunned when Thompson, according to sources, out of nowhere attacked Green.  &gt;	No argument. No squaring up. No taking it outside.  &gt;	“It was a sucker punch,” said one source who attended the party. “But, to be honest, it wasn’t really a punch. It was more like a shove.”  &gt;	It was a face mush, another source described it. Other reports have described it as a legit punch, maybe even a quick one-two.  &gt;	Whatever it was, Green was incensed, according to the sources.  &gt;	Again, the two separated before a full altercation could ensue. Several NBA stars, among them LeBron and Kevin Durant, intervened. They were reminded this wasn’t that type of party.  &gt;	After a conflict resolution session among NBA millionaires, temperatures settled. The party continued with Green and Thompson co-existing without issue, laughing and partying the rest of the night.  &gt;	“Man, that wasn’t no fight,” one source said. “It was much ado about nothing.”   Sounds pretty stupid.  "
"Kevin Durant leaves GS after a 3-peat. Just have a hunch   Boogie re-signs, though "
"lmfao because KD has never even come close to Lebron's level this past playoff run.    When has KD ever averaged 34 or more ppg in a playoff series?   Literally only once- 2017 Finals VS Cavs he put up 35/8/6 on 70TS. That was a great performance, but you can't separate KD's success in that one series from the Warriors system and the fact that Steph and Klay were creating space, and that the Warriors were stacked beyond hell. Throw in the fact that the Cavs really were below average defensively and you'll see that KD's performance vs the Cavs doesn't necessarily translate to the Pacers.    So I wager that Kevin Durant is NOT capable of even scoring 34ppg on 66TS against the Pacers, much less throwing in an additional 8 apg. Durant has literally never in his entire career put on a scoring performance as good as 34ppg (66TS) outside of that one series vs a Cavs team ranked 20th in defense. I see no reason to believe that he would be able to do so against a team ranked 9th in defense, *without* the extra spacing and help "
"1. Kevin Durant has been the best player in the league since 2014 (not counting 2015 injury year) and the Thunder would have won back-to-back titles the last two seasons if he just stayed in OKC.   2. The Warriors before KD were a historically great regular season team who were overrated in the playoffs.   3. Philly will under-perform this year and there will be significant locker-room turmoil by the end of the season. One of Embiid or Simmons will likely be traded.   4. Kawhi wins MVP, the Raptors win the finals, and Kawhi get a tattoo of a maple leaf on his ass. "
"Looking at you, Kevin Durant..."
Lowe also said based on his actual reporting in his recent-ish article about KD that no one really knows what KD wants  Edit:  this one: http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23766415/zach-lowe-kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-dynasty-nba
"Lebron is one of the best and most overrated players of all time. No one has had a bigger presence of online shills to bolster up his career and crown him the great and it's been going on 5+ years now at least. He's selfish and a stat padder and the current superteam arms race NBA is thanks to him and 'The Decision.' No players before then had teamed up personally in the offseason and chose to create a superteam before that point. Others were GM made. Now Kevin Durant has beat him at his own game by joining an already great team and he'll be the one who stops any chance Lebron ever has to win another ring, which is what he deserves. Also, he's a defensive liability but his stans ignore that completely and use his offensive stats are their main excuse. Something no other 'goat' candidate would ever be able to use as an excuse for poor performance on one end of the floor."
"I'm actually happy about the DeRozan trade. The Raptors finally got out of purgatory. If Kawhi stays or leaves, we get a new direction from the team.   The NBA Champions will come from the East.  I don't think Simmons ever gets a dedicated shot and you know what that's okay.   LeBron is the greatest ambassador in the history of Sports. A true role model to look up too. As a human, he one of the GOAT.  Allen Iverson is a smaller Melo. Still love him tho.  Donovan Mitchell had peaked.  Blazers should move Lillard.  Anthony Davis is a Pelican for life.   Kevin Durant is closing in on LeBron as the best player in the league.  Charlotte should NOT blow it up.  Trae Young will be a great player of a bust there is no inbetween.  In terms of impact to the team, Lowry is actually the Raptors GOAT.  I'm really happy that people are dealing that DeRozan is really good. It just taken him to be traded from Toronto   "

"Yes wtf are you smoking hahahah. Scoring more points than someone makes you a better scorer. Otherwise Kyle Korver is a better scorer than Kd and Lebron because he's more efficient.  Hell, by your logic Kevin Durant wasn't the best scorer in the nba in 2011 and Lebron should have won the scoring title even though he averaged one less point than Durant but Lbj was more efficient. Pick your poison kid."

"If Kawhi is healthy he’s my dark horse candidate.  I think he’s a huge upgrade from DeRozan, and if healthy could lead the Raptors to the best record in the league.     Meanwhile, I don’t think the Lakers or Pelicans are good enough to come close to a top seed.  It’s not that Kawhi is better than Davis or LeBron, it’s that he has more support in a weaker conference.  But my leading candidate is Kevin Durant.  "
"I think California would run away with it, but I agree that Ohio would be 2nd.

"&gt;Ok but there is something different about raptors and blazers situation. They didn’t beat a record. They didn’t set a record for most wins in a season. That warriors team did.  They did. They set a franchise record for most wins in a season; 59 wins. But they still got swept by a very weak Lebron team. Regular season wins are overrated. The Cavs and Warriors have shown that repeatedly.   &gt;Of course u can’t understand the hate. It’s your team. I was a huge fan of Kevin Durant in OKC and with him as a player and shooter and everything. I’m more of a Kobe fan than lebron if you are tryna insinuate me for being a lebron fan (idk if you are but just saying). But of course you will never understand the hate bro, because it only made ur team better.  Thats fair. I also respect players who stay with their team like Jordan and Kobe. But I also get it if they leave and try to go to a better situation. I hate it when people bring up the argument: ""Well Magic and Bird would never leave their teams!"" Well no shit. They were going to the finals against their rivals and winning some but also losing some. They would have no reason to leave. But the KD situation is different. We weren't rivals. He hadn't made the finals in several years, plus his franchise traded a MVP away because they were being cheap. Fuck that. If the warriors did that to Steph I wouldn't blame him for leaving.   &gt;what has happened is the balance in basketball before that trade made it so the warriors were beatable.  please don't bring up the ""balance of basketball"" argument. No one was complaining when lebron was making the finals 8 years in row by creating super teams on multiple teams. The Spurs had won over 60 games in 2016 yet people were hoping KD would join them instead of us. What about that competitive balance? Its an easy cop out because fans are pissed the warriors are dominant and continue to find ways to stay domiant. "
"Lakers had LOTS of cap space this year, they were 10th worst,   Warriors has space for Kevin Durant(!!!!) And we're conference finalists the year before.   Also, does it mean teams would go over the Max contract to sign rookies who BTW are not yet part of the NBAPA??.   And last, only way this would make sense if it happened after free agency where contending teams would be forced to spend and resign players out of fear of losing the bids.  Still a bad idea though. Teams will find other ways to improve their odds, better it be through losing late season matches than trying to get as many 1 year deals players on the floor as possible and have them play selfish for a payday."
"Ok but there is something different about raptors and blazers situation. They didn’t beat a record. They didn’t set a record for most wins in a season. That warriors team did. Sure the Thunder vs Warriors was a really good match up and was obviously close, but that’s because KD was playing for the other side.   Of course u can’t understand the hate. It’s your team. I was a huge fan of Kevin Durant in OKC and with him as a player and shooter and everything. I’m more of a Kobe fan than lebron if you are tryna insinuate me for being a lebron fan (idk if you are but just saying). But of course you will never understand the hate bro, because it only made ur team better. Which is perfectly understandable. But no it’s not just lebron fans, it’s a good amount of this sub. It’s a good amount of basketball fans in general. What has happened is the balance in basketball before that trade made it so the warriors were beatable. Now I wish on any team to beat them just for the sake of seeing if they can lose a series. But it hasn’t happened. Tell me that the finals these past two years were actually fun to watch from a non-warrior fan perspective. I’ll tell you, it wasn’t. At least the rockets put up a good fight this year but I think that might be the closest they ever get (id love for them to prove me wrong). All in all, the NBA got slightly less fun to watch for everyone else.  "
"Kevin Durant.  Especially when GSW unleashes their unstoppable strategy of joining hands and forming a four-man ring around a shooter. KD can be the shooter in the middle, but he can also be an invaluable ring man. This is somewhat true of Klay as well, but he doesn't have the same snaky length as Durant."
"I entirely agree that the Pelicans series was an awful judge of both CJ/Dame's 3pt shooting ability given how they were able to D them up....but I still think Kevin Durant is the better 3pt shooter at this point.  Despite some of Dame's ridiculous clutch shots I'd still want KD taking the last shot.  I mean KD shot about 42% on 6 attempts a game during the regular season.  Dame about 37% on 8.5 attempts a game.  you know what though, as I type this out you can easily attribute that to Portland's lack of other 3pt threats and the open looks KD gets being on the Warriors....but still.  I still think KD is the better 3pt shooter (IMO)."
Kevin Durant is actually a snake in real life
"Or with just one word: ""Kevin Durant did not score less than 20 points in ~~every~~ any game this post season."""
"Lol. He didn't start it.   Kaep was kneeling a full ***year*** before Trump entered the picture with his SOB comment in September 2017.  The Warriors had already snubbed the 2017 White House visit 3 months before in a widely reported team meeting, and were regularly commenting in the media about how they wouldn't go.  https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/14/stephen-curry-says-he-wouldnt-visit-white-house-if-invited/  https://www.sbnation.com/2017/9/22/16352408/stephen-curry-white-house-visit-warriors-donald-trump-kevin-durant  https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogergroves/2017/06/13/if-golden-state-warriors-decline-to-visit-the-trump-white-house-are-there-consequences/  These are demonstrable facts. Not sure where you're getting your information from.  You can think it was petty of Trump to rescind the invite (and it TOTALLY was) but he certainly didn't start it."
Kevin Durant is so low-t he doesn't own his own place and still has to rent. 
Phrasing of this really bothers me.  Should be Kevin Durant scored 20 or more every playoff game this season.
TIL Steph Curry is older than Kevin Durant. 
"""Kevin Durant scored 20 or more points in every game this post season.""  Why people gotta make this harder than it needs to be"
this just makes me think: we have to listen to guys like Kevin Durant saying stupid shit to the media for the next 50 years 
"He went deep with that OKC team every year they were a contender, which was a lot (4 WCF appearances). He also led the playoffs in ppg 4 times with the Thunder.  Kevin Durant has lost once in the first round in his career and averaged 2 series wins per playoffs in OKC. Take him off the team and they can't even get past the first round."
Kevin Durant is either Salacious B. Crumb or the Dianoga snake thing in the garbage compactor
Kevin Durant as The Sarlacc.
Same with Kevin Garnett or pre ring Durant those guys just know how to win 
Why do people feel the need to say Kevin Durant scores 20 pts all the time?
he had 5 double digit scoring games in his last 10 games and he was only playing ~16 mins a game. if you watched any one of those games you’d know he can handle and finish. he’s got size and length and he shot 65%+ at the rim.  i didn’t say he was scoring like Kevin Durant. i said he’d score 13ppg on 28mins. do you have anything substantive to add to the thread or are you just gonna nitpick a word?
"I just think it would be really awesome if everyone was just dead wrong about them. Like they harvest the souls of nuns and sacrifice goats to demons and make fun of Kevin Durant behind his back on speaker phone with Obama. And everyone on Twitter is appalled and I'll be the one guy like ""I fucking knew it!"" But no one else even care :( Drake will say he knew it and get 14k rts. That's why I fucking hate him. "
Every time I see something positive written about Kevin Durant online I just assume it was written by Kevin Durant.

"Yeah, but you don’t really need him for offense, you just need someone to defend the Kevin Durant, Jimmy Butler and LeBron James types. "
"There was a podcast with Klosterman at the beginning of July. Klosterman was bugging Bill about how he has a special friendship with Kevin Durant, and Bill said he does podcasts with lots of players, and that he was doing a podcast with Jimmy Butler next week. Now it's been a few weeks since then, with no further mention of the podcast."
The Rockets' backcourt went 44-5 in the regular season.  Then were 3-2 against the Warriors...WITHOUT having Kevin Durant.  They won 5/7 total matchups against the Warriors.
Klay Thompson would be the best catch and shoot player Lebron’s played with since Ray Allen. Draymond Green enhances the hell out of their defense. Kevin Durant is Kevin Durant. Jimmy Butler is in the top 4 of two way players in the league. Kyrie Irving and Lebron have won a ring as a duo. How likely is any given guy I’ve mentioned going to LA is debatable but next years free agency will be pretty nuts if I’m not a complete doofus and wrong about these guys contracts.

Kevin Durant is not a top 10 player.
"LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry"
"If I'm not mistaken these were held during the course of the 1977-78 season. About 30 players took part, and Paul Westphal was declared the winner, beating Rick Barry in the Final. The league tried a reboot of it earlier this decade and Kevin Durant won both."

" give credit to Kevin Durant and the Warriors, who had to cheat to achieve their back-to-back.    I know this is a joke but still gets me haha"
"The Warriors needed Kevin Durant to translate their regular season dominance into the postseason. Before him their offense would go through long stretches of futility because of their lack of isolation scoring outside of Curry, who can be limited against tight coverage and is prone to being worn down physically. They went six against injured Memphis/Cleveland in 2015, down 3-1 and blew a 3-1 lead in 2016. Did not look like a 73-9 team in the playoffs where it really matters.  He is not a luxury, he’s a essential for the versatility of their offense and helps cushion the blow of their bench deteriorating post 2016 (almost all of those players are out of the nba currently)"
Kevin Durant is currently the best player in the NBA. It would just be more clear and undeniable with no lebron. As it stands you can make compelling arguments for both guys. So the only change would be there is no argument to be had about who is the best.

"Think about it tho.. if you’re genetically gifted/talented from the start along with a great, intelligent work ethic and passion for the game.  That athlete would have breezed thru early competition and not even think about PEDs.  Where as the middle tier athlete trying to make some money and is stuck finding a spot in the roster-he’s most likely going to be most desperate to abuse whatever any way he can since he thinks it’s his answer.  “Oh they must use, so I have to too!”   Then they screw themselves over by throwing their hormones out of wack and I believe that will not contribute to longevity.  I also believe basketball is too much of a long endurance(82+game season) skill sport for PEDs to be rampant.   PEDs shine more in sports that require one or two good skills and the rest is based on how you perform (sprinting, jumping, throwing etc) A geared up athlete might run faster and can lift more, but he will never beat Kevin Durant in a game.   "
"&gt; CJ McCollum is just upset because he stands no chance against Kevin Durant.  Hell lets be real, they didn't even stand a chance against the Pelicans lmao. "
/u/toothbud is just memeing.   https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2018/07/25/kevin-durant-cj-mccollum-demarcus-cousins-podcast-comments/
It's not disgusting you fool. Kevin Durant did what he wanted to do and I respect it. He's a two time Finals MVP in the two years he joined while Boogie is looking to prove the doubters wrong.  CJ McCollum is just upset because he stands no chance against Kevin Durant. He wouldn’t even be starting on the Warriors.
ESPN: CJ McCollum directly calls out Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins as “disgusting.”
melo is cool. Short and sweet. Kd is lengthy and slim. 🐍  But I agree there is some hypocrisy I just don't why. I really detest kevin durant.
"To think that Duke has this beast-of-a-man who can dunk from the line and is literally a freak of nature, and what some scouts are calling the next Kevin Durant.   Oh and they have R.J. Barrett too"
"I can see the future... after Durant won his 12th ring, the top posts on r/nba would be:  1. Where does Kevin Durant ranks all time now? Ahead of Michael Jordan?  2. Don't forget the Blazers missed out on both Kevin Durant and Michael Jordan  Or maybe r/nba shuts down, or reddit shuts down, but you get the point."
Kevin Durant and Michael Jordan are two of the best to play the game
Fun Fact : The Blazers missed on Kevin Durant and Michael Jordan
Fun Fact : Greg Oden was drafted over Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is better than LeBron James
"Funny you're accusing me of false statements. Chris Bosh's quote was about adjusting from a 1st option to a 3rd option. Getting less touches and stuff. Here's the quote:  &gt;""Even if I was in [Love's] corner and I was able to tell him what to expect and what to do, it still doesn't make any difference,"" Bosh said. ""You still have to go through things, you still have to figure out things on your own. It's extremely difficult and extremely frustrating. He's going to have to deal with that.""  &gt;Bosh called it a ""psychological battle"" to adjust to a new role where your offensive touches are reduced, and said it's something that was hard on him all the way through last season.   https://www.si.com/nba/2014/10/09/kevin-love-cleveland-cavaliers-chris-bosh-lebron-james  That's not exclusive to Lebron James. That's not 'lebron's flaw'. That's just a new narrative.  Scottie Pippen's numbers went up when Jordan retired in 94. Was this 'Michael Jordan's flaw'? Harrison Barnes numbers went up from 11 to 19 when he left GSW. Is this 'Steph Curry's flaw'? You know what, it is! Steph monopolized the ball. He took shots away from Harrison. Took all the credit for winning, while Harrison was blamed for their 2016 loss. Steph is such a ballhog! Very frustrating to play with him.  lol. These standards are only applied to Lebron no one else. They are not 'Lebron's flaws' and this is not a flaw for him. Kyrie Irving's numbers went down when he went to Boston. Wade and Bosh faded into nothing without Lebron. Mo Williams and every other former Lebron teammate as well. The Warriors record got worse when they added Durant. If Lebron joined the Warriors and their record got worse fools like you and talking heads on tv would say it's the Lebron effect. It's absolute nonsense and just a twisted way of finding a reason to critique Lebron.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/loveke01.html  Kevin Love 3PA last year in Minnesota: 6.6  Kevin Love 3PA 1st year in Cleveland: 5.2  Kevin Love 3PA 2nd year in Cleveland: 5.7  Kevin Love 3PA 3rd year in Cleveland: 6.5   Kevin Love 3PA 4th year in Cleveland: 5.6  LEBRON TURNED LOVE INTO A 3 POINT SHOOTER. HE USED TO BE SHAQ IN THE PAINT BEFORE LEBUM!  "
"I apologize, usually people who smash a bunch of numbers into their keyboard for a username are either on burner accounts where they can be ""real"" (see Kevin Durant) or an old person. You might still fit into one of those camps.  So you're equating shit hole with poor? How does that work, booster seat? See that's the proper usage of booster seat, you'll get it eventually.  A Shit hole in the United States is a place with a bunch of garbage, fair weather, obnoxious people, it smells like shit (hence the shit part of shit hole), there's relatively nothing to do, and nearly everyone's obese. San Antonio qualifies as well. Philly is close but there is at least stuff to do there.  If you're talking about poorest cities we can get into a whole other discussion about what size population qualifies a city, pull up some census data, survey 1 in 10 people. We can make an afternoon of that.  If you're going to put your foot down saying ""CLEVELANDS NOT A SHIT HOLE!!!"" At least be intelligent and have some coherent reason why you think that. Not just ""Hey Man I have been to the Bible Belt, a random dirt patch somewhere else, a United States colony, and flew into LA once, SO I KNOW STUFF!""  Classic dumb-ass laker fan being all argumentative for no reason."

Allan Crabbe seems to turn into fucking Kevin Durant against us
"I'd take Western Conference. The reason?  3 pointers.  PG: Chris Paul SG: Stephen Curry SF: Kevin Durant PF: Dirk Nowitzki C: Anthony Davis  Sub: Ray Allen, James Harden, Karl Malone, Yao Ming, Hakeen Olajuwon, Tim Duncan  These players could drive, and spread the perimeter. From 1-5 they all could shoot 3s. Durant and Davis have the athleticism, and the reach to rebound and also shoot (Davis got the 3pts down) while Nowitzki have the finesse to shoot. Paul and Curry could dribble their way and step back for the 3s as usual.   Subs would have the reigning 3pt made of all time in Jesus Shuttlesworth and 3pts step-back iso king of James Harden. Yao could also shoot back in the days (see his Olympics highlights) and Olajuwon, Malone and Duncan sub the center to play the low-post.   This is just my opinion, how do you guys think about it? Cause from my observation, 3pts have changed the way the game evolved drastically. Especially after the Warriors won their 1st title. 3pt dagger have been the most crucial moment in a lot of NBA games. "

"definitely top 10 already  if he played in the 50s-90s he'd win the MVP every year easily  for instance, theres no chance id take bill russell over kevin durant if i were drafting"
"no, the warriors are already clearly the best NBA team that has ever existed. this was true before they even got kevin durant"

"In the regular season he shot 52/42/89 while being 6th in scoring at 26.4ppg, good for a 0.64 TS% where he is 10th. He was also top 5 in blocks per game. He's 6th in PER and 9th in Win Shares. I think at worst you could say he was in the 5-10 range last year for regular season performance.  Please don't make me defend Kevin Durant any further. It's physically painful."
Kevin Durant/ Steph curry and Lebron James are **way** better than Russ
"Yeah it's not a mistake that Boston ended up with this core of players at all:  &amp;nbsp;  When we look at players Danny has shown interest in:  **PG:** Chris Paul, young floor general PG and one widely regarded as one of the best at his position. In one instance offered Pierce in a trade for CP3, in another he offered Rondo.  **G/F:** Jimmy Butler/Justise Winslow,  a hyper-athletic two-way G/F. Supposedly put together a king's ransom of picks for Jimmy and/or the right to draft Winslow  **F:** Kevin Durant/Paul George, a long versatile ISO scorer. The Celtics tanked in 2007 for KD and then built their cap situation around having max space available for his free agency. Were then linked in multiple trades for Paul George.  **F/C:** Tim Duncan. The Celtics tanked for the Big Fundamental (although before Ainge's time), Ainge would then later say he would rather Duncan over Kobe.   &amp;nbsp;  When we look at the players Danny ended up getting:  **PG:** Kyrie Irving,  a young PG widely regarded as one of the best at his position. Now in a position to operate as the floor general tying everything together.   **G/F:** Jaylen Brown, a hyper-athletic two-way G/F.  **F:** Jayson Tatum, a long versatile ISO scorer.   **F/C:** Al Horford, the closest thing we have to a Tim Duncan-lite.  "
HOW MUCH HELP DOES KEVIN DURANT NEED???
2014-15. Draymond was not an all star. Kevin Durant was not on the team. The only other option on that team who can create their own offense is Harrison Barnes.  Klay Thompson in 2014-15 21.7/2.9/3.2  Jrue Holiday this year 19/6/4.5 while playing better defense.  They still had a top 5 offense.
Klay and Draymond will be less useful on offense without Curry. The offense will stagnate because you're replacing a good passer with a mediocre (at best) passer.  The Warriors starting lineup will have 2 above average shooters if you start Iggy/Klay/Durant/Draymond/AD. That lineup has one player (Kevin Durant) who can beat people off the dribble consistently.  If you start Quinn Cook that is a guaranteed bucket every possession for the Rockets.

"TRUE STORY  I just saw Kevin Durant on Saturday at a conference. I went with a few of my friends to a conference in SanFran this last weekend and one of the surprise speakers was Kevin Durant. I had no idea he was going to be there.  Anyways it was like a QandA where interviewer would ask him questions and he would answer. The theme was about emotional stability and he talked about how he isn’t the most emotionally stable guy but he tries. He said he tweets at kids, for example.  Also Joakim Noah was there."

If Kevin durant hasn’t ruined the nba this would be very possible lol
"A lot of subjective assessments laced in this discussion. It's worked pretty well thus far. To me, when you look at what Hinkie was trying to do and the implication of things he said that the goal was to be a contender. They aren't quite there yet, but this could be the year. I just flatly disagree that a team had no ""realistic"" path to contention when you see franchises like Toronto that are as close or closer to contending and you see the occasional Dallas Mavericks and Detroit Pistons come out of nowhere and shock the world for titles. Or even a team like the Rockets who have never tanked and just accumulated assets in a non conventional way that Hinkie would approve of. If Philly had a win now system in place they could have potentially wooed a James Harden, Paul George, Kevin Durant Kevin Love type free agent or two. Maybe a disgruntled trade like Kyrie. We can't say contention is unrealistic without tanking when none of the other current contenders have even tanked recently, can we??? "
"Kevin Durant gets injured - Kevon Looney comes in and balls tf out, with Steph Curry losing out on FMVP for the 4th time. "
2 of the 4 best players in the world...  plus Kevin Durant.  
"Yes, Kobe Bryant is arguably the most overrated basketball player in history. He is often ranked among the Top-Ten players of all time, which I think this is absurd. The following are the reasons I consider Kobe overrated: Kobe is NOT an All-Time Great Scorer. One of the most prevalent arguments as to why Kobe is a all-time great, is his supposedly legendary scoring ability, which is often compared to all-time great, Michael Jordan. However, lets take a closer look at this claim and show why it is flawed: Kobe has only 2 Scoring Titles. Kobe has only lead the league in points per game 2 times, in 19-year career. In comparison: Michael Jordan has done so 10 times. Wilt Chaimberlain has done so 7 times. Kevin Durant and Allen Iverson have done so 4 times. (KD has been in the NBA, less than half the time Kobe had, and has twice the number of scoring titles) Kobe has a Career Points-Per-Game Average of 25. Kobe averaged 25 PPG, over his career. This is a fantastic average, however, it does not rank among the greatest career averages. Kobe’s PPG average does NOT rank among the Top 10. LeBron’s career average is 27.2 PPG, while Kobe’s career average in the same span was 24.8. However, Kobe is generally considered a greater scorer. Allen Iverson, who is generally not considered among the greatest NBA players ever, had a career average of 26.7 PPG, also greater than that of Kobe. Kobe has had the Worst Chokes in the NBA Finals. Kobe is often ranked among the most clutch players in NBA history. This is not backed by substance, and this is evidenced in some of his NBA Finals performances over the years. 2004 NBA Finals: Game 3 vs Detroit Pistons In Game 3 of the 2004 NBA Finals, against the Detroit Pistons, with the series tied at 1–1, Kobe had arguably the worst choke of any superstar in Finals history, which led to a loss by 20 points. Kobe finished the game with just 11 Points on a terrible 30% shooting, with 3 Rebounds, 5 Assists and 4 Turnovers. 2008 NBA Finals: Game 6 vs Boston Celtics Facing elimination, with his team down 3–2 in the series, with a chance to force a Game 7 in Staples Center, Kobe, the reigning MVP of the league, choked again in one of the biggest games of his career, which led to the Lakers losing the Championship. Kobe finished the game with 22 Points on a dismal 32% shooting, with just 3 Rebounds and a pathetic 1 Assist with 4 Turnovers. 2010 NBA Finals: Game 7 vs Boston Celtics With a brilliant chance at redemption, against a Boston Celtics team that defeated his Lakers two years ago, Kobe had a chance to cement his legacy as a clutch performer on the biggest stage of all: Game 7 of the NBA Finals, at home. Yet, he choked again. Kobe finished the game with 23 Points, of which he scored 11 from the free-throw line, thanks to receiving a ridiculous 15 free-throw attempts (ahem Referees? ahem). He scored 12 Points from the field on a awful 25% shooting, with just 1 Assist and 4 Turnovers, but did have a stellar 15 Rebounds. But thanks to the Referees (The Lakers got 20 more free-throws than the Celtics), the Lakers happened to win this game and Kobe won his 5th Ring. Compare these chokes with LeBron’s Finals: Game 4 performance against the Mavericks, which sparked conversation about LeBron being a Choke-Artist. LeBron put up a measly 8 Points on 27% shooting, but had 9 Rebounds and 7 Assists, therefore having about similar production as Kobe’s in the fore-mentioned games. Kobe has only ONE Regular Season MVP (Which he didn’t really deserve). Kobe Bryant has only one regular season MVP , which is put 12 players who have more MVPs than him. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has done so 6 times. Michael Jordan has done so 5 times. Larry Bird and Magic Johnson have done so 3 times. Tim Duncan, Steve Nash and Stephen Curry have done so 2 times. Kobe Bryant did win the 2007–2008 season, but did not deserve it. Let us take a look at Kobe’s stats, compared to other players’ performances. Kobe Bryant: 28.2 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1.8 SPG, 0.5 BPG, 46% FG, 36% 3P, with a record 57–25. Chris Paul: 21.1 PPG, 4.0 RPG, 11.6 APG, 2.7 SPG, 0.1 BPG, 49% FG, 37%3P, with a record 56–26. LeBron James: 30.0 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 7.2 APG, 1.8 SPG, 1.1 BPG, 48% FG, 32% 3P, with the record 45–37. Amar’e Stoudemire: 25.2 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 1.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 2.1 BPG, 59% FG, 16% 3P, with the record 55–27. Kobe is an Extremely Inefficient player. Kobe Bryant has an Career Field Goal Percentage of 44.7%. Kobe Bryant, despite being a versatile scorer, has thelowest field goal percentageamong the Top 15 All-Time Career Scorers. Kobe Bryant has scored a total 33,643 Points, off 26,200 Shots. In Comparison, Karl Malone has scored a total of 36,928 Points, off 26,210 Shots. Which means, Karl Malone has taken 10 more shots than Kobe Bryant, but has scored 3,285 more points. Kobe has the Most Career Field Goals Missed. Kobe has missed 14,481 Shots in his career, which happens to be 1,064 more than the next player, John Havlicek. Kobe Bryant hold the record with the Most Missed Shotsin a single game with 30 while shooting just 36% against the Boston Celtics in 2002. In the Top 100 for most field goals missed in a game, Kobe hold 25 of those spots, making for a quarter of the total. Kobe Bryant is NOT a clutch player. Kobe does have some great moments in the clutch, but individual moments do not mean he is a great clutch performer. Kobe Bryant missed the last 15 straight game-tying/go-ahead FG in final 5 seconds of 4th quarter/OT of his career, and his last game-winner was in March 2012. Kobe Bryant has a Field-Goal Percentage of 29.1%, over his career, on game-tying or go ahead shots in the last 24 seconds of a game, over his career, only making 48 out of 164 attempts Kobe Bryant has received multiple Undeserved All-Star Selections. Kobe Bryant has been selected to the All-Star Game in the years 2014 and 2016, for which he was undeserving. He received these on the basis of legacy, rather than on performance. His stats for these seasons were: In 2014, Kobe Bryant played a total of 6 games, where he averaged just 13.8 PPG, 4.3 RPG and 6.3 APG. In 2016, Kobe averaged 17.6 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 2.8 APG. Kobe has been gifted Multiple Championships by Referees. Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, whether knowingly or unknowingly, have been subject to some of the most blatantly rigged NBA Playoff games, in history. 2002 Western Conference Finals In Game 6, of a tight western conference finals against the Sacramento Kings, where the reigning champion Lakers were facing elimination, the Lakers received a ridiculous27 Free-Throws, in the fourth quarter, compared to the Kings’ 9. Watch the video below to see for yourself: 2010 NBA Finals In Game 7 of the NBA finals against the Boston Celtics, Kobe shot a disgusting 6 of 24 from the field. However, thanks to the 15 Free-Throwshanded to him by the referees, compared to the whole Boston Celtics team got 17 Free-Throws, Kobe won his 5th Ring. Watch the following video to see yourself: Now I am not saying Kobe is not a legend, I am simply saying that he is given much more credit than some of his more deserving contemporaries. He deserves to be compared to players like John Stocktonand Reggie Miller who are fantastic players, but NOT All-Time Greats like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  Tough question because most basketball experts do not overrate him. Most place him somewhere in the top 10–15. That’s about right. But most young basketball fans do overrate him. Many put him in the top 5. Those that do usually do not have strong knowledge of basketball history; usually overrate individual play; and usually overrate athleticism. Players that are definitely ahead of Kobe: Jordan, Magic Johnson, Jabbar, Russell, Chamberlain, Lebron James In my view, none of these are worth debating versus Kobe. Players that are probably ahead of Kobe: Duncan, O’Neal, Bird, Olajuwon, Robertson Players that are close and/or may finish their careers as close: West, Durant, Curry, Moses Malone So, in my view, Kobe is 12th at highest. Or somewhere in the 10–14 range. That’s still great. So what I say next does not diminish him but only puts him in context versus the other great players. Kobe Bryant is definitely the most selfish and least likable teammate of anyone on the list. (Chamberlain is close on the selfish front. Robertson is close on the least likable front). When I engage in these discussions with my fellow GMs, we set up the ground rule as who would I want on my team for 5 years. This is an important distinction because character/personality become increasingly important over time. Indeed, Kobe would likely be in the top ten if this was a single game or single series. Shaq is another guy that loses ground in this area. At his peak, he was crazy dominant but his laziness and selfishness are draining after a period of time. As a contrast, Duncan and Magic are rated higher than their athleticism might indicate because they are the ultimate team guys. But Kobe’s character deflates his teammates, unlike the majority of those ahead of him who elevate their teammates. Over time, team chemistry decreases. And, of course, losses or implosion occur. Is Kobe overrated by young NBA fans, yes. "
"Kevin Durant. You can easily argue that in clutch moments two years in a row KD clearly outplayed LeBron. In the most recent Finals KD pretty much won a game on his own.   For those that will take ""He joined the Warriors angle."" I counter with LeBron joined the Heat. He joined that team with the same intentions as KD. Win Rings. I also don't value LeBron as high as most people simply because he's never ""dominated the league"" Every other goat candidate has. "

"Of course, if Ingram ended up like that the Lakers should be thankful I feel. Problem is Ingram ""stans"" seem to think it's a lock that he'll become Kevin Durant in Tayshaun Prince's body.  I feel uncomfortable about mentioning Tayshaun Prince's body thrice now. "
Kevin Durant is my team. 
"fun fact, Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant are both on a 19 win streak vs the sixers"
"**Speaking about the West,**  Lebron is locked in for a spot  Boogie is clearly out  **Questionable/Competitive for spots:**  Draymond green  Paul George  Lamarcus Aldridge  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Karl-Anthony Towns  **Some new guys who may make the cut:**  Donovan Mitchell  Chris Paul  Nikola Jokic  DeMar DeToronto  **Fairly safe list:**  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Lebron James  Klay Thompson  **Definitely not going to make the cut:**  Melo  A lot of these spots depend on team standing as well as individual numbers. The MVP players(James, Curry, Durant, Westbrook, Harden) can coast in based on reputation even if they are having a rough season."
"Ok, so a few things.   First this list did not include Cousins, Gobert, Aldridge, and Davis for various reasons. If they were included he would drop even more in all of these rankings.   Second, these rankings are fairly consistent, that means they mostly agree with each other. If they mostly agree with each other, we can assume they are fairly accurate.  Third, there is a difference between comparing stats across eras and comparing stats over a single season. Different eras come with different rules, and different rules can affect stats.  Fourth, comparing full careers can result in funny business as a player who play more non-prime years can hurt their averages and advance stats.  Fifth, Charles Barkley was a top player all-time. I imagine most lists have him as a top 15 to 25 player all-time. Is it really that absurd that a player that good would have advance stats that say he is a top-5 player all time? The difference between the GOAT and the 25th best player all-time is very very small. We are talking about the difference between Lebron James and Kevin Durant here. That is a difference so small it is almost irrelevant."
"""Gather around kids and let me tell you the story of how we could have had a dynasty if we drafted Michael Jordan or Kevin Durant instead of 2 tall centers who ended up becoming the greatest draft busts in basketball history."""
So Kevin Durant joining a good team as a free agent is against the spirit of competition but bribing a superstar not to play so other teams can win is totally cool. Love /nba logic.
The GM has something to be proud of. Kevin Durant doesn’t.
"Splash bros is a pretty dope name. Steph ""Lightskin"" Curry. Klay ""The Toaster"" Thompson. Draymond ""Nutcracker"" Green. Kevin ""The Snake"" Durant. That whole team has some iconic names lol."
"Kevin ""Slim Reaper"" Durant except he didn't want the nickname so fuck him "
Lmao forgot about [when he laughed and shook his head at KD.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2668220-demarcus-cousins-shakes-head-laughs-at-kevin-durant-taking-questions-as-warrior)   Fwiw idk if he was legit serious about it all tho lol they were pretty good friends and fresh from the olympics together 
His impact is on the level of Kevin Durant by most metrics. So yes top 3 seems pretty reasonable. The upper echelon tends to be reserved for extraordinary two way players and Kawhi is that
"Lmfao at the cop-out ""*offensive"" foot note buried at the end to try and excuse this nonsense baiting shitpost. No one cares how high Harden's TS% is inflated due to the ridiculous amount of times the refs send him to the line when his actual FG% plummets to 41% and his 3pt shooting below 30 freakin % in the playoffs when it actually matters.  Wilt Chamberlain averaged no less than 30 PPG and up to 50 PPG on at least 50% shooting from the field from 1959 all the way until 1966. Karl Malone averaged 27 and 10 on over 50% shooting from 1987 to 1998. Kevin Durant has never averaged LESS than 50% shooting from the field, 37% from 3, and 25 ppg since 2012 and shows no signs of slowing down. Those are just a few examples, I could list other real offensive greats like LBJ and Kobe to hammer the point home, but anyone not being disingenuous should get it by now.   Harden is a GOOD, certainly nowhere near all-time great, regular season offensive player due to his playmaking and absurd amount of FTA per game (he's league the lead for the past half decade basically and already has more seasons with 10+ FTA than Kobe did in his entire career) who nosedives in efficiency, consistency, and all-around play come postseason time. Calling him the 2nd best offensive player ever based off of his past handful of seasons isn't unpopular; it's straight up idiocy.  "
30 straight championships    PG: Steph Curry   SG: Klay Thompson   SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Draymond Green  C: Demarcus Cousins
\- Luka Doncic will disappoint and be an impoverished man's Manu Ginobli at best.     \- The Nets will make the playoffs.     \- Dennis Smith Jr. won't improve at a satisfactory rate this year.     \- Lonzo Ball will average more assists than Lebron.     \- Jaren Jackson will have a rough season.     \- Houston Rockets get knocked out in the 1st round.     \- Kevin Durant has a down year from 3 point range.   
No it's Kevin Durant. I could be wrong. But I'm never wrong. 
No it’s probably just some guy who made is account name Kevin Durant 
This kid looks like a myles turner kevin durant love child. 
"Patrick Patterson isn’t reliable dude. Who is he making pay?   Golden State was among league best in three point and mid range conversion rate. Do not compare your offense to them. They have Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. You have Westbrook and George.  Having bad spacing was alright when you had one of the all time great scorers in Durant, but PG  isn’t nearly as consistent as he was. You can certainly win without it, but your ceiling is capped with only a few reliable shooters."
I meant that they've always been short of 1 two way wing. With Kevin Durant or PG13.
Golden State Warriors   Best : Kevin Durant (Idk if cousins will return 100%)  Worst : Iggy
"Tell that to the thunder. They've always been noticably worse without him, even if he can't score for shit.   Not even saying he's a stud. But he's one of the like 3 people in the league who can credibly defend Kevin Durant or LeBron, which is a pretty big fucking deal. "
Yeah Russ should be Red with Haste. Maybe we can add white for seemingly flying for dunks.   Kevin Durant is Green... for snake. Sub type hydra. Lol. Also has the ability Reach. Make him unblockable.   Steph is probably Blue because he is like a Wizard. Flying ability for his sky fucking.   LeBron should probably have Trample or Indestructible. So like Red Green or Red Black.    
"Well everyone has a bias against Kevin Durant since he signed with GSW, that pretty much explains it."

"In 2016, a few days after the Warriors signed Kevin Durant, I was driving down the street in Oakland and saw this dude walking kinda in the middle of the street instead of the sidewalk. As I got closer, I first noticed he was wearing some fresh apparel and he seemed to be pretty tall. I kept getting closer as he was on the street I was drving on and I realized, shit this mothafucka is hella tall. Once I was a few feet away I realized damn this is fucking KD in the middle of the street. I rolled down my pasenger window and yelled 'Hey KEVIN!' surprising the shit out of him and i swear to god he jumped higher than he ever did in a regulation basketball game. I asked if he was lost or needed help as he looked super confused. He said no thanks just looking for a place to eat, I wished him luck and drove on."
"The double standards are ridiculous. Apparently Kevin Durant is soft as baby shit for letting a ridiculous amount of hate get to him but if Devin Booker says ""lol theyre not that good as basketball"" everyone gets up in arms about not being mean."

"2 players.  I'm taking Kevin Durant and myself. I'm playing 0 minutes, but I'm on the roster.  I think we can win the title with KD, because not only do we get him, but the Warriors lose him.   So then I get to win a nba championship"

"Well he doesn't need to thank them or something, but don't make fun of people who aren't as physically gifted as you for being passionate about basketball and discussing the NBA.   It might look funny that fat dudes who can barely play are making fun of elite athletes like Kevin Durant and Devin Booker or that people who don't know what a pick and roll is are criticizing the coaching decisions of someone like Tyronn Lue. However, if you only let elite basketball players and genius basketball minds discuss the NBA then you can say good bye to your multi-million dollar income. "
Kevin durant.  He might have 10 years left so a lot can still happen
Rodney Hood and Kevin Durant
Are you Kevin Durant? 
"The eye test for fans is overrated because we aren’t as good at analyzing the game as we think we are. I think advanced analytics are the most reliable way to judge players, though they have outliers, it starts to become decently accurate when you incorporate multiple factors... The eye test shouldn’t be completely ignored but it’s not as important as many people claim it is in my opinion cause a lot of people like to act like their eye test is more reliable than every other factor when it clearly isn’t... The eye test may be better to see potential but not straight up production.   Edit: FWIW I made a stat combining multiple advanced stats together that had the most accurate looking league leaderboards and I think it came out pretty decently:  1. James Harden 11.12  2. Stephen Curry 9.69  3. LeBron James 9.61  4. Anthony Davis 9.11  5. Damian Lillard 8.68  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 8.15  7. Jimmy Butler 7.99  8. Chris Paul 7.73  9. Karl-Anthony Towns 7.53  10. Kevin Durant 7.02  11. Nikola Jokić 6.93  12. Kyrie Irving 6.75  13. Russell Westbrook 6.47  14. LaMarcus Aldridge 6.41  15. Victor Oladipo 5.65  16. Kyle Lowry 5.14  17. Clint Capela 4.96  18. Kemba Walker 4.87  19. Kevin Love 4.73  20. Rudy Gobert 4.68  It’s definitely not perfect but I think it has a better leaderboard than any singular advanced stat does... I’m not sure what I could do to improve it but it seems to favor low usage centers too much and hurts centers with high turnover rates and not-elite efficiency."

"Exactly. People can hate every day on Kevin Durant, Melo, Westbrook, Harden, etc., and expect all of them to sit silently, have thick skins, and take the online abuse.  But someone throws the shit back and people here lose their fucking minds.  The average user here must be more insecure than a thousand Shaqs and KDs combined if they’re really butthurt about this."
Steph averaged 27/8/9.5 on 44% shooting. Why you gotta lie and say a triple double?   Kevin Durant averaged 35/8/5 on 55% and 47% 3point percentage.   Where’s this narrative that Steph was better in this finals series coming from? 
The King of the NBA is in Oakland and his name is Kevin Durant. Also known as the dude who LeBron is too cowardly to guard in important games. 
Kevin Durant would join the Warriors in Summer 2016...then it happened o__O;
kevin durant is a better writer.
"Muggsy Bogues was 5-3 and Kevin Durant is a lot more skilled than him. Not saying you’re necessarily wrong in today’s day and age, but food for thought. "
Kevin Durant would still bust up this league if he was only three feet you losers. Have fun trying to cut it in the NBA you geeks!
"i find tony allen fun to watch. loved when he basically shut down kevin durant that playoffs despite being 6 inches shorter than him.  offensively we still don't know what frank can be yet. he should be better than those 2 purely from passing, dribbling standpoint even if he can never shoot."
"Well 1) those are almost his exact numbers in the 2015 Finals. 2) Kevin Durant is the one that joined Curry's team because he'd won a ship by himself, not the other way around. 3) the only ""bad"" Finals he ever had was him coming off of an MCL sprain and he was still fine (23/5/4 on 58% TS%). 4) In this scenario he is playing with Lebron James who is way better than KD so all of this is moot. "

Gordon Hayward for 21 year old Kevin Durant
"I don’t see how it’s a knock against Kawhi’s offense if he doesn’t have a bunch of 40 and 50 point games. If you can score 25 efficiently  and win with stifling defense, there’s no need for 50. Kevin Durant and Stephen have scored 40+ less than 5% of the time their entire careers, you can’t count on that offense coming every night, but you can get efficient smart offense that wins games"
I don't think people credit his defense enough. He's so far ahead of the next best option for defending Lebron James and Kevin Durant. You can get scoring and playmaking elsewhere. You can't replace having a Hall of Fame level defender at the right position for dealing with the other best players in the league.
Kevin Durant will be annoying still 
"Of course they're more efficient, there's been a huge, highly publicized shift in basketball strategy brought on by analytics. It'd be crazy if they weren't, especially since they play on a stacked team.  And due to many fortunate circumstances (the most crucial of which was a salary cap hike), the Warriors got to sign Kevin Durant, inflating ring totals. It'd be like the Bulls signing Hakeem in 1991.   Sure, there's no such thing as illegal defense now. But I don't see any reason to think Jordan's impact would be diminished. It's more of a guard's league than ever. Harden and Westbrook average 30 a game. The lane is more open than ever nowadays, sometimes there's no rim protector whatsoever because the center is guarding a guy at the 3pt line. MJ would thrive today as he did back then, and maybe even more so."
"Purely based on on-court impact? Off the top of my head I'd say that: MJ, LBJ, Kareem, Wilt, Hakeem, Shaq, Bill Russell, Magic, Kobe, and Duncan all had greater on-court impact on games than Stephen Curry or Kevin Durant."
"Are you just making jokes at this point? Curry has a small argument for being above KD, but to even suggest Draymond is better than Kevin Durant is among the most outrageous takes I've ever read on this sub. "
"Iggy can't give credit where credit is due. Never forget.   Also, he's in love with Kevin Durant."
I mean....Kevin Durant is arguably the best scorer of all time or at least tied with Kobe  So...
Kevin Durant in Allen Field House.  
"But he didn’t. Kevin Durant only averaged 30+ once. Kareem averaged 35 twice in two separate playoff runs, and 32 in two other ones. "
I hear this Kevin Durant guy plays like a big guard or somethin
"Guards: DJ Augustin/Cory Joseph/Avery Bradley/Isaiah Taylor  Wings/Stretch: Kevin Durant/Myles Turner/PJ Tucker  Bigs: Lamarcus Aldridge/Tristan Thompson/Jarrett Allen/Mo Bamba  Durant, Bradley, LMA is a solid 3some and combined with role guys and young guys this team could be 2nd or 3rd in the East and push for a finals spot"

"The TIL threads in 10 years are going to be crazy...   “The 2017-2018 Warriors not only had Kevin Durant, they also had two of the best shooters of all time...”"
"My Favorites:   **PG:** Steph Curry, Loved him since Davidson. Would have drafted him #1 ( fight me)   **SG:** Dwayne Wade, Can’t forget that first finals run. Magical.  **SF:** Kevin Durant, Remember backpack KD hooping in the summer? Sold.  **PF:** Tim Duncan, Played the majority of time at C but who cares  **C:** Shaq, arguably could have been the greatest with work ethic.     My Best at Each Position:   **PG:** John Stockton, Definition of traditional Point God.   **SG:** Michael Jordan, GOAT(fight me)  **SF:** Larry Bird, Houdini on the court  **PF:** Tim Duncan, this man plays D&amp;D then schools the best of all time.  **C:** Kareem, still underrated. Like, seriously. "
Lmao Kevin Martin. Stop it. Not even a comparison. if PG drops that 25+ ppg on 60% Ts like he did vs the Jazz then the thunder would’ve won in five games. The only reason Durant struggled that series is because they doubled and trapped him all game. He had no other star to open the floor up for him.

I can't imagine how difficult it will be for the Warriors to adapt to a defensive scheme that involves allowing Kevin Durant to do anything he wants
"Yes, because Kevin Durant is famously the most liked player in the NBA."
"You've also got to take into account the era in which these accomplishments were achieved. There were only 8 teams in the NBA when Pettit played, so there's a smaller pool to choose from for All-NBA and MVP (54-65), and he played from the very first seasons which is when there wasn't good competition.   [These are his highlights from that 50 point game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQH6Z5oWugM)  You can't tell me that he's greater than Kevin Durant when he's going up against that level of competition. "
"Stats are from a simulated season in Basketball GM, where I went 68-14 and lost to the Mavs who had Kevin Durant in the finals. Swept everyone else."
"Yeah, it isn’t easy to defend them, but blueprint is out there.  If you have personnel to switch, you do it.  How did GS’s offense look in WCF with KD leading it?  Pretty bad, he got his, but offense had no flow.   Also, you want KD to go off.  If Steph goes off, you lose.  Best way to beat GS is to turn their offense into the Kevin Durant show."

"""LEAVE ME...I MEAN, KEVIN DURANT ALONE.""  - OP Probably "
Imagine replacing 2010 Kendrick Perkins with LeBron 😂 that'd be like replacing Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant.... 
I think Kevin Durant absolutely has a chance as being a top 10ish player based on talent and accomplishments when all is said and done. He is an extremely talented player
"There are many NBA players who donate millions to good causes.  KD donated $10,000,000   http://www.fox5dc.com/sports/kevin-durant-donating-10-million-to-prince-georges-county-students-education  I hardly heard a peep about this in the national sports media."
"&gt; Draymond is exhausting. His strained relationship with Steve Kerr once inspired a 4,000-word opus from ESPN in 2016. Earlier that year, his ""I am not a robot"" screaming match with Kerr drew the attention of local police in Oklahoma City. Over the past two regular seasons, he's alternated between ambling through games on extreme cruise control and cursing out Kevin Durant in front of 25 HD cameras. He was spectacular through most of the playoffs, but after the Finals, David West said the team spent most of the year dealing with internal tension that would have shocked outsiders. Who wants to guess whether Draymond made the problems better or worse?   &gt; **This isn’t meant as an attack on Draymond**  Sure fooled me.   "

"As someone who has long held Kevin Durant as the overall Superior player by a very small margin, I think that was a wonderful post.   I'm going to go over my own perspective  because I think it's a pretty interesting topics that I don't think garners enough  meticulous analysis I feel people cover in Broad strokes and don't get to the intricacies enough.   Not to say I'm going to do a great job lol.   The biggest differences on both sides are to me Durant Superior defense and shooting like you mentioned and LeBrons Superior physicality and dribbling and passing abilities.   To me, LeBron's greatest strength is handle and passing, his keen ability to set everything at the motion but at the same time he doesn't always play optimized because he relies upon himself to an absurdly high degree.   When LeBron is on your team he is the offense whereas if Kevin is on your team he is quite heavily featured but he is another Cog in the unit. Maybe the main cog, but he has deferred to curry and westbrook many times.  He will defer to third options at times also.  LeBron only really deferred to kyrie. Even wade bosh and love weren't able to make LeBron better off the ball, or allow the offense to feature them many times.  Not to say LeBron didn't play well off the ball on the heat but LeBron catching and shooting isn't really an incredible form of offense. Yeah he caught him cutting to the rumor if you pass it to him and he makes another Quick Pass what she does do that stuff that's awesome but he doesn't do enough of that kind of stuff.  I'm not going to say he was wrong to do it but that's kind of the point LeBron doesn't really make you better playing off of him to a huge degree. Also his off ball presence, while real, is of a far smaller magnitude of than that of what Durant does for his teammates.    When you factor in the point that Durant is the greatest scorer in the league while not overly featuring himself his efficiency does come more into clear focus when you understand that the fact that his system is awesome is helping him but he's also helping that system be properly lubricated and function very well.   Look at game 1 the Western Conference Finals the Rockets were able to coax Kevin into becoming a selfish player at that point even Steve Kerr and Disney showed the talk where Kerr relayed the message so Jackson had for Michael Jordan about believing your teammates.   The difference to me is that Durant usually remembers the value of his teammates LeBron thinks most of his teammates value come spoon-fed from him.   Durant is willing to be a member of the team and that's what he wants he probably wants to be the best member of the team but he doesn't care if it's unanimous LeBron wants to be the guy who setting everything in motion on his team.  Will get the Spurs and warriors those are teams playing at the highest level trying to make their teammates better at every opportunity.   Durant couldn't dribble and isolate the way LeBron does and take the ball all over the court.   That said Durant can post from anywhere and can shoot over you at any time he doesn't really need his dribble and he actually has a sick handle it just not up to the level of LeBrons.    All in all to sum of where I truly stand, I'm going to give some quick ratings of my top players in the league as though I'm nba 2k to put into perspective my rankings of top players.  I know this is kind of silly and doesn't provide that much context for anyone but I'm just saying I think the difference is pretty marginal and a lot of these players have their pros and cons against one another and at the end of the day I think the top players are really close but I personally view durant and then honestly personally even Kawhi Leonard as nbas top two players. I have LeBron tied at third with curry and Harden I would probably give LeBron the 3A ranking lol but I just think Kawhi and kd being more about the team and far superior defenders and shooters separate their play a notch from LeBrons.  I will concede at times I feel like he is the best player when I watch him go to work and be unstoppable getting to the rim but that's really not percentage-wise such a huge aspect of his game anymore he simply isn't Elite athletically on the level he used to be compared to other players.     I guess in a vacuum I kind of feel like LeBron and Kawhi are equal players but due to his ability to shoe I would rather have him on my team whereas I feel like Durant is more of an offensive weapon so I personally have him ranked at one undisputed.    Kevin Durant 98.    LeBron Steph Harden Kawhi 95.    AD Giannis 93.   Jimmy Butler Westbrook 91."
Man imagine if Kevin Fucking Durant was traded 
Kevin Durant with 208 burner accounts.
"LeBron James has played in more NBA Finals Games (49) yet has less championship rings (3) than Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden, and **Chris Paul** combined (41 games &amp; 5 rings)."
Steph Curry: 60% Kevin Durant: 49.4% Klay Thompson: 49.1%  It's not fair.
Jason Kidd defended Kevin Durant &amp; LeBron James for possessions at a time in back to back to series in 2011 at like 40 and didn’t get killed. I’ll go with Kidd 
He’s beaten lebron zero times when Kyrie and love are healthy and when Kevin Durant isn’t on his team
"It would be wild. But Doncic is the best rookie to come into the league since, I dunno, Blake Griffin and Kevin Durant? He has too much smarts on him and has good scorers around him to pass to. In fact, if at all there is one stat I might be overestimating, it is his ppg. As a 6'8"" point forward, I'm certain he can average 6/6."
"its not a matter of pride. its a matter of how goddamn frail he looks. of course a punch from an adult man is going to hurt, but i feel like it would hurt kevin durant more than the average nba player because hes so fucking skinny i look at him and im like damn what a skinny motherfucker"

"There's a difference between ""I wouldn't be surprised if he did"" and ""he's a lock."" Those are two very different things.  A lock means that, unless the guy becomes OJ Simpson, he could not score a single point for the rest of his career or do anything else and he'd be in the HOF. LeBron James is a lock. Kevin Durant is a lock.  Ilgauskas is nowhere close to a lock. The man hasn't played since the 2010/11 season and has not even sniffed the HOF."
Ginobili on Kevin durant comes into mind due to the sheer difference in size and athleticism

Durant has literally outplayed LeBron head to head, in the regular season, and in the postseason excluding stats vs sub 45 win teams, which LeBron got 1-2 free series a year against in the East to pad his stats while KD was facing legit contenders every round. Just look at 2014. KD faces the 50-32 Grizzlies and DPOY Gasol in the 1st round, who played at a 60 win pace when healthy, as they were in the playoffs, the 57-25 Clippers and CP3 in RD 2, and the 60-22 win Spurs and Duncan/Kawhi in the WCF who annihilated Miami in the Finals. Meanwhile LeBron faced the 43-39 Bobcats and 22 year old Kemba in round 1, the 43-39 Nets and 38 year old Paul Pierce in rd 2, and the Pacers team that collapsed down the stretch winning 10 of their last 26 games after the PG13-Hibbert drama. The same Pacers team that got taken to 7 by the 39 win Horford-less Hawks in round 1 and 42-40 Wizards in round 2. No wonder his WCF and Finals stats shit all over LeBron's finals stats going back to 2011. Oh and he has more MVP's, FMVP's, and titles over the past 5 years. And he's switched teams less times too"
"Probably because advanced metrics are largely a joke and are heavily skewed in favor of ball dominant players rather than efficient players.    i.e. can anyone explain to me how Jordan had equal if not better advanced stats in 1998 than Durant did in 2018?     **Context is irrelevant in terms of Durant's role being easier than Jordan's as that is void in the role of advanced metrics. They are simply measuring statistical impact of players relative to league average adjusted for pace. The argument isn't that Durant's season was more impressive, it's discussing how advanced stats could have possibly reached that conclusion when they're simply analyzing numbers in a vacuum.    Note: Advanced stats use pace adjusted numbers, so here are their stats adjusted to 100 possessions    |Rk|Player|Season|Age|FG|FGA|FG%|FT|FTA|FT%|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PTS| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kevin Durant|2017-18|29|13.1|25.3|.516|7.4|8.4|.889|0.6|9.0|9.6|7.6|1.0|2.5|4.3|37.1| |2|Michael Jordan*|1997-98|34|14.9|32.1|.465|9.6|12.2|.784|2.2|5.8|8.1|4.8|2.4|0.8|3.1|40.0|    |Rk|Player|Season|Age|G|MP|PER|TS%|WS|WS/48|OBPM|DBPM|BPM|VORP| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kevin Durant|2017-18|29|68|2325|26.0|.640|10.4|.215|5.0|0.7|5.6|4.5| |2|Michael Jordan*|1997-98|34|82|3181|25.2|.533|15.8|.238|4.6|0.0|4.6|5.3|  So Jordan attempted 6.8 more FGA, 3.8 more FTA, averaged 1.6 more OREB, 1.4 more STL, and 1.2 less TOV. Since it's assumed a possession=1 shot attempt=1 stl=1 tov=1 oreb and the coefficient of 0.44 is used to determine the possessional value of a FTA relative to a FGA, Jordan used 4.272 more possessions than Durant.     With those 4.272 possessions, Jordan managed   2.9 more points, 3.2 less defensive rebounds, 2.8 less assists, and 1.7 less blocks.    Let's just assume that blocks and defensive rebounds are completely worthless to a team, which is absurd.    Jordan averaged 2.9 more points and 2.8 less assists on 4.3 more possessions. Let's say that assists are irrelevant as well and the scorer is the only one that deserves credit, how the fuck is Jordan considered superior when he scored 2.9 more points on 4.3 more possessions? That's 0.67 points per possession, barely half of the NBA average(1.06). You telling me that somehow makes them equal in value? Jordan 1.6 less points for his team than expected not even including Durant's 2.8 more assists, 3.2 more drebs, and 1.7 more blocks.    Here's another example where somehow assists become hugely valuable again despite being of no value in the above    2015 LeBron vs 2018 Durant playoffs    |Rk|Player|Season|Age|GS|MP|FG|FGA|FG%|FT|FTA|FT%|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PTS| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kevin Durant|2017-18|29|21|807|13.1|26.8|.487|8.4|9.4|.901|0.8|9.2|10.1|6.1|0.9|1.5|3.1|37.5| |2|LeBron James|2014-15|30|20|844|14.2|34.1|.417|7.6|10.5|.731|2.3|11.8|14.2|10.6|2.1|1.3|5.1|37.7|    |Rk|Player|Season|Age|G|MP|PER|TS%|OBPM|DBPM|BPM|VORP| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kevin Durant|2017-18|29|21|807|25.1|.606|5.7|0.8|6.4|1.7| |2|LeBron James|2014-15|30|20|844|25.3|.487|5.9|5.1|11.0|2.7|    LeBron is +7.3 FGA, +1.1 FTA, +2.0 TOV, +1.5 OREB, +1.2 STL which works out to 7.084 possessions.    With those 7.084 possessions, he averaged 0.2 more ppg, 1.1 more dreb, +4.5 assists, and 0.2 BLKs.     If 98 Jordan is ~= to Durant in PER with    2.9 more points, 3.2 less defensive rebounds, 2.8 less assists, and 1.7 less blocks on 4.3 extra possessions    how the fuck is 2015 LeBron~=2018 Durant with   0.2 more ppg, 1.1 more dreb, 4.5 more assists, and 0.2 less BLKs on 7.1 more possessions.     Using the 1.06 multiplier(NBA league average ORTG) for average points per possession, LeBron's example is telling me that an **assist is worth roughly 1.63 points** excluding DRB and BLK, which are irrelevant as 18 RS Durant has even higher discrepancies over 98 RS Jordan than 15 PO 18 PO LeBron over 18 PO Durant.    Meanwhile Jordan's example is telling me each assist is worth **-0.59 points.** Yes, that's a negative.    so -0.59~=1.63 according to PER??     Using the same value for assists from the Jordan example, LeBron's 7.1 more possessions should yield 9.9 less points than expected if the possessions were used at random by a league average player     There's 0 consistency. Not to mention that if you apply a static value for assists making for the differential between LeBron and Durant career wise, Stockton should be the GOAT according to advanced stats. And yet he's nowhere close    "

Find me the most recent to me someone has referred to Durant as MVP Kevin Durant. My guess is that it hasn't been since 2015. 
Kevin Durant
"They tried paying Harrison Barnes before the season but he rejected it. Nobody thought Kevin Durant was gonna be a Warrior until pretty much the week he signed. It's not a loser mentality, it's realist, there's literally no top tier team that came to form without luck. It's just arrogant and ignorant to act like not re-signing role players to get Durant is planning ahead, you can admit it's lucky, it doesn't make your team any worse."
"Sure. But people don't refer to Durant as mvp kevin Durant, cause he's not the mvp anymore. "
"I just met kevin durant at Glendale Galleria. I dont know what he was doing there but he was walking with two other guys. I saw him and wanted to meet him, but hesitated for a second. But my gut said this was my only chance so I just walked up to him. I introduced myself and said that I am a big fan and all that. He just looked at me confused and said that I must have confused him with someone else. His two buddies started laughing but KD looked super serious. I hold my hand out to shake his hand but he pulled himself back and took couple steps backwards. He was super fast. I understood that he wanted to stay undercover so I just gave him a wink and walked away. He is a super down to earth guy and bit of a germ freak I think"
"I would have a different not Lakers team they you (way different) but i think they would beat the lakers team. I think it would be something like.

The team 5 years ago would beat you guys just by having Kevin Durant.
Good luck finding someone to guard Kevin Durant....
Unpopular opinion: Kevin Durant is *not* the worst living human being on earth.  I guess that's bad?
It's only Warriors fans who don't realize how they lucked into getting Kevin Durant. There'll never come another season when the salary cap jumps high enough to add a max contract without making any sacrifices.

Devin: Nah man, he not that good. The team can't win a chip with that cat. They need a Kevin Durant in there. I don't like the organization the roster wasn't that good to begin with.

"Warriors didn’t really take a fully conservative approach. Yeah they drafted Curry, Klay and Draymond. But they away Monta Ellis, signed Iguodala, Bogut and David Lee. Won in 2015, as soon as they lost in 2016, they didn’t want to go back conservative and hope they’d win again. They let Barnes walk, signed Kevin Durant.  The Warriors even nearly traded Klay Thompson a few years prior to now. They’ve also been rumored to be trying to get to Anthony Davis. "
Kevin Durant and James Harden didn’t want to be leaders either. Doesn’t mean you can’t win.

"PG - LBJ Jr   SG - 40 Year Old Lebron   SF - Rookie Lebron   PF - Miami Heat Lebron   C - Current Lebron    6th: Prime JR   I'd just stagger the rest to have at least 2 Lebrons out there with the JR's at all times.  Lebron is a machine and doesn't need as much rest as a normal human so it should often just be the starting 5.    Since we don't know what future Lebron or future LBJ Jr hold for us, we have to assume based off what we see now.  Lebron projects to be the most talented and contributing 40 year old this game has ever seen just based off how well he's aged thus far.  His 3PT shot and playmaking should be at all time highs, while his motor will be the lowest on the starting 5.  This sets him up to use his infinite wisdom/photographic memory to create perfect space and set great plays with his refined 3 pt shot and consistent ability to drive.    LBJ Jr playing his natural position at PG.  He's show a good handle and a versatile game.  His age will undoubtedly give him the best motor of anyone out on the court, thus having him guarding Steph with smothering defense only a hungry teen son of the GOAT can produce will definitely slow down Steph's game.  This is really ALL we can hope for of LBJ jr, outside of the occasional 3 or running the ball up the court.    The real playmaking will come from current Lebron, at C.  He's at the age of having a perfect mixture of 3 pt shooting, motor/strength, &amp; experience vs warriors to man the floor.  He will know what to do and who to get the ball to.  Having the Lebron at C running Point will create confusion and interesting spacing.    Rookie Lebron will be all over Kevin Durant.  He will be focused on shutting him down first and foremost.  Did I say Lebron James Jr would have the best motor on the court? I forgot about Rookie Lebron.  No worries, though.  Having 2 rookies with excellent pedigree &amp; size are perfect when coming up against 2 unstoppable scoring forces in Steph &amp; Kev.  Rookie Bron and his Son will pretty much spent as much energy as they have to shutting down their assignments and scoring sporadically when the opportunity arises.    Miami Lebron is just a problem.  This is prime Lebron.   This is unstoppable Lebron.  This is Lebron will jump in the air and kill 3 people on his way to finishing at the rim, Lebron.  He will be their 1st option and he will get his buckets.  He's faster than Draymond and can shoot the basketball, he's gonna get his buckets.    Now, let's factor in confusion.  GSW are going to be confused as hell telling them apart, ESPECIALLY the JR smith bench.  JR Smith has looked the same since he was 16 years old.  If all the Lebrons wear that same oversized headband and block their hairlines, it will be tough to distinguish some of them.  This is definitely a negative against GSW.    Teamwork, the Lebrons can pretty much read each other's minds.  Who knows Lebron better than Lebron? That's right, 40 year old Lebron.  All these Lebrons will be reading each others movements and will know when each version of Lebron is in his best position to score.  This fact alone, plus their amazing conditioning is a huge plus for team Lebron.    The Warriors have a diverse game and better bench, though.  They have specialists who can really shoot the 3, all while playing very good defense.  It isn't enough, though.  We are talking about a team of GOATS here.    Lebrons in 5.  "
Kevin Durant and Chris Paul. I call the cops on myself. We all get arrested and go to jail for 5 years. The Warriors and Rockets are now beatable. Y'all welcome. 
"Kuzma is seen with an unlikeliness to improve because of the precedent of the 4-year player and how complete his offensive game looks as it is. The players that end up being drafted after 4-years are typically really fundamentally sound either offensively or defensively and because of that have early success in the league. However, they’re also perceived to have lower talent potentials and that’s why they stayed in college longer to become the best “they can be” and hopefully become good role players and low starters.  However, players like Embiid, Simmons, Ingram, Lonzo, Fultz and other 1-year players are seen as having higher ceilings because despite coming out at 19 years old and having a lot of rawness and kinks in the game, they still have success against other players and some end up being as successful as 4-year players early without even exhausting their talent levels yet. Embiid averaged 20+ points last year yet is seen as still raw and not complete and that’s why his ceiling is so high. Simmons averages are high in every category yet he doesn’t even have a perimeter jumpshot. Ingram averaged 16 points in his second season just like Kuzma, yet you can tell he’s very offensively raw and has that sense of you know he can get waaaay better from this.   You can tell Kuzma has a grasp and understanding of his game similar to that of an established veteran (he’s almost capable of scoring anywhere possible) but the thing is he’s doing everything right so EARLY that it’s hard to see where he can get better at unless it’s defensively. Embiid, Simmons and Ingram’s games are sincerely incomplete yet they get the same job done or better than Kuzma while not having nearly the same grasp on their abilities as Kuzma.   This isn’t saying Kuzma can’t improve, because he can improve and probably become an All-Star, but because he’s already grasped and can do a lot of things out of his first season, there’s not much to see him improve on besides defense. Yet a lot of folks see Embiid, Simmons and Ingram as future superstars because they have so much to learn and develop in their games yet play at an above average level.   Embiid is 23, but he still hasn’t fully developed yet as a post offensive player (a lot of that attributed to his early injuries) and many perceive him to be a 25+ point scorer when he’s peaking and possible MVP candidate. Same for Simmons, who gets Bron comparisons and Ingram who gets T-Mac and Kevin Durant comparisons.  It’s why LeBron himself sees a lot more in Ingram and Lonzo than Kuzma when he joined, because you have that sense that they are far from acknowledging their own strengths and “waking up” so to speak."
Kevin Durant not being named at all just shows how delusional this sub is.
2000's Team PG - Steph Curry SG - James Harden SF - Kevin Durant PF - Lebron James C - Marc Gasol  2010's Team PG - Kyrie Irving SG - Klay Thompson SF - Giannis  PF - Anthony Davis C - Joel Embiid  Which team wins a 7 game series?
"If even that...   Some NBA preseason tickets are as low as $15.  Sonics fans have no reason to really care about either of the teams playing in the exhibition.    One hand, you have the Kings who are the worst team in the league and it almost feels like the NBA is rubbing salt in Seattle's wounds by having it be the team Chris Hansen almost acquired.    On the other hand, you have the Warriors who are a big deal, but they'll be playing limited minutes.  Seattle fans have a weird relationship with Kevin Durant.  Many didn't fully appreciate him during his rookie season, but plenty fell in love with him.  Then when the team moved to OKC the majority of Seattle fans reluctantly rooted against KD, because although they had a soft spot for KD they passionately wanted to avoid seeing Clay Bennett and Oklahoma win a title.   Seattle fans celebrated when KD abandoned Oklahoma, but the hardcore NBA fans here hated KD's decision to join a 73 win team as much as everyone.    Meanwhile, a massive chunk of former NBA fans here are apathetic or outright hateful of the league right now.  I expect that they'd return in droves if the SOnics returned, but asking Seatteites to pony up big bucks to a league they still feel fucked over by is a hard sell.  Going to the ""Big 3"" was different, because we got to see guys like Payton and Rashard Lewis and celebrate the former team while giving money to a league that wasn't the NBA... but even that, it wasn't close to being sold out.    Asking Seattle fans to pay the NBA a bunch of money to watch two teams that aren't the Sonics is a different story.  There's also frustration from fans here who feel like the NBA has used the threat of moving a team to Seattle as a way to force other cities to pay for new state of the art arenas in their home cities.    So yeah... seeing Durant play 15 minutes in an exhibition game in Seattle might be fun, but it's not fun to the point that they are going to be able to charge $60+ for shitty seats in decrepit Key Arena before they shut it down for renovations.  I expect to see plenty of cheap seats.  If ticket sales struggle, I hope the league doesn't mistakenly assume lack of interest in paying to see this exhibition is a sign Seattle isn't hungry for an NBA team.    This game should be a first step towards the NBA repairing their relationship with Seattle in advance of bringing a team back here.  That should mean cheap seats, giveaways, and a celebration of the past.  Also, KD should come out wearing Sonics warmups.     "
"2000s All-Decade Draft Team  Starters  G: Steph Curry  G: James Harden  F: LeBron James  F: Kevin Durant  C: Al Horford  Bench  Russell Westbrook — Chris Paul — DeMar DeRozan — Kyle Lowry — Jrue Holiday — Goran Dragic — LaMarcus Aldridge — Kevin Love — Blake Griffin — Marc Gasol  2010s All-Decade Draft Team  Starters  G: Kyrie Irving  G: Paul George  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Anthony Davis  Bench  Damian Lillard — Bradley Beal — Victor Oladipo — Klay Thompson — Jimmy Butler — Nikola Jokic — Kristaps Porzingis — Karl-Anthony Towns — Joel Embiid — DeMarcus Cousins  ...wow, this is tough. I guess I’d give the ever so slight edge to the 2000s. The 2010s is way deeper (not to mention guys like Gobert, Green, Wall, Simmons, Mitchell, etc. aren’t even listed), but I like the 2000s starters just a little bit more. LeBron on the same team as KD, Steph, and Harden would be nasty. If it were a 7-game series, it’d definitely go 7. But I’ll take the 2000s, barely."
Klay Thompson made Kevin Durant give up imo.  
The game Steph Curry made Kevin Durant into a snake*
If we're just talking about one initial like all first names starting with the same initial all-time  ######K - PG: Kevin Johnson  - SG: Kevin Martin  - SF: Kevin Durant  - PF: Kevin Garnett (Or Karl Malone)  - C: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Current  #####Last Name H  Last Name H’s - PG: Jrue Holiday/George Hill/  - SG: James Harden/Gary Harris/Buddy Heild  - SF: Gordon Hayward/Mario Hezonja  - PF: Al Horford/Tobias Harris  - C: Dwight Howard/John Henson/Spencer Hawes 
"You know what, I don’t even hate Lebron, but if I went by what this sub likes to look at into hating all of Warriors players...  1) I hate Klay because he’s is a sore loser for “man’s game” comments he made years ago, However, Lebron is such a fierce competitor amirite? Let’s completely ignore him mocking Dirk’s flu and telling us how much better his life is compared to us after losing in 2011. Totally not a sore loser.  2) I hate Kevin Durant for ring-chasing on a 73-9 win team that LOST the finals. However Lebron joined one of the best SG’s in league history who won a ring without him and would have had a better record than the 45 wins this sub likes to bring up if he wasn’t injured in 2010 season. Oh also, he brought another all-star and later one of the best 3 point shooter with him. Definitely not ring-chasing.  3) I hate Steph Curry because he can’t win a championship on his own and his win in 2015 has an asterisk next to it because of the injuries to Cavs. Oh man totally loved Lebron’s playoff run in 2016 where he buttfucked the east with a much better roster than anyone and won the finals because Curry was hobbled and Bogut was injured and Draymond was suspended. Definitely not an asterisk. (Again I’d like to point out that asterisks are given out for steroids and shit, not because injuries/suspensions happened. Those are all part of sport, but people on here would have you believing that Curry’s ring doesn’t count because Love and Kyrie got injured).   Look, I actually like Lebron. However, if I am supposed to hate a player for all the reasons this sub hates them for, then Lebron has elements of ALL of those. "
But Kevin Durant isn't 25 points from being the all time Olympic scorer and 19ppg is nowhere near the highest? 
"Yikes. That’s why I love Low kick on Blaziken in Uber’s, every Legendary is Super Heavy. Now I have a mental Image of Blaziken Kicking Kevin Durant in the shins before making a jump shot lol. "
"Never hated GSW, they grew a championship contender organically. Nothing wrong with that.    The issue is with Kevin Durant, and his soft ass decision to join your already championship caliber team the off-season after choking on your dick. Then wins a pretty much given title with you guys and claims to be the best in the league. Not helping his imagine bickering with kids online with and without burner accounts."
"You can joke about efficiency all you want, but the shooting stats back it up  Lebron takes way more inside shots near the rim while Kevin Durant stretches his scoring all the way out to the perimeter"
"1. If you're going to take LeBron off the heat and not replace him with anybody sure the Heat won't win. Just like the Warriors won't win if you take Kevin Durant off that team and replace him with nobody.  2. Because the Celtics would have to get rid of one of their big 3 to make room for LeBron. LeBron/Wade/Bosh is better than LeBron/Old ass KG and ray allen. LeBron did the best move possible for his career just like KD did. Also LeBron took a paycut to make things happen. KD didn't so if you really want to get down to it, LeBron's decision was worse because he didn't take what he was worth since he was so desperate for a title.  Don't use faulty arguments. It makes you look really dumb. "
I never hated on the warriors. just kevin durant. hes pretty good at basketball though
"but the point still stands on those possessions. The Clippers were bringing help and discouraging the Thunder from getting the ball to Durant. The first possession in that highlight reel doesn't even involve KD touching the ball b/c the ball handler saw Deandre lurking behind ready to anticipate the entry pass. That's consistent with that 4th quarter.   Paul executed the scheme well and did his job as a primary defender, but he's nothing without the support behind him. That's why I hesitate to say ""lock down"", and I wouldn't say he played great defense in the series when  he got beaten badly by his primary assignment who he guarded on far more possessions than Kevin Durant. "
I gotta give that L to him but it's more in Kevin Durant than Westbrook. Durant was the best player in that team and he backed down and choked. Not saying Westbrook didn't choke but I give the L mostly to Durant
"I’d gladly take a 6-5, 6-6 Kevin Durant "
"Jayson Tatum isn’t even a true longboi smh  Kevin Durant, Giannis, Ingram, Bamba, Isaac etc. are the long boys of the league.   6’9 height and 7’3 wingspan minimum"
"I would say number 1 is Kevin Durant, but I am a bit conflicted. The thing with Kevin Durant is that while people disrespect his personality, they at least respect his game. With harden people both disrespect his personality and his game so in a way it can be seen as he is hated more. I'm gonna keep KD at 1 to be safe though."

Basically a more muscular and bigger hands Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant 🐍 shake confirmed 
&gt;They are still going to do much better than him.  Idk if I agree with that. It's Kevin Durant.
"Lol Kevin Durant, and not because he’s a snake. "
"Kevin Durant if Curry gets hurt I can see KD averaging 30 ppg 8 rpg 6 apg and leading the Warriors to 55-60 games. He just needs to win one more MVP and a championship to be a top 10 player in my opinion. 23,000 points, 2× MVP, 3× Champion, 3×FMVP, 10× All Star, 9× All NBA, 4 Scoring titles after this year would be an amzing resume for a 30 year old. He can than join the Knicks and hopefully win a ring or two and solidify himself as a top 10 player."
"You're reaching hard.   Singler is mainly recruited for his 3-pt shooting and ability to stretch the floor. That's why his FG% is even lower than it already is since half his shots are 3-pointers. We look at his Detroit seasons, including TOT, where he averaged 37-41% from 3-pt range and dropped to 31 and 19% on OKC. Hey at the very least in favor of your viewpoint, he went 2/5 in his 12 games last season. Lmao.   For example, Reggie has the same TS% on FAR higher volume but you conveniently took that out of context. Kanter reached his peak percentage leaving OKC and increased it from 54% to 59% which is an astronomical leap on same volume.  Oladipo made some vague comments about Westbrook's work ethics and you think that's why he jumped to becoming the most improved player in the league? Lmao.   Oladipo and Harden NEVER would have reached MVP caliber playing alongside Westbrook. That's simply a statistical fact because there's no way you can shoot enough to even score 25+ points when the guy next to you has a historically high 42% usage rate. Unless of course your name is Kevin Durant and you have the authority to take as many, if not more, shots than Westbrook. And yet even Durant improved when he went to Golden State. Yes he benefits from the tremendous gravity from Klay and Curry but several reports illustrate Durant's complaints about OKC offense - in particular Westbrook's - is why he wanted to leave OKC in the first place.   https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/12/13/16770062/victor-oladipo-russell-westbrook-okc-effect    This site should end any debate on the matter.

"School spirit/pride creates a sense of community and can bring in alumni donations. It also gives them a reputation. DeMatha would be a relatively uninteresting school in PG County except it has 18 NBA alumni (including Markelle Fultz and Victor Oladipo), so people across the country have heard of it and that can make local kids want to go there over Bishop McNamara or St. Anselm's.   It honestly doesn't seem worth it to me -- Kevin Durant went to Montrose Christian, which was a major powerhouse but grew too quickly as a result of its success and then had to close for financial reasons. Though most of these schools are older and more stable than Montrose with large endowments/financial aid budgets.  With places like Maret and Sidwell from the second article above, it's less wanting to be the best basketball team than it is just knowing that not losing all the time in sports will make a school more attractive to potential applicants, especially boys. And the schools that they have to competetive with are all recruiting. "
"I just wanna say something real quick  ""FUCK Kevin Durant!""  That's all"

lmao he get 8 apg with the warriors... are we really gonna pretend he could do the same with the cavs roster?   dont forget that kevin love was getting his ass handed to him in the pacers series. and that kevin love qas missing for the final two games of the celtics series.   the celtics team was about was good as the jazz even eith kyrie and hayward gone. do you really rhink that durant plus george hill is taking down the celtics in games 6 and 7?  lets be real here. durant just isnt capable of being the one man system that lebron is. we all knoe this dont even deny it. thats why durant wouldnt have been able to carry the cavs.   
"It’s not dumb... what’s dumb is pretending they have more value when they don’t   Let me ask you in oracle do they hang the banners that say “2018 champions but this ring isn’t worth more than the 2016 ring”?  Of course not   When they introduce Kevin Durant to the hall of fame will they say “winner of 3 rings but they aren’t as valuable as dirks”?  Of course not   When they refer to the warriors on ESPN or NBA Tv... to they say “3 time champs but their championships aren’t as impressive as the 2011 Mavericks”?  Hell no....   I act like they are the same, cause in reality they are.  No where it matters do they have more or less value in society.  It’s just on reddit and twitter where we do this.  And I’m not opposed to it.  It’s the off-season we need something to talk about.  But I’ve just been seen this trend lately of us acting like Dirks ring is this huge accomplishment and should be equal to 5 rings or whatever.  And that’s where it’s a bit far for me.  I love dirk but reddit is going a bit far almost to a bronsexual level."
Kevin Durant is NBA version of Sasuke 
"I’m a simple man. When I see Kevin Durant being portrayed unfavorably, I upvote."
"KD? KD is extremely good at what he does, but he doesn't have nearly the toolkit that MJ or Kobe had. Durant himself [pretty much echo's my original post](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1991551-modeling-his-game-kevin-durant-cites-kobe-bryants-skill-as-second-to-none)  As far as Michael, yes, he was called air Jordan for a reason. His body control and skill is completely unlike any other guy I've seen, except Kobe. It's not obvious since their games are so similar, but you have to really look closely to see the difference. MJ was more athletic, but I've seen Kobe pull off moves I've never seen MJ do. For example, it's no secret that they are both deadly in the pinch post, but I've seen Kobe utilize his footwork more to perform [step back reverse jumpers,](https://youtu.be/rDcHUyYhRHM) the [""Dirk"" one-legged fadeaway,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JjjXPT0IPQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=953), and there are many more examples. Ironically, Kobe really moved like a snake using fluid motions and tight angles to get anywhere he wanted. That's just the nature of the game, the later players have the advantages of taking what the older players did and building on them. As far as pure skill and craftmanship, nobody has Kobe beat."
"PG Magic  SG MJ  SF Kevin Durant  PF Tim Duncan  C Hakeem Olajuwon   I know people are gonna knock on me for not putting Lebron but everyone's doing it and i wanted to put another line up. Magic's just as good of a playmaker as Lebron and Tim and Hakeem were very movile in their prime. In today's rules they may suffer but in a slower pace they'd stop Shaq. I have KD for spacing and Magic developed a shot over time but they'd suffer, tbh."

"Although Harden did have Kevin Durant once upon a time and fell short in the NBA Finals.  I guess Harden was super young but he was more than capable; what hurts more is that without Harden's good play in the conference finals, they would not have beaten the Spurs.  "
"It's because Russ has the perfect narrative surrounding him as he carries the underdog Thunder on his back versus the evil Kevin Durant and his overpowered sqaud.    It's almost ridiculous how good the story line is, especially with the history between Russ and Durant. It feels straight out of a movie.  Essentially if you hate the Warriors, which 90% of people do, it makes someone like Russ extremely easy to root for."

I agree. All I’m trying to say is I think that if he trained his entire life Kevin Durant would make a pretty good goalie.

"Melo had to battle all of those guys too IN ADDITION to constantly being compared to Lebron James (probably the GOAT) as players like Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, and Chris Paul were all very dominant in their primes. Don’t disrespect the late 2000’s and early 2010’s NBA like that."
"Is that the same Kevin Durant who averaged 35/8/5 on 70%TS in the 2017 finals, and 29/11/7.5 on 65%TS in 2018? When it comes to playoffs and finals, KD is just flat out better than Steph. "

"This is one of Steph Curry's few flaws and where Kevin Durant really helps. When the game gets tight, Curry's size makes it difficult for him to get a look off. A big reason why GSW treasures KD's isolations so much."

"IIRC, those games b/w Kobe and KD weren't as one sided as you suggested. I think each had their own haymakers, but to suggest Kobe would wreck him is a little homerish. Pre-prime KD held his own against Kobe. I don't remember who guarded who in those OKC-LAL matchups, but I don't think they guarded each other. Anyways, I found a [stat sheet](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/h2h_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Kobe+Bryant&amp;player_id1_select=Kobe+Bryant&amp;player_id1=bryanko01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players) for their matchups."
"This is FALSE information, Kd torches Kawhi when they play and he cannot guard him either.Guys just make things up when there are actual stats and game tape out.The best Kd defenders are on his own team in Iguodola and Draymond  Kevin Durant while guarded by Kawhi Leonard in 2016 WCSF:  42 points 15/22 FG (68.2 FG%) 2/5 3PFG (40 3P%) 1.91 PPS"
"Eric Gordon is a reserve player on the Houston Rockets. KD is a starter, why would you argue this?  Losing Iguodala is losing the fifth best player on the team. You cannot say that Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant all suffered losses because of one player missing time. Even if one of the all stars was missing, them losing games is still not excused. It's a championship caliber team still.  Your example is completely different because Chris Paul is an all star caliber player and Andre Iguodala is not. The Rockets also possess only two all star caliber players as opposed to the Warriors' four.  Not sure why you had to attack my flair and call me delusional when my opinion is not even that controversial."
"&gt; KEVIN DURANT is reportedly open to discussions over a possible move to the Los Angeles Lakers next summer to team up with LeBron James, according to Fox Sports’ Skip Bayless.  Oh okay. "
"I'm not. But im a Kevin Durant alt, so I have my own issues."
"You really think Kawhi is better than KD?  LOL.  KD is 4-1 in the playoffs against Kawhi.  Head to Head in the playoffs:  KD: 28 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists on 61.1% TS  Kawhi:  15 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists on 55.0% TS  Its not even close.  KD destroys Kawhi every time  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/h2h_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id1_select=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id1=leonaka01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players"
Kevin Durant and Howard
"Kanter was measured at 6' 9.75"" in the combine.  Lebron was measures at 6' 7.75""  There is no way Lebron is only 2 inches shorter than Kevin Durant"
"I get that you have an ambivalent opinion because of the difference in talent when you compare GSW and the Lakers, but it's still extremely common to see Curry being picked up from half court and also double teamed (most prominent examples being against the cavs in the last 2 finals where they would rather give Kevin fucking Durant a good look). Doesn't this answer that Curry had better gravity that teams are committing hard to him despite having Klay and more recently KD on his team?"
"It's too hard to accurately judge this because Curry plays on an all-star team. It's nearly impossible to run a good defensive scheme against them that involves doubling a guy like Curry, as you'd be leaving open a guy like Kevin Durant lol most teams hedge and recover as best they can simply because they don't have the ability to recover after getting *pulled in* by the gravity per se. They just play man and know they're mismatched, because allowing 2 players to jump one Warrior is literally asking for a highlight to be made on you. You just can't leave them open, they're too good. "
"*This video is fucking annoying. How can they show me two players and expect me to realize which is Aaron Gordon and which --* oh, that's Kevin Durant."
"Ah yes, Kevin Durant's real father from south of the border, [Señor Durant Sr.](https://i.imgur.com/M1X6Ak0.jpg)"
"Late to the post, but I agree, Kevin Durant is arguably the best offensive player in the game, has outplayed Lebron in back-to-back finals, and is a top at least top 15 defensive player in the league why Lebron does not want to play defense anymore.  People like to use hyperbole that if you were to switch LeBron and Durant from last year that the Cavaliers wouldn't make it out of the east 1. LeBron had a hand and why his team was that way to begin with so why are we putting Durant and LeBrons personal made situation 2. Who exactly was going to get in Kevin Durant's way? Victor Oladipo and the Pacers? The mentally fragile Duo of DeRozan and Lowry? The Boston Celtics without their two best players? Yeah I'm not buying it"
Kevin Durant starting an early  rivalry I see 
"1. Jordan  2. LeBron  3. Bird  4. Magic  5. Kobe  6. Shaq  7. Olajuwon  8. Duncan  9. Karl Malone  10. Kevin Durant  (Kobe, Shaq, Duncan, and Hakeem are almost interchangeable)."
"Donald Trump = Kevin Durant.  Both are complete asshats who are always in the news for embarrassing Twitter scandals. Yet, both manage to keep winning despite their haters. Trump lies about his weight and Durant lies about his height."
1. LeBron James 2. Tim Duncan 3. Shaquille O’Neal 4. Kobe Bryant 5. Kevin Garnett 6. Kevin Durant 7. Stephen Curry 8. Dirk Nowitzki 9. Dwyane Wade 10. James Harden   I was born in 2000
"Harrison Barnes. He played for you a few years back, before that Kevin Durant fella joined. "
Lebron also let Kevin Durant average 32 ppg the past 2 finals where KD had the 3 highest true shooting percentages in Finals history
He’s forever a cult hero to Maryland fans. I pretty much stopped following the Terps when he graduated (and they moved out of the ACC)  Sidenote but Vasquez played HS ball  at Montrose Christian with Kevin Durant
"What the fuck??  Ariza doesn't do anything on offense besides 3's and dunks and his entire career is based on defense  Kevin Durant is an insane jump shooter  Brandon Ingram is pretty bad at shooting rn and has shown more proclivity for driving than anything.  Also there's no reason right now to project him as a lock down defender or a rim protector like the two guys you named. While his defense isn't as bad as his FT shooting, his isn't going to be at the level of those 2 guys' without taking major major steps."
Does that make Kevin Durant Benedict Arnold? 
"The Jordan Rules and Hack-a-Shaq were strategies teams employed, not actual rules the NBA implemented like the ""Reggie Miller Rule"" and ""Kevin Durant Rule."" The NBA did introduce zone defense, though, in order to reduce Shaq's dominance."
"Generally they name the rule after the person it's meant to inhibit. Reggie Miller Rule, Kevin Durant Rule, Jordan Rules, Hack-a-Shaq"
This man more insecure than Kevin Durant

"&gt; Not that surprising for a guy who dominates the ball the entire game, which explains the points, rebounds, and assists  Dominating the ball leads to rebounds? Also, you're ignoring the fact that he's dominating the ball *because* he's such a great scorer and passer. Kyrie is arguably a better scorer than LeBron. If Kyrie was as good of a passer and decision maker then he'd have dominated the ball as much or more.  &gt;  Also Cavs entire game plan was to limit Curry's touches  And the Warriors entire game plan was to let LeBron do as much damage as he wants?  &gt; Also not surprising because neither team had an elite shot blocker or steal man. Just for reference the last 2 Finals Kevin Durant lead both teams in Blocks.  I'd argue that KD is the elite shot blocker."
"Not that surprising for a guy who dominates the ball the entire game, which explains the points, rebounds, and assists. Also Cavs entire game plan was to limit Curry's touches and double team him so of course Curry would not lead in points.  The Warriors play a democratic offense, so no one will put up massive assists numbers either. Rebounds?  With Green playing Center a ton, it surprise that a taller Lebron would grab more rebounds.  Also not surprising because neither team had an elite shot blocker or steal man.  Just for reference the last 2 Finals Kevin Durant lead both teams in Blocks."

"1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Steph Curry 4. James Harden 5. Anthony Davis   AD and Kawhi is obviously close but Kawhi hasn't played well in a year and he's coming off an injury that put him out for a year, AD on the other hand finished 3rd in MVP, had a great playoffs performance and will likely improve again. Kawhi will also have to adjust to being on a new team and not playing with the best coach of all time. The rest of them are above AD due to their abilities to carry a team especially in the regular season. You could argue that Harden is a choker but his regular season ability makes me rank him that high. Lebron obvious 1 may change this year but idk, KD at 2 as he performs noticeably better in the playoffs than Steph imo also has 2x FMVP over Steph. LeBron, Steph, KD over Harden due to less choking basically."

Number 2 picks are not created equal. Kevin Durant was a #2 pick as well.   I'm not comparing Ingram to Durant but saying that the Lakers should've been willing to give up Ingram because they were willing to give up D-Lo is silly.

"Copying this from another user. Kobe is the second most popular player ever. Kobe is not a top 10 player. Durant and Kobe probably end up close on all time lists.   &gt; Yes, Kobe Bryant is arguably the most overrated basketball player in history. He is often ranked among the Top-Ten players of all time, which I think this is absurd. The following are the reasons I consider Kobe overrated: Kobe is NOT an All-Time Great Scorer. One of the most prevalent arguments as to why Kobe is a all-time great, is his supposedly legendary scoring ability, which is often compared to all-time great, Michael Jordan. However, lets take a closer look at this claim and show why it is flawed: Kobe has only 2 Scoring Titles. Kobe has only lead the league in points per game 2 times, in 19-year career. In comparison: Michael Jordan has done so 10 times. Wilt Chaimberlain has done so 7 times. Kevin Durant and Allen Iverson have done so 4 times. (KD has been in the NBA, less than half the time Kobe had, and has twice the number of scoring titles) Kobe has a Career Points-Per-Game Average of 25. Kobe averaged 25 PPG, over his career. This is a fantastic average, however, it does not rank among the greatest career averages. Kobe’s PPG average does NOT rank among the Top 10. LeBron’s career average is 27.2 PPG, while Kobe’s career average in the same span was 24.8. However, Kobe is generally considered a greater scorer. Allen Iverson, who is generally not considered among the greatest NBA players ever, had a career average of 26.7 PPG, also greater than that of Kobe. Kobe has had the Worst Chokes in the NBA Finals. Kobe is often ranked among the most clutch players in NBA history. This is not backed by substance, and this is evidenced in some of his NBA Finals performances over the years. 2004 NBA Finals: Game 3 vs Detroit Pistons In Game 3 of the 2004 NBA Finals, against the Detroit Pistons, with the series tied at 1–1, Kobe had arguably the worst choke of any superstar in Finals history, which led to a loss by 20 points. Kobe finished the game with just 11 Points on a terrible 30% shooting, with 3 Rebounds, 5 Assists and 4 Turnovers. 2008 NBA Finals: Game 6 vs Boston Celtics Facing elimination, with his team down 3–2 in the series, with a chance to force a Game 7 in Staples Center, Kobe, the reigning MVP of the league, choked again in one of the biggest games of his career, which led to the Lakers losing the Championship. Kobe finished the game with 22 Points on a dismal 32% shooting, with just 3 Rebounds and a pathetic 1 Assist with 4 Turnovers. 2010 NBA Finals: Game 7 vs Boston Celtics With a brilliant chance at redemption, against a Boston Celtics team that defeated his Lakers two years ago, Kobe had a chance to cement his legacy as a clutch performer on the biggest stage of all: Game 7 of the NBA Finals, at home. Yet, he choked again. Kobe finished the game with 23 Points, of which he scored 11 from the free-throw line, thanks to receiving a ridiculous 15 free-throw attempts (ahem Referees? ahem). He scored 12 Points from the field on a awful 25% shooting, with just 1 Assist and 4 Turnovers, but did have a stellar 15 Rebounds. But thanks to the Referees (The Lakers got 20 more free-throws than the Celtics), the Lakers happened to win this game and Kobe won his 5th Ring. Compare these chokes with LeBron’s Finals: Game 4 performance against the Mavericks, which sparked conversation about LeBron being a Choke-Artist. LeBron put up a measly 8 Points on 27% shooting, but had 9 Rebounds and 7 Assists, therefore having about similar production as Kobe’s in the fore-mentioned games. Kobe has only ONE Regular Season MVP (Which he didn’t really deserve). Kobe Bryant has only one regular season MVP , which is put 12 players who have more MVPs than him. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has done so 6 times. Michael Jordan has done so 5 times. Larry Bird and Magic Johnson have done so 3 times. Tim Duncan, Steve Nash and Stephen Curry have done so 2 times. Kobe Bryant did win the 2007–2008 season, but did not deserve it. Let us take a look at Kobe’s stats, compared to other players’ performances. Kobe Bryant: 28.2 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1.8 SPG, 0.5 BPG, 46% FG, 36% 3P, with a record 57–25. Chris Paul: 21.1 PPG, 4.0 RPG, 11.6 APG, 2.7 SPG, 0.1 BPG, 49% FG, 37%3P, with a record 56–26. LeBron James: 30.0 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 7.2 APG, 1.8 SPG, 1.1 BPG, 48% FG, 32% 3P, with the record 45–37. Amar’e Stoudemire: 25.2 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 1.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 2.1 BPG, 59% FG, 16% 3P, with the record 55–27. Kobe is an Extremely Inefficient player. Kobe Bryant has an Career Field Goal Percentage of 44.7%. Kobe Bryant, despite being a versatile scorer, has thelowest field goal percentageamong the Top 15 All-Time Career Scorers. Kobe Bryant has scored a total 33,643 Points, off 26,200 Shots. In Comparison, Karl Malone has scored a total of 36,928 Points, off 26,210 Shots. Which means, Karl Malone has taken 10 more shots than Kobe Bryant, but has scored 3,285 more points. Kobe has the Most Career Field Goals Missed. Kobe has missed 14,481 Shots in his career, which happens to be 1,064 more than the next player, John Havlicek. Kobe Bryant hold the record with the Most Missed Shotsin a single game with 30 while shooting just 36% against the Boston Celtics in 2002. In the Top 100 for most field goals missed in a game, Kobe hold 25 of those spots, making for a quarter of the total. Kobe Bryant is NOT a clutch player. Kobe does have some great moments in the clutch, but individual moments do not mean he is a great clutch performer. Kobe Bryant missed the last 15 straight game-tying/go-ahead FG in final 5 seconds of 4th quarter/OT of his career, and his last game-winner was in March 2012. Kobe Bryant has a Field-Goal Percentage of 29.1%, over his career, on game-tying or go ahead shots in the last 24 seconds of a game, over his career, only making 48 out of 164 attempts Kobe Bryant has received multiple Undeserved All-Star Selections. Kobe Bryant has been selected to the All-Star Game in the years 2014 and 2016, for which he was undeserving. He received these on the basis of legacy, rather than on performance. His stats for these seasons were: In 2014, Kobe Bryant played a total of 6 games, where he averaged just 13.8 PPG, 4.3 RPG and 6.3 APG. In 2016, Kobe averaged 17.6 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 2.8 APG. Kobe has been gifted Multiple Championships by Referees. Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, whether knowingly or unknowingly, have been subject to some of the most blatantly rigged NBA Playoff games, in history. 2002 Western Conference Finals In Game 6, of a tight western conference finals against the Sacramento Kings, where the reigning champion Lakers were facing elimination, the Lakers received a ridiculous27 Free-Throws, in the fourth quarter, compared to the Kings’ 9. Watch the video below to see for yourself: 2010 NBA Finals In Game 7 of the NBA finals against the Boston Celtics, Kobe shot a disgusting 6 of 24 from the field. However, thanks to the 15 Free-Throwshanded to him by the referees, compared to the whole Boston Celtics team got 17 Free-Throws, Kobe won his 5th Ring. Watch the following video to see yourself: Now I am not saying Kobe is not a legend, I am simply saying that he is given much more credit than some of his more deserving contemporaries. He deserves to be compared to players like John Stocktonand Reggie Miller who are fantastic players, but NOT All-Time Greats like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  Tough question because most basketball experts do not overrate him. Most place him somewhere in the top 10–15. That’s about right. But most young basketball fans do overrate him. Many put him in the top 5. Those that do usually do not have strong knowledge of basketball history; usually overrate individual play; and usually overrate athleticism. Players that are definitely ahead of Kobe: Jordan, Magic Johnson, Jabbar, Russell, Chamberlain, Lebron James In my view, none of these are worth debating versus Kobe. Players that are probably ahead of Kobe: Duncan, O’Neal, Bird, Olajuwon, Robertson Players that are close and/or may finish their careers as close: West, Durant, Curry, Moses Malone So, in my view, Kobe is 12th at highest. Or somewhere in the 10–14 range. That’s still great. So what I say next does not diminish him but only puts him in context versus the other great players. Kobe Bryant is definitely the most selfish and least likable teammate of anyone on the list. (Chamberlain is close on the selfish front. Robertson is close on the least likable front). When I engage in these discussions with my fellow GMs, we set up the ground rule as who would I want on my team for 5 years. This is an important distinction because character/personality become increasingly important over time. Indeed, Kobe would likely be in the top ten if this was a single game or single series. Shaq is another guy that loses ground in this area. At his peak, he was crazy dominant but his laziness and selfishness are draining after a period of time. As a contrast, Duncan and Magic are rated higher than their athleticism might indicate because they are the ultimate team guys. But Kobe’s character deflates his teammates, unlike the majority of those ahead of him who elevate their teammates. Over time, team chemistry decreases. And, of course, losses or implosion occur. Is Kobe overrated by young NBA fans, yes.  "
"Kevin Durant is a better scorer, but Larry Bird is the *way* more well-rounded and complete player  Bird &gt; Durant, and it's not even close"
"Yes, which is fine, I just would like it if more people would acknowledge that.  The ""legacy"" thing is basically a circumstantial argument. Any number of things could change the amount of rings someone won, so it just results in empty greatness based on caricatures of actual achievement. Which is fine but people treat it like the gospel on how to judge player greatness as a whole.  Leads to things like Kevin Durant skipping out on the Thunder to go ring chasing because in the end all people will remember is the rings."
"More complete =/= better.  Khris Middleton is a more complete offensive player than Giannis, does that make him better? Kevin Durant is a more complete scorer than Michael Jordan, does that make him better?"
Ability wise you can make a very strong case for Kevin Durant to be top 10 alltime. However he will never get close to that legacy wise.
"This is why some analysts use relative true shooting alongside or even sometimes in place of TS to see what a player's impact on a team is.  basketball's a competitive sport so naturally the game will become more efficient over time, that's why it's important to examine these statistics within the context of the player's era.  Edit: I really like the summary [here, in the backpick's article on him](http://www.backpicks.com/2018/03/05/backpicks-goat-26-kevin-durant/), Durant's pretty much on par with the top scorers in NBA history, if you scroll down to the ""impact evaluation"" section, you can see some of the numbers that they bring up in comparison."
&gt; Kevin Durant is the best player on the best team in history.  Actually Durant wasn't there for 73-9
"&gt; The polar opposite of Ben Simmons who laughed when he was compared to Donovan Mitchell    Why would you even bring Ben into this? Donovan was the one that started that shit, and embarrassed himself when he hopped on that delusional ""Ben is not a Rookie"" bandwagon. Ben Simmons was the most hyped up rookie since LeBron, and he was and is still also compared to LeBron. So obviously he's supposed to have a high ego. He's supposed to laugh when being compared to another fellow rookie, Donovan Mitchell.  This is the NBA, not the Big 3 Friendly tournament.  If you can't handle shit, then don't start shit   &gt;  I love Ben even more because he straight laughed at that dumb shit.. He always knew that he's on another level, he always knew that he'd win the ROTY, and he always laughed at anyone who thought otherwise, laughed at anyone who kept on saying ""Ben is not a Rookie""..  You are supposed to laugh at any dumb reporter questions, and the haters. If you can't laugh at the haters, then it means you are getting insecure.. Look at Kevin Durant, for example  "

"i said great shooters can do things in suboptimal ways  you argued that Kevin Durant is one of the best shooters in the league, and he shoots across his face, using his left eye, so it can't be a negative  I mention that Reggie Miller's whole shooting form is, in a vacuum, pretty bad, but he managed to be the greatest shooter ever (until Steph and Ray) anyway  Point being, you can get away with any weird hitch or something if you practice enough. Whether or not Durant turned himself into one of the great shooters ever, it's still probably better to be one of the 90% of human beings who have the same eye and hand dominance, so you can keep the form as perfect (Klay-like) as possible"
"&gt;Two years ago after Kevin Durant didn't even take a meeting with the Lakers, if we would've said what you said in your last sentence this sub would've been calling us delusional.   Well yeah two years ago it was a different team. They had DLo / Sophmore Randle / Larry Nance, and limited roster flexibility. I'm not saying people will sign with LA regardless, but even before LBJ signed they had a solid roster with Kuz/Ing/Zo and tons of cap room.   I mean no need to be so aggressive, LA a solid team. I'm just saying I don't think Magic was the main engine behind the turnaround, a think a number of top GMs could replicate what he did with LA, but he did a good job seizing and actually betting on the opportunity and it's paid off"
"Two years ago after Kevin Durant didn't even take a meeting with the Lakers, if we would've said what you said in your last sentence this sub would've been calling us delusional.

"Jeremy Lin is such a stretch. Steph Curry is actually perfect for the bill. He went to a decent but not particularly notable basketball school, he flared up - well known, like Naruto because of having the fox, but nothing crazy and he took his time leaving his junior year (like how Naruto struggled at the academy. He was fairly injury prone early on in his career before finally breaking into his form with the arrival of his squad - Klay “Sasuke” Thompson,  Draymond “Sakura” Green, and trophied veteran Steve “Kakashi” Kerr.   Kerr is probably the biggest stretch, but one could argue his clutch and limited but impactful play during some of those Bulls runs were like his secret ANBU missions, and that by the end of Steph Curry’s saga he’ll quit being a coach to sign a one year vet min and ball out or something. Klay is another one that’s kind of hard because he hasn’t really betrayed yet, but I mean if someone was gonna leave and go power up real quick he’s probably the most likely. Green tho is pure Sakura. He beats the crap out of people, he’s got a sweet brolove for Klay, and he’s often the level headed leader providing a perfect support role.   Eventually Steph goes epic mode, two time MVP, but then he steps back to let other people get their arcs in and shit, spread the love. Eventually he’ll snap, average 16 3s a game, and unite the NBA in a giant war against Adam Silver’s best attempt at parity - cyborg replicas of the leagues best all time players.  Bonus: Steph makes some friends on the way and turns enemies into pals too, like Kevin “Gaara” Durant who thought he was alone in OKC. "
Kevin Durant - Box
"It was even worse that like an hour before he signed Yahoo accidentally posted an article saying Kevin Durant was signing with Boston, so this sub went from ""thank god it wasn't the Warriors"", to ""FUCK"" in the span of like 45 minutes. "
&gt; Kevin Durant (hissss) has won every playoff series since leaving the Thunder.   Of fucking course.
"""It doesn't matter because literally everything Kevin Durant does in his entire life doesn't count any more.""   – the fucking *obsessed* losers on this sub"
Does it make anyone else smile internally that a major athlete like Kevin Durant loves music by queer artists like Frank Ocean and Blood Orange wherein they talk about sexuality and love among other things?
Kevin Durant and the Silver Snakes.
He had Kevin Durant
It is. That’s why Kevin Durant made the best decision.
yeah that makes no sense kevin durant idolizes kobe and i fucking hate kd
Kevin Durant and the Arizona Diamondbacks.
"It’ll be easier for you to get into 2019 basketball and as the season starts, let the details come in. I’ll give u a quick rundown of who’s who in the NBA and a brief backstory.   Lebron James: One of the best if not the best conditioned players in the NBA, never gets injured and is on a 7/8 year streak of going to the finals.  Stephen Curry: Revolutionized the game by shooting three point shots at a high ass rate, extremely popular with the kids because u can relate to him being short and not a super athlete.  Kevin Durant: great player for the warriors who Steph also plays for, he left his hometown team to join them after they beat him in the playoffs after they got the best regular season record of all time.  Demarcus Cousins: another stud who joined the warriors this year. He got traded from his hometown team 2 years ago, went to a franchise with another top 3 big man and they did pretty okay. He tore his Achilles and took a large large large paycut to play for the warriors for one season so he could rehab appropriately and get a ring.  Kyrie Irving: used to play with Lebron, requested a trade to lead his own franchise, got traded to the Celtics for their star player. Has one of the best handles of all time, Celtics have great coach and would be clear favorites if the warriors weren’t at an all time level.  James Harden and Russell Westbrook: Triple double machines, they have taken the last 2 MVPs and a lot of people are now questioning the significance of getting at least 10 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in one game. Top tier players Kawhi Leonard: forced a trade out of his hometown team but didn’t say anything about anything to anyone and this made people mad, plays for now top 3 team in the east The 76ers: controversial team because they have young stars this season and they purposely lost games to make sure they got good young players. Fun team to watch though.  No bias here tho: watch the Celtics for a fun ride tho  There’s ur players who I think will be important to the storyline for the nba season"
"Kevin Durant is an incandescent scorer and will most definitely end his career as one of the best to ever put the rock through the hoop.  What he is not is better than LeBron James.  KD benefits more from    Man I'm not even gonna finish this comment, this post is hard bait "
&gt; want Kevin Durant to be an analyst so he can get roasted for the whole half-time show.  he will quit 10 mins in the first episode
Kevin Durant is a top 3 player and one of the most dynamic scorers in nba history there are very few things that he can’t do 
The TNT crew is the exact reason why I want Kevin Durant to be an analyst so he can get roasted for the whole half-time show. I wonder who'd be doing the roasting lol
Kevin Durant
pretty sure the Suns plan is making a run at Kevin Durant next year since Kevin Durant loves Booker and has gone on record saying he loves Phoenix
Are these only allowed to be on the court?  Because Celtics off-court would be Len Bias dying.  Or Reggie Lewis dying. Honorable mention: Missing out on Tim Duncan and Kevin Durant.
"But that's exactly why people prefer Payton/Kemp to Westbrook/Durant!   Kemp was one of the greatest dunkers of all time. Durant gets 3s off the fast break, and his dunks just don't look that impressive given his length and lack of strength. Yes they probably generate more points, but Payton/Kemp certainly were more exciting.   The most exciting thing I can imagine on a Westbrook/Durant fast break is Westbrook flying to the rim and throwing it down hard, and he doesn't need Kevin Durant to do that. "
"Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Zaza Pachulia, Blake Griffin, Jamal Murray, Willie Caley-Stein"
"James Harden, Demarcus Cousins, Draymond Green, Russel Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, Chris Paul.  I'm sure these guys are fine dudes, but on the basketball court, I loathe them.  Dudes love to whine, or play for the foul.  I swear they play the refs more than they play basketball."
"Kevin Durant,  demarcus cousins.  No explanation needed"
"Lol you’re a freakin dork... teams do everything in their power to compete; and players are supposed to do everything in their power to compete as well. Saying, oh well, guess I’ll just go to the already dominant team that I lost by the skin of my teeth to, is uhh unsurprisingly looked down upon.   You didn’t make any real arguments besides “players and teams have different standards” and yea, they do. Now that you understand that you understand why kevin Durant is mocked but the warriors aren’t. "
"People obsessed with Kevin Durant responding, again."
"If he's taking like 25 FGA per game to reach that number of PPG, he's nothing special. If Booker wants to be a superstar, he's gotta improve his defense and increase his efficiency to Kevin Durant levels (above 60% TS)."
In the immortal words of Kevin Durant: don't worry about what goes on at the top
Give me Kevin Durant. 
All-time: Kobe  2018/19: Kevin Durant
"I’m not saying I agree with KD’s decision more, I am saying that, at the time, people were saying that LeBron was soft and that he was a villain, which is similar to what people say about Kevin Durant now. I just think that we shouldn’t hate on these guys for doing what’s allowed in free agency. There’s nothing in the rule book against joining an established team. "
"A bit of Boston bias but:  Scary Terry  Jayson “he boomed me” Tatum  Kevin “The Snake” Durant  Steve “electrical infetterence” Blake  Lebron “Le” James  Isaiah “midget” Thomas  Eric “Drew” Bledsoe  Lonzo “BBB” Ball  Brian “White Mamba” Scalabrine  Ty “step over me while a ring falls out of my fish face” Lue  Shoutouts to my favorite team memes: CUSCRISE, Bucks in 6, and Memphis having no chance at winning the championship. "
Not in order yet but:  - Klay Thompson  - JR Smith  - Joe Ingles  - Kyle Singler  - Nick Young  - Javale McGee  - Kevin Durant  - Lance Stephenson  - LeBron James  - Brian Scalabrine  .   I will be editing this list as the comments come.
"&gt; The one thing I would say about those teams; however, is that Jordan was always the man. Pippen was a supporting star, but when crunch time came, no one was looking for Pippen to carry the load. Rodman certainly wasn't either. Jordan had a very strong supporting cast, but he still had to be the man for that team to win titles. That wasn't the case in Miami.  Disagree wholeheartedly. LeBron won Finals MVP both of those years and with the exception of maybe 2010-11, he was very clearly the man on those Miami teams. You can see Wade's numbers decline over that period while they were arguably the best years of LeBron's career. Wade was amazing in his first Finals win but when the Heatles won their titles it was LeBron that carried the load and both the numbers and the optics support that  &gt;For Jordan, you could have probably replaced him with Malone, Olajuwon and Shaq, and seen the Bulls win the title. Probably Gary Payton and David Robinson would get there, and maybe Barkley or Oakley.   Oakley?!  &gt;Durant, Howard, Kobe, Chris Paul, Kevin Love, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett, Westbrook, Tim Duncan, and maybe a Tony Parker, Derrick Rose or one of the Gasol brothers  There is no chance with Love, an old Garnett, Parker, Rose or the Gasols over LeBron. There is a chasm between LeBron and those players. LeBron was not sweeping the finals every year. One of them took seven games and they lost twice.  &gt;How good does a team with Bosh, Wade and Marc Gasol look in comparison to a Bulls team with Pippen, Rodman and Charles Barkey. Both teams are pretty good, but I think that Heat team is much more championship caliber.  Rodman and Barkley kind of overlap in their strong points but on talent I will take the Barkley/Pippen/Rodman team 10 times out of 10. IMO Bosh was only a HOF caliber player when he was playing on average to bad teams in Toronto. In general he's an all-star. And I think Barkley was more valuable than any of those guys. I honestly feel like I would say Barkley &gt;= Wade, Pippen &gt; Bosh and Rodman &gt; Gasol and the only one I think is really arguable is Barkley v. Wade  &gt;Also, don't downplay Ray Allen's contribution. It wasn't LeBron who saved the Heat with the buzzer beating 3 in game 6 against the Spurs. That was a series-saving shot.  Alright, then I guess we can start talking about where Jordan would be without John Paxson. Allen's shot was huge but it's still one shot and doesn't change the fact that he was a role player and his overall contributions reflected it  Anyway, I think we're getting off track here. I'm not trying to have a LeBron vs. Michael GOAT debate because honestly I don't have a strong opinion on it.   I agree that the Bulls did a better job of retaining their roster (and retained their coach as well while the Cavs moved on to Scott) but we're still talking about dropping 2 wins vs. dropping 42. Even the Heat dropped 17 games when he left and they at least attempted to backfill his talent with guys like Whiteside and Dragic. LeBron's supporting cast at the end of his first Cleveland stint was just bad. "
"hmmm, probably because I watched literally every game.   But how about letting [Kevin Durant say it?](https://newsok.com/article/3809699/okc-thunder-kevin-durant-says-thunder-misses-russell-westbrook)   you think Westbrook didn't lead OKC in 2013?! they had the 1 seed locked up that year....you think he didn't lead them in 2016? when the narrative formed that with Durant out, it was clearly Russ's team, even after KD came back?   di....did you watch Thunder basketball? The 2010 series against the Lakers? the 2012 playoffs? Every single game the tone is set by Westbrook. Westbrook IS the Thunder. Holy shit man. "
"&gt;The eastern conference was horrible during that period. Their primary competitor was Howard's Orlando Magic, who actually knocked them out  Actually, they lost to the Celtics, in 6 games, in the Conference semis. Orlando then lost to the Celtics also, in the Conference finals. Sure, the Leastern Conference wasn't particularly strong that year, but East hasn't been strong in ages, so that's nothing new.  &gt;The team was not built to support LeBron at all. It was a patchwork team of overpaid players that were the best pieces available to try and keep LeBron from leaving in free agency.  You talk down about the team pretty hard, but they did win 61 games that year, and was mostly the same team that won 66 games the year before that. You talk like LeBron was just playing with a bunch of random scrubs, but LeBron only topped 60 games one time in his career since, despite having two superstars next to him every season, except this past one. You can talk down his supporting cast because they don't have the name recognition, but for those last two years in the first Cavs stint, the team was damn good.  Also, I forgot to mention him before, but Antawn Jamison was also a pretty damn good player, too.  &gt;That's arguable, too. They were both flanked by two HOFers and a ton of quality role players. Ray Allen was amazing in his prime but he was a role player at that point in his career.  The supporting cast of Michael vs Miami LeBron is debatable, for sure, at least in Mike's post-baseball years. But, it should be pointed out that Michael only had one HOF'er in his pre-baseball era (Pippen). Rodman didn't join until after Mike had already won three titles. Those Bulls teams pre-baseball era were mostly Jordan, Pippen and role players, like Horace Grant and BJ Armstrong.  In the post-baseball era, with Rodman, Kukoc and Kerr, there is an argument on supporting cast. The one thing I would say about those teams; however, is that Jordan was always the man. Pippen was a supporting star, but when crunch time came, no one was looking for Pippen to carry the load. Rodman certainly wasn't either. Jordan had a very strong supporting cast, but he still had to be the man for that team to win titles. That wasn't the case in Miami. Wade won a championship as the crunch time guy for the Heat pre-LeBron, and was often the crunch time guy even when LeBron was around. He was the finals MVP for that pre-LeBron title. Pippen was one of the best supporting stars, if not the best, in the history of the league, but he could not carry a team the way Wade could.  The way I would look at is this, in comparing the teams: If you took those rosters and replaced Jordan or LeBron, how many stars could you have put in that slot and still had a championship team. For Jordan, you could have probably replaced him with Malone, Olajuwon and Shaq, and seen the Bulls win the title. Probably Gary Payton and David Robinson would get there, and maybe Barkley or Oakley. would have also fit. For LeBron, however, I think if you put Wade and Bosh next to any of the following players, you have a championship team: Durant, Howard, Kobe, Chris Paul, Kevin Love, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett, Westbrook, Tim Duncan, and maybe a Tony Parker, Derrick Rose or one of the Gasol brothers. How good does a team with Bosh, Wade and Marc Gasol look in comparison to a Bulls team with Pippen, Rodman and Charles Barkey. Both teams are pretty good, but I think that Heat team is much more championship caliber.  Also, don't downplay Ray Allen's contribution. It wasn't LeBron who saved the Heat with the buzzer beating 3 in game 6 against the Spurs. That was a series-saving shot. He wasn't HOF Ray Allen, but he was still one of the most dangerous three point shooters of all time, even at that stage of his career, and LeBron owes that title to him.  &gt;I agree about Dirk, but he's the exception, not the rule. If you're having a GOAT conversation, Michael Jordan didn't do what Dirk did either.  Michael didn't. He always had at least Pippen alongside him. Even his worst supporting cast was better than Dirk's. Dirk gets serious props for that run.  In the GOAT argument between LeBron and Mike, however, the important part, to me, is that Mike just won every single year. The last 6 years he played with the Bulls, he won the title every single year. When he had a great supporting cast (those last three Bulls seasons, in particular), he just didn't lose. LeBron, however, has had undoubtedly great supporting casts for at least 7 of the last 8 seasons (with the exception season being this past one after losing Kyrie). During those seasons he has 3 titles. In his four Heat seasons with Bosh and Wade, he only had two titles, and one was by the skin of his teeth, after the aforementioned Ray Allen miracle 3. He lost to Dirk plus randoms in 6 games, and got pounded by the Spurs in 5.  Now, don't get me wrong, LeBron's last 8 years have been very impressive, but the bar is reeeeeeeeeally high when you are arguing for GOAT. Michael never took a garbage team to a title like Dirk did, but every time he had a good supporting cast he won a title, and it was usually in a dominant fashion. LeBron is awesome, but just hasn't been able to win the way Mike did, even with handpicked great supporting casts. That is why Mike edges him for GOAT, unless LeBron does something great in LA.  &gt;When MJ left Chicago they won 55 games the following year. When LeBron left Cleveland they won 19. All of the other teams you've described here were better than the supporting cast on that Cleveland team. It was bad.  Granted Cleveland was bad without LeBron, after he left, but the Bulls and Cavs are not direct comparisons. The Bulls tried to remain a top tier team, and added players like Kukoc and Steve Kerr, while retaining their other top supporting players like Horace Grant and BJ Armstrong. Pippen was a credible center piece to try to win with. Cleveland was build around one credible center piece. They had good role players, but no one to build  a team around. In addition to losing LeBron, Z left and Shaq left. They didn't add any noteworthy new players, like the Bulls did.  No one can, or should, argue that LeBron's supporting cast with the Cavs, in his first stint, was as good as Mike's supporting cast, even in his pre-baseball era (before Rodman, Kukoc, Steve Kerr, etc). But, there wasn't nearly as much of a discrepancy between the two as the post-LeBron, post-Mike stats suggest, because it ignores other roster moves."
First LeBron James. Then Peyton Manning. Then Kevin Durant. Now Kyle Singler.  GOAT tier players hitting unrestricted free agency and forming superteams. Who's the lucky franchise gonna be this time? A billion dollar asset is about to walk in someone's door and bless them with multiple championship game appearances.
Like LeBron or Kobe.... Or Kevin Durant who actually did it. 
Portland for passing on Kevin Durant 
For the lazy:   Blake Griffin (22.5)  Carmelo Anthony (21.0)  LeBron James (20.9)  Donovan Mitchell (20.5)  Kevin Durant (20.3)  Joel Embiid (20.2)  Tyreke Evans (20.1)
"It's ok, Kevin Durant, I'm betting most of us in here still would."
This is not Kevin Durant.   I would still drink it  This is definitely not Kevin Durant. 
"Sue ""not Kevin Durant"" Bird"
"I don't understand why people hold something that's said like 6 years ago.   Things change, and people change.   Kevin Durant might no longer want to drink Scarlett johenson's bath water anymore "
"KD as a matter-of-fact joined a team that won 73 games in the regular season, the greatest regular season record. He also joined the first ever league unanimous MVP, which is also a fact. He joined 2 other All-Stars in Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, which is also a fact.  That team 'choked' because of various factors with Draymond's suspension but also LeBron and Kyrie going supernova was a huge deal. I cannot stress how great LeBron was in that Finals, and Kyrie matched him stride for stride offensively the whole way.  The Cavs regressed after that Finals (back to the mean I should say because Cavs Game 5-7 was not their normal standard), however Warriors won the Finals just the year before. Durant didn't give them a 'killer instinct', he just skewed the odds to where even one or two of their All Stars shying away meant they could win.  You ask yourself, who will win the NBA Finals this year? If the answer isn't Warriors, you're lying to yourself. It's a foregone conclusion and I don't think the NBA has been that in a long time. I'm sorry, but some team being able to line up with 5 All-NBA players is a bit fucking sad and dismal as a fan of another team, no matter the circumstances.  Warriors with Curry, Barnes, Draymond, and Klay were an organic beast who you cannot begrudge their success to; you still can't begrudge the Warriors, but I sure as hell can begrudge Kevin Durant's success. Just because he's the best player on an already stacked team doesn't say much - we've always known his immense talent. It's just, how is it a challenge when if you have an off-night you have Stephen motherfucking Curry as your second option..."
Ah yes who can forget the hidden gem of a free agent Kevin danger noodle Durant.
Kevin Durant is in talks about joining Duke next season.
"Sounds like ur still salty after getting sent home by Al Horford and schoolchildren lmao.   Marcus Smart is better than some of ur starters so idk why you are acting like that’s a fair comparison.   And yes, Middleton’s performance was absolutely an outlier. He’s not Kevin Durant.   Bledsoe isn’t very good anymore.   “I don’t give a shit what ur regular season record against .500 teams was”   Hahahaha of fucking course you don’t because it doesn’t support ur retarded narrative. "
"LeBron took a 15% pay cut over the course of his deal, just because he used the ETO we ignore that. He was eligible for nearly 17 million dollars, and took 14.5. It's a pittance now, but the cap was 58 million when the Heat formed. That's 4% of the cap.   In 2010 - 2011 the West had 12 of the 20 best teams in the league. The standings were Bulls, Spurs, Heat, Mavs, Lakers, Celtics, Thunder. This probably the best East season of most of LeBron's career. Maybe the 08 - 09 season, which is the top heavy season I think you're referencing. The 09 - 10 season had 7 of the top 10 teams from the West, and 12 of the top 20. 2011 - 12 was a bit more even, but also a lockout year which generally hurts older teams. 12 - 13 had 5 of the top 6 come from the West. 13 - 14 had 8 of the top 10 come from the West. The East is a joke, and the Heat made it worse, with 3 of the best players in the East joining 1 team well all taking a discount.  Except a bunch of older players refuse discounts constantly. Kobe made like 30 million to end out his career, Pau is over payed currently at 37, Nash was making 9+ as a broken down near 40 year old, Dwight was making too much for what he is now, Chris Paul is an older guy who just signed a massive extension, Parker and Manu were both making more than they were worth last year, Paul Millsap and Horford are going to be over payed at the end of their respective deals. Outside of Dirk, and Duncan I can't really think of too many old stars who are worth a bit more, that are not making bank. I agree that discounts hurt the negotiating power of the players, but the players are generally short sighted and screw themselves just as much.  Mike Miller isn't the issue more just a symptom. LeBron struggled to get out of a historically weak conference. He runs over the trash out East, and plays a tough series here or there, and it seems pretty intentional on his part, especially with how Miami formed. He's played with 4 HoF level guys in their primes, knock on wood for Kyrie's knees. Jordan got 1 HoF guy in his prime, whose equal to Wade imo, and the tail end of Rodman. People remember that 96 team, but completely forget how injured and inconsistent Rodman and Pippen were in 97 and 98.  My issue isn't that I think it's unfair that LeBron made a free agency choice, and took a discount. It's not to prop Jordan up by trying to say he didn't have great teammates. It's the fact that I hear people talk about LeBron losing in the Finals being better than not making the Finals at all. I think LeBron's legacy has a massive competition issue when you stack it up against what Jordan had to face. I feel like LeBron had way more help over the course of his career, well playing in the much weaker conference comparatively. I also feel like LeBron was good enough to carry a team on his own without another top 5 player in Wade, he's shown that he was when his teammates got injured. The Heatles taking a discount to add even more help rubs me the wrong way because they were easily the most talented team ever assembled, at least since 76, up until the Warriors came along. They had 2 guys coming off top 3 seasons, and Bosh, at worst a top 15 player, whose one of the most underrated players of his generation because he played for the Raptors at a time when everything around him was trash.   Ya it fucking bugs me that it's hand waved as ""Well the Cavs were bad, so it's ok"" as we see massive backlash on Durant, whose literally following in LeBron's footsteps. The fact that LeBron saw the Celtics trade for 3 guys in there early 30's, and said you know what fuck all of this I'm going to assemble a fifth of the US Olympic basketball team to dominate my shitty conference is trash, and no one else seems to give a fuck as they meme at Durant.  I can't wait for this season to watch all of the is LeBron finally aging takes that are going to happen. It's going to go one of two ways, and I'm excited for either LeBron showing his conference never mattered, or all of the young guys being lambasted for not being good enough ala Kevin Love.  TLDR: Everyone sucks LeBron's dick, because he's really good, and ignore anything that should be a detriment to his legacy because he's our generational player."
I hope ring chasing dies after Kevin Durant killed it
"It's about one supporting the other.  Generally, NBA players are good enough to pull their own weight and/or punch above it needed, especially nowadays even more so. If you take a volume shooter that takes 25 FGA off a team, those 25 FGA will simply be distributed among other players depending on their role. And if 5 players each get 5 FGA in that case, and they cumulatively convert at a 62%TS clip, then that's better than the volume scorer taking 25 FGA by himself and converting at a 57%TS.   Of course, there's other things to account in the overall scope of the offense, like how the volume shooter can suck defensive pressure on himself, thus making life easier for his teammates both on offense and defense. But there are a lot of advantages in having a diverse, multi-threat offense as well, with good shot distribution and ball movement, ask Golden State or San Antonio about it. In fact, if we look at the best offenses of all-time historically, most of them are predicated on volume playmaking, ball-movement and multiple threats, not a guy putting up 35-40 ppg on above average effiency while everyone else does jack all.   Personally, I don't see the difference between a guy putting up 27 ppg on 65%TS or a guy putting up 32 ppg on 60%TS. If i'm trying to build a historically good offense, i'll take the more efficient guy every single time because it's more likely than not that he doesn't freeze or stifle his own team's flow for individual numbers to some degree.  You think that guys like Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James couldn't average over 35 ppg if they wanted to? Their efficiency won't suffer much, these guys know how to score. I mean, LeBron just had back-to-back playoff runs where he averaged 33 ppg on 63%TS. But does that really make their team better? "
Imagine putting Kevin Durant in the same conversation as Lance Armstrong and Barry Bonds. 
"I get what you're saying too though. That season, you'd take GSW in any head to head matchup. I guess my stance is that 3-1 is such a rock solid lead that even an underdog should be able to nab one of three. You're in the Western Conference Finals for a reason. I also have no problem with someone saying that a team that won 73 games during the season is perfectly capable of winning three straight even against a team featuring Kevin Durant."
"If Kevin Durant is juicing, then he’s doing it wrong."
"Oh, poor guy Kevin Durant! It must be so hard for him, playing for (likely) the best team ever and on his way to a three-peat!  That media dude is really biased towards him /s"
😂😂😂 2016 you talking about the rigged series in which Draymond Green got suspended game 5 when the series was 3-1 by a situation lebron instigated??? Please.. you guys try to hard to create these narratives to help your king. The truth is in the last 2 years Kevin Durant is 8-1 in the Finals thats 2 Rings 2 Finals MvPs.   The same MEDIA that said Lebron should not win another MVP as long as he is on the Miami Heat because the roster was too deep playing along with 2 fellow all-stars. And still gave him the League MVP..  The media has proven that time heals all wounds and ya will get over Durant going to the Warriors. What you need to do is get over what happened 3 years ago and live in the present. Lebron is technically on his 4th team. 
Kevin Durant*          ^*🐍
"Best part is Raptors and Celtics fans complaining about Kevin Durant ruining the NBA. I mean I could see them making a case now that Lebron is gone, but when he was running the east with 2 other all stars(on two different teams lol) you saw some Stockholm syndrome shit from them when they rooted for him over the Warriors.   Lebron was to the east what Warriors are to the entire NBA now. The difference is there was always a different team coming through the west and beating Lebron in the finals and showing everyone just how much of a cakewalk the east was for Lebron. People will always talk about Warriors going 12-0 through the West in 2017, but Lebron went 12-1 the same year in the East.   KD obviously chased his rings much harder than Lebron, but principally, they both did the same thing by stacking the deck in their favor."
Austin Rivers as Ziggy.   Tim Duncan as Lester.   Latrell Sprewell as Cheese.   Kevin Durant as Carcetti.   Metta World Peace as Cutty.   Danny Ainge as Prop Joe.  Mike Dunleavy Jr. as Kenard (because fuck Kenard).  Every referee as Butchie. 
Kevin Durant already an all time great. Joined an all time great team in Warriors. A team that doesn't need him to compete for championship every year.
Ben Simmons Lebron James Kevin Durant Draymond Green Anthony Davis  
"Bro, Kevin Durant is like the one dude at your local gym that is way too good to be there. Dude knows how to score and if you aren't a fan of him, he hurts your heart 10 times a game. "
Lebron left a team that brought him Mo Williams as his best player...Kevin Durant left a team that was raking in young superstars. Also Lebron didn’t join the team that he lost a 3-1 too 
You're pretty crazy if you take Damian Lillard over Kevin Durant or Giannis for your franchise. I can kind of understand Westbrook... But everyone else? Not a chance in hell. 
Only four players have done this and also had 100+ 3 pointers made in a single season:  Rasheed Wallace (2002)  Shawn Marion (2005)  Kevin Durant (2013)  Draymond Green (2016)
"You want discussion? Okay.  Kevin Durant displayed the opposite of competitive spirit by joining the team that beat him. His move effectively killed any semblance of competitive balance as the Warriors’ (arguably) biggest challenger was effectively eliminated. Moreover, his actions since have done nothing but indicate that he knows exactly why people don’t respect what he did, and every tweet / comment from him actually perpetuates the feelings of disdain."
Kevin Durant tried to win a title for 9 years for the OKC franchise and they didn’t put it together. They both bailed to win championships.
"Yes.  And his mind would finally come back to him.  Come back, KD, I know you are reading this.  Come back to the backpacks and your van.  Remember how free you were driving this and not giving a fuck what people think.  https://bustedcoverage.com/2018/04/23/buy-this-custom-2008-gmc-savana-formerly-owned-by-kevin-durant-photos/"
"*A story from Kobe's PT during the summer of the Olympics:*  A few days later Kobe called him at 4:15 a.m., and asked him to come to the gym. They worked out for 75 minutes, and the trainer went back to his hotel to sleep before the next day's 11 a.m. scrimmage.  That's when things got crazy, from the trainer:  ""This next part I remember very vividly. All the Team USA players were there, feeling good for the first scrimmage. LeBron was talking to Carmelo if I remember correctly and Coach Krzyzewski was trying to explain something to Kevin Durant. On the right side of the practice facility was Kobe by himself shooting jumpers. And this is how our next conversation went -- I went over to him, patted him on the back and said, 'Good work this morning.'""  'Huh?'   'Like, the conditioning. Good work.'  'Oh. Yeah, thanks Rob. I really appreciate it.'  'So when did you finish?'  'Finish what?'  'Getting your shots up. What time did you leave the facility?'   'Oh just now. I wanted 800 makes so yeah, just now.'  In effect, Kobe showed up seven hours early for an offseason scrimmage."
"you're coming on to this here internet, logging on, and then trying to tell us that Damian Lillard is more skilled and a better basketball player (whatever the difference between those two is is surely pedantic) than Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook AND Giannis Antetokounmpo? ok then "
I don't think you understand how this works. I think you need some time to really really think things through.  You take LeBron off the 2010-11 Heat team and replace him with nobody.  You take Kevin Durant off the 2016-17 Warriors team and replace him with a max player and a starting center to get the 2015-16 Warriors.  I hope you've caught up. I don't have experience in teaching.
&gt; 2nd best player in the game which he wasn't before he joined   He was considered 2nd best since 2012 lmao. Relevant flair  &gt;  He was barely talked about for 2 years.  are you actually saying Kevin Durant was barely talked about? lol wtf
Kevin Durant dropped 30 on 65 TS and they lost. I can also pick out individual series.
What about this is not true.  Kevin Durant exercising his right as a free agent doesn't warrant an asterisk next to his name. He did not violate a league rule. He did not take a banned substance that enhanced his performance on the court. The use of asterisk is way out of bounds in this context.
"""Lebron is so good that we were a 73 win team and still needed Kevin Durant to beat him."""
Kevin Durant also botched a blowout dunk in the first half and the Raptors went on to outscore his team by 25 in the second half. (They still lost because they were facing the goddamn Warriors lol.)
"Ignoring the fact that it's Ben Taylor.  This was a long read and albeit interesting at points nothing it's not that crazy. It's the same top names at the peak and if you value longevity you favor Kareem and if you value peak you favor MJ or Bron.   This list gets really interesting in the 5-15 range as it's surprising to see Magic Johnson and Larry Bird below Kevin Garnett. However with a bit of thought in the methodology being more cumulative you can imagine how Bird and Johnson get hurt from shorter careers. Bird not starting until 23 and Magic getting HIV.  This is kind of where these whole longevity vs peak things raise hairs. Reggie Miller is kind of the prime example that get's called out a lot. Right now on this list he ranks ahead of Durant by two spots, granted Duran'ts career is not over. However if Durant didn't play a single game ever again I'm never saying Reggie Miller is the better player. If Durant got some catastrophic injury and his next 5 years he played at the level of Kyle Singler, I'm still not saying Reggie Miller is better.   But in the end it's a statistical model that seems to favor longevity a bit more than most casual when discussing. More of who had the best cumulative career in my eyes than who is the best player. "
PG-Ben Simmons SG- Devin Booker SF-Kevin Durant PF- Giannis Antetokumpo C-Anthony Davis. 
Melooooo lmao  As a side some of my favorite photos of Thunder players are at away games with a yellow/gold crowd during the playoffs. The contrast of the blue and gold is very pleasing. 2016 Warriors series comes to mind.   [example](https://www.slamonline.com/archives/russell-westbrook-kevin-durant-havent-talked/) 
"PG - Ben Simmons, Damian Lillard  SG - Luka Doncic :-) (though the safe answer is Harden)  SF - Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant  PF - Kristaps Porzingis, Anthony Davis  C - Nikola Jokic"
PG: Ben Simmons  SG: James Harden  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Giannis Antetokounpo  C: Anthony Davis
Can he bench more than Kevin Durant?
"I dunno, Kevin Durant would be a pretty fucking good second choice"
"It quite honestly blows my mind that people have been fooled into believing there's no gap, or that it's even close at all, simply because he joined Golden State. If he hadn't, this wouldn't even be a talking point.   In 15-16, KD played 18 playoff games to the tune of 28-7-3, more turnovers than assists, 54 TS%, blew a 3-1 series lead to the team LeBron eventually beats.   Then joins them, his playoff TS% MAGICALLY jumps up *fourteen* points to 68%, hits a dagger over LeBron, wins the title and suddenly ""there's no gap between them.""   Is this really what we choose to believe? That because Kevin Durant is surrounded by the greatest accumulation of talent we've ever seen on one NBA team, that there's no gap between them? Immediately after watching LeBron drag flotsam to the Finals to make it 8 straight, on 34-9-9, elite efficiency? People constantly vaunt Kobe for averaging 35 in the regular season, LeBron did 34 on 61 TS% in four playoff series. Hello? Puts up 51-8-8 in game 1 as KD shoots 8-22, only to still lose in OT?   But no, because KD scores the ball so well in *single coverage* and makes super duper *pressure-filled* clutch shots over *trash defense* LeBron, there's no gap.   Yup. That's where we're at.   I'll be over here with 'this sub'...there's a significant gap, and it's frankly pretty clear to see.  "
"If this is really the case, then the rest of their players are vastly overrated.  Kevin Durant should not even be rated as a top 5 player if he can't get that team even without Curry to be a good offense."
Nobody makes scoring look more effortless than the current Kevin Durant.  
Media will build a rift like they did with Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.  Media continues to believe they didn't get along. KDs burner account even defended Russ and called the rest of the teammates trash.
Over Kevin Durant?
"Do you mind taking this completely reasonable take somewhere else? Waiting and ""running the course"" isn't as sexy as Kevin Durant! Cheers from Iraq."
How likely do you see Kevin Durant leaving GS after this year? 1-100?  What if they win/what if they don't win; does that change his view? 
"who do i want playing defense on james harden? draymond green or boogie cousins?  who do i want with the ball in his hands more? kevin durant or boogie cousins?  boogie does not help the warriors against us. he'll hurt their defense and any shot he's taking that kd or curry isn't is better for us.  it's not about talent, it's about match-ups. so how about you stop being insulting and start thinking about how the game will actually work."
Well I’m pretty sure Lakers fans themselves aren’t writing the articles. They just post them.  Also it’s ironic you have a problem with insecurity when you cheer for a team with Kevin Durant on it.
LeBron is a better scorer than Kevin Durant. He's so underrated in that aspect. If Im going to be honest he's the best scorer of all time.
Kevin Durant 
"Yeah but Kevin Durant has won two rings with Steph Curry, LeBron has won 0 rings with Steph Curry"
Kevin Durant is better than Lebron James. 
"Many individual players sure, but in recent history I don't think there's been a single dominant team that didn't have at least one superstar/max player taking paycuts (or not being paid what they're actually worth due to other circumstances in the case of Steph and Klay)  Pippen - max player, wasn't on a max.  Tim Duncan - max player, wasn't on a max.  Kevin Durant - max player, wasn't on a max.  LeBron James - max player, wasn't on a max.  To a lesser extent:  Steph Curry - max player, wasn't on a max  Klay Thompson - max player, wasn't on a max.  This covers every single team that has won multiple rings since the 90s except the Lakers and the only reason I didn't list them is because I am not aware of their contract situation in 00-02 and 09-10. Wouldn't be surprised if Kobe and Pau were taking paycuts respectively."
"I've always thought a Dirk comp was fair. She's a great defensive rebounder, and incredibly efficient scoring the ball (22 ppg on 50/40/80). She's a better point forward than Dirk is, but assist wise they both average around 3 apg. She's a better defensive player than Dirk, but she isn't a DPOY candidate. I'd say she's an 8/10 defender, while prime Dirk was 6/10. Maybe 7/10 during his 1.5 bpg and 1.5 spg season.   I'd say Dirk or Kevin Durant are decent comparisons. She isn't quite the pure scorer Durant is, and has a slightly more faceted game offensively, which leads me to Dirk.   EDIT: Maybe a Chris Bosh with better range and vision? "
"&gt; Are there players that you suggest I keep my eye on? Up-and-comers?   **best dudes in the league/most fun to watch:** pretty much anyone who's been on the all nba / all star team. Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook are considered the best (in no order).  ""**Up-and-comers"":** Ben Simmons, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Nikola Jokic, Karl Anthony Towns, Devin Booker. Luka Doncic is this upcoming year's hyped rookie."
"kevin durant could never make another cent, live to be 10,000 years old, and still be living comfortably. "
"""kevin durant is a better scorer than lebron james because he is better on the warriors than harrison barnes was xD :3"""
Besides the Heat’s Big 3 only Kevin Durant has taken a paycut to help their superteam
"&gt; Well of course it runs smoother with Steph in. The offense was designed around Steph after all. But Durant's ""selfish offense ruining play style"" is what saved them the series by snagging game 1.  when KD's ISO's go in, then yeah, but you could also argue his clogging up of the offense with ISO's cost them in games 2,4 and 5.   Plus, the ""the offense was designed around Steph after all"" argument is such a cop-out. Essentially whats the point of even having this discussion when you're saying that when Steph makes the offense better, it's because of the way the team is built. When KD makes the offense better, it's because he's the better player. See what I mean? It's such a cop-out argument   &gt;  They were up 10 already with him playing very poorly the other 75% of the game. Curry basically ran up the score rather than closed it out.  lol that's kinda disingenuous. Steph was cooking the entire first half. Plus, the Steph didn't run up the score, the score was run up because steph closed out an inferior team in the finals  &gt; This might apply if the Cavs also didn't double players like Durant, Lowry, Derozan, Rozier, Oladipo, etc. the same way they did to Steph  but they didn't double players like they did Steph. They allowed George Hill to ISO KD on the block bc they'd rather match up KD and a guard than see Steph go to work on Kevin Love or Lebron. Even in KD's go-ahead 3 in game 3, they switched that screen, they didn't double. If that was steph, they're trapping and forcing the ball out of his hands (bc that's exactly what they did to steph all game, series)  &gt; First I just want to point out that Steph had worse on/off numbers than Durant this postseason, including the Finals. That being said, on/off stats are one of the worst ways to compare how a player impacts the game. On/off stats ignore lineups, rotations, the opposing teams lineups, garbage time, etc. They painted the Spurs defense as 8 points better when Kawhi was off the court in 2017 for example. That doesn't mean Kawhi is an overrated defender and was bringing the Spurs defense down.  I wasn't even talking on/off, i was pointing out how much more efficient Steph's teammates shoot when he's on the court vs when he's off bc he gets them open looks. KD doesn't have that same effect, so Steph makes KD better than KD makes Steph. The skills that put a microscope onto every great thing KD can do puts Steph's skillset under a blurry lens.  &gt; And speaking of elevating people's games, look at how much better Steph played against the Cavs post adding KD versus pre having KD. His efficiency goes through the roof, because KD draws a ton of attention away from Steph and helps him get easier baskets. Durant still scores most of his baskets when tightly guarded and unassisted, while Steph shoots a ton of wide open shots off of passes from guys like Igoudala, Durant, and Green.  duh"
But the Warriors won without Kevin Durant? The Cavs evaporate without LeBron. The Warriors can still win games without Curry or Durant or either.
"And that's not to say the Warriors wouldn't have gone after Kevin Durant anyway, but point is, teams respond to fans, which represent money. "
Golden State getting the number 1 seed. and then Steph Curry and Kevin Durant just choking away a whole series and then exposing all of KD's burner accounts
"It's like if Kevin Durant told C.J. McCollum, ""Don't concern yourself with what goes on at the top"""
"No single player can shut down James Harden (unless he’s injured), that’s the thing. It takes an entire team effort to stop an offensive player of that caliber, and even then it’s tough.   In 2016, Kawhi Leonard won DPOY and was being hailed as one of the greatest perimeter defenders of all time. Yet what happened in the playoffs that year vs OKC? Leonard defended Kevin Durant who proceeded to drop 28ppg on 50% fg on him over a 7 game series. Basketball is designed such that a great offensive player will usually have the advantage over a great defender.. it’s just the nature of the game, especially with the rule changes."
Are you suggesting that Kevin Durant does not score more points because of OP's strength of will itself?
"If he was second best then he’d have more than 3 chips especially after being gifted multiple stars to make it happen. He’s also not expected to win anymore, so you’re essentially saying 2nd best player only wins 3?  His numbers aren’t even best 3 in small forwards, with bird, Baylor, and Barry.   Kareem, mj, wilt, Russell, kobe, bird, magic, Hakeem, jerry west, Oscar... there’s plenty of names that had a far better success than lebron, and a much harder path than the one he has chosen.   After both careers are done, Kevin Durant will have a better career than lebron James. Flat out"
Seems like he has plans to retire early. http://amp.si.com/nba/2018/06/11/kevin-durant-can-see-himself-retiring-five-years
"For number 1, Steph Curry or Kyle Korver.  For bonus round, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, or maybe Shaq."
No Kevin Durant flag football?
"""4 proven transcendent players"" Number of 20 PPG+ seasons:  LeBron James: 15 Steph Curry: 6 Kevin Durant: 11 Kawhi Leonard: 2  fuck out of here with this ""there are only 4 and they are always favorites"" bullshit. superstars like harden, Giannis, and AD exist and your Pokemon-style nonsense of ""one of these four always win unless it's against each other"" is so fucking reductionist  LeBron is LeBron, Steph and KD play on the same fucking team, and Kawhi has had one and a half good playoff runs as the star player on his team. Relax lol."

"and pays his own bills:  'He is often alone. “I know what to do,” Westbrook says. “I don’t need a bunch of people around to give me—whatever those people give you.” He pays his own bills, a rarity in the NBA, hauling stacks of them into the Thunder lunch room. “This isn’t $32,” a staffer heard him grouse at a miscalculated invoice.

"Dude, Kevin Durant is not going to marry you  Get off his nuts lol it's fucking embarrassing"
"From what I can see,  1. Praise LBJ  2. Scorn Kevin Durant  3. Scorn GSW  4. Write interesting random facts people will forget tomorrow. "
That would have broken r/nba worse than Kevin Durant joining GSW because the Wizards were the closest to handing Lebron his first round loss. (not because of team quality/skill but shenanigans)  Read up on the crab dribble here:  https://www.bulletsforever.com/2016/6/7/11873892/washington-wizards-cleveland-cavaliers-rivalry-lebron-james-kyrie-irving-john-wall  Lebron literally ushered in the era where superstar calls (already being labeled to MJ) went beyond rule breaks and of course nowadays everything is shifted towards James Harden and Kevin Durant (with occasional Lebron James flops) being done in the name of abusing and making the game what it is today.  The Decision was not the first time Lebron has semi-ruined the league.
"&gt;https://m.imgur.com/a/jgEjduc  I don't know if I completely understand why this means it's ridiculous.  Durant, Lebron, Harden, Curry, Cousins, Aldridge, George, AD, Irving, Derozan, and Lillard-  None of those players would be ridiculous to see in the top 20 in scoring this year and that's 11 of the 17 guys listed.  The only guys on this list who have no chance of being in the top 20 in scoring are much older than Love.  The top 3-4 guys in rebounding are the exact same minus Kevin Love.  The assist list has changed fairly drastically, but Kevin Love is not a guard.  I'm not saying Kevin Love is definitely going to be as good as he was, but this list doesn't prove to me that it's insane to expect him to be close to the same player. "
I bought a Kevin Durant OKC jersey because we were up 3-1 in WCF vs the Warriors and... fuck my life 
"On Christmas 2015, my boss bought me one of the Thunder Christmas Day jerseys. Unfortunately he got me a Kevin Durant one. About six months later, it was effectively unwearable in my state. Beautiful jersey though. "
"They go from a contender to a lottery team? That tends to happen?  These teammates you rave about, Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan, how did they do without Chris?  I'll tell you, they have a **73-86 record without him.**  These are the guys you think are comparable to having Kevin Durant."
"No, I don't have proof. But most likely a PG like Chris would do extremely well with a scorer like Kevin Durant."
That's because he played with Kevin Durant for 8 years.
Yeah it's interesting for as much acting as Harden does to sell calls and get some calls he doesn't deserve there are also a number of plays where he gets no call and has a legitimate gripe. His game is built on physicality in many ways and he's always going to be given physical treatment defensively. He truly is impossible to officiate you're going to miss fouls with him and give him fouls he doesn't deserve  The other thing with Harden is conditioning(his asthma is also related to this general idea) is an issue. When he came to Hou and had to take on a greater scoring load to manage himself and be able to shoulder such a burden physically he needed a means of getting more easy baskets. Harden for as good a scorer he is and how often he attacks does not have the most explosive first step; ie in other words it takes more work for him to get his baskets than many other stars. All of this is also part of why he adapted his style if he wanted to go from 20ish ppg to 30 on the same efficiency he needed a source of lower effort buckets.   And honestly Harden isn't the only example. Early in his career Kevin Durant was famous for his rip move. Now whether or not this was specifically in response to how physical defenders were being I don't think is as clear cut with him but I do think it was one factor. Over time rules changed so it was harder for him to get that move off and I don't think it's unrelated at all to why he doesn't get to the FT line as much anymore; back in OKC he would have seasons averaging 10 FTs a game. 
&gt; **you** were 5-23  &gt; username is BlindedbythePhxSuns  kevin durant is that you?
"For the 2007 draft, I debated whether I wanted a Greg Oden or Kevin Durant jersey. I was 11 at the time, I ended up going with Kevin Durant-Supersonics jersey. Not something I regret at all. Can you imagine if I had went with Oden instead though.  "
"I would. [You're for sure getting this level of defense](https://youtu.be/3RnoreTM9eA) the passing and vision are consistent, and when his shot is off he shifts down from 11 attempts a game to 7. He was [the best player on the court for a series](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2018-nba-western-conference-semifinals-pelicans-vs-warriors.html) with Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and Anthony Davis playing.  That's not routine for him, but there aren't 7 other players in the league who are capable of that. That said, nobody has any idea the toll all the small ball has taken on his body so far or how steep of a drop off he'll get as age and injuries accumulate."
The Brazilian Kevin Durant approves of this comment
"You're crazy if you don't think a line-up of DeRozan, Lowry and Kevin Durant is a legitimate championship contender."
"&gt;KD is honestly better due to his incredible physical gifts  A baseless claim not supported by any metric.  &gt;Have you ever watched a game of his? Dude was an amazing pick pocketer and was absurdly good at disrupting passing lanes but he wasn't a good lockdown man on man at all  I've watched plenty of his games, he wasn't a lockdown defender, but there's a lot more to defense than just locking down your man. Help defense, passing lanes, positioning, awareness, effort and consistency are all very important, Bird was elite and better than Durant in these aspects.  &gt;Bird is lucky he had one of the goat defensive team around him so he could stick to just going for steals  It's absurd that a non-fact like this was upvoted by so many like-minded idiots.   Larry Bird joined a 29 wins 1979 Celtics and the Celtics won 61 games the next season, their defensive rating went from 19th in the league to 4th in the league with minimal roster change. Dennis Johnson wasn't on the Celtics yet, neither was Kevin McHale, nor Robert Parish.  He then led his team in DBPM (admittedly inflated by DRB% and AST% interaction), DWS and minutes for 6 consecutive seasons, in that stretch, the Celtics never fell below 7th in the league and peaked at 3rd in the league.   Durant has never achieved anything even remotely similar on the defensive end.  &amp;#x200B;"
Sorry for bad English   Where were you when thibwolve legend Duol Deng dies?  I was sat at computer trolling Kevin Durant.   ‘Lysol is kill’  ‘No’
"""Klay isn't great at handling the ball""  That's it. Klay is somewhat dependent on Curry and other players to get him the ball. He cannot run an offense.  Harden and Paul are miles better as a duo at running an offense because they are interchangeable.  Even with their skills not being as complimentary, they still had a better offense than Curry and Thompson last year without having Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant is the second best player
Kevin Durant.
we’re in a thread about the best backcourts of all time and you’re talking about kevin durant.   how fucking thick are you...
The Brightest Timeline 2017 Thunder  Starters: Russell Westbrook - Andre Roberson - Kevin Durant - Al Horford - Steven Adams  Bench: Victor Oladipo - Dion Waiters - Ersan Ilyasova - Domantas Sabonis 
Andre Miller  Jason Richardson   Kevin Durant   Serge Ibaka  Nikola Jokic 
-Mike Bibby  -Jason Terry  -Kevin Durant  -Lamar Odom  -Rudy Gobert
2015 Warriors had Harrison Barnes. 2018 Warriors had Kevin Durant. You don’t see the difference?
"That's why they are inferior talent-wise, statistically and lost the majority of the h2h matchups depsite having Kevin Durant."
Does Kevin Durant still have burner accounts?
If you rearrange Julie Phayer around it spells Kevin Durant
Does Kevin Durant have a future working in social media?
Kevin Durant has a nice flow on that track 
Kevin Durant is a great player 
"My friend, you've argued with Kevin Durant. Twice."
"Game 5 of the Western Conference. first round. Warriors and Timberbulls, 10 seconds left. Joakim Noah misses both his free throws but Butler grabs the board.   Deng looks at Thibbs on the sidelines, his hunchback is protruding as angry spit oozes from his lip. KAT has the ball in the post against Steph Curry but passes it out anyway to Deng.  Deng looks at coach.  “Witness me...”  Deng drives through the lane and dunks over Kevin Durant. He falls from the rim, his knees have exploded, his back has been ripped apart. Blood covers the floor. Thibbs nods his head in approval as Derrick Rose sits on the sideline in a suit.  “I am awaited in Valhalla,” Deng says with his last breath.   Warriors win 127-92"
Kevin Durant is so fucking good and will be the best player in the NBA

They essentially just had to get rid of Diaw and one of Green or Parker to fit in Durant’s salary. That’s gutting in the same way that getting rid of Bogut, Ezeli, Barbosa, and Barnes is gutting.  Warriors were going to match on HB if KD didn’t sign with them "
Yeah i played kevin durant one on one lol. I lost

At the end of the season Rockets have much better record than Hawks.  /u/livefreeordont : ""Durant from Rockets is great player, Durant from Hawks is far worse""  &gt; Why do you think people put Steph over Wilt as greatest Warrior  To be fair, most of them is unable to compare them objectively."
Thunders greatest ever player is Kevin Durant no question. 
"My man you're tripping..put Stockton aside. Wade is one of the top ~20 basketball players ever, and Karl Malone is one of the top ~15 basketball players ever. You're talking about Mitchell basically becoming as good as current Kevin Durant, just think about how likely that is to happen. "
"Kevin Durant is a far better player than Curry. If you have an all time draft and you take Curry before Durant you're an idiot. Curry is a great chucker who is a liability on defense. Durant is for sure top 5 on the offensive side, and arguably top 5 on the defensive end as well. "
"Except it's not the same since Curry is better than Durant.  Peaked higher, won more, greater impact when on different teams, greater impact in every lineup on the same team, better in box scored advanced stats, better in on/off advanced stats, and the Warriors win more without Durant than they do without Curry. FMVPs don't make Tony Parker better than Tim Duncan, or James Worthy better than Magic, or Paul Pierce better than Kevin Garnett."
"Except it's not the same since Curry is better than Durant. Doesn't take a Warrior fan to know that.  Peaked higher, won more, greater impact when on different teams, greater impact in every lineup on the same team, better in box scored advanced stats, better in on/off advanced stats, and the Warriors win more without Durant than they do without Curry. FMVPs don't make Tony Parker better than Tim Duncan, or James Worthy better than Magic, or Paul Pierce better than Kevin Garnett."
"Lol saying no rookie has ever been as well rounded as Tatum is a laughable statement. Tyreke Evans was better and more well rounded in his rookie year and look what happened, not to mention basically every real superstar you're ignoring with that statement. Tatum averaged about 1.5 assists and 1.5 turnovers in a low turnover offence, acting like he's a good playmaker is just making shit up. His ceiling is no where near Kevin Durant, let alone what he's projected to be. He's a good player, I expect him to be an all star for a few years at least. But some of these homer opinions like comparing him to Durant are just getting hilarious. Imo he's not even top 3 in his draft class. Simmons and Mitchell are definitely better, and personally I'd take markannen over him as well."
LeBron would have a 4 straight rings right now if his teammates didn't die in 2015 and if Kevin Durant had testicles
"Kevin Durant playoff stats (127 games): 28.8 ppg on 59.1% TS  LeBron James playoff stats (239 games): 28.9 ppg on 57.9% TS.

LeBron James playoff stats (last 124 games): 29.3 ppg on 59.3% TS  \_(ツ)_/¯   Oh, and Tmac has only started 38 playoff games. He’s not even eligible to be in this convo"
not dick sucking kevin durant dry is hard for you eh?
"Between the 2007-08 season and the 2013-14 season, Carmelo Anthony was selected to the All-NBA First or Second Team 2 times. In the same time span, I found 12 players selected to the 1st or 2nd team more times than him. In order by most selections in that time period: LeBron, Dwight Howard, Kobe, Durant, Dirk, CP3, DWade, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Amar'e, Blake Griffin, and Russ. Additionally, Deron Williams, Steve Nash, and Kevin Love all received 2 selections in the same time period. Again, this is not my opinion but the opinion of the All-NBA voters, in your cherry-picked time period. Concede?"
Kevin Durant and LeBron James
"Yeah quite possibly, but this guy literally said, after one year in the nba, that he’s going to be Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant was substantially worse in the regular season than AD
Kevin Durant and Steph Curry
Kevin durant easily. Look at their on/off in the finals and playoffs this year. Third most impactful would be Harden or AD. Stats back it up
"I'm sorry to see you don't watch Anthony Davis play. Guy averaged something like 30 and 11 with dpoy tier defense after Cousins fell. If you really think that isn't better than James Harden, you've clearly made up your mind 🤣  It's the era of wings because of switch heavy offenses. Davis guards wings better on a night by night basis than all the players you listed  Kevin Durant is better than Curry too tbh "
Kevin Durant did nothing wrong and if we were in his shoes we would have done the same thing
Kevin Durant is at least as good as Lebron

Yeah that won't happen. Prospects are always compared to current superstars. Every tall skinny dude is Kevin Durant. Every big fast guy that passes is the next Lebron James. Every white guy that can shoot 3s is Dirk. Every little dude that shoots 3s is the next Steph Curry. 
"A super great read!! Here are some minor typos I found and suggestions I thought of while reading.

(Maybe add ‘Westbrook would go on to have one of the most statistically-stunning seasons in 2016-17, winning MVP by almost single-handedly dragging the Thunder to the playoffs while putting up historic statlines not seen in the NBA for over 50 years and performing countless clutch plays, but falling short against the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs, who were led by fellow MVP-candidate James Harden and boasted a historic offense’ because I personally think it’s worth mentioning as an important part of recent NBA history)  "
WAIT. There's a similar clip of Obama greeting the Texas college basketball team when Kevin Durant was on the team. Did Key and Peele get it from that or was it before?

"cont (pt. 5)  **Portland Trail Blazers**  **Hallmarks:** Bill Walton and the ’77 Champions; Clyde Drexler in the ‘90s; Extremely Bad Decisions &amp; Extremely Bad Luck  **This Year:** Playoff Contenders  The Blazers joined the league in 1970, and though once had companions in the Seattle SuperSonics and Vancouver Grizzlies, are now the sole team representing the Pacific Northwest. Bill Walton led the team to considerable success in the ‘70s before injuries drove him away, winning them their sole franchise title in ’77. They drafted Clyde ‘The Glide’ Drexler in 1983, and with the #2 pick in the 1984 Draft, selected Sam Bowie. Michael Jordan went 3rd. Yeah. Clyde the Glide would take the Blazers to Finals in ’90 and ’92, but both were losses. An ugly rebuilding process in the ‘90s and early ‘00s and a string of controversies dubbed them the ‘Jail Blazers’. In ’06, they drafted Brandon Roy – a near-unanimous Rookie of the Year and All-Star until injuries brought him down only a few seasons later, and in ’07 they selected Greg Oden with the #1 pick… and Kevin Durant went #2. Oden immediately suffered a string of injuries that kept him from ever seeing substantial success in the NBA. Yeah. Again. Since 2013, the Blazers have been led by the duo of Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum, one of the best guard duos in the league, but their lack of a more complete roster has haunted them, and despite securing the #3 Seed in the West last year, were swept in the first round by Anthony Davis’ Pelicans.  This year, expect much the same from the Blazers. They didn’t make the off-season moves that many were expecting, and it’s difficult to imagine how they’ll compensate for the same problems that plagued them last year. They’ll likely reach the playoffs again under Dame and CJ’s clutch shooting, but are unlikely to see the WCF.  ***  **Sacramento Kings**  **Hallmarks:** ’51 Champions; Chris Webber  **This Year:** Bottom 10  First the Rochester Seagrams, then the Rochester Royals, then the Cincinnati Royals, then the Kansas City-Omaha Kings, then the Kansas City Kings, and finally the Sacramento Kings, the franchise’s history dates back to 1923, and their sole NBA Championship, and sole Conference Title, came all the way back in Rochester in 1951. The Royals/Kings have been the home to several great players – Maurice Stokes, Oscar Robertson, Jerry Lucas, Nate Archibald, Ernie Grunfeld, Spud Webb, Chris Webber, and DeMarcus Cousins… but they never seemed to put together the right team at the right time. The early-‘00s Kings, led primarily by C-Webb, made the playoffs every year from ’98 through ’06, including a WCF appearance in ’02, but the Kings have failed to make the playoffs – or even post a &gt;.500 record – since 2006. Their last two seasons have finished 32-50 and 27-55, and their attempt at infusing a young roster with veterans seemed only to backfire.  This year, expect more of the same from the Kings. Their young roster will continue to improve and develop, but the focus in Sacramento remains very much on the future, not the present, and a successful season for them this year would mean merely cracking 35 wins.  ***  **San Antonio Spurs**  **Hallmarks:** 5 Championships between ’99 and ’14 under Gregg Popovich and Tim Duncan  **This Year:** Playoff Contenders  The Dallas/Texas Chapparals of the ABA joined the NBA in 1976 with star George ‘The Iceman’ Gervin, having early success in the ‘70s that never amounted to a Finals appearance. The ‘80s were difficult for the Spurs, and even acquiring All-Star David Robinson in ’89 didn’t help them to find any lasting success through the ’90s. But then during the ’96-’97 season, the Spurs would make GM Gregg Popovich their new head coach, and in the ’97 draft, selected Tim Duncan with the first pick – and everything would begin to turn around. Duncan became the younger of the two ‘Twin Towers’ next to Robinson, and immediately the Spurs turned around to win the ’99 Finals. The ‘00s would be dominated in turns by Popovich and Duncan’s Spurs and the Jackson and Kobe Lakers. The Spurs would win additional titles in ’03, ’05, ’07, and ’14, each time with Duncan leading the way, playing a famously selfless, clean, methodical method of basketball that has become synonymous with Extremely Good Human Being Gregg Popovich. With Duncan’s retirement, his heir-apparent Kawhi Leonard, a consensus-top-5 player when healthy, did something strange. There’s no time to explain here exactly what happened last offseason, but it culminated in Kawhi Leonard shockingly demanding a trade, and being sent off to Toronto in exchange for, primarily, DeMar DeRozan. With the retirement of veteran Manu Ginobli and the departure of veteran Tony Parker, the Spurs are in the most uncertain place they’ve been since Duncan arrived. Nobody knows what to expect.  This year, watch the Spurs closely. Anything could happen. We haven’t seen a Spurs team without Ginobli or Parker or without Duncan or Leonard since the early ‘90s. Popovich is still the league’s most legendary coach, and DeMar DeRozan has a chip on his shoulder – but will that be enough to help them sustain the consistent success they’ve had until now?  ***  **Toronto Raptors**  **Hallmarks:** Vince Carter in the ‘90s  **This Year:** ECF Contenders  Founded in 1995 alongside the Vancouver Grizzlies, and now the sole NBA team representing all of Canada, the Toronto Raptors struggled until the acquisition of Vince Carter via a draft-day trade in 1998. Vince Carter was one of the most exciting and attention-drawing players of his era, infamous for his incredible, arena-shattering dunks that many consider the best in NBA history. Unfortunately, though Carter was able to help the Raptors make the playoffs in ’00, ’01, and ’02, they never found significant playoff success, and Carter was traded to the Nets in 2004. Chris Bosh would take Carter’s mantle as the team leader, but after more playoff losses, would also leave the team a few years later in 2010. The most recent era of Raptors leadership came in the form of the backcourt duo of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan. Led by the pair of guards, the Raptors have found by far their most consistent, dependable success yet, making the playoffs for the last 5 straight seasons, and making it past the first round for the last three seasons. Each of their last three, second-round or ECF playoff losses has been to LeBron’s Cavaliers – and now, with LeBron having departed to the Western Conference, it looks like the Raptors may have found their opening. Toronto fans were devastated and shocked to see DeRozan traded away to the Spurs in what many considered a betrayal by the front office, but in exchange they received Kawhi Leonard, who, if healthy and cooperative, is by any account a better overall player.  This year, expect the Raptors to make a run at reaching the ECF and maybe, finally, breaking out of it - though the Celtics and Sixers will both want to have their say in that. Nevertheless, if the stars had ever aligned for Toronto, this is the year it happened.  ***  **Utah Jazz**  **Hallmarks:** John Stockton and Karl Malone in the '80s and '90s  **This Year:** Playoff Contenders  The New Orleans Jazz were founded in 1974 before moving to Salt Lake City in 1979 and, bizarrely, still calling themselves the Jazz even though they now played in friggin Utah. Though their very first decade of play was unsuccessful, once they turned things on in 1984, they didn't miss another playoff birth until 2004. From '84 to '04, the Jazz were the most consistent team in the NBA, spearheaded by one of the league's most legendary duos of Point Guard John Stockton and Powerful Forward Karl 'The Mailman' Malone. Their run through the '80s and '90s reached a pinnacle in back-to-back Finals appearances in '97 and '98, both times coming up short to Jordan's Bulls. A 00's rebuild granted them Donovan Mitchell, a Rookie of the Year candidate last year, and Rudy Gobert, the '18 Defensive Player of the Year - echoing back to the Stockton-Malone duo.  This year, look for the Jazz to be #3 in the West behind the Warriors and Rockets, to remain the league's premier defensive powerhouse, and for Donovan Mitchell to continue to mature into an All-Star-caliber player.  ***  **Washington Wizards**  **Hallmarks:** Wes Unseld, Elvin Hayes, and the '78 Championship  **This Year:** Playoff Contenders  Founded in 1961 as the Chicago Packers, then the Zephyrs, then relocated to the Baltimore Bullets, relocated again to the Capital Bullets, renamed the Washington Bullets, and now finally the Washington Wizards, the franchise made four Finals appearances - all in the 1970's - an won one championship in '78. The Wizards were a dominant team throughout the '70s, winning their division title nearly every season. Age and injuries caught up to them at the end of the decade, and the '80s and early '90s proved disappointing for the Washington team, even acquiring big names like Manute Bol, Moses Malone, Muggsy Bogues, Chris Webber, and most famously of all, Michael Jordan in 1999, returning from his second retirement at the age of 38. Many fans to this day try not to remember the fact that Jordan came back, and though his personal stats were strong, the team's mediocrity is considered the low point of his career. Gilbert Arenas struggled to carry the Wizards to success in the '00s, losing in four playoffs from '05 to '08, but they would return to the playoffs in 4 of their past 5 seasons under the backcourt duo of John Wall and Bradley Beal. Unfortunately, like the Blazers, their absence of frontcourt power has kept them stagnant, right around the spot where the playoffs seem likely, but advancing into them doesn't.  This year, look for the Wizards to sit atop the Southeast Division and another good year for Wall and Beal, but unless they can generate something new from the frontcourt, they're unlikely to be able to turn a playoff birth into real success."
"cont (pt. 4)  **New Orleans Pelicans**  **Hallmarks:** Chris Paul from ’05-’11; Anthony ‘The Unibrow’ Davis  **This Year:** Playoff Contenders  Remember the whole Charlotte Hornets fiasco? So the New Orleans Pelicans were founded when the Charlotte Hornets relocated in 2002, then Katrina happened, and they became the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets for two seasons before returning to New Orleans, and a few years later, renaming themselves the Pelicans, and returning the pre-’02 history of the Hornets to the new team in Charlotte. TL;DR, New Orleans’ team history starts in 2002, but they got a bigger jump-start than an expansion team would’ve. Also they retired Pistol Pete’s #7 because he played on the New Orleans Jazz, and they play in New Orleans now, even though the Jazz still exist, but in Utah. It’s all a mess.  Anyway, the Hornets drafted Chris Paul in the 2005 NBA Draft and he quickly turned into one of the most remarkable Point Guards in NBA history – despite this, success was moderate, playoff losses hit them hard, and CP3 would request a trade. The Hornets, weaker than ever, landed the first overall pick in the ’12 draft, and acquired Anthony Davis – who has become the face of the franchise and one of the five most dominant players in the NBA today, already rumored to be the ’18-’19 MVP favorite. Last season, despite an injury to his right-hand man Boogie Cousins, AD carried the Pelicans to a first-round sweep of the favorited Blazers in Round 1 of the playoffs. It’s unclear if Cousins’ absence will hurt the team this year – they seemed to, if anything, play better without him.  This year, watch Anthony Davis. Seriously, just watch him. He is a wrecking ball on both ends of the court. Don’t be surprised to see him carry the Pelicans to another playoff victory, even if they’re unlikely to compete with the likes of Houston or Golden State.  ***  **New York Knickerbockers**  **Hallmarks:** Walt ‘Clyde’ Frazier and the ’70 and ’73 Championships; Patrick Ewing in the ‘80s and ‘90s.  **This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack  The Knicks were founding BAA members from 1946, and though they were successful from the start – making three straight finals appearances in the early ‘50s – luck was never on their side. Coach Red Holzman and star Clyde Frazier finally brought them dominance in the late ‘60s, culminating in NBA titles in ’70 and ’73. Their luck turned down in the 80s, and back up in the 90s, when Patrick Ewing brought them to two Finals appearances – both losses. Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire tried to restore Knicks glory in the ‘10s, but never cracked an ECF. With the 4th pick in the 2015 Draft, the Knicks selected Latvian Big Man Kristaps Porzingis, the new face of their team. Though set back by injuries, when Porzingis is healthy, he’s an absolute menace on the court. It’s unclear when he’ll be able to start this season, and the Knicks don’t really have a complete roster to give him the tools to make a playoff run, but they might have the cap space and the New York pulling power to draw in another key player next season.  This year, watch for Porzingis, and watch the trade rumors. The Knicks’ fate is very much in Kristaps’ hands – but he’s definitely going to need another piece if they want to have real playoff success.  ***  **Oklahoma City Thunder**  **Hallmarks:** Gary Payton; the ’79 Championship Seattle SuperSonics; the Harden-Westbrook-Durant team in ‘12  **This Year:** Playoff Contenders  The Seattle SuperSonics were founded in 1967 and played there until ’08, when, to no small amount of controversy, they relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder. The Sonics’ history, including their greats Lenny Wilkens and Spencer Haywood, and their ’79 NBA Championship, now belong to the Thunder. Young superstar Kevin Durant moved with the team from Seattle to OKC, where they acquired James Harden and Russell Westbrook – all three of whom have since won MVPs. The young trio carried the team to the 2012 Finals, but LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and the Miami Heat came away with the win. The Thunder would trade James Harden to the Houston Rockets, and lose their league MVP Kevin Durant to free agency (later joining Golden State), leaving Russell Westbrook as the beating heart of the franchise. He would go on to win the '16-'17 MVP in one of the most statistically remarkable seasons in the history of the NBA, dragging the Thunder to the playoffs only to fall short to Harden's Rockets (Harden himself would win the MVP the following year). Alongside All-Star Paul George and Big Man Steven Adams, the Thunder are essentially playoff locks this year again – but how far they can get into the playoffs is anyone’s guess. Last year, they lost in the first round to the Jazz.  This year, watch for Oklahoma City to have comparable success to last season. Westbrook is one of the most dynamic and explosive players in the league, and incredibly fun to watch. The Thunder, barring any injuries, should have no trouble making the playoffs. The focus this year is in getting to the WCF.   ***  **Orlando Magic**  **Hallmarks:** Shaquille O’Neal and Penny Hardaway in the ‘90s, Dwight Howard in the ‘00s and early ‘10s  **This Year:** Bottom 10  The Magic were founded in 1989, and by ’93 had drafted the most dominant player of the ‘90s, Shaquille O’Neal, and traded for guard Anfernee ‘Penny’ Hardaway. Along with Horace Grant, the Magic bulldozed their way to an NBA Finals in ’95, but Hakeem’s Rockets were hungrier and more experiences. By ’96, Jordan’s Bulls were back, and swept the inexperienced Magic. The following season, they’d lose Shaq to the Lakers, and though they acquired some past-their-prime greats, the roster wasn’t enough to sustain any success. Tracy McGrady only seemed to find first-round playoff losses, and the Magic wouldn’t see a chance at a title again until their new Big, Dwight Howard, carried them there in ’09, beating a young LeBron and the Cavaliers only to fall short against the Phil Jackson-Kobe Bryant Lakers. The Magic are new deep into a rebuilding process, lacking any true superstars and hoping that their new rookie Mohamad ‘Mo’ Bamba can be the foundation on which future success can be built.  This year, watch Mo Bamba – one of the few rookies this year who could find real success and play real minutes – but don’t get your hopes up for the Magic to make a playoff run. Last season, they started out strong, and a ton of hype got built up. This team’s not ready yet. Don’t set yourself up for that again.  ***  **Philadelphia 76ers**  **Hallmarks:** ’55 Champions; Wilt Chamberlain’s ’67 Champions; Julius Erving’s ’83 Champions; Allen Iverson in the late ‘90s and early ‘00s  **This Year:** Playoff Contenders  The Syracuse Nationals were founded in 1946, winning a title in ’55 before relocating to Philadelphia and becoming the 76ers in 1964, the same year they acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Warriors. Wilt managed to win the ’67 championship, his sole victory over the Celtics’ ‘60s dynasty, before departing to the Lakers at the end of the following season. The Sixers would struggle to find meaningful success again until the NBA-ABA Merger, wherein they bought Julius ‘Dr. J’ Erving from the ABA Nets and immediately took the league by storm, rushing to the ’77 Finals before falling to the Blazers. They would lose again to the Lakers in the ’80 and ’82 Finals, before acquiring Moses Malone and sweeping the Lakers 4-0 to win the ’83 Championship. The Sixers rose to prominence again after drafting flashy superstar Allen ‘The Answer’ Iverson – but he only managed to take them to one Finals, a loss to, again, the Lakers. In the early ‘10s, the 76ers began ‘The Process’, a controversial rebuilding plan executed by GM Sam Hinkie. The team was awful and Hinkie would be fired not long after – and yet now the 76ers find themselves with a trio of young superstars, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, and Markelle Fultz. By many accounts, ‘The Process’ paid off after all. The Sixers are generally ranked as the third strongest team in the East, and last year lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Boston Celtics.  This year, watch for Ben Simmons to continue to improve and dominate as the league’s best sophomore player, pray to God that Joel Embiid stays healthy, and expect the Sixers to be a top-3 seed in the East.  ***  **Phoenix Suns**  **Hallmarks:** Charles Barkley in the ‘90s; Steve Nash in the ‘00s  **This Year:** Bottom 10  The Suns joined the NBA in 1968, have made it to the WCF 9 times, the Finals twice, and have the fourth-best winning percentage in NBA history. You wouldn’t know it, looking at the now. The Suns found relatively consistent success throughout their history. They took an early trip to the finals in ’76 under the leadership of Paul Westphal, and in ’88 and ’92 acquired Kevin Johnson and Charles Barkley, respectively, carrying them to several very successful seasons, including  ’93 Finals appearance in which they lost to Jordan’s Bulls. In ’96 they drafted Steve Nash, who after an unassuming few seasons, with the help of coach Mike D’Antoni, revitalized the Suns. Playing in an offensive system called ‘Seven Seconds or Less’, the Suns developed one of the most unique styles of basketball the league had ever seen, and Nash won two MVP’s as the commander of it. Since Nash’s departure, the team’s hopes now rest in the hands of their young shooting guard Devin Booker. Unfortunately, injuries and an incomplete roster have kept the Suns from seeing much success. They finished with the worst record in the league last year, securing the first pick in the draft, Deandre Ayton.  This year, watch the Suns’ young, exciting team. Their lack of success has meant several top draft picks, and Devin Booker continues to improve. It’s unlikely that the Suns are going to see much success this season, but if they can at least show signs of promise, they might be able to leverage it for the changes they’ll need.   "
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Kevin Durant. The decision making is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical free agency most of the moves will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Kevin's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Lebron James literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these decisions, to realize that they're not just smart- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike KD truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Durant's existencial catchphrase ""He can't win with those cats"", which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Bob Meyer's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Kevin Durant tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."
Also it is actually based on the handshake between Obama with a white dude follow by another 'bro' handshake between Obama and Kevin Durant.

Look at the 10 before MCW; Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin , Tyreke Evans, Derrick Rose, Kevin Durant, Brandon Roy, Chris Paul, Emeka Okafor, Lebron James.  All but 2; Okafor and Evans,  were on an all-nba team. On top all but 4; Rose,Irving, Okafor, Evans, had multiple all nba teams. ROY has been a good predictor over time but we have had sort of a dry spell the last 5 years. "
"I understand what you're saying, but there is a difference between hayward guarding a normal 2/3 and hayward guarding Kevin Durant/Anthony Davis at the 4. Wouldn't call that meaningless"
"Kevin Durant trying to turn a promising young kid into a heroin addict. ""Shoot up!"" Pathetic."
It made Lowry and DeRozan+ a bunch of role players a top 4 team so don't see why it can't do it with a player twice as good as DeRozan on both ends of the floor and is considered on the same tier as Kevin Durant and Steph Curry when healthy
"Quote from Michael Lewis' ""The Undoing Project"":   For instance, in the 2007 draft there had been a player his model really liked: Marc Gasol. Gasol was twenty-two years old, a seven-foot-one center playing in Europe. The scouts had found a photograph of him shirtless. He was pudgy and baby-faced and had these jiggly pecs. The Rockets staff had given Marc Gasol a nickname: Man Boobs. Man Boobs this and Man Boobs that. “That was my first draft in charge and I wasn’t so brave,” said Morey. He allowed the general ridicule of Marc Gasol’s body to drown out his model’s optimism about Gasol’s basketball future, and so instead of arguing with his staff, he watched the Mem­phis Grizzlies take Gasol with the 48th pick of the draft. The odds of getting an All-Star with the 48th pick in the draft were well below one in a hundred. The 48th pick of the draft basically never even yielded a useful NBA bench player, but already Marc Gasol was proving to be a giant exception. (Gasol became a two-time All-Star in 2012 and 2015 and, by Houston’s reckoning, the third-best pick made by the entire NBA over the past decade, after Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin.) The label they’d stuck on him clearly had affected how they valued him: names mattered. “I made a new rule right then,” said Morey. “I banned nicknames.”  http://www.sbnationradio.com/rockets-daryl-morey-passed-marc-gasol-man-boobs-nickname/"
Hey man if having Steph Curry and Kevin Durant injured in back to back to back playoffs is lucky I don't know what to tell you. The Warriors just had more talent to withstand injuries.
Report; Wolves asked for Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant for Butler
"Honestly I don’t even much dislike the warriors it’s really just Kevin Durant and Boogie, the original warriors won it fair and square but Kevin Durant’s rings and finals mvps? They’re fraudulent "
Kevin Durant led iso squad.
"He had intention of competing, where on Phoenix they were a dying team who went .500 his last year. Kevin Durant jumped off a team that had a 3-1 lead in the Western Conference Finals. The season GSW went 72-9 Vegas had them at 17.24%(+480) chance to win the Championship preseason. The next year after adding Durant the preseason odds to win the championship were 56%(-129). If Barkley did the same thing as Durant then that is like saying an apple is the same thing as an orange because they are both fruit."
"I don't think you can bring in an approximation for Klay or Green.  Tell me every NBA team doesn't wish they had a rock solid 3 and D guy who is happy scoring 12 but able to score 50.  Tell me every NBA team doesn't wish they had a defensive leader who also has a few assists and some scoring in him.  These aren't just bums off the street in a system.  These are incredible players.  Oh, also, I believe Kevin Durant is at least an above average scoring talent.  This is sort of a trash take."
Imagine what if Kevin Durant will be in 2022 most respectful player in NBA?
“This is despicable. Kevin Durant would never do this.”
"what makes Jordan and Curry different from Lebron and Kevin Durant,  Jordan and Curry revolutionized HOW the game is played. Lebron and Durant simply can be called “epitomes” of a brand of basketball. I dont think this makes the latter better than the former.   No, Durant is not better than Curry, just like you can argue Curry isn’t better than Durant.   No Lebron is not better than Jordan or Jordan “lite” aka Kobe, just like you can argue Jordan or Jordan “lite” aka Kobe isn’t better than Lebron.   It’s pointless to argue against the NBA canon with hypotheticals, however. Until PROVEN otherwise, Curry is the 2x MVP, 3x champion best player on the Warriors that didn’t need Durant to win a chip. Please, don’t make up any excuses"
"/u/Texaslion is correct: Knight for Dieng works straight up. Then Gordon and Tucker (or Nene works financially) for Butler.  The problem is what happens next summer if Dieng is on the books. HOU's cap situation would be pretty ugly. For all the talk about how expensive GSW could get if KD stays (I don't think he is, [which is why I wrote this](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/9/17/17869342/kevin-durant-warriors-lebron-james-nba-preview)), it'd also apply to HOU. Trading for Butler would then possibly end up being a one year gamble that ends up hurting them next season and beyond when GSW is more beatable."
This response is taken out of context and has nothing to do with the OKC team. The question asked was about others talking about his individual performance during the NBA finals and KD saying being a part of a team was the real story of the championship. He then provided this quote as an extreme example of how the greatest individual performances will achieve less than a team that learns from other. He goes on to talk about how he's at his best when he's asked to do more than score.  &amp;#x200B;  [https://957thegame.radio.com/media/audio-channel/kevin-durant-joins-papa-and-bonta-warriors-media-day](https://957thegame.radio.com/media/audio-channel/kevin-durant-joins-papa-and-bonta-warriors-media-day)  Question is around 4:30
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  The Golden State Warriors need Steph Curry.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you need him despite your other all stars? The obvious answer: you didn't watch the team without him.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Warriors without zombie ankle Steph.  And because you didn't watch them without him, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""iso percentile"" or ""slithering"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Steph's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the greatest PG in today's game, and one of the 5 best to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that Kevin Durant is as important as Wardell Curry, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched the Warriors without Steph wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Steph is more important.  You might be jealous of Steph's three rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest shooter in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Warriors fan who watched basketball in the naughts, or a Thunder fan who watched deep playoff runs squandered, you don't know what real, impactful, game-changing, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Steph isn't even a top 4 most important player on his team.  So don't go spouting bullshit about team compositions you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like Kevin Durant The Most Player on the Warriors™, but leave the Steph talk to the adults. Fair?"
Dude why the fuck are you constantly posting Kevin Durant-centric threads about how good he is?
Kevin Durant is a fucking loser but pretending he isn’t better than Steph at this point is idiotic and everyone needs to stop doing it

"""Fuck Kevin Durant-san” as the NBA has been expanding into Japan quite recently. "
A bit late but I just wanted to say Fuck Kevin Durant.  That is all.
Hunter Pence signs should return as Kevin Durant signs at games this year. This could be one of them.
"Yeah, but Kevin Durant isn't a fucking guard. You can't argue that he is like you could argue Anthony Davis or LaMarcus Aldridge as a 4 and/or 5."
"Honestly it's often the moves a GM makes when the team *isn't* competitive that are the ones that matter the most. Like people praise Danny Ainge all day long (and rightly so), but it's for the moves he made back when the Celtics weren't making the playoffs rather than what he did this past summer. I mean, yes, he signed Horford and Hayward, but that's not really any different than Magic signing LeBron. All Ainge could do was set the Celtics up to make them attractive enough to where top talent would want to sign there, same as Magic did with the Lakers.  Throw out the LeBron signing when evaluating what Magic has done. Just look at everything he did from the moment he took over right up until LeBron signed and I doubt anyone could find even one move he made that hasn't turned out well. Magic hasn't been on the job long, that's true, but he turned around a team that was a hell of a mess in a very, very short time. Keep in mind that when Magic was hired it was mere months after the previous regime had just signed Luol Deng ($72 million), Timofey Mozgov ($64 million) and Jordan Clarkson ($50 million) each to four year contracts, *fully guaranteed*.   Additionally Magic was taking over a Laker team that the previous year had just lost a franchise record number of games, and was faced with *the certainty* that their 1st round draft pick would be gone either that summer or the next (it was top 3 protected in 2017, and fully unprotected in 2018). And on top of that the Lakers' best asset at the time was D'Angelo Russell, a #2 overall pick which was looking more and more like a bust with each passing game (and continues to).   Compare that to where the Lakers are now. They are thought of to have one of the best young cores in the league, they no longer have *any* of those three toxic contracts clogging things up, and they created enough cap space to be able to sign LeBron and another max player next summer. So you may not attribute LeBron joining the Lakers to Magic (it was LeBron's decision after all), but I think you *do* have to credit Magic with making the team desirable enough to where LeBron felt comfortable making that decision. After all, before Magic took over the Lakers were either getting laughed at for pitch meetings (LaMarcus Aldridge) or weren't getting meetings at all (Kevin Durant). Clearly Magic did *something* right."
"Kevin Durant is an amazing player, I just don’t see how it people are taking this so seriously. Seems like he just feels KD is in that tier and doesn’t get enough cred.   I’m not even really a KD fan and I’m a huge Kobe fan, and I see KD in Kobe’s tier as far as skill and ability to take over a game. "
"By efficiency statistics, yes, Kevin Durant has the best finals performances in history. However, you’re not going by statistics (unless you just didn’t know that statistic). You pointed out his teammates as reason his performances aren’t as great but now you know the top 10 GOATS played with comparable talent to GSW.   So if they all had comparable stacked teams, **but.....** KD is still statistically better in the finals.... Who do to think had the greatest performances?"
"Take a step back. Are you really suggesting the nets could get Kyrie, Jimmy Butler, AND Kevin Durant? That's absurd"
"Whoa whoa whoa, I bet he'd take a slightly used Kevin Durant. "
That wasn't the context at all...  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-on-joining-warriors-i-didnt-go-there-to-make-my-life-easier/  Unless there's some other video or you're joking.

Kevin Durant DPOY - Disrespected Player of the Year
/r/worldnews has a Kevin Durant filter? Didn't know he was that common on there 
"DeMarcus Cousins, Dwight Howard, Kevin Durant, Dennis Schröder, Draymond Green"
"There's a timeline out there where world champions Felix Hernandez and Kevin Durant own the city of Seattle. The King and the uhh, *Servant?*"
"Your argument would be similar to saying winning ncaa player of the year is not important because lots of unsuccessful nba players end up winning that award.  My argument is that it does matter when you take age INTO context. Most poty winners are seniors and don't become very good nba players. However, the only freshmen to win it are Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant. Just like we don't compare 18 year old durant to 23 year old Doug McDermott. We shouldn't compare doncic to bjelica. Doncic is the only teenager to win the award for euros and there are no comparables. I'm not saying he's going to become the best player, because player development is very unpredictable and dependent on team staff. But I'm saying his very unique achievements justifies the tremendous hype. "
"If I remember correctly, Jordan had something similar to say when he did is ""Sit down with Ahmad"" for his 50th birthday.  ""Who's the best, lebron or kobe?"" ""kevin durant""  ""We talking about lebron or kobe and kevin durant is gonna sneak through the back door""  Something to that effect. "
I mean I think it’s pretty clear based on his own comments Kevin Durant is pretty terrible at evaluating NBA players in their totality. We’re talking about a guy who went to the mattresses for FG percentage.
Kevin Durant the kind of guy to ride a horse with both legs on one side
I doubt anyone on the planet has the same thought process as Kevin Durant
"Pretty sure that as elite basketball players, Lebron only respects very few players. Like I think he only respects Draymond Green, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Ben Simmons, and Jayson Tatum. Tatum earned that respect and recognition after his dunk. Before that Lebron dismissed him like trash like when he hit those dagger 3s over Tatum and just walked back right through Tatum. After Tatum's dunk Lebron looked back at him and actually looked at him as a man.  Every one else is just not worthy and I can see why from his perspective it is that way."
"If someone gave you a max contract, you'd probably have the confidence to walk into any shopping center and leave hand in hand with the baddest woman out of convenience. This same type of ""hanging dick"" confidence you speak of -  doesn't necessarily translate to making a jump shot or defending Kevin Durant."
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Kevin Durant. The decision making is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical free agency most of the moves will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Kevin's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Lebron James literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these decisions, to realize that they're not just smart- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike KD truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Durant's existencial catchphrase ""He can't win with those cats"", which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Bob Meyer's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Kevin Durant tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.   "
"Dario Sarić is and will continue to be a better player to have on your team than Kevin Love because of their gap in playoff production.  Stephen Curry is just as good as Kevin Durant and has been better overall in 3 of the last 4 seasons.  Jimmy Butler is a top 10 player in the NBA right now.  LaMarcus Aldridge is tiers above DeMar DeRozan and will be for the next few years.  The Hornets will clinch a playoff spot with several games left.  Kristaps Porzingis is massively overrated and Julius Randle will be just as good as him overall after this season since Randle will have a large role in a good team... Also the gap between Randle and Porzingis last season was not very large at all, Porzingis just got more opportunities.  Lonzo Ball is already a better player than Rajon Rondo has been after his ACL tear."
"Oh wow...you say you never watched MJ besides some old tapes. Then you spout off false claims that you haven't even researched yourself and ask me to research it for you. You have no clue what you are talking about.  Jordan is light years ahead of Durant and eclipses him at almost everything to do with basketball.  I'll list it out for you.  So you focused on offense...Here is the small list of things Durant actually does slightly better:  0.057 better at reg. season 3 pt. fg %  0.023 better at playoff 3 pt. fg %  0.047 better at reg. season free throw%  0.032 better at playoff free throw%  EVERYTHING else Jordan is better.  The numbers above also include his Wizards years. You take those off an he is literally untouchable for every other player in the history of the game during the 11 1/2 seasons he played with the Bulls.  Look at this link to see for yourself...  [http://www.landofbasketball.com/player\_comparison/kevin\_durant\_vs\_michael\_jordan.htm](http://www.landofbasketball.com/player_comparison/kevin_durant_vs_michael_jordan.htm)  I'd don't have time to list all the things Jordan does better b/c it would take me an hour...especially when you add in defensive efficiency and accolades/records.  If you think Jordan is only known as a scorer then you are going to have a bad time trying to argue this point to anyone ever.  Look at his '87-'88 season. Averaged 35.0 ppg (after averaging 37.1 ppg the previous year) on 53.5% shooting. First player to win the league MVP award AND DPOY award in the same season. Averaged 1.6 blocks and league high 3.16 steals per game.  Won the All-star game MVP and dunk contest. Finished the season with a 31.7 PER and headed to the playoffs with 21.2 WS. 11.81 VORP which still remains second highest of all time (behind his own 11.98 he got the next season).  As I stated above, this is just one season, there are plenty more stats I've left off from that year alone. Imagine if I listed everything from his whole career....  &amp;#x200B;"
"This is kind of like when Dominique Wilkins said he never played with anyone good, when he played with NBA Champion, 3x MVP, 12x All-Star, Hall of Fame player &amp; one of the 50 Greatest Players of All-Time member Moses Malone.  Sometimes people just say things in haste &amp; don't think about it all that deeply &amp; it becomes a ridiculous soundbyte.   James Harden &amp; Russell Westbrook are destined for the Hall of Fame, much like Kevin Durant. I wouldn't read too much into this. Plus he played with them at a different time, not when they are what they are today. Harden was coming off the bench.  I also thought it was ridiculous when Robert Parish, whom played with Larry Bird &amp; won championships with him, said that Paul Pierce was the best offensive player in Celtics history. But whatever. People say things when pressed and sometimes you'll disagree with it."
Kevin Durant the kind of guy to drink ice water after brushing his teeth.
Kevin Durant the kind of guy to like the hot side of the pillow 
"&gt; Is this Kevin Durant admitting that he doesn't want to be the best player on a team?  I guess, but hasn't he said something similar before (might've been late last year)?"
"Do you feel the same way about all the shit that JR Smith, Kyle Singler, Demarcus Cousins, and Kevin Durant get on here? Or how about when bootum does lowlights for the same player multiple times? Or are those different because reddit isn’t national TV? Trump complains that the constant jokes at his expense are bullying, are those not ok? You’re playing a dangerous game trying to draw lines on who you are allowed to make fun of and why."
I wonder if 20 years from now everyone on here will still get so triggered when hearing the name Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant doesn’t get enough credit for his defensive play. How they gonna give him such a low defensive rating? When you watch him on the court play defense, he hands out blocks like it’s free candy. This man has been way overlooked for too long and it’s because people are pushing forward an agenda that he’s not the greatest player in this league today. He’s rightfully upset at the way talking heads overlook his ability."
Kevin Durant was a back-to-back Finals MVP in his 2 years with the Warriors. I wouldn't consider him a sidekick
"[Lombardi] DeMarcus Cousins on who’s faster: Him or GS’s Kevin Durant. “I don’t compare myself with anybody,” Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo that said ""I feed off the haters."" “I’ll let you interpret that however you want,” Cousins said."
Keep in mind that all of those players were on horrible defensive teams.   But kevin durant was on the warriors
"Sure but that was pre Kevin Durant. You’re not going to beat a team with five all stars straight up, you gotta take risks. "
"Kyrie Irving, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, DeMarcus Cousins"
"I recall him not being able to bench 225 for one single rep at the combine. I maxed around 235 a few years ago and remember thinking ""neat I'm stronger than Kevin Durant and I'm 5'9"""
"time will tell. Not to say that Lebron hasn't had help because he had help in Miami and in Cleveland. Never forget Ray Allen hit a pivotal shot in one championship that the Spurs should have won and Kryie hit the pivotal shot in the 2016 finals. Not to say that Lebrons herculean effort wasn't the prime factor in driving the bus to that point but he did have ""help"" as well. Kevin Durant showed similar potential when he helped the Thunder get to the finals when their squad was relatively young/not as developed as when Lebron took Cleveland to the finals his first time around before moving to Miami.   It'll be interesting to see how their careers compare and to see the similarities once its all said and done. "
Why is Kevin Durant always acting like such a butthurt baby all the time?  
"Kevin Durant is a good defender, and this '357 out of all players' seems unfair and misleading to me.  However, he is NOWHERE NEAR being in the conversation for being DPOY. He's not even the third best defender on his TEAM!  If somebody asked me ""Is KD a good defender?"" I say ""Yeah... he is.""  If somebody said ""Should he be considered for the all-defenive team?"" HELL NO!!!  &amp;#x200B;  I'm not even sure I'd put him a 4th or 5th best on his team. Klay, Dray, and Iggy are clearly better.  WAY better.  And I'd put Curry ahead of him to be honest a well.    David West? McCaw. Looney. Bell. Yu coudl very well argue that, despite playing far fewerminutes, that they put in better defensive performances.    He's a good defender on a great defensive team: there is no reason why he should expect to stand on on that team defensively, let alone stand out in the entire league. "

He’s right in that it’s hard to find a more perpetually defensive player than Kevin Durant.
Is Kevin Durant a meme now? 
All y'all blogboys. Don't talk about basketball to Kevin Durant unless you've played in the league.
"I love Klay and he is a good man defender but he is not a good help defender.  That being said, he does make help defense easier if his man is taken out of the equation.   To be considered elite, I really think it is important how you impact team defense. This is what makes Draymond so great. He is undersized at his position, can decently guard all positions, but it is his help defense that really makes him special.   One of the reasons Kevin Love was so important is that he kept Draymond more perimeter and impeded his ability  to help.   Durant definitely improved and excelled, in some games when he was focused, at help defense.   DPOY seems like a reach though. He might have the ability, but it has to be a body of work for the entire year, not just stretches. "
If Kevin Durant would just shut his mouth and stay off social media it would be way easier to like him.   He continues to make things worse for himself. I don’t get it. 
There's times I swear Kevin Durant is *trying* to be unlikeable. Guy's *arguably* the third-best defender in the Warriors' starting lineup.
"Kevin ""I tell ladies I'm 6'9 and the boys im 7 foot"" Durant"
Honestly Kevin Durant is doing everything he can to make himself seem like the worst person in the NBA. Can't believe i felt bad for this guy when he was playing with Westbrook. Turns out Durant was probably the problem. Only sad thing about it is I used to love the Warriors. Now they're too easy to hate. 
I think Kevin Durant is the defensive player of the year.  He certainly gets very defensive whenever he is in front of the press.

My point was that Kevin Durant quite clearly left. Just because Paul George chose to stay doesn't make Westbrook suddenly magical.
To be fair they make everyone look like Kevin Durant. Remember Thon Maker?
"My mom has definitely heard of LeBron and might have heard of Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, so I'll go with James Harden."
"That's true, but I think it goes back to the first guys point- it becomes a harder decision to shoot rather than pass when the guy standing over there is Kevin Durant, or Steph Curry, or Klay Thompson. All of a sudden there's a heck of a lot more pressure to make the shot, and if you have any doubt or hesitation at all it's probably the smarter play to pass to one of them guys. "
Kevin Durant
1) Kevin Durant the greatest scorer I have ever seen  2) Jonathan Isaac 6'12 SF/PF who can guard 1-5 and has great defensive potential   3) Kawhi Leonard the greatest perimeter defender I have ever seen other than probably prime Tony Allen.
"That’s not even Tracy McGrady level. Rose had a very good year for a 22 year old, but it’s nothing generational at all. Kevin Durant has already won a second scoring title by the time he was 22."

&gt; MVP- Kevin Durant   Marry me
"Because Steph Curry and and Kevin Durant are both top 5 players in the NBA?  Because Klay And Steph are two of the best 3pt shooters in the NBA?  Because Draymond can guard all 5 positions despite his height?  Because Steve Kerr is one of the best coaches in the NBA?  The Lakers have LeBron, a bunch of mediocre/bad defensive players and were one of the worst 3pt shooting teams last year and likely will be again this year. "

Who hasn’t? A 73 win team with Kevin Durant?
"I was looking back a couple years out of curiosity and in 2016 83.3% of GMs thought that Golden State made the best overall moves, but only 80% of GMs thought that the Warriors acquisition of Kevin Durant would make the biggest impact. Can you imagine the one GM saying, boy I think Utah signing George Hill was a bigger deal than KD, but the acquisition of Matt Barnes really puts Golden State over the top. "
Booker is going to be rdy for the season opener  Suns also have a history of signing top quality free agents. It isn‘t by chance that both Blake Griffin and Kevin Durant put Phoenix as a top 2 destination in podcasts when asked. 
"I don't like it when he gets his Celtic or Kevin Durant hard-on, but as far as wild takes goes he knows they're dumb unlike Skip and Stephen A. who think they're being absolutely serious. And he also has some interesting insights in general."
Rehashed comment about how Kevin Durant is an insecure coward.
1. Lebron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. thru 7: ???? (Giannis/KD/Steph/Westbrook/Kawhi Leonard) ???? 
"Right, but the fact that he's ""Kevin freaking Durant"" won't magically heal his knee, nor will it mean his game will age well. Most players' careers don't  make it past 33, let alone justify a 4-year, max deal at that age. Even if you're optimistic about him aging well, my point is that its already a risk to be signing him at 31, preferring to sign him when he's 32 or 33 is just asking for trouble.  "
One underrated option would be to keep the cash salary cap but to not set restrictions (or set limited restrictions) on equity grants.  It's a bad thing for the sport of basketball as a whole if the San Antonio Spurs are even in danger of insolvency.  It's not really a bad thing for basketball as a whole if the owner of the Spurs gives away a 2% chunk of his stake in the team to lure Kevin Durant in free agency or entice Kawhi to stay.  
"Which player would you want taking a shot with the game on the line?  &amp;#x200B;  1. Kevin Durant, Golden State – 40%  &amp;#x200B;  2. Stephen Curry, Golden State – 27%  &amp;#x200B;  3.

&gt; Who is the best defensive player in the NBA?  &gt;  Kevin Durant 3%  DPOY
"Roids for an NBA player wouldn't provide nearly the same type of competitive advantage it does in the MLB or even the NFL.   There are clear competitive advantages in any sport with steroids, but in the NBA you don't need to be super muscular to be successful. Hell, strength isn't even a super necessary trait for guards and some forwards in the NBA. The combine record for their bench press (which is 185, not 225 like the NFL) is 27 reps which was set in 03 by Jason Keep. It's really not an impressive strength feat, and some years the top guy on their bench press doesn't even break 20 reps at 185, and in some cases (Kevin Durant, Jamal Crawford, Monta Ellis, T.J. Ford, Luke Ridnour to name a few) don't even get a single rep at 185."
"Who is the best defensive player in the NBA?  1. Rudy Gobert, Utah – 37%      Kawhi Leonard, Toronto – 37%  3. Draymond Green, Golden State – 17%  4. Anthony Davis, New Orleans – 7%  **5. Kevin Durant, Golden State – 3%**  hahaha Warriors GM must vote for him"

"I miss read this head line and thought it said ""Kevin Durant plans to be honest about pretending about free agency"" and I think that fits a lot better"
"Yes, Kobe Bryant is arguably the most overrated basketball player in history. He is often ranked among the Top-Ten players of all time, which I think this is absurd. The following are the reasons I consider Kobe overrated: Kobe is NOT an All-Time Great Scorer. One of the most prevalent arguments as to why Kobe is a all-time great, is his supposedly legendary scoring ability, which is often compared to all-time great, Michael Jordan. However, lets take a closer look at this claim and show why it is flawed: Kobe has only 2 Scoring Titles. Kobe has only lead the league in points per game 2 times, in 19-year career. In comparison: Michael Jordan has done so 10 times. Wilt Chaimberlain has done so 7 times. Kevin Durant and Allen Iverson have done so 4 times. (KD has been in the NBA, less than half the time Kobe had, and has twice the number of scoring titles) Kobe has a Career Points-Per-Game Average of 25. Kobe averaged 25 PPG, over his career. This is a fantastic average, however, it does not rank among the greatest career averages. Kobe’s PPG average does NOT rank among the Top 10. LeBron’s career average is 27.2 PPG, while Kobe’s career average in the same span was 24.8. However, Kobe is generally considered a greater scorer. Allen Iverson, who is generally not considered among the greatest NBA players ever, had a career average of 26.7 PPG, also greater than that of Kobe. Kobe has had the Worst Chokes in the NBA Finals. Kobe is often ranked among the most clutch players in NBA history. This is not backed by substance, and this is evidenced in some of his NBA Finals performances over the years. 2004 NBA Finals: Game 3 vs Detroit Pistons In Game 3 of the 2004 NBA Finals, against the Detroit Pistons, with the series tied at 1–1, Kobe had arguably the worst choke of any superstar in Finals history, which led to a loss by 20 points. Kobe finished the game with just 11 Points on a terrible 30% shooting, with 3 Rebounds, 5 Assists and 4 Turnovers. 2008 NBA Finals: Game 6 vs Boston Celtics Facing elimination, with his team down 3–2 in the series, with a chance to force a Game 7 in Staples Center, Kobe, the reigning MVP of the league, choked again in one of the biggest games of his career, which led to the Lakers losing the Championship. Kobe finished the game with 22 Points on a dismal 32% shooting, with just 3 Rebounds and a pathetic 1 Assist with 4 Turnovers. 2010 NBA Finals: Game 7 vs Boston Celtics With a brilliant chance at redemption, against a Boston Celtics team that defeated his Lakers two years ago, Kobe had a chance to cement his legacy as a clutch performer on the biggest stage of all: Game 7 of the NBA Finals, at home. Yet, he choked again. Kobe finished the game with 23 Points, of which he scored 11 from the free-throw line, thanks to receiving a ridiculous 15 free-throw attempts (ahem Referees? ahem). He scored 12 Points from the field on a awful 25% shooting, with just 1 Assist and 4 Turnovers, but did have a stellar 15 Rebounds. But thanks to the Referees (The Lakers got 20 more free-throws than the Celtics), the Lakers happened to win this game and Kobe won his 5th Ring. Compare these chokes with LeBron’s Finals: Game 4 performance against the Mavericks, which sparked conversation about LeBron being a Choke-Artist. LeBron put up a measly 8 Points on 27% shooting, but had 9 Rebounds and 7 Assists, therefore having about similar production as Kobe’s in the fore-mentioned games. Kobe has only ONE Regular Season MVP (Which he didn’t really deserve). Kobe Bryant has only one regular season MVP , which is put 12 players who have more MVPs than him. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has done so 6 times. Michael Jordan has done so 5 times. Larry Bird and Magic Johnson have done so 3 times. Tim Duncan, Steve Nash and Stephen Curry have done so 2 times. Kobe Bryant did win the 2007–2008 season, but did not deserve it. Let us take a look at Kobe’s stats, compared to other players’ performances. Kobe Bryant: 28.2 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1.8 SPG, 0.5 BPG, 46% FG, 36% 3P, with a record 57–25. Chris Paul: 21.1 PPG, 4.0 RPG, 11.6 APG, 2.7 SPG, 0.1 BPG, 49% FG, 37%3P, with a record 56–26. LeBron James: 30.0 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 7.2 APG, 1.8 SPG, 1.1 BPG, 48% FG, 32% 3P, with the record 45–37. Amar’e Stoudemire: 25.2 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 1.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 2.1 BPG, 59% FG, 16% 3P, with the record 55–27. Kobe is an Extremely Inefficient player. Kobe Bryant has an Career Field Goal Percentage of 44.7%. Kobe Bryant, despite being a versatile scorer, has thelowest field goal percentageamong the Top 15 All-Time Career Scorers. Kobe Bryant has scored a total 33,643 Points, off 26,200 Shots. In Comparison, Karl Malone has scored a total of 36,928 Points, off 26,210 Shots. Which means, Karl Malone has taken 10 more shots than Kobe Bryant, but has scored 3,285 more points. Kobe has the Most Career Field Goals Missed. Kobe has missed 14,481 Shots in his career, which happens to be 1,064 more than the next player, John Havlicek. Kobe Bryant hold the record with the Most Missed Shotsin a single game with 30 while shooting just 36% against the Boston Celtics in 2002. In the Top 100 for most field goals missed in a game, Kobe hold 25 of those spots, making for a quarter of the total. Kobe Bryant is NOT a clutch player. Kobe does have some great moments in the clutch, but individual moments do not mean he is a great clutch performer. Kobe Bryant missed the last 15 straight game-tying/go-ahead FG in final 5 seconds of 4th quarter/OT of his career, and his last game-winner was in March 2012. Kobe Bryant has a Field-Goal Percentage of 29.1%, over his career, on game-tying or go ahead shots in the last 24 seconds of a game, over his career, only making 48 out of 164 attempts Kobe Bryant has received multiple Undeserved All-Star Selections. Kobe Bryant has been selected to the All-Star Game in the years 2014 and 2016, for which he was undeserving. He received these on the basis of legacy, rather than on performance. His stats for these seasons were: In 2014, Kobe Bryant played a total of 6 games, where he averaged just 13.8 PPG, 4.3 RPG and 6.3 APG. In 2016, Kobe averaged 17.6 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 2.8 APG. Kobe has been gifted Multiple Championships by Referees. Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, whether knowingly or unknowingly, have been subject to some of the most blatantly rigged NBA Playoff games, in history. 2002 Western Conference Finals In Game 6, of a tight western conference finals against the Sacramento Kings, where the reigning champion Lakers were facing elimination, the Lakers received a ridiculous27 Free-Throws, in the fourth quarter, compared to the Kings’ 9. Watch the video below to see for yourself: 2010 NBA Finals In Game 7 of the NBA finals against the Boston Celtics, Kobe shot a disgusting 6 of 24 from the field. However, thanks to the 15 Free-Throwshanded to him by the referees, compared to the whole Boston Celtics team got 17 Free-Throws, Kobe won his 5th Ring. Watch the following video to see yourself: Now I am not saying Kobe is not a legend, I am simply saying that he is given much more credit than some of his more deserving contemporaries. He deserves to be compared to players like John Stocktonand Reggie Miller who are fantastic players, but NOT All-Time Greats like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  Tough question because most basketball experts do not overrate him. Most place him somewhere in the top 10–15. That’s about right. But most young basketball fans do overrate him. Many put him in the top 5. Those that do usually do not have strong knowledge of basketball history; usually overrate individual play; and usually overrate athleticism. Players that are definitely ahead of Kobe: Jordan, Magic Johnson, Jabbar, Russell, Chamberlain, Lebron James In my view, none of these are worth debating versus Kobe. Players that are probably ahead of Kobe: Duncan, O’Neal, Bird, Olajuwon, Robertson Players that are close and/or may finish their careers as close: West, Durant, Curry, Moses Malone So, in my view, Kobe is 12th at highest. Or somewhere in the 10–14 range. That’s still great. So what I say next does not diminish him but only puts him in context versus the other great players. Kobe Bryant is definitely the most selfish and least likable teammate of anyone on the list. (Chamberlain is close on the selfish front. Robertson is close on the least likable front). When I engage in these discussions with my fellow GMs, we set up the ground rule as who would I want on my team for 5 years. This is an important distinction because character/personality become increasingly important over time. Indeed, Kobe would likely be in the top ten if this was a single game or single series. Shaq is another guy that loses ground in this area. At his peak, he was crazy dominant but his laziness and selfishness are draining after a period of time. As a contrast, Duncan and Magic are rated higher than their athleticism might indicate because they are the ultimate team guys. But Kobe’s character deflates his teammates, unlike the majority of those ahead of him who elevate their teammates. Over time, team chemistry decreases. And, of course, losses or implosion occur. Is Kobe overrated by young NBA fans, yes. "
"I'm not arguing against that fact, but as you said, perception is the difference. And perception is entirely derived from context. The facts are that Kevin Durant, arguably the 2nd best player in the league at the time, maybe 3rd, decided to leave his competitive, championship-contending team in OKC to join the regular season record-setting 73-9 Warriors teams who had been to the Finals twice in a row, also the same team that knocked his out of the playoffs. Those are hard facts. And that's why the sub shits on him. Kawhi held out on his team in San Antonio which is a punk move in itself, but is not the same ""anti-competitive"" move that KD made. That's why KD saying the same thing would get him shit on. He knew he'd face the backlash when he made the decision. "
"Your telling me that GSW is holding him back? Wtf? The only person I can see in golden state rn that’s holding him back statistically is Kevin Durant cus curry is no longer the 1st option. And no I don’t buy the whole curry brings the system to a team thing cus Golden State went from losing in the first round of the playoffs to winning the championship, and then going 73-9 all with pretty much the same roster (adding Shaun Livingston which was obviously a huge pickup). That’s not cus curry finally figured out how to play that’s cus they got a brilliant coach in Steve Kerr that implemented a brilliant system designed to help steph curry flourish. I’m not saying steph is a system player, steph is amazing with or without the system. I’m saying steph is able to produce crazy numbers because of that system. "
"My top 10 is:  1.Lebron James  2.Kevin Durant  3.Stephen Curry  4.Anthony Davis  5.Kawhi Leonard  6.Giannis Antetokounmpo 7.Kyrie Irving  8.James Harden 9.Chris Paul 10.Russell Westbrook   In my opinion, Embiid has top 10 talent he just hasn’t done enough in the NBA yet. "
"Well, relative to his regular season domination, he definitely underperformed.   He didn't win Finals MVP in 2015, got shut down in 2016, and got the best of Kevin Durant in 2017 and 2018, while also having a few blunders.   Great player, but we always expected more of him in the finals and he pretty much didn't live up to his performance in the reg season and play-offs. "
&gt; If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light  &gt;&gt; - Lady Gaga  &gt;&gt;&gt; - Kevin Durant
Isn't that Kevin Durant 
He's also playing with Kevin Durant. Voters aren't likely to vote for him. Makes him a dark horse.  Curry is 7th or 8th favorite to win MVP depending on sites.
"It's probably hit or miss.  I respect the shit out of Kevin Durant and -loved- that early Thunder squad, but as a fan of basketball the sport, has it been difficult to fully embrace him?  Yeah I mean, I'm a sports fan too.  It's been so cool seeing him mesh with the team, but would I be devastated if he left this summer, giving us a few more years of vintage Splash Bros/more competition overall?  Nope.  "
"Ironically, it seems you're missing their point. Nobody misunderstands the things Kevin Durant says, give people more credit. KD gets clowned cause he lets people know the things they say on the internet affect him, and he's developed this annoying persecution complex. He fans the flame just as much as his ""haters"".  "
"I mean lets take a look at what Sean Marks has done:  Traded Thad Young for the draft pick used to select Caris LeVert  Traded Bojan Bogdanovic for a bad contract (Andrew Nicholson) and the draft pick used to select Jarrett Allen  Traded Justin Hamilton (not in the NBA anymore) for DeMarre Carroll and the draft picks that turned into the Nets 2 new rookies (Dzanan Musa and Rodions Kurucs)  Traded Brook Lopez and a draft pick (used to select Kyle Kuzma) for D'Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov  Traded Andrew Nicholson for Allen Crabbe (Crabbe is overpaid, but his contract is same length as Nicholson and Nicholson was literally not playable.  Crabbe makes $18M per year for his production but if the Nets hadn't traded for him, Nicholson would be on the bench costing $6M per year for the same length of time)  Gave Dinwiddie a chance to show the league that he belongs on an NBA roster, Dinwiddie responded by finishing top 3 in Most Improved Player  Traded Trevor Booker for a high value 2nd round pick (2019 NYK unprotected) as well as Okafor/Stauskas, who ended up not working out  Signed Tyler Zeller to a minimum contract then traded him for a 2nd rounder when it was apparent that Jarrett Allen was ready to play  Traded Mozgov, the 2nd rounder from the Zeller trade, and their own 2021 2nd rounder for Dwight Howard.  Howard was bought out, but this move saved the Nets from having to pay Mozgov through 2020.  The Nets now have over $65M in cap space in 2019, keeping Mozgov would've severely limited the financial flexibility of next offseason  Traded Jeremy Lin and Isaiah Whitehead for Denver's 1st and 2nd rounders in a salary dump (Kenneth Faried and Darrell Arthur)  Traded Darrell Arthur for Jared Dudley and a 2nd rounder  Kept a core of 8 players who combined for over 76% of Nets minutes in 2017-18 while adding quality free agents on fair contracts (Ed Davis, Shabazz Napier, Treveon Graham  Which front office in the league has made better moves in that time span?  Only ones I can think of is Toronto for acquiring Kawhi Leonard, Golden State for acquiring Kevin Durant/Boogie Cousins, Houston for trading for CP3, and Boston for trading for Kyrie/signing Horford &amp; Hayward."

Kevin Durant ruined Westbrooks lmao. cant do shit without him
Donovan Mitchell has not been a free agent yet. We've seen a lot of small market guys move ranging from Kevin Durant to Kawhi Leonard.
"NBA constantly advertises their star players, signature shoes, and media constantly talks about them. It's always ""Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and the Warriors"" or ""Kristaps Porzingis and the Knicks"". They attach players to everything. "
"Well Kawhi and Lebron on the team would be able to compete with the Kd Warriors in the same way Kyrie and Lebron were able to compete with the original Warriors. Once Kawhi flees the icebergs of Toronto for LA Lebron and Kawhi will take turns scoring on the Warriors and the Warriors will be helpless.  Curry will choke as usual, the Warriors will lose, and Kevin Durant will take the hardest road and join the Lakers in the summer. "
I don't see a world in which Kevin Durant turns down $153 million to go to Warriors

“Kevin Durant” -Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is so soft we gotta write titles like that now?
Kevin Durant has had at least a reasonable case as the 2nd best player in the NBA since 2012. And for the majority of the years I would call it more than reasonable. Basically only a top 2 GOAT of all time has kept him from being the best player of the NBA for many years.   That in fact gets lost on plenty of people. KD this decade has had 1 season of a TS% less than 61%: even in this era on the volume he scores that is historically impressive.  
"""What's a conflict of interest?"" - Kevin Durant probably "
https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/sports/kevin-durant-responds-teens-spicy-instagram-take-headlong-dive-comments-dms-174301583.html   All this kid says is he doesnt elevate his team like brin or curry and he throws a tantrum lol
"It's close, but he fits my top 25, personally.  In no particular order: Kobe, Duncan, Shaq, Mikan, Wilt, LeBron, Moses Malone, Karl Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Michael Jordan, Kareem, Bill Russell, Julius Erving, David Robinson, Kevin Garnett, Oscar Robertson, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, John Stockton, Bob Petit, George Gervin... 24 players I'd comfortably take over Wade. "
Holy... i thought that was kevin durant
"Yes, there are extremely low volume scorers who thrive usually off offensive rebounds and lobs, but Towns isn't one of them. It's just not possible to create the kinds of shots these players are capable of finishing at a high enough volume to center your offense around them. If you limit by players averaging at least 15 PPG, here are the leaders in true shooting last season %:  |Player| |:-| |Stephen Curry| |Karl-Anthony Towns| |Kevin Durant| |LeBron James| |James Harden| |J.J. Redick| |Kevin Love| |Anthony Davis| |Kyrie Irving| |Julius Randle| |Chris Paul| |Nikola Jokic| |Kyle Lowry| |Giannis Antetokounmpo| |Klay Thompson|  So you have 7 guards, 5 center/forward or forward/centers and 3 forwards. That's pretty balanced and if anything favors perimeter players.  But yeah, if you take out the points filter, you add a bunch of both 3pt specialists and rim runners/offensive rebounders to the list."
He is often caught not paying attention even in the playoffs. Kevin Durant clapping in his face this comes to mind after Curry missed a switch. And Draymond is occasionally angry at Steph for not communicating on defense and paying attention.
Kevin Durant is a pussy.  David Stern is 20x the commish Adam Silver is.  
"Imagine that, they'll forever be known as the franchise that drafted Greg Oden and then have the next team took Kevin Durant with the next pick...themselves. good look tryna fix that mistale"
"The thing is, when people say that the rockets got worse by losing ariza, it isnt by losing ariza himself, but rather losing what Ariza *did*. Finding a guy that can give that ampunt of effort to guarding Kevin Durant is tough and almost impossible over a 7 game series. And no one else is anywhere near him in terms of ability to bother durant (as miniscule as the effect is) besides possibly tucker, who would ideally come off the bench as a fresh body to contain dursnt while ariza could rest"
"Actually Kerr put him in this conversation.  Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr isn't playing favorites, but he also isn't shy about naming the best player on his stacked title squad.  &amp;#x200B;  Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  &amp;#x200B;  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins.""  &amp;#x200B;  Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer.  &amp;#x200B;  ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game.""  &amp;#x200B;  The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible.  &amp;#x200B;  ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said.  &amp;#x200B;  ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill.  &amp;#x200B;  ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league.  &amp;#x200B;  ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."""
I blame Kevin Durant for this horrible post. I just feel like somehow it's his fault.

Yeah but they have Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant
i’d be flummoxed too if kevin durant was taking discounts to work for me but this guy was asking more
"Right, because Harden was the exact same player in 2012 and those are the only two possible explanations.   They totally should've predicted that Kevin Durant -- an MVP who helped them get within one game of making the finals against a 73-win team -- would leave to join the Warriors.  They obviously made a huge mistake with the Harden situation, but you can only say that they traded away an MVP using hindsight. It was a bad move at the time and it looks worse now, but it's not like they were a lottery team from 2012-2016. Like a bunch of other teams, they gambled and lost. It happens. "
Kevin Durant honestly
"We've already broken down 2013, and how i disagree with your view here. Durant had the superior offensive cast and i explained why. Even if Westbrook wasn't as good as he would later on develop to be, he was still a good all-star level player. Kevin Martin was also better than anyone Harden had in 2017.  &gt;Durant did similar WITHOUT the shooting around him those guys had.  Are you sure? Because basketball reference says that the Thunder were 3rd in the league in 3PT% in 2013. Kevin Martin and Thabo Sefolosha shot 42% from outside the arc. Fisher and Ibaka were decent as well at 35%. 2017 Rockets had Anderson at 40%, Bev at 38%, Gordon at 37% and Ariza at 34%. They did shoot way more threes though, but that's also because of Harden's ability to facilitate.  In 2016, Westbrook was very close to Durant in terms of value given to that offense. No doubt. Also, the Thunder I believe were the best offensive rebounding team that year, which adds to the overall ORtg. Kanter, Adams were absolutely massive on off. boards. Ibaka was solid as well. Westbrook was one of the best, if not the best off. rebounding guard in the league. Roberson was decent. Houston were ranked #7.  Harden didn't have anyone even close to Westbrook's level to relieve the pressure of him offensively. Yet, he still led the 7th best offense that year with basically Ariza and Beverley as the only positive offensive players. That's insane to me. Also, let's not forget this was the year where Houston was imploding left and right. There was the whole Ty Lawson debacle in the beginning of the season which went to shit as he played like one of the worst players in the league. Corey Brewer played the 5th most minutes for them that year. They were making desperation signings ala Michael Beasley, Marcus Thornton and even freaking Josh Smith. That team was very much in shambles, unlike Durant/Westbrook/Ibaka who had played together and had chemistry since 2010, also Adams/Roberson were pretty familiar with the team at this point as well.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;"

"The same Grizzlies that knocked the defending Western Conference champions OKC Thunder and hugely marketable star Kevin Durant in 2013, get a grip. "
"In the 2018 finals LeBron was #1 in points, #3 in rebounds, #1 in assists, #4 in blocks, and #3 in steals (again, among ALL PLAYERS). He registered a 34.0/8.5/10.0/1.0/1.3 statline. What's more, he got those 10 assists with J.R. Smith (.317 FG%) George Hill (.323), and Jeff Green (.286) playing starter minutes, and Kyle Korver (16 MPG) going 1/16 **in the series**. Kevin Durant also played well, especially on defense, but LeBron was unquestionably still the most important player on the floor, and likely the best as well."
"&gt; News that George had agreed to a four-year, $137 million contract traveled fast, though not to Thunder center Steven Adams. “I don’t keep up with that s---, mate,” Adams says. “I’m f------ terrible. I just show up and whoever’s on the team, cool.”   I just imagine Steven Adams showing up the season after Durant left and wondering ""where is Kevin at?""  and then this year with everybody being excited that Paul George is back and Steven just greeting him in a normal way like ""hey mate, how was your summer?"" with complete disregard to the fact that it was assumed to be a one year deal.

Are you fucking telling me that Yao Ming is the best Chinese Basketball player because of his skills and hard work? The odds of that being the case are 0.000000000000001%.  The truth is he is the best Chinese Basketball player because of his height.   Even if tomorrow there's a 6'9'' Chinese Basketball player that becomes better than him it wouldn't mean that skills and hard work are more important than height.   The best Basketball player is Lebron, he is 6'8'', maybe just 0.1% of the population is taller than 6'7''.   Kevin Durant is 7 foot tall and he is the second best NBA player.  Stephen Curry is 6'3'' (very tall), he is, by far, the most skilled NBA player and one the hardest workers and it's hard to say that he is the 3rd best Basketball player, there are other guys who are better than him but are playing for shitty teams.   &gt; Because there are hundreds of millions of basketball fans and most of them are NOT NBA HEIGHT.   I'm just saying that people tend to like meritocracies in sports, which is why Basketball will always be far away from being the most popular sport in the world.   &gt; Giving you 3 names literally isn't even relevant to the argument.  Yeah, it's irrelevant because you cannot even answer such an easy question about a sport that according to you is about skills and hard work and not about being tall. "

"If I was blind, I wouldn’t be able to read Durant saying exactly that multiple times:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-says-russell-westbrook-had-nothing-to-do-with-leaving-thunder/amp/  https://mobile.twitter.com/barstoolsports/status/909773195573686275 "
"Find it pretty bizarre that you say Westbrook has had post season failures with Kevin Durant when he's been to more WCF's than Dirk has and has a finals appearance himself. Dirk is the better player, but the ""underwhelming playoff runs"" are indeed comparable, with last season's first round exit being the one anomaly. Especially considering the OP is asking whether or not Russ could go on to win a ring in the future."
"I don't think the ""underwhelming playoff runs"" are comparable. Before the 2011 Championship, Dirk made 2 WCSFs and the WCF alongside Nash and Finley, then made the Finals, 2 WCSFs and 3 first round exits with Jason Terry as his second best player. Westbrook had post season failures with Kevin Durant (an MVP), James Harden (6MOY, comparable to or even better than Mavs Jason Terry), Ibaka (DPOY contender, borderline all star), Paul George (Top 10 player) and Carmelo Anthony (not great but still better than most teammates Dirk has had).   Dirk has had so much more success with so much less in terms of teammates. Dirk has never played with a HOF player in their prime, yet still managed to lead Dallas to twelve 50 win seasons, sixteen 0.500 seasons, 2 finals appearances in an incredibly tough conference. I think both are loyal to their franchise, but thats about it. "

""Kevin Durant!  The poise, the consistency, the smoothness, the skill, the length, the athleticism, the talent.""  I find him far, FAR more annoying than JVG's sometimes amusing rants.   Doris Burke though, hell yes."
Take that last sentence and make it twice as potent and you have Kevin Durant.
"That's true, but I still don't think that means no one has a chance. If adding Kevin Durant to a 73 win team didn't make them unbeatable then I doubt Boogie will."
"You and a lot of other NBA fans have a strange belief that hand-eye coordination is not really a genetic attribute. Yes, you can hone hand-eye  coordination through practice, but at the end of the day, each person will have a coordination ceiling. Otherwise we could all be pro-golfers with enough practice.   To your other point, big men running and handling like guards is not new in the slightest. Magic Johnson played point guard; Larry Bird handled the ball and could shoot lights out; Dirk was a paradigmatic big man shooter; Andre Kirilenko was a 6’11 point forward, and the list goes on.   The reason you haven’t seen a Kevin Durant-type player before is because Durant is a ridiculous freak, not because he’s just playing a new style.  Anthony Davis grew up playing guard but can no longer play like a guard *because playing like a guard at that height is insanely difficult.*  "
"First, who exactly do you think has the innate  skills? I can’t think of another player who moves like him at that size and length. Maybe Giannis.   Second, if there were multiple players who could be like Durant if they focused on guard skills, there would be multiple Kevin Durants. Coaches would teach them guard skills. It’s not just them being ignorant about guard play. Giannis focuses on guard skills and looks nothing like Durant. "
"http://www.nba.com/2016/news/03/01/joe-johnson-says-he-wants-to-finish-career-in-miami.ap/  Bron never publicly stated it but he had absolutely intended to stay in Miami and pulled out in the last possible moment.

"You're just using supermax interchangeably with large amount. Jimmy Butler will have 8 years of service. Maxes are slotted based on year's of service, the supermax is by hitting certain criteria you can jump up and get the %s of the level above you earlier on. There's a year 5 max, a year 7 max, and a year 10 max. So Wiggins extends at max at 30 million a year for 5 years, Towns does the same but his max will be around 38 million on average for 5 years (think he needs 1 more all nba or dpoy to secure it otherwise he'll be closer to 35 on average).   Steph Curry hit the designation, so after 8 years he was able to sign for 40 million on average. Kevin Durant also fulfills that criteria, but as a 10+ year vet now with full Bird Rights his average would be around 45 million a year over 5 years if he stays in Golden State this summer. So Jimmy Butler by not qualifying is looking at somewhere below 38 million a year max, and closer to 35 million if he switches team's without retaining his bird rights. So if he signs somewhere new over the summer he's looking around 4 years 140, or if he re-signs with whichever team he's on by then closer to 5 years 180. All of these numbers are tied to the cap which we can only speculate on until the league gives the team's exact figures closer to July, but the percentages of the cap and of yearly raises are fixed."
Lol i domt get it.  This is what happens when Kevin Durant snakes out andnjoins rhw warriors because he is a mental midget.  That mentality filters down even to the fans now.  Fans would rather tank and lose and have low expectations than see their team be a fringe contender with high expectations.  The league has become PUSSIFIED.  I literally enjoy and respect the women in the WNBA more because they are mentally tougher and actually suck up their situations without complaining.  Just look at Sue Bird.  She is ten times tougher than KD and KAT combined.
"Curry and Durant would be two of the favorites, but cancel each other out in theory. James Harden is unlikely to have the best stats, and guys rarely win it back to back. Chris Paul probably isn't MVP worthy. Celtics are very balanced, and Kyrie Irving is unlikely to have MVP stats that put him over guys like Curry.   From there, we end up with:  * Kawhi Leonard * Joel Embiid * Giannis Antekoumpo  One of these players will probably be on the 1st or 2nd seed in the conference. So if they go traditional, whichever one of those guys ends up on a 1 or 2 seed, possibly even 3 seed if they win 55+ games will probably get it. My money would be on Giannis in this scenario.  I think Lebron is a decent bet. He would get it as the 3rd seed imo with mid 50's wins. The media wants to give it to him, but the question of whether the Lakers are good enough remains. I agree that Davis' team isn't good enough to get him in the conversation.  Some dark horses would be Jimmy Butler, Victor Oladipo, and Paul George (if he keeps them good while Westbrook is out), but most of these players generally fall short of the stats you expect from MVP.  The problem is that Curry/Durant would be the traditional MVP winners, but they're on the same team.   My bets would be placed in this order:  1. Giannis Antekoumpo 2. Lebron James 3. Stephen Curry 4. Kevin Durant 5. Kawhi Leonard"
"You're missing the point...  You're the one who is brushing off the whole entire reason why Durant was able to put up that type of performance. Because he played off the pressure the Splash brothers gravity (mainly Curry) and the playmaking prowess of Curry, Draymond, Iggy created. He enjoyed that luxury, to an extent no player in NBA history ever has.  Like I said, Curry could definitely replicate that type of performance... IF HE WASNT FUCKING GUARDED BY THE ENTIRE TEAM EVERY POSSESSION REGARDLESS IF HE HAD THE BALL OR NOT. You clone Curry, make the whole opposing team guard him and put the other Curry clone in place of Durant and watch him go to work...   Again, not taking anything away from Durant, he did better than most people would in that role, indeed, but that doesn't make him a better player than any of the guys i mentioned. Most of those guys are great scorers in their own right, so it's not unimaginable for them to put up 35 ppg on great efficiency or completely wrecking the other team in other ways if they're barely being guarded on offense.   The point remains that Durant can't be as good of an offensive catalyst for a team than LeBron, Curry, Durant or CP3 can, he doesn't have the skillset. He can be an elite one, but not as good as those guys (with comparable talent).   Durant had Westbrook in 2013, who despite his flaws, is still an elite offensive players. And Kevin Martin who was clearly better than anything Harden had in 2017. Ryan Anderson was the 2nd best offensive player Harden had in 2017 and he was more comparable to Sefolosha than Westbrook or Martin. You really think what Durant did with that OKC team in 2013 is more impressive than what Harden did in 2017? I don't. Also, Harden led the #1 offense last season. The addition of CP3 was absolutely huge, but he missed a lot of games and they needed to build the synergy from the ground up. Durant had already a year with GSW under his belt, and couldn't do better than Harden with that Warriors team. Curry missed games, but CP3's absence should've hindered Harden a lot more than Durant not having Curry, but that didn't seem to be the case.  Nah, you just seem to be a guy who overvalues scoring and undervalues other aspects of offense. Which is honestly what most people do, since correlating scoring with how good someone is offensively has been done since the dawn of basketball.   &amp;#x200B;"
"The worst thing is when they compare them to current superstars, showing they don't understand how unique that superstar is. Ingram isn't the next Kevin Durant because we probably won't see another guy like that in 20-25 years."

"Don't forget,  C. J. McCollum  has a nice podcast as well. Talks about life in the league, work outs and evaluates players. Occasionally has NBA guests like Damian Lillard and Kevin Durant to name a few. Check it out!"
"I see Kevin Durant a lot, but it should be Snake."
Imagine leaving Kevin Durant open because some 6’3 guy chewing on his mouth guard just crossed half court with only one guy on him. Impact on the court has to be Curry. 
"without Steph Curry's intangibles, the Warriors would never have been able to recruit or incorporate Kevin Durant to the extent that they have  so yeah, intangibles are pretty important."
"You are forgetting Giannis' [humongous hands](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/ftw/2018/06/05/giannis-antetokounmpo-shows-off-his-freakishly-big-hands-in-amazing-photo/111171928/). Bruno's are normal for his size like Kevin Durant or Giannis' younger brother (drafted by Dallas' with the 60th pick).   EDIT: My point is that Giannis wasn't very good in basic basketball skills when he was drafted. If Bruno would have learned as much it would be a legit NBA player. However, he wouldn't be in the same level as Giannis, that's true. However, nobody drafted Giannis' brother before Dallas, so maybe teams aren't eager to draft long athletic dudes that don't know how to play basketball very well anymore."
"I think there's a decent case to be made for Oladipo being better last season. Derrick Rose was the beneficiary of being the leading scorer on a very good Chicago team in an age before the basketball media was savvy with advanced stats. The Bulls were still able to make the playoffs every season after he tore his ACL until his return, even being able to win a series without him, and they finished 3 seed the one year (when they lost to the Wizards in the first round?). Rose was good, helped push them up to contender, but really wasn't MVP caliber.  I don't think he would win that MVP if you had modern voting tendencies going into it. Dwight Howard was absolutely robbed that year, but Lebron, Pau Gasol, Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, and Dwyane Wade were all pretty clearly better, even if they didn't have the narrative going for them.  The Rose season is always a sore spot, especially since those two years were the high point of the post MJ years. Even among the Bulls fandom now though, a decent amount of people can recognize that Butlers 16-17 season is actually the best individual season since Jordan."

"You do not want to go further because you believe they are on the same level when they are not, lol. But you are clearly not interested in arguing in good faith anyway given your characterisations of Lebron’s opponents or his teammates (the gall shown by suggesting Lebron “disappointed” by only winning one game and narrowly losing two more against a 73-win team which upgraded its worst starter into *Kevin Durant* and proceeded to set the playoff win percentage record utterly removes any remaining claim you could have offered to being slightly objective or unbiased).  However, one claim here is so especially nonsensical that I would actually feel bad if I did not address it.  &gt;	Note nobody from the early 2000's to mid 2000's really features in advanced stat rankings despite that era having a solid collection of talent in Kobe, Duncan, Shaq, Young Lebron, Nash, Kidd, and TMac.  Lol, Shaq and Nash fare incredibly well in those rankings. Lebron fares well relative to his age (fittingly fantastic but not quite the all-timer he would become in the late ‘00s). Duncan fares very well in the playoffs and respectably well in the regular season, which was basically his reputation anyway.  You keep trying to act like Kobe is not the only outlier, but he really is. Lebron is simply better by basically every metric, and no amount of shallow narrative manipulation changes that.  Oh, and for posterity: no, I do not think Kobe’s 2004 is as large a knock on him as 2011 was for Lebron, but it also does not need to be for Lebron to still be obviously better."
Kevin Durant
What are you talking about? Obviously Kevin Durant is the best player on the warriors and kyrie does not play for golden state
"No no, not when Kevin Durant’s In the same finals as kyrie. Kyrie is good but he’s not Kevin Durant good. Kyrie wasn’t even the best player on his team in the finals. So idk how he’s gonna leap over Durant jst like that. "

"Kevin Durant joins OKC, AFTER, they win a finals. Lmao."
"Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Steven Adams, Russel Westbrook, and after a finals win with that team, Kevin Durant again. Oh man, a fan can dream"
"You say this, but I bet you don't have Kevin Durant as a top 5 player of all-time."
"Kawhi Leonard is my bet.  But, like it or not, I think Kevin Durant has a decent chance as well.  I think Durant has a better chance than LeBron, not because he's necessarily better, but because his team is far, far better."
"KD should go to Orlando if we draft RJ Barrett  RJ Barrett, Jonathan Isaac, Kevin Durant, Aaron Gordon, Mo Bamba with Jonathon Simmons and Evan Fournier off the bench."
"Chris Paul vs Stephen Curry, James Harden vs Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler vs Kevin Durant, PJ Tucker vs Draymond Green, Clint Capela vs DeMarcus Cousins (potentially not at full strength). If the Rockets stay healthy I really like their chances with this squad. "
"I don't think you understand how players like Butler have influence over an organization. The TimberWolves traded a number 7 pick, and two young talented players in Dunn and Levine for Butler. If Butler expresses his desire to be traded, it is in the best interest for the team to do so because otherwise he will walk in free agency. In that scenario, the TimberWolves will have lost the pick and two lottery players for nothing. You never let a player of Jimmy's caliber just leave in free agency if you can prevent it, because you can receive quite a good haul of assets in a trade for him. See the Kawhii Leonard or Kevin Durant situations as an example. "
"We've acquired Lebron, Anthony Davis+Kevin Durant in one offseason . Expecting big things"
"Facts. Up until Curry hit that half court 3 pointer vs. The Thunder and Westbrook hit his game winner vs. The Nuggets I thought this was the best buzzer beater I had ever seen in my life. Anthony Davis, probably the tallest guy on the court, hits a DOUBLE CLUTCH FADEAWAY 3, over Kevin Durant (the reigning MVP) and Robertson (OKCs best defender) **on the road** to win the game. Shit was incredible."
"Call me crazy, but on a dynastic championship team, I think Kawhi is a good #2 option. Kevin Durant too. "
"Their play style was heavily based around quick ball movement and cuts to the rim with specific use of Andrew Bogut's elite screening (controversial at the time) to free up the splash bros. They are a relatively more iso-centric team since Kevin Durant joined but back then they where all time historic in assists per game with 29!      .       One thing that other teams failed to execute in their play style to pin down the Warriors was that while the Warriors where renowned for their elite scoring they where actually 5th in the league defensively as well. Another thing is that teams had to be completely ready from the get go. This might sound obviously but teams had to be active the whole game. IIRC 4 of the Warriors losses in the regular season where by over 15 and only 2 by a single possession. This is because a lot of the time even when the Warriors weren't playing well they would still be within around 8 points in the last quarter. Of course with their high 3 point volume this meant they where always only a couple shots away from retaking the lead.     .      Obviously Curry had an outstanding season but one of the underrated parts of that team was Draymond Green breaking out. He averaged 14/10/8 with outstanding defence and had a legit argument for top 10. Plus he was actually being able to shoot knocking down 39% of his threes. Another important thing to note is the Warriors during the regular season had a good run with injuries with their big three of Curry, Klay and Dray only missing 6 games between them.   .      Guys like Ezeli, Livingston, Barbosa and Speights also played really well to lead the bench and the team was extremely well rounded and deep at all positions. I think that would be one thing that would make the record so tough to break is that the Warriors weren't necessarily top heavy and could win games when their stars where off.   .        They ultimately lost the series but an example of this depth is game 1 of the finals where Curry and Thompson only combined for 20 points between them but their bench players in  Livingston (20), Barnes (13), Igoudala (12) and Barbosa (11) combined for 56 points."
"It's a fairly new phenomenon caused by the large number of max slots and the relatively low cap for a max, so your superstars and sorta-kinda-stars are earning pretty similar amounts.  If Kevin Durant hadn't joined the Warriors they would still be good, but not such a sure thing. And then assuming the Warriors would have lost one of Klay Thompson or Draymond Green in 2019 free agency, there is relative parity again."
"The reason for the current Warriors superteam is a combination of 3/5 of their best players being drafted by the team and being re-signed to team friendly deals before they really became stars. The NBA makes it so that the salary cap is directly proportionate to the amount of money the league makes.   In 2016 there was a pretty substantial cap spike due to what I think was a new TV deal. So a lot of teams had plenty of money to play with. Kevin Durant(top 3 player in the league) took this opportunity to join the already title contender Warriors. So that was when they became pretty much unstoppable. They also signed DeMarcus Cousins (skilled big man and all star) to a vet min contract because he is coming off an Achilles tear. He had other offers but it seems he wants to use this year to win a ring, rehab with no pressure and set himself up for a bigger payday next year.   Tl;dr it’s not usually this unbalanced, it’s just a perfect storm that worked out really well for Golden State. When it comes time for them to give everyone fair value, they’ll probably have to let some of their stars go or try to get them to sign team friendly deals.   I don’t know the specifics of this but the longer a team above the salary cap, the more it costs them per year.  "

I feel like jimmy's response is him trying to be competitive and trying to bring out the best in his teammates. Kevin durant didn't do a competitive thing but is trying to bring out the best in himself.
Wardell Stephen Curry II  Kevin Wayne Durant
"Team dynamics go south quickly when the best players aren't the highest paid. For as much credit as the Warriors got for Steph's second contract, Golden State might have been in trouble if coming off that 15-16 loss in the Finals Harrison Barnes had been their highest paid player. Draymond in particular could have had an issue making $15M with Harry B making $22M that season. Kevin Durant restored order to their financial hierarchy while waiting for Steph to finally get what he was owed starting in 17-18."

Debatable whether he should count for OP's exercise.  Especially since OP said he was just using google to avoid any controversy about debated heights, eg Jokic was 6'10 until recently but now he's listed 7'0, Embiid is suspected to be 7'2 275 but is listed 7'0 250. Not necessarily correct, but a consistent standard at least.  &gt; disclaimer: many actual heights of these players are often disputed. the heights you see listed are results of a Google search for each player's height.  &gt; also I only listed players who are currently active and not listed as sidelined i.e. KP, Dwight, Dirk"

"OAKLAND, CA -- In an intense interview on Wednesday evening, Golden State star Kevin Durant put an end to rumors he would be leaving the Warriors to team up with NBA superstar LeBron James in Los Angeles.    ""Hell no"", Durant said. ""That was all false. All false. 100 percent false.""    Durant, who gave the interview wearing a custom-made Lakers jersey with his name and number on the back, went on to assure Warriors fans and press alike of his commitment to the team.    ""That aint me"", the nine-time All Star said. ""I'm not about to just up and leave my team. I would never do that.""    The 2017 NBA finals MVP, who gave the interview from his Bay Area home, answered questions as a crew of movers were seen packing various home items behind him. Between questions, a nonchalant Durant addressed the moving crew. ""Be careful with that TV"", Durant said to one mover. ""That one is going in my living room in LA.""    ""Anyway,"" Durant continued, ""I'm here for good. I'm just taking it day by day, focusing on what I have on my schedule today."" Durant's Google Home was then heard turning on, saying ""You have one event on your schedule today. Your flight from SFO to LAX leaves at 6:50 PM."""

Confused with the Lakers defense. Why is Luke Walton throwing double teams at Kevin Durant? Can't see this being a viable strategy when top coaches like Ty Lue would never do so.

&gt;Kevin Durant reacted vociferously  **VOCIFEROUSLY**
"  Butler is better, more experienced and tougher than anyone else on that Wolves roster. So he can bully them in practice, it's not surprising. He also has every right to, because if KAT really doesn't want someone like Butler on his team, than he wants to feed his own ego more, than to win basketball games. That's just really embarrassing, and quite pathetic  &gt;   That's why GSW is so far ahead as a team.. So many all stars/superstars, yet they keep their personal ego on check, and only want to win games. That's how they got Kevin Durant, and now Cousins"

If you think Irving is supposed to carry them to the finals then you're delusional.   Are you a fan of KD?:  &gt; If Kevin Durant couldn't make Westbrook and a bunch of long, athletic and talented role players work as an unstoppable scoring machine then he's not as good as he thinks he is."
Doncic didnt do well against Ben at all lmao. He literally couldnt do jack shit. Ayton played against the best team NBA has ever seen with 3 of their starters playing 24 minutes and still scored most of his points in the first half against them. He literally played 1 on 1 and scored on Kevin Durant twice. 1 was a mid range jumper and other one was a straight up post-up play.   Ayton will win the ROTY by a mile by averaging a double doble in his rookie season while Doncic wont even be getting decent minutes by the mid-season.

"What are you trying to get at? You mean the 5 All Star team of Steve Nash, Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Ron Artest and Dwight Howard isn't the same as Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Demarcus Cousins?"
No doubt. They are just arguably less applicable to NBA athletes. NFL combine results also weigh much heavier into draft position. Guys like Kevin Durant will never blow these tests out of the water but he will dominate guy who do on the court. What I'm trying to say is it's difficult to measure NBA athleticism.   I'm sure crossfit athletes would excell in either combine but few could compete in either sport.

That's rather debatable. About the best player part anyway. Lowry by most metrics was far and away the best player on the Raptors. Those same metrics don't smile very nicely about Derozan whereas Kawhi has an impact similar to Kevin fucking Durant. That upgrade is so massive it could almost be called free really. Then they got Green just thrown in the mix there. &gt;&gt;  It's also of note that Danny Green is either underrated or Derozan is overrated. Both of them actually have comparable impacts on a team. What Derozan suffers from in effeciency and lack of defense Green brings with 3 and D skill sets. Obviously the offense isn't as good but that's what Kawhi was there for. They essentially traded Derozan for Green team impact wise and got Kawhi as a bonus. It's really a stupid high upgrade.

"Kevin Durant ruined great basketball: I was obviously rooting against them, but that 73 win teams was amazing to watch. Now, I expect the Warriors to win every night; I know they won't (every single night), but I expect it and they could. "
"I thought this would be a fun chance for me to look at teams/players that I haven't seen that much of. Did my best but I don't catch as many games as is really needed to do this well. Also any player that was/is injury for a significant time I will judge as if they will be back to full strength. So Hayward will get a pass for the games this year as it has been too short to truly judge him yet. I will also exclude rookies for the top ten. Anyways here's my list:  PG:  1. Stephen Curry 2. Russell Westbrook 3. Chris Paul 4. Damian Lillard 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Kyle Lowry 7. John Wall 8. Ben Simmons 9. Kemba Walker 10. Mike Conley  This is the deepest position for elite talent; for me 4 through 10 are pretty close but there is a good drop to 11, etc. I have Rubio, Dragic, and Bledsoe as the next three. As a note (and this will probably be disregarded due to flair), I think you overrate Lonzo, there are probably 15-20 players I would have above him right now, and it might be more depending on his minutes this year. Not to say he won't end up top ten (he easily could be top ten with an average shot), but right now he is not that close. I'm pretty excited by last year's pg class and think some of them will end up in this top ten in the next couple years (hope one of them is Fox).  &amp;#x200B;  SG:  1. James Harden 2. Jimmy Butler 3. Klay Thompson 4. DeMar DeRozan 5. Victor Oladipo 6. Bradley Beal 7. Jrue Holiday 8. CJ McCollum 9. Donovan Mitchell 10. Devin Booker  I thought this was going to be a weak position group but there are a ton of good SG's right now that make up for the lack of elite SG's. I had Jaylen Brown as a SG and he just missed the cut. He is probably top ten if you put him at SF (Bball ref has him 51/45% SG/SF last year). A couple others were hard to leave out: Lou Williams, Gary Harris, Will Barton, Brown, Tyreek Evans, and JJ Redick were all right there for me. I also think this position will have some up and comers this year. Zach LaVine, Josh Richardson, Buddy Hield, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Josh Hart, and Tim Hardaway Jr are all very good young players at this position.  &amp;#x200B;  SF:  1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Paul George 5. Gordon Hayward 6. Khris Middleton 7. Otto Porter Jr 8. Jayson Tatum 9. Joe Ingles 10. Harrison Barnes  This position has the most top end talent but is relatively shallow after the top guys. My next five were Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Taurean Prince, Brandon Ingram, Robert Covington and Andrew Wiggins. I think Barnes is underrated due to being on a bad team, but I expect he will be outside the top 10 for Prince or Ingram by the end of the year. I have Giannis as a PF.   &amp;#x200B;  PF  1. Anthony Davis 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. LaMarcus Aldridge 4. Draymond Green 5. Kevin Love 6. Blake Griffin 7. Kristaps Porzingis 8. Derrick Favors 9. Nikola Mirotic 10. Tobias Harris  This is the weakest position for me. My next three would be Paul Millsap, Aaron Gordon, and Dario Saric. I feel like I might be missing someone here because that group in just not that good. Millsap two years ago would easily make the top 10 but he slowed down last year. Not sure who else deserve consideration.  &amp;#x200B;  C  1. Joel Embiid 2. Nikola Jokic 3. DeMarcus Cousins 4. Rudy Gobert 5. Karl-Anthony Towns 6. Al Horford 7. Andre Drummond 8. Clint Capela 9. Steven Adams 10. Marc Gasol  Another group that was deeper than I thought. My next four would be Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, Jusuf Nurkic, and Hassan Whiteside. Lots of potential here for some young guys. I think particularly Jarrett Allen and Deandre Ayton have a chance at top ten by the end of the year.   &amp;#x200B;  Let me know why this entirely too long post is wrong!  &amp;#x200B;"

"Your flair -&gt; [GSW] Kevin Durant  The post -&gt; about a good game, crediting (a bit?) the Jazz and the Warriors, excited for more.   And your reply came hastily so... "
"“Kevin Durant is absolutely unstoppable” works too, but I take your point "
"""Behind Kevin Durant?"" Excuse me, this game was all JEREBKO."
Kevin Durant is averaging 33.5 ppg 8.5 rpg 6.5 apg abd 2 bpg shooting over 50%
"2017 definitely KD. For 2018 I can flip a coin. Some people forget (thanks to JR) that in 2018 KD had a completely shitty game 1 . That makes it a wash with Steph's shitty game 3 IMO. While KD had an unimaginable game 3, Steph was excellent in 3 of 4 games, setting the record for 3's in game 2 and a triple double in game 4. I can understand why someone would go with KD but there's an argument for both.  But again, the fact that Steph is in that conversation with Kevin fucking Durant (7 foot guard, best scorer in the league) is there just proves the original point. Steph is so much better than the other PG's in the league and I think it's crazy how overlooked he is by a lot of people. "
Jesus Christ the nostalgia in this thread is just ridiculous. You trying to sit here and tell me with a straight face that Larry Bird is a better 1 on 1 scorer than Kevin Durant? GTFOH

Kevin Durant just got jingled
It's a damn gift that we get to watch Kevin Durant play the game of basketball. This dude is a physical anomaly and it's so fun to watch
Kevin Durant is like a woman in her 30s. Without a ring he'll leave your ass.
"Never forget that one time, Kevin Durant called Kawhi Leonard a system player."
This game is fucking nuts. I love Ingles. Kevin Durant is the stupidest basketball player ever. How the fuck do you make those stupid ass shots? Dummy.
Kevin Durant are you fucking kidding me
Kevin Durant is good at basketball.
Kevin Durant is so lanky it's almost cartoonish. His wingspan is insand
I hate Kevin Durant with a passion
literally no one said this besides kevin durant
At least he’s not Marc Albert calling Kevin Durant Dick Barnett or some shit 
"Curry is a great player, top 5 definitely  However I will give the nod to Kevin Durant every day of the week without hesitation. His scoring ability is unmatched by any person in NBA history to me, he is becoming a better defender and wisely using his length to guard every person he comes across all the while dropping 28 on ya head and you can't do anything about it.   Curry is also a phenomenal player, I think he is better than Harden, Westbrook, Giannis, CP3, whoever you wanna put in front of him, except for Anthony Davis(who I very much came around on being a fucking top 3 player this offseason) and Kawhi(If he returns to what he was pre injury when I legit thought he was the second best player in the world and he has not shown me any reason why not)  Steph Curry is wonderful, no doubt about that. But he is not better than Kevin Durant. And do not bring up his MVPs, one of those are contended bc some believe Harden should have won that first one instead of Steph."
"Kevin Durant is like the best 1 on 1 player, so for some reason, people choose that to rate him over Curry as a player in 5 on 5...even though Curry is clearly much better in the 5 on 5 game. "
Who would win: Pat Mahomes with a machine gun or Kevin Durant?

"I think his most recent was one of the most impressive runs we've ever seen in the NBA. Against a 73-win reigning championship squad, that just knocked off Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, two HOFers in their primes, the previous series... and the Cavs were down 3-1 before a huge comeback. It's hard to top that."

"AJ Styles most intense obsession is the NBA, and it’s grown ever since he introduced himself as LeBron at the TNA ppv Genesis 2010. “It was funny as hell, and the fans flipped out,” American Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle says. “There were people falling from the upper deck to the lower deck when he came out.” (When he met the real LeBron a few months ago, AJ's knees shook.) Today, he’s close friends with several professional players and is dedicated to becoming one after he retires from wrestling, which he hopes won’t be until his mid-40’s.  “I’m actually talking to the people over there now. Adam Silver, he knows me,” AJ says. “I had dinner with [Steve Kerr] two, three days ago. I asked him how long he’s gonna do this and he said ‘as long as Kevin [Durant] goes, I go, and then I’m with you.’ I’m like yes! Seriously. I’m really serious about it.”"
"Kevin Durant to the Warriors: ""You fucking need me!"""
Rumors swirl that Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard are no longer interested in joining Lebron on the Lakers!  
"I'm sure that's true for the actual haters but the doubters have a legitimate case.  Personally, I think Tatum is a sure-thing superstar but I can also appreciate that some might doubt him because he was in such a great system.  It's not a negative exactly but if you compare him to Donovan Mitchell and Ben Simmons who *were* their teams systems then I can appreciate the argument.  I think it's possible for someone to present a decent argument for Jayson Tatum as Tayshaun Prince 2.0 instead of Kevin Durant Jr. even though I personally believe he's a future superstar."
You’re ignoring the fact he went up against the warriors.  In the 4 matchups: Lose without love and Kyrie Win with full squad and best fairytale of all sports Lose because they add kevin fucking Durant Lose without Kyrie after dropping 52 or whatever in game 1  How do you honestly expect him to win any of those finals.  2016 was a miracle.  All 4 years is against a team who had at least 4 all stars before adding Durant.  I guess we will just agree to disagree
Kevin Durant is going to pull his power move this off-season and force a team to Seattle. It won't work. We will laugh. 
Kevin Durant should take note.
"I feel like LeBron bought into his own hype in 2011 too hard, if he had the mindset then that he has now, he would have taken it much more seriously and won that series. I feel like he'd still be in Miami and working on this 6th or 7th title by now if that 2011 year went differently. Imagine if Miami stayed together until the cap spiked up and they were the ones to land Kevin Durant... assuming Bosh didn't develop the clots and older Wade transitioned into a sixth man, that would be a fearsome combination."
"I honestly don't really understand people who say the Bulls are anywhere near this Warriors team. The Bulls won 72 games, the Warriors won 73, and we had a bunch of debates about which team was better. Then the 73 win Warriors team added Kevin Durant. And then they added Boogie Cousins. The Bulls may have caught this team off guard and pulled an upset, because that happens sometimes, but they would probably just be thoroughly spanked. "
"&gt; WS/48 is heavily influenced by the quality of your team and tells you very little about how players stack up (or anything at all for that matter). LeBron tends to lead Jordan in many of the +/- based stats, aka the ones that aren't just box score approximations and actually tell you something about a player's impact.  You have it backwards. While not perfect, WS/48 is the best metric to measure individual impact. +/- are much more dependent on your team/lineups.  &gt; LeBron has had several non-MVP seasons clearly better than Jordan's '98 MVP season. Unfortunately his competition was Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Stephen Curry all at their peaks instead of 36 year old Karl Malone. And this goes without mentioning the '11 Rose robbery.  You fail to realize that Jordan was also robbed of MVPs. And bringing up 2011 is just dumb, even LeBron himself said Rose was the MVP that year. Rose had a worse team, and both of his starting bigmen combined to miss 60 games, and he still dragged the Bulls to a better record than LeBron's Heat. LeBron wasn't evn second in MVP voting that year so its not like he was going to win if Rose didn't anyways.  &gt; I don't think LeBron deserved a DPOY either but '09 has a better case than any of Jordan's years as far as I'm concerned.   Lmao. You write off Jordan's DPOY by saying a perimeter defender wasn't as impactful as one of the best interior defenders ever, and then say that LeBron deserved DPOY over Dwight?? Who at the time ran off like 4 straight DPOYs and in his prime was one of the best interior defenders we have ever seen???  "
"These last playoffs? Well, Rajon Rondo dismantled the Portland offense. Anthony Davis played great. Victor Oladipo was great against Cleveland. How about Terry Rozier? Chris Paul looked like the point God before his hamstring (?) injury. Then there’s the very obvious Kevin Durant. Ricky Rubio? Donovan Mitchell?   Historically? KG, Tim Duncan, Kobe, Paul Pierce, to name a few? "
"PER was literally designed by Hollinger to put Jordan at the top. He arbitrarily assigned values to box score measures to create a ranking that fit his liking. WS/48 is heavily influenced by the quality of your team and tells you very little about how players stack up (or anything at all for that matter). LeBron tends to lead Jordan in many of the +/- based stats, aka the ones that aren't just box score approximations and actually tell you something about a player's impact.  And here's the thing regarding accolades and awards: they're 100% relative. Ranking players by media voted and circumstantial awards is a lazy way of doing things and cuts out all the context and critical thinking. Let me break all these down for you:  1. Steals and scoring titles are completely meaningless. They just tell you who averaged the most ppg and spg in a season. Allen Iverson has more scoring and steals titles than LeBron but you'd be pretty stupid to put him above LeBron as a scorer or a defender. A player could theoretically average the second most points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks and not win a single award for it despite being by far the best player in the league. LeBron's thing isn't that he's the clear best at one particular facet of the game, it's that he's top 3-5 in a lot of different areas. Unfortunately for him there is no ""all-around"" award given out at the end of the year.  2. LeBron has had several non-MVP seasons clearly better than Jordan's '98 MVP season. Unfortunately his competition was Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Stephen Curry all at their peaks instead of 36 year old Karl Malone. And this goes without mentioning the '11 Rose robbery.   3. I'll probably get heat for this but it's 100% true. That DPOY Jordan won was Hakeem's. You can't tell me an elite guard defender is more valuable defensively than arguably the greatest defender of all time in the middle of his athletic prime. If you suggest otherwise you simply don't understand how basketball works. Although Jordan was undoubtedly great defensively that season, by far the biggest reason the Bulls were a good defensive team that year was because they led the league in DRB% by an enormous margin. Soon as they traded Oakley in '89, they crashed from #3 to below average.  I don't think LeBron deserved a DPOY either but '09 has a better case than any of Jordan's years as far as I'm concerned. 09 Cavs with LeBron had a 100.6 DRtg (-7.7) while the Magic with DPOY Howard had a 101.8 DRtg (-6.5) Cavs overall were only the 3rd best defense at -5.9 because they fell off a cliff without LeBron (below average defense at +0.5). In comparison, the 88 Bulls were also 3rd best defense but at only -2.5 against an almost identical league average DRtg.  LeBron led the Cavs in every defensive statistic: defensive rebounds, total rebounds, steals, blocks and defensive on-off. He ranked 2nd in DRAPM among perimeter players behind Artest, 2nd in opponent PER among perimeter players behind Kirilenko (while playing considerably more minutes than either) and the Cavs were first at the SF position in points and efficiency allowed."
Kevin Durant was drafted by the Sonics. Russel Westbrook was drafted after they were approved to move but before they did so.
"No lol wtf if social media is causing him stress and he gets rid of his online presence  instead of going the Kevin Durant route, that's obviously a mature move"

"Kevin Durant? He would be interesting, he was a good rim-protector for some minutes."
"Here's the stuff I was thinking of:  • Over the past three seasons, these have been the most efficient starting wings in the NBA (must have started at least 2/3's of games over that 3 year span and averaged at least 28 minutes per game)...  Rk	Player	TS%  1	Kevin Durant	.641  2	Kawhi Leonard	.611  3	LeBron James	.610  4	Otto Porter	.599  5	Klay Thompson	.596  6	Giannis Antetokounmpo	.590  7	Jimmy Butler	.580  8	Gordon Hayward	.577  9	Evan Fournier	.572  • Last season there were only three under25 starters that: had a higher 3P% than Fournier's (.379); had a higher TS% than Fournier's (.577); and scored more than Fournier PPG (17.9):  Kyrie Irving, Karl Anthony-Towns and Nikola Jokic  • Fournier was an excellent spot up shooter last year, in the top 95th percentile of the entire NBA ...for most of last season he led the entire NBA in catch and shoot efficiency.  • Fournier was also an excellent cutter, in the top 95th percentile of the entire NBA  • Fournier also ran the PnR pretty good, in the top 81st percentile of the entire NBA...which btw was same percentile rank as Oladipo."
"What he's saying is that even without Durant his team was a championship level team who won 73 games in the regular season, whereas the Cavs without LeBron were a lottery team who'd gotten two number #1 overall picks even with Kyrie there. Now you've downgraded from Kyrie to Kevin Love and it's questionable if you're a playoff team without LeBron.   So he's both defending his team and taking a shot at yours in one simple sentence. "
It gets Kevin Durant the further back you go. 
"lol, see, that's an unfair characterization of how it's used.  It's often used to draw a distinction between two players who are otherwise similar. Or to point out the value of a player who can shoot like Steph. And people either disregard it or overrate depending on whatever argument they are trying to make, just like every other stat.  But let's not act like anyone says Anthony Tolliver is better than Kevin Durant because of his TS%. "
Says the guy who named himself after how mad he is at Kevin Durant
It's really a shame the Pelicans are the only team in the league without a Kevin Durant stopper.
I'll take Stanley's 1/5 from 3 and 30% from the field if that means the opponent's starting small forward doesn't look like the next Kevin Durant.   A win is a win! Nothing comes easy in the Association 
" ""I saw what Russ Westbrook did when \[Kevin\] Durant went down with that foot injury in OKC. And that's what I told Coach Gentry I have to be. If I have to be Westbrook, I will be Westbook.""    ""When you look at LeBron, every year you know he's going to be great and his team is going to have a chance to win the title,"" Davis said. ""From here on out, I want to be in that conversation every year. Not every other year. Not every few years. Every year. If that's going to happen, we're going to have to win, and I'm going to have to be the most dominant player.""    ""I want to be the best player. I want to be in the playoffs. I want them to be talking about me as an MVP candidate,"" Davis said. ""I don't want there to be any questions anymore about AD."" "
He also said Kevin Durant instead of Kevin Garnett when referring to Area 21
"""Kevin Durant: YOU WERE NEVER MY BEST FRIEND!"""
Well I mean... You guys won 73 fucking games WITHOUT Kevin Durant. And you have DeMarcus cousins coming down the line? A non ridiculous argument can be made that you guys still win the title this year if you replace KD with say... 50 cents on the dollar.   So then you recoup some value on KD and win a title. 
I got 100% on my second try.  Apparently Kevin Durant has been notified and presumably will sign with me in 15 days.
"pfft, when we sign Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Khris Middleton in the offseason, then bring out the KKK...KP lineup, the league will be *shook*  in all seriousness though I really doubt you guys will win anything in the next four years. sorry, lakers man. "
"Man, I don't know...this sounds suspiciously like the logic that informed the Kevin Durant for DPOY hype train "
"Kyrie is one of a few players in the entire league who gets BETTER in the playoffs. If you look at regular season vs playoffs, almost every player statistically gets worse, even Kevin Durant and James Harden. I think Lebron, Kawhi, Kyrie and PG13 are some of the few who improve on their regular season numbers. Oh, Anthony Davis too. "
"Kevin Durant ruined the Golden State Warriors experience. Remember how much fun it was to watch Steph dominate? Now we just have to deal with KD bein that moody kid that everyone feels bad for and it's too uncomfortable to tell him ""Hey, we were having more fun before you got here"""
"Ariza was and always will be a much better defender and matchup vs Kevin Durant tho which is a big reason that plays into it. Ariza was the perfect wing defender for Durant, tall and long. I dont think Ennis will be as valuable for Houston vs GS for this reason. Also Ariza is a more proven player as well"

"Kevin Durant is certainly going to the Bad Place.  His online activity and his twitter bio alone make it an absolute certainty.    Steph Curry is going to the Good Place, because no one is allowed to not like Steph Curry.  Ironically most of his other team mates are also going to the Bad Place.  Klay, for his ""be a man"" bullshit; Draymond for kicking so many people in the nuts; Cousins for being Cousins.  "
Kevin Durant and Jaylen Brown
"Ever since Kevin Durant went to the Warriors, they always lost their opening game and won the championship...  Confirmed Warriors won’t win the championship"
"Kobe faced more 50 win teams and more Mvp level players   Tim Duncan,Dirk Nowizki, Kevin Garnett, Kevin Durant, and steve Nash in the Playoffs before the finals   Also in his 7 finals runs Kobe  Averaged 27.3/5.6/5.4 shooting 45/35/85   Vs lebrons   29/9/7 shooting 50/34/74   But LeBron has had 12 combined allstar teammates vs kobes 6   Honestly I'd give it to Kobe because of the difficulty of the West when he made the Finals "
"Its almost exactly like sports in a sense.  For instance in the NBA you get buzzer beaters/awesome dunks/Posterized/Hot streaks that make you go crazy or get super hype. Other times you are just thinking ""This game is boring"" but all sports (and e-sports) have these high and lows in a game.  Same thing can happen in e-sports someone goes on a kill streak or does an insane shot that makes you think ""This person is soooo damn good"" and you just go insane or get super hyped. Especially if they play for a team you generally root for.  Best instance I can think of really is (And I will say this.. I do not know every team/e-sports thing out there) But its like comparing Faker (League of legends fame.. look up high lights of his.. he is pretty damn good League player) or Shroud (Probably one of the best FPS players in general.. dude can play almost any FPS game and be absolutely dominate in the game within a month of playing it and honestly watching his youtube high lights make me feel like I should never play FPS games ever again)....... To well since this is NBA players like Lebron or Steph or Kevin Durant. "
This is a pretty hot take but I don't think Kevin Durant should be on the warriors anymore if we want a competitive league. 
Kevin Durant from deep! (it was a mid ranger jumper)
"Eric Housen &gt; Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant must hate seeing Steph and the Equipment Manager running the ring ceremony. 
Kevin “Randall” Durant 
I hope Kevin Durant chokes a playoff series away by playing iso ball despite the Warriors being immensely more talented than the other team...
If you're telling me that Jimmy is better than:  * Steph Curry * James Harden * Lebron James * Kevin Durant * Anthony Davis   You're clearly on something  
1)  Lebron James   2)  Stephen Curry   3)  Kevin Durant   4)  James Harden   5)  Kawhi Leonard     6)  Anthony Davis     7)  Giannis Antetoukmnpo     8)  Russell Westbrook    9)  Joel Embiid     10)  Damian Lillard   
"I hope Kevin Durant misses every single one of his shots for the rest of the season, gets traded to the Sixers and forgets how to shoot like Markelle Fultz, plays alongside Markelle Fultz, and gets into a fight in the locker room and loses. Markelle Fultz then makes my fantasy checkups less cringing while I get to revel in Kevin sitting on the end of the bench looking like the traitorous twat he is "
&gt;Kevin Durant is one of the greatest defenders in the league  Bye lol 
"So what? That’s not an accurate measurement of how good a defense is. Kevin Durant didn’t and he’s one of the greatest defenders in the league, when you look at actual footage, it’s obvious that Klay is above those guys"
I wouldn't wish an injury on a person so instead I just hope Kevin Durant gets a stain on his favorite shirt or something
I noticed many comments were about old players returning to their prime but what about young players fast forwarding to their prime? See OKC 2011-2012  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Serge Ibaka  Kendrick Perkins  
I want Kevin Durant to get in a shouting match with a fan and walk away crying.

Kevin Durant - Signing with the team he loses to in the playoffs 
Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Kevin Durant  Demarcus Cousins  Andre Iguodala
"If this lakers team wins a championship, do they get an asterisk for combining so many former champions with lottery picks, or is that only for Kevin Durant? Obv I’m a homer, but it’s comedy to see lebron repeatedly try to build superteams, but only kd’s rings seem to “not count.” "
"How many teams have had to deal with 2 of their 3 best players going out on a year where they probably would have won the title? And there's a big fucking difference between losing to a better team and having a bitchmade superstar join a 73 win uber title favorite in the middle of your team's prime.  You want to acknowledge the 3 #1 picks and LeBron but ignore everything that came after and negated that luck. Like Boozer screwing us over and dipping for the Jazz, free agents not wanting to come to us because we're a small market team in a city with shit weather, getting our 66 win team eviscerated by a team doped up on PEDs, Durant's bitchmove, Kyrie leaving, LeBron leaving twice, Kevin Love's decline, etc. With better luck and a different era the 2015-2017 Cavs were a team that could've feasibly threepeated. But in one year we were destroyed by injuries and then Durant happened. How tf can we lose two titles to bad luck and still be considered the luckiest team in NBA history. Especially over the fucking Lakers? What a joke."
"I mean, he is definitely the most popular player, but I would argue Lebron is also one of the most viscerally hated players (in a rare instance where Kevin Durant is number one). Because people may not like Westbrook or Harden and find them annoying, but the level of animosity for them or for Kyrie or for Kobe or for any other point of criticism is never on the level of the hated for Lebron. And the love outweighs that hate, sure, but there is still an enormous amount of hate: you can see it here, and you can see it in the Woj criticism thread, and you can see it in any instance of Lebron not being flawless. And it has only become more toxic since the move to Los Angeles."
"He’s good.  Even when he was 100% I’m not sure I’d have had him above Kevin Durant, Butler, or PG."
sb nation should make for Kevin Durant video
Idk man that Kevin durant guy is alright 
"Lebron can be surrounded by whomever he wants. He literally chooses where he wants to go and then has a big influence on who he plays with. He chose to play in Cleveland and L.A. just like Durant chose to play in GS.   Aside from that, LeBron takes over ever single team from a offensive system standpoint. He makes the offence change to cater to him. Kevin Durant went and just played within the offence for the most part.   Some of this is on lebron. If he wants a better surrounding cast and system then stop forcing his system on teams and maybe do a better job of figuring out what existing teams have good players and management.  It was pretty obvious the young Lakers were not going to super well this year. Then they signed all those head scratchers and the team still didn’t look it was going to do well. "
kawhi-Hinata  Westbrook- Naruto  Klay thompson-Shikamaru  Kevin Durant- Orochimaru  &amp;#x200B;
"I know this is a weird one but the summer of 2016, with Chris Paul and the gang in the NBAPA being like 'give us all the money right now, spreading it out does nothing for me' and then Kevin Durant having basically 30 teams with a max slot available and the fortunate circumstances surrounding it all. And diving into stupid things that teams like the blazers, lakers and whole host of other teams did and the cost to move those mistakes or sit on them. Also the culture of superteams being so toxic in the league and general abandonment from the NBA fan of the concept of salary cap. 'Yeah Lebron to the knicks' remember that was a thing. I don't know though, could just be my weird ass thoughts."
"I think you're ignoring the context here and that's ridiculous. If you take a 73 win team and add a former MVP in his prime that benefits both parties. LeBron put up way better stats efficiently against THAT team with essentially scrubs and Kevin Love. How is that not outplaying Durant who has a two-time MVP, a DPOY, and one of the best shooters ever on his team?  Durant is a better defender than LeBron and has been for the past few years. But that doesn't mean that you can't look around and see that Durant doesn't have to do everything for his team. He could average 10 pts a game and the Warriors would probably still win last year. The effort needed to do what Durant does vs. the effort LeBron needs to put in is vastly different. "
"Then perhaps they should have told him that they weren't going to trade him when he asked for it. That's what the Spurs did to Aldridge (""We aren't going to trade you unless we get someone like Kevin Durant back.""). I think Butler has been justified in protesting publicly like he has been. Minnesota has not been acting in good faith and it has been obvious since the ""botched"" trade to Miami."
"Kevin Durant in the playoffs the 3 seasons before joining Golden State:  35.8/10.1/5.2/**1.3**/1.4, .561 TS%, 22.6 PER, 4.4 BPM  Kevin Durant in the playoffs with Golden State:  **37.9**/**10.3**/**6.0**/1.0/**1.6**, **.635 TS%**, **26.0 PER**, **7.3 BPM**  Tell me more about his stats not being inflated"
"kevin durant or not, the warriors would still be the team to beat. they’d still be the best team on paper of all time"
"The thing is the rockets only play slow because they need to in order to beat the warriors. Unfortunately, the warriors have Kevin Durant who can get buckets playing fast or slow. I don’t think the rockets will want to trade Carmelo isos ups for Durant isos. Sure maybe he could get some switches onto curry, but he’d need to get that switch consistently to make up for his deficiencies on the defensive end.  Of course, all this only matters if the rockets can get to the point where their playing the warriors in the playoffs  "
"the only reason the league isn't competitive is because kevin durant went to the warriors. the only reason it was possible was because of a one time jump in the salary cap leaving a large number of teams with a large amount of extra room in one specific summer that kd also happened to be a free agent.  the warriors are an anomaly. the league doesn't need to change anything, the union just needs to agree to cap smoothing the next time there's a massive influx of new revenue."
Some people aren’t as bothered with all the drama... especially if you’re at the bottom of the totem pole. But that’s all irrelevant since you know more then Kevin Durant. 
"Well most recently Curry came off of an injury and didn't even play in the first round. He was at full strength in the finals however, and averaged 27.5 ppg, 6 reb, almost 7 assists, 1.5 steals, and a block. This was done on great efficiency with splits of,.402/.415/1.00. His counting stats weren't as good as Lebron's certainly, but Lebron doesn't share the floor with Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. The second leading scorer on the Cavs was KLove with 19. The leading scorer on the Warriors was KD with 28.8. This wasn't nearly Curry's best finals either. He was even better in 2017. (sorry if this posts multiple times, reddit is being dumb rn) "
Not sure why people are acting liking Curry is taking away from Kevin Durant. Durant is probably 2nd in MVP rankings right now.

"Because Kevin Durant is a better basketball player? Curry is better on the Warriors, but if I'm taking one to plug and play anywhere, I'm taking KD."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that Kevin Durant is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like Kevin Durant The Best Playoff Midrange Scorer in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
I will take 1 Kevin Durant pls

"This is a quote from Kevin Durant “When you’re around LeBron James, there’s so much that comes with that -- outside distractions and conversations and just noise that just comes around from being around LeBron James. “  But ok. "
I have one Jimmy Butler and a gently used D Rose that I would give you for Kevin Durant. 
Kevin Durant took some cupcakes crushed them up and snorted them through a silly straw before the game holy damn 
If you talk shit about kevin durant and you're a high schooler he will find you on twitter 
For a second I thought Nerlens Noel was Kevin Durant at the 3 point line
&gt; is just misreading the body language  Sort of like reddit. There was a post how Kawhi might be autistic and Kevin Durant has a mental illness because he likes to talk trash. It's ridiculous. 
"The warriors were just as fun to watch, if not moreso, before they got kevin durant. And they were still mortal in the playoffs without him.  You cannot seriously deny that KD's decision to join the warriors ruined the balance of the league. They went from being perennial contenders to being quite literally unbeatable. That makes the playoffs less entertaining to watch.  And obviously, it's not their fault. It's KD's fault. He's free to do what he wants, sure, but he objectively made the NBA (especially the playoffs) less enjoyable. ""Unfair""? No. But literally the weakest move of any superstar in NBA history."
"First two lines:  &gt; ""When Kevin Durant raised the Finals MVP trophy in the air in June -- his second straight, mind you -- it was supposed to be over for Stephen Curry.""  When was this  ever a narrative? "
"No, cause he didn’t have Kevin fucking Durant on his team and was the clear cut best player while leading them to the best record in regular season history. It’s also harder to win MVPs the more of them you win. To act like that season and this one are the same is dumb."
Yeah because hardens choker reputation comes from him having to carry the entire team. Even last years “27 missed threes” was without Chris and he had to do all the work. If he was given prime Kevin Durant to take defensive pressure off of him he would have performed much better.
"Except hardens chokes have came when having to carry the entire team. Harden would not choke with a Kevin Durant to draw attention away from him. I mean just look at westbrook, he hasn’t even won a playoff series since KD left"
Kevin Durant
"&gt; only WB ever benefitted from having good teammates.  Yeah, only Westbrook has had a teammate anything near Kevin Durant.  And again, years ago is not now.  I wouldn't have argued either of them were better than him before last year.    &gt; Poor Lillard, has to carry Nurkic and CJ.  Players worse than Paul George and Steven Adams, yeah.    &gt; Poor Embiid, having to carry that scrub Simmons.  Worse than Paul George, yeah.    Hate to break it to you bud, Westbrook as not even made it out of the first round leading a team, and he's done that with more talent than either Embiid or Lillard have to work with.   "
Lmao give them Kevin Durant as a teammate.  What has he done leading a team?  Zero.  Hasn't made it out of the first round.  So he's actually behind them both in that respect.   
"So [Michael Jordan's 69 point game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199003280CLE.html) would register as 98 (69 + 18 + 6 + 4 + 1)?  Sweet.  For comparison purposes, here are the Game Scores above 30 this season, along with the stats you are tracking, and the Club 60 players in bold.  Game Score is a formula for evaluating productivity in one game:  &gt;Game Score; the formula is PTS + 0.4 \* FG - 0.7 \* FGA - 0.4\*(FTA - FT) + 0.7 \* ORB + 0.3 \* DRB + STL + 0.7 \* AST + 0.7 \* BLK - 0.4 \* PF - TOV. Game Score was created by John Hollinger to give a rough measure of a player's productivity for a single game. The scale is similar to that of points scored, (40 is an outstanding performance, 10 is an average performance, etc.).  |Rk|Player|Date|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS|GmSc| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1|**Nikola Jokic**|2018-10-20|11|11|4|1|35|45.8| |2|Stephen Curry|2018-10-24|4|3|0|1|51|41.8| |3|**Blake Griffin**|2018-10-23|14|6|0|1|50|38.8| |4|Klay Thompson|2018-10-29|5|0|1|0|52|38.6| |5|Jimmy Butler|2018-10-19|7|3|4|2|33|37.0| |6|DeAaron Fox|2018-11-01|10|15|1|0|31|36.6| |7|Damian Lillard|2018-10-25|7|6|1|0|41|36.4| |8|**Anthony Davis**|2018-10-17|16|8|3|3|32|35.4| |9|**Derrick Rose**|2018-10-31|4|6|2|1|50|35.2| |10|Kevin Durant|2018-10-26|9|5|0|0|41|34.6| |11|Nikola Vucevic|2018-10-20|13|12|2|0|27|33.6| |12|Damian Lillard|2018-10-27|7|6|0|0|42|33.3| |13|Anthony Davis|2018-10-23|13|2|1|5|34|32.3| |14|Kevin Durant|2018-10-19|9|7|1|1|38|32.2| |15|LaMarcus Aldridge|2018-10-22|10|5|1|1|37|32.0| |16|DeMar DeRozan|2018-10-29|6|9|3|0|34|32.0| |17|Trae Young|2018-10-21|2|11|1|0|35|31.6| |18|**Giannis Antetokounmpo**|2018-10-24|18|10|2|3|32|30.7| |19|Stephen Curry|2018-10-31|2|9|2|0|37|30.1|  Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=game&amp;year_min=2019&amp;year_max=2019&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=game_score&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=30&amp;order_by=game_score&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#stats) Generated 11/2/2018."

"I would love the Nets to move D’Lo for a 1st since Phoenix has 2-1st this year. Maybe the Nets could also move Crabbes $ at some point also since it’s an expiring $18.5m after this season.    D’Lo has been sat at least 2x already this season in crunch time but he’ll only be 23 this year and when his shot is falling and isn’t trying too hard with flashy passes he’s so good.    Would rather the Nets go into this offseason with Dinwiddie starting at PG with his cheap $2-3m cap hold, 3-1st round picks, and $70-80m in cap space depending what they do with RHJ.   * Dinwiddie - Napier - ?   * LeVert - Harris - Musa   * ? - Kurucs - Graham    * ? - RHJ - ?   * Allen - ? - ?    That depth would be solid with that 2nd unit especially if they could lure 2 Stars with Max $. Nets do have a number of connections with Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant. That’s my pipe dream but as a Nets fan I’m always expecting the worse to happen.   Most likely the Nets keep D’Lo while Dinwiddie kills it on another team possibly the Knicks who also get Durant. Then Kawhi stays in Toronto leaving the Nets in a Division with 4/5 the teams stacked in Boston, Philly, Kawhi led Raptors, and Durant led Knicks. Especially if Porzingis magically no longer has long term worries about his shoulders, back, knees, anemia, or the worries Bigs will always have with injuries to their feet. "
"&gt; Tank, get lucky, draft a Kevin Durant, and hope he stays healthy  Someone said this in response to the dude with the GSW flair saying Superteams are unfair"
Thank god someone agrees with me. Bagley has the tools to literally become whatever he wants. HoF defender? He has the length. Next Kevin Durant? Put the work in. He moves really well for such a big guy and his footwork is underrated. His potential is limitless. 
"Inside, sure. It had a huge effect on the inside/midrange game.  Hand checking isn't going to make a huge difference when he pulls up at half court.  Add to that, the same era featured ""illegal defense"" rules - no sagging off for soft doubles, commit to a hard double team or stay man-to-man. Which means either Curry is getting single coverage - which is awfully dangerous when he's 30 feet out - or else one of his teammates is wide open.  All this while both he and Klay are running around with hair-trigger shot releases, and that's not even including Kevin Durant, the seven-foot guard."
"Kevin Durant is a legit 6’9, so he looks really tall next to people that list themselves at 6’9 but are actually 6’7. No way is either Simmons or KD over seven feet tall."
"Kevin Durant, Kawhi, Giannis, Lebron."
Imagine the fucking shit show if Kevin Durant and Cousins sign 5 year extensions with the Warriors
"The Blazers front office seems to fuck up the biggest decisions like Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant, but still manage to field a scary team year after year"
"I think you misheard what he said on that podcast, unless you're referring to a different one. The one I'm pretty sure you are referring to, he went on a giant rant shitting on Butler, and then ended it by saying that Jimmy is coming to town in a month, and that he'd love to ask him these questions.  The full backstory, is that towards the beginning of the summer, Bill was doing a podcast with I believe Dave Chang. The topic of Kevin Durant came up, and Dave Chang started ribbing on Bill for being best friend with Kevin Durant. Bill got really defensive about this, said he doesn't have a special relationship with KD, and that he does multiple podcasts with lots of guys, he then said that he had Jimmy Butler on his podcast twice and that he was having him on again next week.  If you listen to this podcast episode, it was pretty clear he made this up and said it in panic. He then reached out to Butler, who was non-commital about going on the podcast as he's recently become in cahoots with ESPN. "
"Yeah they're stil listing him at 6'11"". I believe Kevin Durant is also 7'1"" actually but wont list it."
"2015 Warriors: The Dubs have won their first championship since 1975, with breakout stars in Klay and Steph, and a defensive genius in Draymond   2018 Warriors: The Dubs win back-to-back titles after having added 2014 MVP Kevin Durant and sign All-NBA center DeMarcus Cousins in the offseason"
Anthony Davis  Kevin Durant  Westbrook  Devin Booker  Demar Derozan  In order of likeliest 
"I dont think this is true, but even if it was, it doesnt mean what you think it does  Curry is a better scorer than Kobe or Bird. *Maybe* he's worse than KD, because KD **also might be the best scorer ever**--for ex, if you care more about getting your shot in every situation.  Forget limiting terms like ""shooter"" or ""scorer:"" when you combine his scoring with his dribbling, passing, and gravity, curry is the greatest pure offensive player the league has ever seen. No one moves an offense like Steph does. He's Steve Nash with comparable scoring to Kevin Durant.   Steph Curry is an elite scorer, playmaker, and ball handler at the same time. He warps defenses with and without the ball. There is no answer to Steph Curry. Comparing him to other three point shooters is like comparing Shaq to Al Jefferson"
See: Kevin Durant
"Of course the Warriors would be affected if Steph lost significant time but I'm saying other teams would be affected even more if they lost there main guy. Anthony Davis is 100% more *valuable* to the Pelicans than Steph is to the Warriors. Same with Lebron, Giannis, and Kawhi. If the Warriors lose Steph the still have Kevin fucking Durant "
"&gt; Lebron couldn't compete without Kyrie  Yes, LeBron couldn't compete by himself against the combination of 2 Time MVP Steph Curry, 1 Time MVP Kevin Durant, All-Star Klay Thompson, and DPOY/All-Star Draymond Green.  I left that part out because it's obvious, uninteresting, and meaningless much like the Warriors since 2016. "
"When is r/nba going to get on board the ""russel westbrook is just not really a great player"" train?   Russ just isn't good. He could be, but if he's on a team he HAS to have a ridiculously high usage rate and be the complete centerpiece of everything they do, and when he does that, your team cannot be good. Unless you have kevin durant taking every single other shot, and then you're good despite westbrook, not because of him. "
Kevin Durant thinks very highly of LeBron. I think he'd list any team with Bron on it. 
Kevin Durant should be on the list as well
I'm coming around to liking them tbh. They play a great brand of basketball and they have great leaders and chemistry.   Also they upgraded from Harrison Barnes to Kevin Durant. That's like going from a studio apartment to a 5 bedroom house. It can't be stated how much better this team is with KD. 
"Part of what I like about my favorite athletes is their spirit of competition, their fire and tenacity. Kevin Durant showed that he doesn't have this fire or tenacity. Obviously no one can take away what he's accomplished, but now he'll always have the ""but could he have done it without going to a team that was already by far the best in the league""?  Like I said, great baseball player playing tee ball. Is he impressive at it? Sure. But that doesn't mean he should be a role model for taking the path of least resistance. It may show ruthless efficiency but it sure doesn't show much else."
"This is not true.  His players tribune picture and title did become a meme, [""My Next Chapter""](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/kevin-durant-nba-free-agency-announcement) (shoutout to /u/sim88 ) but he never mentioned hardest road.  Feel free to read it, he compliments OKC and mentions it was a hard decision to make.  &amp;#x200B;  The hardest road thing got taken out of context during a press conference a couple days later, because of course it did.  Here's the quote --  &amp;#x200B;  *""This is the hardest road because I don’t know anybody here. I’ve never lived in this community. … This is not the easiest situation because I’m out of my comfort zone.”*"
"Dwyane Wade is the 3rd best SG of all time, fuck are you talking about? He was a Finals MVP and won a ring by himself even without LeBron. He was talked about being robbed of an MVP in 2008 a few seasons b4 LeBron cane to Miami.  Chris Bosh was a 25 and 10 player for a shitty Raptors team, not in the runnint for MVP but he was an All Star and a franchise player.  James Harden was a bench player and  6MOTY when he was on OKC, and only became the player he was seasons after he left. Kevin Durant didnt play with an MVP caliber James Harden.  Russell Westbrook was the best player Durant has played with and even during Westbrook's prime after Durant, all his flaws are showing up in the playoffs with his inability to win."
Kevin Durant  Anthony Davis   Kawhi Leonard  Dame Lillard  Uhhh fuckinnnnnn ummm Steph again   You know...the classics 
"The 2017 Cavs/Warriors finals wasn't narrow...the Warriors won 4-1! KD showed out in both NBA Finals but that's not what /u/ultralightdick was talking about. The 73-win Warriors in 2016 would've won the title if Harrison Barnes could've hit any one of his open shots or if 1-2 plays went to the Warriors favor.  &amp;#x200B;  And then the Warriors replaced Harrison Barnes (who was trash in the 2016 Finals) WITH KEVIN DURANT! I fully expect them to have been the favorites in 2017 without KD considering Steph was actually 100% healthy. They might have lost last year to the Rockets, but I don't think we saw the absolute best of the Warriors in the playoffs last year until they were pushed to the brink"
"Teams literally chose to lose to the Warriors rather than letting Curry look good in a hard fought series.  The Cavs in 2017 were so scared of him that Kevin Durant was getting easy dunks. And those weren't backdoor cuts or well executed plays, it was just KD dribbling the ball into the offensive end and no one covering him as he went straight down the middle of the lane to the basket - and all because Curry was racing to the corner.  The Cavs almost got swept, but they were determined to limit Curry as much as possible - and Curry still almost averaged a triple double that finals.  Teams are more scared of Curry than they are of losing."
"The only reason Curry could miss a couple of games in the playoffs is because they got another Superstar in KD in 2016. Plus they have a great system and culture.   Lebron runs his personal system with every team he plays on. That is the reason his team looks so lost when he is out of the line-up.   Even when he was on the Cavs and would sit out, Kyrie and Kevin Love used to struggle leading the team to victory even against mediocre opposition.   It's not because those two all-stars all of a sudden suck, it's because they don't know what system to run without Lebron dictating everything.   Curry is one of the most flexible superstars ever and has been far better offensive player than Lebron since 14/15.   He is the engine of the Warriors and the team even plays better defense with him on the court.   All the talk of Curry being a defensive liability is just narrative. He is a very solid team defender.   He just struggles as a man defender, not because of lack of effort, but because of lack of speed and size.   I think people like you overrate the actual offensive talent of some of Curry's teammates, at least before Durant arrived.   Guys like Iggy, Livingston cannot shoot to save their lives. The same thing with Draymond Green, whose playmaking is also very overrated.   He gets a lot of easy assists and layups because of Curry's gravity. Klay Thompson can go nuclear, but the dude can be very streaky too.   He can't create his own shot and is prone to having many poor offensive games in a row.   Yes, he does have a lot of responsibility as a perimeter defender, but he is not faced with the task of creating his own offense, ever!!   That team needs to cover Curry's deficiencies on defense cause he covers the hell out of their deficiencies on offense every single game!!   At the end of the day it's a team sport and everyone has to work together to achieve the ultimate price. "
"It don't work that way man. Warriors actually drafted Curry, Klay and Dray. So really they only got one all-star from free agency.   Durant saw how well that organization was run with a great system and came to partake in that culture.   Lebron came back to the Cavs with all-star Kyrie waiting for him and getting the 26pts and 12 rebs version of Kevin Love. Everybody had them as the favorites coming into that 14/15 season.   It's funny how the narrative changed to the Warriors being so stacked with talent when they started dominating after Kerr took over.   Many even doubted Kerr's credentials as he had never been a head coach before the Warriors got him. "

No. Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant are both playing at an MVP level this season and Curry is probably going to win a unanimous MVP as he scores 30 PPG on 70 TS% this year. The Warriors are also adding Demarcus Cousins in a couple months.  Nothing is stopping the Warriors this season.
Kevin Durant as ruined the NBA is perfect
And the Warriors won 73 before adding prime Kevin Durant.  
Kevin Durant hands out circus peanuts 
"Restricted FA isn't good enough.  And maybe the problem isn't teams have enough options to retain players, maybe some teams have TOO MANY options to acquire players.  Warning: Big ol' wall of text incoming.  If you break down the top 50 highest paid players in the NBA - and remove restricted free agents, which is about the *only* tool teams have to retain players - it leaves only about half the league that have signed one of those players to an unrestricted contract.  So that's just half the league, out of the entire pool of free agents over the past five years when players get the choice of where to go that have even managed to sign *one* of those players.  As I mentioned in my previous comment, some of those are mostly due to egregious overpays:  George Hill for $19 million/year to the Kings, Chandler Parsons for $25 million to the Grizzlies.  One step below that, there are some good players who were paid probably well above their value in order to either stay with their team or jump ship to another: Nicolas Batum for $24 million to stay in Charlotte, Paul Millsap for $30 million to go Denver, Harrison Barnes $24 million to leave the Warriors for Dallas (although he's somewhat lived up to it), Mike Conley for $30 million to stay in Memphis - fine, maybe fringe All-Star players paid like All-NBA guys just in order to either woo them away from elsewhere or convince them to stay.  You could argue Conley earned it, but he's the exception here, not the rule.  Remove those guys, and now only about 1/3 of the league is left who have been able to sign a max-contract player who is a true, bona-fide max salary type of player.  Want to guess which markets have the most, AND objectively *best* of those players?  Counting Chris Paul's sign and trade, Houston has three big UFA signings  (although one is Ryan Anderson), convincing Harden to re-up.  Golden State has by far the biggest two with Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.  Boston also has two with Gordon Hayward and Al Horford, and that's not even their biggest acquisition of the past two years...  Lakers landed LeBron - enough said.  Miami has been successful in their own right, keeping Chris Bosh from leaving to Houston and keeping Hassan Whiteside.  They're also riding landing BOTH LeBron and Bosh in free agency - I can certainly see why a Heat fan might not think acquiring good players outside the draft is difficult for a franchise.  Do you notice anything about these teams?  It's the same big markets that have historically always had success luring high profile players.  The largest exception at the moment appears to be Oklahoma City, who probably against expectations managed to re-sign Russell Westbrook and Paul George.  It may have just been the perfect storm of events leading to both of them - Russ left alone in the wake of KD leaving and then apparently convincing George to stay along with him this offseason - good on them.  But this sort of thing happening is so rare.  This is just in free agency - we're not even getting into players forcing trades, which even more favor a select few destinations.  Butler ain't getting rumored to the fucking Hornets.  Or Bucks.  Or Blazers.  It's always Miami, California, Boston, New York, Texas.  With players forcing their way to teams outside of free agency even, teams in these locations have way too much of an advantage to obtain and retain high caliber players.  Small market teams need a tool to balance the scales.    The Designated Player Extension was supposed to do that in theory, but it doesn't appear to have any impact on players' decisions, and in some cases seems to even be canceled out by money players will save by not paying as much in taxes in some states.  It's not enough."
He’s built like Kevin Durant so he must be good! He’s got a high ceiling!
"[I didn't know either, here.](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/8/16/17697752/cj-mccollum-kevin-durant-feud-warriors-jennifer-gmib) It's funny!"
"I almost completely agree with this, HOWEVER there is another major curve in that the people he's passing to are Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and now Boogie Cousins.  Steph's sole offensive dominance only lasted 2 seasons before they got KD and became a ring factory. I wonder what will happen to his GOAT ranking if KD leaves and he can't reproduce that level of dominance with the NBA defenses evolving so much to stop the 3 pointer."
Kevin Durant and Steph Curry vs Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram.  Yep. That's about a tie.   ffs
"Kevin Durant is actually 6’11 or 7’0, he put 6’9 on his height so the Supersonics would play him at small forward"
He forgot DPOY candidate Kevin Durant.
"Parity, doesn’t matter, that’s Kevin Durant.   Defense, doesn’t matter, that’s LeBron James.   Passing, doesn’t matter, that’s Kobe Bryant.   Staying in shape, doesn’t matter, that’s Shaq.   Practice, doesn’t matter, that’s Allen Iverson.   Sitting on the bench, doesn’t matter, that’s Carmelo Anthony.   Performing in the playoffs, doesn’t matter, that’s James Harden.   Shooting, doesn’t matter, that’s Ben Simmons.   Rebounding, doesn’t matter, that’s Brook Lopez.   Making smart shots, doesn’t matter that’s Russell Westbrook. "
"Yeah his second year mate. How did Lebron do in his second year? How about Anthony Davis? How about Kevin Durant? How about Butler?  &amp;#x200B;  You really going to sit here and tell me that Towns isn't a winner because he didn't take the worst team in the league to playoffs in 2 seasons? Unbelievable.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; In your world, does that somehow mean the same thing as 'number 1 draft pick'?   Did I say it did?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; However, none of that means he mentally isn't soft. Sorry.   And as a random dude on reddit you'd know wouldn't you?"
Kevin Durant was a competitor at that point 
"So far this season he definitely is, followed by teammate Kevin Durant."
When Gucci mane somehow didn’t rhyme Kevin Durant with Kevin Durant     
1 LeBron James (+1) 2 Kevin Durant (-1)  sorry but HOW?
"Lol, way to confirm exactly how much you actually watched the playoffs by citing Kevin Love as a substantial offensive weapon, plus referring to a player who has not been with the team for over a year. Not to mention the fact both those players are far worse defenders.  The Cavaliers as a whole were terrible on defence (yes, during the regular season in part because of Lebron’s coasting), which always affects defensive statistics. And some others marked him as a mediocre regular season defender. So that is hardly a strong narrative.  The comparison of Kawhi and Durant (or apparently Oladipo...) is easy because they play rather similarly on offence. The comparison with Lebron is far more difficult because he matches their scoring output while serving as the offensive engine. Maybe you should stop just listening to talking heads and start thinking through a few of these comparisons for yourself."
"He does deserve some blame, when the Celtics were balling last few seasons everyone screamed Brad Stevens is the GOAT Coach in the league.  Well he got a lot of credit, now its time for him to get some blame.  I really think even with a healthy Hayward this team, particularly the starting lineup would still have problems.  There is only one ball. Look at GSW, Draymond is not a ball hog he is essentially a versatile roleplayer, Klay runs off screens and fills the Ray Allen/Rip Hamilton role. The Warriors consistently insert a random Center who doesn't do anything but set screens and rim run.   What are Browns, Tatums, Haywards role? None of them have a particular unique skillset that differentiates from the other, if Tatum was a great rebounder or Brown specialized in getting stops against the other teams best player like Bruce Bowen or Tony Allen.  Last year once Kyrie went down all expectations went out the window , this year there was a lot of hype and expectations. These young guys haven't had big roles w/ big expectations until now.  I really think they have a problem with Tatum/Hayward. Neither of them are big, athletic or strong enough to dominate at the PF. Neither sets good screens, blocks shots, rebounds well, gets stops. Horford has never been a great rebounder but this team lacks so much of the small things.  Kevin Durant can play the 4 because he is 6'11 and a god damn freak, Hayward and Tatum can't they don't have the versatility, basically this whole team isn't good enough to insert at any position and say ""Go play ball we'll figure it out later."""
Why is there a picture of kevin durant on the right side of the screen? He ruined our league.
"Bosh is overrated and only an all-star in the East. He made the all-nba team ONCE in his entire career so he was not a true all-star even. Dude couldn't take the Raptors to the 8th seed his last year there.  KAT looks just like young Kevin Love. You can't build around him with some role players and have a decent season. Kevin Garnett, a true franchise player, had the Wolves in the playoffs his 2nd year as the *6th seed.* I can't name any of the bums he was playing with without looking it up can you?  Towns is in his 4th year and is on path to the lottery again although he could prove me wrong. He's lucky his team won some games because Butler was there.  Durant has always played with others stars and above average role players. Shit, the Sonics won 31 games the year before they drafted Durant. After they drafted him they won 21 games they got worse with him. Westbrook is drafted next and they win 23 games. They add James Harden and Serge Ibaka next year and they won 50. Kd doesn't get full credit for that that was a stacked team.  In Kd's MVP year, Westbrook played more than half the games (46). The Thunder won most of their games that year when Westbrook and Durant were playing. Durant on his own lost a ton. Examples:  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201404040HOU.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201404140NOP.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201403160OKC.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201402010WAS.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201402070ORL.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201312310OKC.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201401020OKC.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201401070UTA.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201401090DEN.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201401140MEM.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201311010MIN.html  And that year the Thunder added Steven Adams and Reggie Jackson. They were stacked as hell and Kd still had a losing record in his MVP year without Westbrook."
There’s literally zero doubt they make the playoffs. Idc if you downvote this but at least save it. I will get “Kevin Durant” tatted on my back if they don’t make the playoffs. (I hate kd) 
Yes for Kevin Durant. 
[I think this is what he's talking about. Woj said the Warriors are a serious threat to sigh KD 5 months before it happened] (https://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--warriors-serious-threat-to-sign-kevin-durant-182559375.html) 
"In the context of ""In 5 years a team will be thinking of waiving Melo""?  I mean I could say, ""In 5 years a team will be thinking of waiving Kevin Durant"" but we don't know what could happen between now and then, maybe KD comes out as some kind of serial rapist or some shit."
Mo Bamba 7'10 wingspan  Aaron Gordon 7'0 wingspan  Jonathan Isaac 7'2 wingspan  Kevin Durant 7'5 wingspan  Cameron Reddish 7'1 wingspan  Melvin Frazier 7'1.75 wingspan  Justin Jackson 7'3 wingspan  Khem Birch 7'0 wingspan   He would fit right in to the Orlando Magic
There is no chance in hell Kevin Durant is signing with the Magic. 
this isn't:  Top 10 TS % - 15+ FG attempts  1. Stephen Curry  2. Kevin Durant 3. Tobias Harris  4. Damian Lillard  5. Luka Doncic 6. Kawhi Leonard 7. Kemba Walker  8. Kyrie Irving 9. LeBron James 10. Joel Embiid 
"Like it or not, Kevin Durant has without question the most versatile scoring arsenal in Nba history, he does everything well when it comes to scoring. There's a reason GMs voted for him as the dude they want taking the last shot. He gets buckets."
"When a player has a ~6 game shooting slump in their first 12 games people start saying ""maybe everything has changed and he isn't as good anymore"".   When a player has a 6 game shooting slump in January nobody bats an eye.   The same goes for the positive stats this early on.   Tatum will have a 10 game stretch where he averages ~25ppg at some point this season. If that had randomly happened to start the season then we'd all be proclaiming him the second coming of Kevin Durant."
"Jesus. No wonder people said he’d be the best prospect since Lebron. I was a doubter prior to the season but he’s shattered all my doubts.  Only time will tell whether taking Ayton and Bagley over him was either a mistake, or a Portland ‘I drafted Sam Bowie and Greg Oden over Kevin Durant and Michael Jordan’ Trailblazer mistake"
"Imo, he always benefited playing on good teams with good teammates. He's not a team carrier he's scorer. Basketball to him = try to score. It's like giving Kevin Durant or Devin Booker their own team with below average players on it. That's what happened when Melo was on the Knicks and Amare declined and he was left with below average role players."
"He got lucky. They have a dynasty because they got KD; I truly believe that they'd have no more than 2 total championships if that doesn't happen. Signing Durant took a combination of there being a significant cap spike *and* Curry being underpaid. He does deserve credit, though, for being an excellent drafter.  Personally, I give Kerr more credit for their dynasty than him. He introduced that beautiful offense and took them to a championship in his first season, a year after getting knocked out in the 1st round. His offense attracted Kevin Durant, who was tired of the slog that was OKC's offense.   He is not clearly ahead of Ainge and Masai imo. At best he is even with them."
Kevin Durant here ... don’t you know you aren’t allowed to do what you want for your career

Kevin Durant ruined our sport and Steph Curry is wildly overrated dude plays no defense probably isn't better than KD. 
Fuck kevin durant he ruined our sport for years and people just pretend it never happened 
http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/omnisport/99/78/kevin-durant-63016-usnews-ftr_1vn2owry7ud31j185pcc24t39.jpg?t=-1590445563&amp;w=960&amp;quality=70
"The Warriors have Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Quinn Cook? This is bullshit "
"CMV: Kevin Durant is the most overrated player in the NBA. And you could switch him out for most players in the top 50-100 range and the Warriors would still win a ring.  Yes, I've seen threads where people claim how he's the most important piece of the team, and make it sound like he's playing defense as good as Pippen, AK47 and Ben Wallace combined, but the ""Warriors could win a ring without him"" argument can be used for pretty much every player on that team... well, minus Curry imo, because he gives that team its distinct identity, but that's a whole different debate"
"Kevin durant signed with the warriors after losing to them, you heard that ? What what bad move from him.  "
...... The 2014 spurs a total outlier.  What do you mean the first 2 warriors rings? The one where the other teams 2 stars were injured and the one where they added kevin durant?  Depth didnt have much to do with that. Helll the next year a healthy cavs smacked that same warriors team with far less depth. Just stars taking over.    Embiid butler and simmmons are nasty defenders.    Lmao. Stars win championships. Whose dominating the league right now?  Oh yeah the team with more stars than anyone else. 
Joe Ingles dunking on Kevin Durant
"Ben Simmons hits the game winning 3 over Kevin Durant, completing the reverse sweep over the Golden State Warriors"
Thats fine. No distractions when it comes to the wooing of Kevin Durant lmao
They did badly in the playoffs last year because of Melo. There's no two ways about it. The Jazz averaged a higher point per possession rate off when Melo was defending the ball handler than Kevin Durant did all season last year. He was absolutely awful (and I'm one of the few fans that still likes Melo).
"Ben Simmons, Redick, Jimmy, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid"
Kevin Durant
"Wow imagine James Harden, Russel Westbrook and Kevin Durant on the same team "
"MVP : Giannis  MIP : LaVine 6MOTY : 🌹 / Schröder ROTY : fuck it Trae Young  DPOY : Embiid  COTY : Nick Nurse  EOTY :  Morey ( if he pulls off JimmyBuckts) Finals : Raps vs Warriors ( Warriors in 6, Kawhi brings home 2 Huge games ) FMVP : 🐍 Kevin Durant !"
"I can't find a source, but during the 2016 regular season Curry didn't play in all 73 games the Warriors won and they still won without him.  Some links for proof: https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201512310HOU.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201603010GSW.html  Similarly in the 2016 playoffs, Curry missed a bunch of games against the Blazers, and yet Draymond and Klay carried the Warriors to playoff wins regardless. The Warriors won Game 1 and Game 2 against the Blazers without Curry but with Thompson and Green going off:   https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201605010GSW.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201605030GSW.html  Look at the rebounding, assist, and block numbers from Draymond. Astronomical. They need Draymond to win NOT Curry. Hell, Warriors fans always blame the 2016 finals on losing Green for 1 game. Imagine blaming a finals loss on your 3rd string star. Imagine the Cavs blaming losing because Kevin Love was concussed and missed a game. Imagine the Raptors saying they lost the finals because OG got injured for 1 game. Fucking pathetic. Curry is a pussy and useless without Green.   Don't even get me started on Durant.   In reference to the 2016 playoffs:  &gt;So far in the Warriors' six playoff games — he has missed four games completely and parts of the other two — the Warriors have seen dramatic improvements in how much they are dominating their opponents without Curry, especially beyond the first quarter.  https://www.businessinsider.com/golden-state-warriors-without-stephen-curry-2016-5"
"Easy to say that now huh. I agree he's not Kevin Durant or LeBron. But he can definitely be the second option. He's getting back into the flow of things and you can tell he was a little more assertive this game, which is a great sign for the Celtics. "
"&gt; But right now, the Celtics’ Top 2 are not on the same level as a Kevin Durant and Steph Curry, or a ~~Chris Paul and James Harden~~ Kyle Lowry and Kawhi Leonard.  FTFY"
I can find the podcast but it might be tough to find the spot that he specifically talks about the Jazz.  Anyway here is the podcast https://m.soundcloud.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast/finals-mvp-kevin-durant-ep-225
&gt; People mentioned his shot being off the first game of summer league.    Why make things up? Kevin Durant famously tweeted about his hesi pull up in his summer league game and his shot looked good and he was plenty confident in taking it. 
"Imagine Kevin Durant, but he can't dribble, finish at the rim, rebound, play defense, or shoot well. "
"Hmm. Do you have your ""Weve beaten golden state"" ID? It would just be a picture of kevin durant with your team's logo as a faded backdrop. It should say ""My Next Chapter"" on the bottom as well."
I don’t hate ray full transparency. But I think going to the team that beat them in the former playoffs is a bit of a different scenario.  Also he was only with the celts a couple years.  Kevin Durant left the team that drafted him again for the team that beat him. Lebron was hated because he was a Cleveland institution. Different situations
I mean y’all did the same thing with hating Ray Allen. It wa probably more classless being shopped around by the FO and then being shat on by his former team mates . Kevin Durant  was hated after he left OKC even though he still cared about the city. So was Lebron the first time . It’s natural for jazz fans to feel this way or any fan to be salty about your star leaving.
"This is just a case of a young guy learning that he's the face of an NBA franchise and can't tell gay puns to the media. A proportionally tiny wrist seems appropriate and a good way to let him, the public, and other players know that that stuff isn't okay. If it didn't become a news story, he probably would have just gotten a stern call from the league office.  He's a professional, and whether he likes it or not, part of the millions of dollars he makes is having to keep a clean public image. Look at a guy like Embiid - he can still be fun while having at least, well, somewhat of a mental filter.  EDIT: There seems to be this nervous energy to defend any player not named Kevin Durant and Chris Paul when they make a mistake. Players can make mistakes and still be good people. It isn't the end of the world if a player you like says something dumb."
Tatum is definitely better than Fultz. But it is funny how Fultz looks like he’s shooting a Boulder now and still shoots the same as Tatum who Bill Simmons called “the Kevin Durant of this generation”
Free Agents making Northwestern teams sad is a July 4th tradition though.  [Example 1](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/lamarcus-aldridge-sign-spurs)  [Example 2](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/kevin-durant-nba-free-agency-announcement)  [Example 3](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/boston-celtics/after-day-confusion-gordon-hayward-announces-hes-joining-celtics)
Jimmy Butler is not Kevin Durant 
Kevin Durant is about 240 and just compare his body with LeBrons. No way LBJ is under 250-255
"Game 3 Durant: 43/13/7 on 82.4%TS  Game 3 LeBron: 33/10/11 on 53.1%TS  Both players had good games and bad games. KD was able to win when JR Smith, Kevin Love, AND Rodney Hood all did better than anyone on the rest of his team."
"Who know, they can literally be the championship Boston Celtic that can shut you down completely on defense alone, literally GS Warrior Kryptonite if you think about it. Would be a wonderful story though.  The snake Kevin Durant facing off against his former team, that grind their way through the season after a 0-4 start.   Paul George showing the world why he sign with this team.  Russ redemption.  Andre return from a major injury  The comeback kids of Schroder and Noel  The gentle giant of Steve Adam  Then they beat the Warrior for the Western Conference Title..........Just to lose to Boston lol."
You're talking about a team with both Kevin fucking Durant and Steph Curry in the starting 5. Losing a bench player is an afterthought on a squad like that.

Never forget that kevin durant ruined the fucking sport fuck him 
Kevin Durant has joined the warriors* 
"If you watch dudes like klay they push off to create space on screens and ive never seen it called. So you gotta feelnfor steph but if they dont call holds on steph then it balances out by all the clean looksnklay generates with a push off.  Also gsw has also been notorious for holding and being allowed more than other teams on defense cause theyre superstars. Moving screens, holding, pushing, blocking *nba finals kevin durant didnt have his feet set* , etc.   Also steph is a superstar like lebron. If you called a foul everytime they deserved one theyd have 50 points a night."
this is gonna sound weird but I wanna see Kevin Durant shave his goatee. eyebrows and entire head   i wanna see how that looks 
It would be hilarious if the warriors didn't win the championship but that's not going to happen. Kevin Durant is too much of a bitch he ruined competition for all of us. 
Random question but does anyone recognize the shoes Kevin Durant is wearing tonight?
"Alfonso ""Kevin Durant"" Mckinney"
"I hate how what kevin durant did isn't constantly criticized, shit was completely ridiculous. 2016 was just bad. Especially for politics. "
Why the fuck would Kevin Durant and the Greek Freak want to list their height as inches shorter than they actually are?  What's the advantage to that?
Kevin Durant. PLOT TWIST. HE RETIRES AFTER THIS SEASON 
"Trevor Ariza is an easy scapegoat/write off for Rockets fans but I dont think they really appreciated his length and versatility on the defensive end for these playoff potential elite wing matchups whether its Paul George, Kevin Durant, Lebron, Joe Ingles etc"
Kevin Durant so shook right now. 
"Anecdotally I think most players intentionally wait a split second after the buzzer sounds to attempt a long heave. (They don’t admit it’s intentional, but come on, they know how much time it takes to launch a shot.)  Kevin Durant specifically has been criticized for not attempting heaves, but he’s far from the only one. Pay close attention at the end of 1st 2nd and 3rd quarters and you’ll see what I mean.   Here’s a good read on it http://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/53670/shane-battier-and-the-buzzer-beater-problem  And the money quote from Shane battier: “Even the heave is a plus-play. But unfortunately we're not judged on the plus-plays. We're judged on (shooting) percentages. I think they should take the heave out of the stat book. It's common sense.""  And if they did change the rule book to reflect this stance?  ""You'd have guys fighting to take that shot, because it's a hell of a fun shot,"" he said. ""We shoot those shots every day in practice."""
"***&lt;East&gt;***  Starters:   Kyle Lowry   Victor Oladipo   Kawhi Leonard   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Joel Embiid    Reserves:   Kyrie Irving   Kemba Walker   Zach Lavine   Khris Middleton   Blake Griffin   Hassan Whiteside   Serge Ibaka (Yes, this is a homer pick I know)  ------  ***&lt;West&gt;***  Starters:   Steph Curry   James Harden   Kevin Durant   LeBron James   Anthony Davis    Reserves:   Russell Westbrook   Damian Lilliard   Demar DeRozan   Paul George    Nikola Jokic   Draymond Green   Klay Thompson    I'm betting voters will insist on giving the Warriors 4 all-stars again.  -----  Captain/Draft predictions just for fun.  Giannis East Captain, LeBron West Captain (Though I could see Steph getting it too).  **Starters:**  LeBron: KD  Giannis: Steph  LeBron: AD  Giannis: Kawhi  LeBron: Harden  Giannis: Embiid  LeBron: Lowry  Giannis: Oladipo"
"Yeah, midrange isn’t inherently bad. Kevin Durant makes his living there, but the difference is Durant is almost automatic. "
"Why does it have to be Evan Turner? You're purposefully making it sound like Lillard was playing alongside scrubs. I believe Kyrie could perform at a similar level alongside someone like CJ McCollum. Even if he doesn't win against the Pelicans he's going to put forward a good showing. This man goes off against the likes of Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala guarding him, he's more than going to hold his own against Jrue Holiday."
"He's still being guarded by the likes of Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant and more often than not he torches them. The dude's special."
What about Kevin Durant? He is well connected and he does have a background answering people more then most people
Kevin Durant👀 
Scarlett johanneson I will drink ur bath water...#random - Kevin Durant 
"Brandon ""Kevin Durant"" Ingram!"
"im not sure ingram is actually an elite prospect besides the fact he has the body of kevin durant  of course he doesnt have the shooting, but he's not really *that* athletic either  Imagine if Durant didnt exist, and that wasnt the go-to reference for this kind of length. What would his draft comp had been? Tayshaun Prince? i seriously think he's getting a lot of mileage out of *looking* like kevin durant"
Hey Cassidy! Two questions:  Where do you think Kevin Durant goes in free agency next summer?  Who's the most inspirational NBA player ever? 
"You're acting like all of these guys are going to come in and be great players right off the bat. They are not. In all likelihood, maybe one of them enters the league as a guy who truly deserves to be a starter over NBA vets.  I'm sure they'll all be good, but potential doesnt win basketball games.  You might as well ask if college Kevin Durant could beat present day KD in a 1v1. "
It’s weird seeing George Mikan rated higher than Kevin Durant. I get era context and all that but still weird.   And Duncan over Hakeem? Delete this nephew 
"Give Harden Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond and see what happens, they would do all of that and so much more  harden is better"

scott brooks is a bad coach. he was only hired to try to sway kevin durant to sign with them
"You know what I think would be hilarious. If Silver came out and announced the picks. ""And with the 1st pick in the 2019 All-star Draft, Kevin Durant selects....LeBron James!""  Followed by a highlight reel and accolades. That would be fucking amazing."
"It's not that John is blameless, but there are deep-seated sources of dysfunction within the franchise/front office/coaching that are dragging every down right now.   Like you're talking about Wall being a problem because he doesn't move on offense. There's no element of Scott Brooks offense designed to encourage Wall to move! On top of that Brooks insists on playing the bench scrubs all at once, so they constantly blow leads and force the starters to overextend themselves to get back in the game. Case in point, John played 41 min last night in a double digit loss to a 2-7 Mavs team.    This article is about Brooks' Thunder days tenure [you could replace it word for word with what's happening in DC](https://www.sbnation.com/2015/4/22/8469587/scott-brooks-fired-okc-thunder-kevin-durant):  &gt;With the Thunder falling short of a title the past few seasons, Brooks increasingly came under fire for a perceived lack of strategic wit. The coach is often an obvious scapegoat when a talented team falls short of expectations. In Brooks' case, he was often the one (along with Westbrook) getting the bulk of the blame.  &gt;**Much of that tied to the offensive end of the floor, where the Thunder often lacked the creativity or movement seen in other top offenses. The team typically depended on Durant or Westbrook to create chances, which at times left them tired and/or overwhelmed. To many outside observers, Brooks' lack of technical acumen was always going to be an issue when putting together the playbook.**   "
"Harden had better seasons than him in 2017 and 2018. Westbrook also had a better season than him in 2017 which is why Steph hasn't made first team since 2016 (also because missed games last year). Even Kawhi had a better year than him in 2017. Kawhi was playing on a different level on both ends before the Zaza injury.   Even Steve Kerr said  Lebron/Kawhi/KD have a level of dominance beyond Steph due to physical limitations.  &gt;Steph is one of the great players in the world. Two time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of the way he impacts the game. But, you’re talking about Kevin Durant at 6’11 protecting the rim, getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do. There’s a different level of impact that is actually possible for Steph and for KD.  &gt;Steph is my size. He’s literally my size. So, what he’s capable of is all based on his amazing skill. He can’t do anything about being 6’3 and a buck seventy-five. So, in the playoffs especially when you’re having to protect the rim and do so many different things. There has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you’re having these conversations about who’s the best player in the league. And that’s why Lebron is there, that’s why Kawhi is there, that’s why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force.”"
Kevin Durant still joined a 73-win team.
"We could also emerge in talks for Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis or Lebron James.   If we really wanted to, we could emerge in talks for Michael Jordan. "
"This is my take.   He looked like Kevin Durant or something or there.  Someone said Paul George, i might like that comp better"
Kevin Durant should be Top 5 too.   
"It's possible, but big men haven't been winning RoY awards recently. Since 2008 (when Kevin Durant was drafted to the Supersonics), a non-guard has only won the award twice. Karl Anthony Towns and Blake Griffin.  * KAT's 2015: 18.3 pts 10.4 rbs 2.0 ast * Griffin's 2010: 22.5 pts 12.1 rbs 3.8 ast * Ayton so far: 15.9 pts 10.9 rbs 3.4 ast  He's got a shot.  Note: Wiggins and Durant won but they were both listed as shooting guards. "
"“For comparison, there have only been 9 players to score 30 PPG, and have a FG% of 50%. And 7 of those 9 players were centers/big men, who got all of their points around their rim. The only non-centers/big men to make this list are Steph Curry, and Kevin Durant.“  Tbh, I just skimmed through the first part so I may have missed something. But this statement isn’t true for the entire history of the league, right?"
Kevin Durant is 7’4”

"No. I may change my mind on that if Kevin Durant leaves and it turns out that McKinnie is not, in fact, the greatest shooter in the history of the NBA on a sample size large enough to be meaningful, mind you, but... no.  Dude ghosted us in the finals, and ghosting people is just rude.  I'm still slightly mad about that, but at the same time, I want him to do well? Except I don't, because if he couldn't play worth a damn for us in the *goddamn Finals* why should he play well any other time? Except I do, because I liked him before that?  Mixed. Feelings."
They weren't an expansion team and they had Kevin Durant before they even came over
Kevin Durant is better then Larry Bird. And will end his career as the 2nd greatest SF ever
Ingram was given a green light last year when our guard rotation was injured actually. He’s just not remotely as talented as Kevin Durant. For the love of god chill with the comparisons.
Kevin Durant is a top 3 scorer and top 5 shooter of all time 
"[To be fair, Ingram was drawing KD comparisons long before we drafted him](http://www.draftexpress.com/article/How-Brandon-Ingram-Compares-With-Kevin-Durant-At-The-Same-Age-5418/)"
"but that’s the problem, that his shot DID totally break down, and that was almost impossible to foresee even looking back in hindsight. had it not happened that way we just don’t know if he would be shooting 35% or 25% from 3. and bad workouts or not, having kevin durant tweet about your hesi pull up jimbo means he looked pretty good.  lonzo had similar college stats with his 3P and FT% but i haven’t seen any arguments that people should have seen his current shooting struggles coming. maybe they’re in r/lakers but i haven’t seen them here and i’ve seen it about fultz a few times (but of course people will dissect his shot more). the consensus on both of them at the time was that they had nba range.   i am far from a fultz stan, i just thinking this argument relies way too heavily on hindsight. "
Roc Nation's biggest NBA client is Kevin Durant.
"Kyrie Irving can’t be the best player on a championship team IMO. isn’t good enough of a playmaker and his defense is still terrible despite what the RPM says I still see him dying on screens. As for the core of the Celtics, you have their bird rights so of course you can re-sign them. The point is Gordon Hayward and Al Horford cost you a shot at Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard because you can’t sign them, but I don’t see a superstar in Tatum or Brown."
"Bradley Beal is better than Kevin Durant. There, I said it. "
"I mean with how they reacted, you’d think Kevin Durant is not a human and was put on this earth simply for their entertainment. "
"You can approach it from any number of different angles, there is almost no way Kawhi gets that many votes. The Canada bonus has never proven to be anywhere near that strong. Toronto doesn’t get a whole lot more media attention in America than San Antonio.  LeBron was the only player in the league to get more votes than Giannis last year. He got a whole 100,000 more. He’s been one of the biggest names in basketball since like 2002, and the consensus best player in the league for at least eight years. You’re telling me Kawhi is going to get roughly that many votes, after only getting 40% of that at most in his entire career, because he plays for the Raptors now? Come on. Be realistic.  Here’s a full list of players who came within a million votes of Giannis in 2018:  Kevin Durant, former MVP, considered the best player on the best team in the league, coming off a Finals MVP, probably the single most talked about player in the league. -200,000  Kyrie Irving, fresh off a trade to a big market team and best team in the East at the time, marketable enough mainstream star that an entire feature-length movie was made based on his Pepsi endorsement ads. -400,000  Steph Curry, two time MVP, on the best team in the league, defending champions, considered the second most popular player in the league behind LeBron. -200,000  Manu Ginobili - People knew he was retiring and there was a massive online push to get him into the All Star game. It didn’t work. -700,000  That’s it. That’s the whole list. Four guys, one of whom was a massive fluke. The gap between Giannis’ votes and Kawhi’s votes in his last healthy year was bigger than the gap between James Harden (who won MVP that year) and Antonius Cleveland. Kawhi has no argument."
"&gt; Being constantly taunted and disrespected every day at your job shouldn't be expected of any body.   Isn't that exactly what you should expect when at an opposing teams arena , in pretty much any sport?  If being called a cupcake is too emotionally heavy for him, he is in the wrong profession.  Of course there is a point where fans can go too far, but I don't think ""cupcake"" is anywhere near that point.  I just know if my son came home from school and the school had told me he said what Kevin Durant said here, specifically in response to being called a ""cupcake""... I would be disappointed in him.  You only empower the hecklers by responding this way.  "

I think Kevin Durant should retire from basketball and try an individual sport like tennis or golf where his reaction would be warranted. Does this lanky dolt not understand what sport he's playing?!
Kevin Durant should just retire. He's not going to go to a bad team so if he's just hopping on another superteam the league will still be fucked. GET OUT KEVIN.
Harden lead the Rockets to a 1 seed in the west. Russ broke a long standing record and took his team to a 6th seed in the west. Steph had one of the best seasons of all time and easily had the best shooting season of all time. Twice. Kevin Durant challenged LeBron for best player in the league after he dominated for the past decade. LeBron won 4 of the 5 years before that

Why'd no clippers fans tell me Tobias Harris is literally **KEVIN DURANT**
Kevin Durant has been my favorite player in the league since Kobe retired and was always a close second. Way off base with that one dawg.
"It doesn't sound like he wants to go to Washington  &gt; “I thought about what it might be like,” Durant said.   ...   ""I didn’t know what it would be. I know every time I go back it’s pretty hectic, and I just wanted to focus on basketball and not have to worry about a lot of stuff that comes with being at home.   “It’s always good going back, but I would rather play in a different city.”  From https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2017/02/27/kevin-durant-on-d-c-i-really-just-didnt-want-to-play-at-home/  (edit: uh whoops ppl have said it already, but maybe the article will be interesting for some people)  "
"&gt; r/nba: ""Wow, Durant is probably the most sensitive nba player ever.""  Yeah, if KD occasionally told a heckler to shut up, that's understandable. But he has a history of letting fans get inside his head. Even arguing with random anonymous people (probably 12-old year kids) who criticize him on social media.

"I want an All Drama team. (Requests or was traded/FA edition)  Draymond Green  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Jimmy Butler  John Wall  Whose the bench though? Kyrie, Boogie, Melo, Dwight? With Cp3, Rondo. Dare I say GM Lebron?   "
Kevin Durant is softer than baby shit.   Part of playing in the NBA and earning absurd amounts of money so dealing with the dum shit fans say (within reason).   KD could’ve just sat back and counted his millions or done a DWade with the purple shirt guy but he made himself look like a bit of a weenie instead. 
"It is possible to be two things. Kevin Durant is a good human being who cares about his city, even though they turned on him. He is also a bitch."
"Story filed to ESPN: The Warriors fined All-Star Draymond Green for unloading a verbal barrage onto teammate Kevin Durant  in a recent practice. After Green and his teammates had been challenged to raise intensity in that session, Green fired back with ”You’re a B—-"" to Durant . Story soon."
Kevin Durant is *very* unlikeable.

"Kevin Durant is a lil bitch ring chaser, downvote away. "
"Hey man, don't mean to be that guy, but you're just a little bit off the mark with the word ""epitome"" here. To be the epitome of something is to be the height of that thing, or the embodiment of that thing, or the ultimate example of that thing, but since it refers specifically to one subject, it doesn't really apply to analogies to that thing. Some examples:  - Steph Curry is the epitome of the NBA's modern shooter.  - Donovan Mitchell's rookie definition Adidas hoodie from last year was the epitome of clever brand marketing.  - Kevin Durant is the epitome of thin-skin bitchitude.   For your comment, what if we tried this:  &gt; This is tantamount to a younger sibling doing or saying something to piss off their older sibling. As soon as the older one starts retaliating: ""Mom! Kevin just said/did this thing.""  Hope this didn't sound condescending, I'm just a big time vocab/grammar nerd, and I know I get super embarrassed when I find out I used a word wrong in real life, so I try to save other people that same embarrassment when I can. I love the word ""epitome"", so I applaud your using it in the first place either way, and I hope this clarification helps you use it more in the future!"
Referee! Referee! Kevin Durant said a bad word!
popping in to say hell yeah kevin durant. go off
I love Kevin Durant.
"15 games. 21-years-old. Come on, dude. Giannis at 21 had very similar statistics to Ingram right now. I don't think they're going to to be similar players, but it just shows the idiocy of judging players too soon.  It's like you guys expect every player to be Kevin Durant immediately or something like that. It's incredibly ignorant of how most players actually develop, and it's ignoring the incredibly small sample size so far this year and how Ingram (and the rest of the young Lakers) are still adjusting to a brand new set of teammates. Ingram has improved dramatically every year in the league, and I imagine he will again this season once everything is all said and done. "
Add in another young player with value or 2 unprotected picks + filler to make the salaries work.  The only people saying No after that are delusional Lakers fans who still believe Ingram is actually going to turn into Kevin Durant Version 2.0.  Beal paired with LeBron makes this current season less certain and doesn't stop the Lakers from being contenders for the remainder of LeBron's prime years.
this new group of Laker fans is in no way ready for the amount of hatred that we will receive if we end up with Kevin Durant and LeBron James through free agency.  if Kevin Durant ends up being a somewhat major character in space jam 2 it will be even worse.   I can't fucking wait to see if this dumb shit actually happens. 
"Must be a new fan.  And if you are, I'd like you to meet PJ Carlesimo, the OG tank commander, the inventor of Kevin Durant at SG.  Fun times.  Edit: it was so bad that they had to fire him after a 1-12 start in OKC. Brooks took the reigns and guided the team to an amazing(?) 23 win season, netting Harden in that draft. "
Kevin Durant loses his powers to the monstars but in real life
"Would love to know what the heckler said to provoke that  Edit: called him cupcake, according to TMZ http://www.tmz.com/2018/11/19/kevin-durant-cusses-out-mavericks-fan-during-game/"
"&gt; Just to give you an idea, in the previous series, they held Westbrook's FG% to .360. Now you may say, yeah, well that's just Westbrook, and that would be a mildly good point, if it weren't for the fact that they held Kevin Durant's FG% to .429. That's Kevin Durant.  And yet D wade played exceptional. Shot 55% from the field. ORtg of 123 to Lebron's 102. Lebron attempted 15 shots/game in that finals in 44 mpg, compared to 19 shots/game in 44mpg the rest of the post season. In a three point loss in game 4, he had a whopping 8 points and only 11 attempted field goals. He averaged 3 fta/game in the Finals compared 9 fta/game in the rest of the post season. Mario Chalmers attempted more FT's that series than Lebron. Was Dallas that incredible at not fouling him, or does it make more sense that Lebron was playing incredibly passive? He also posted four of his six worst game scores in the Dallas series, with his best gamescore against Dallas ranking in at 12/21 for the post season.  If the goal was to play 5 on 1 against Lebron, well they failed because he deferred to Bosh and Wade the whole time. Usage of 25.8% and 30.2% respectively to Lebron's 22.9%."
"&gt;Which owner in their right mind would Continue giving LeBron the reigns when he didn't give any assurance that he was going to be here for good.  Every single one. It's Lebron fucking James. Every year he's on your team your team is good. The Warriors just fined their own player to appease Kevin Durant.  &gt;If LeBron truly wanted to stay, he would have taken a 5 year deal instead of holding the Cavs to ransom by taking short deals every season.  He had to do that to force ownership to care about winning. That was Lebron's leverage. Otherwise, he would be stuck there with nothing just selling tickets for ownership like the first 7 years in Cleveland."
Kevin Durant
"Gonna have to disagree with this one. They curb-stomped their way into, and through the finals. They were as red-hot and zoned in as I've ever seen any Championship team pummel through the playoffs.  Just to give you an idea, in the previous series, they held Westbrook's FG% to .360. Now you may say, yeah, well that's just Westbrook, and that would be a mildly good point, if it weren't for the fact that they held Kevin Durant's FG% to .429. That's Kevin Durant.  The Mavs didn't outscore the Thunder or the Heat in that run, it was just a bunch of old, hungry, savvy players who were just at the tail-ends of their peaks, who punked a bunch of super talented young guys by playing meticulous defense. They tricked and baited them into doing stupid things, and it was a beautiful thing to watch. And they pretty much went into it with the soul goal of playing 5 on 1 basketball against LeBron, and forcing the rest of the team to beat them. I genuinely believe the pressure the Mav's brought that game would have broken a younger MJ and Kobe as well.  What happened here was pretty simple. This was a hyper-talented team, who were unfortunately only in their first year, with a young coach who had never been on this stage, and lacking a fully formed chemistry. And Rick Carlisle basically dominated them. Once these guys gelled, they were much, much harder to beat. But in this series, they were making incredibly stupid decisions on defense, and not only being shut down by the Mavs, but giving them easy shots as well. Here's a nice video that came out during the finals that breaks this down pretty well - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ\_obUYJOII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ_obUYJOII)"
Kevin Durant had a losing record in the playoffs without Russ. He lost to the Griz in 2013 without Russ and stunk it up.   You can't say KD took us anywhere; it was a team effort in 2012. Kd alone in 2013 lost hard. 
&gt;Russ is probably this for OKC  Kevin Durant begs to differ
No you’re thinking of Kevin Durant
That was before we entered the Kevin Durant dimension. Somewhere in the universe there is a world where Durant never joined the warriors

"Alright, we get it. You hate Kevin Durant."
Obviously Kevin Durant
"LOS ANGELES​ — The​ day the Cavaliers agreed to trade Kyrie​ Irving to the​ Boston​ Celtics,​​ LeBron James was signing jerseys for Upper Deck in Santa Monica, California.  When then-coach Tyronn Lue, also in California at the time, found out what was about to happen, he drove out to see James and put him on the phone with Cavs general manager Koby Altman.  James was adamant on the call — do not trade Irving, especially to the Celtics. By the end of the call, according to four separate accounts of people present for the conversation, Altman told James the trade would not occur.  Minutes later, on Aug. 22, 2017, word broke that the Cavs agreed in principle to send Irving to Boston for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and Brooklyn’s 2018 first-round pick.  James’ close friend, Randy Mims, and bodyguard Rob Brown came to him with their phones to show him the news. James, who was still signing jerseys, dropped the pen and slumped in his chair.  “Everyone knows that when Kyrie got traded it was the beginning of the end for everything. It’s not a secret,” James said in an interview with The Athletic.  James suggested he didn’t feel he was lied to by Altman, so much as Altman was overruled by owner Dan Gilbert.  “You realize at that point in time, take nothing from Koby, because Koby (was just named GM), but at that point in time, you realize that Koby’s not the only one running the team, as (former GM David Griffin) had done, and that’s why Griff was let go pretty much,” James said.  Cavs front-office officials declined to be quoted for this story but disputed that Altman gave James any indication the trade would not occur. They also said Altman asked James whether he would commit to the Cavs long-term if Irving were not traded, and James said no.  On Wednesday, James will walk into Quicken Loans Arena as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers for his first game against the Cavs since leaving the organization a second time as a free agent.  “I’m returning to a place where I’ve spent 11 years of my career,” James said. “I had some great moments, had some not so great moments, but, all in all, when you give everything to whatever, the franchise, a teammate, a coaching staff, anything, that’s all that matters.”  It wasn’t supposed to be this way. When James made his triumphant return to Cleveland in 2014, after four years and two titles in Miami, he said more than once that he intended to retire there.  Then, the next four years happened: an astonishing mix of amazing, heartbreaking and truly bizarre. Not even LeBron expected he’d so quickly be able to bring Cleveland its first major pro sports title in more than 50 years, and certainly not in such dramatic fashion. Nor could he predict that the title, along with his philanthropic work in his hometown of Akron, would cement his legacy in Northeast Ohio regardless of where he finished his career. He had no idea Kevin Durant would stack the deck in Golden State, or that his own team would lose the general manager he trusted, then trade away the other elite player he depended on — at Irving’s demand, no less. Or that one of his closest teammates would unspool one of the greatest performances in NBA Finals history by forgetting the score of the game.  There has been some assumption that one of the biggest factors in LeBron leaving Cleveland was his strained relationship with Gilbert, a strain that is both well-documented and overblown. It wasn’t like they were close before James announced on TV in 2010 he was headed for South Beach, and Gilbert responded with the Comic Sans letter, nor had they become friends when James chose to return to Cleveland.  The distrust between them was always there. When they struck a new partnership in 2014, James stuck to his job of playing at a level to put the Cavs in the Finals, and Gilbert kept his word to spend the money necessary to keep the team competitive.  Initially, the organization bristled at James’ method of doing contracts — signing one-year deals instead of a long-term, maximum contract like the three guaranteed years he gave the Lakers in July. When James felt the roster needed upgrades in season, or if he felt a change was needed at head coach, he let it be known through his body language, his commentary and his play.  But after the Cavs won their first and only title in 2016 — the city’s first since 1964 — James did something that summer for which he receives little credit. He signed a multiyear contract, for two seasons with a player’s option for a third.  Yet that same summer, the balance of power in Cleveland’s boiling rivalry with the Warriors shifted for good as Durant, a former MVP, shocked the NBA by signing with Golden State. And after Durant and the Warriors beat James and the Cavs in five games in the 2017 Finals, James, for the first time, headed into the summer without either freedom of movement or leverage over the organization.  So when Griffin, the general manager who’d built the Cavs’ 2016 championship team and whom James trusted, didn’t get a new contract from Gilbert when his old deal expired, there was nothing James could do about it. When Irving was traded, there was nothing he could do about it."
"Yeah, Kevin Durant felt like he could shoot the ball anytime he felt like it and literally killed any ball movement. But, I can’t blame the Warriors for being flat footed. It’s been a brutal week. 5 games in 7 days with 2 back to backs."
Blame Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors two years ago. That was basically opening a salt mine inside of a toxic swamp and the sub has been decaying ever since. The environment was changed on us completely by one bitch decision. 
Maybe Celtics fans overrate the talent on their roster. But ask the Warriors who they're most concerned about:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2803802-kevin-durant-draymond-green-name-celtics-as-warriors-biggest-threat  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/video/steph-return-boston-i-heard-weather-great-here-june  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/klay-thompson-draymond-green-celtics-warriors-biggest-threat/  So either the Warriors players don't know what they're talking about when it comes to basketball or you're jumping the gun by saying the Celtics are the most overrated team in the league.
"In 10 years, watch the 30 for 30 on the Warriors' dinasty and predict the whole script. Cool song starts playing and the narrator goes like ""the Champions were back to what could be their swan song, and they wanted to go out banging"".  Dramatic orchestra song starts playing and he continues: ""but then, a single moment appeared to have turned their season: the man who had pitched the Warriors to two time finals MVP Kevin Durant dared him to leave, telling the small forward the team didn't need him to win.""  Next segment shows some irrelevant bench warmer talking about how the locker room atmosphere was tense. For the first time ever, Kerr's team loses three on a row. Have they lost the plot? The NBA rejoices. But then Curry comes back, and the Warriors take flight. Narrator: ""Perhaps, what they really needed that time was their symbol to be back, a man who embodied the revolution of a franchise from lottery dwellers to all-time greats, Stephen Curry.""  Cousins comes back, the team starts winning again and make the playoffs. Documentary focuses now on how the mentality had changed, Green and KD still hate each other's guts, but manage to play well together. The Warriors reach the finals against the Boston Celtics. Journalist remarks that Curry still had a chip over his shoulder for not winning finals MVP.  ""Over the course of six games, the Warriors go 4-2, Curry wins finals MVP and alongside his teammates, his 4th NBA title in 5 years and puts the cherry on the top of a journey who sent the Warriors into the upper echelon of all-time greats. An electrifying team, led by one of the most exciting players to have ever stepped on the hardwood. A team of 5 All-stars, who some said, got so bored of their dominance that they decided to sabotage themselves to make things more interesting"", the narrator concludes, to the background music of an orchestra playing cheesy motivational songs.  The darkest timeline."
Then leave him out. They still have Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. The Thunder are doing better led by Paul George and Steven Adams while their starting backcourt is out.
It is how it is. Kevin Durant was labeled as the next TMac coming in to the league.  He reached that level and then some.
"so you're saying with Kevin Durant, and guys like Quin, Shaun, Iggy, Klay, your best and only option is to iso? That's what you're telling me? when teams like Mavs and Kings and Clippers, teams with decent talent but not a ton, are out here winning games off ball movement and running nice sets? well alright then, mr durant."
"Part 2:  It wasn’t supposed to be this way. When James made his triumphant return to Cleveland in 2014, after four years and two titles in Miami, he said more than once that he intended to retire there.  Then, the next four years happened: an astonishing mix of amazing, heartbreaking and truly bizarre. Not even LeBron expected he’d so quickly be able to bring Cleveland its first major pro sports title in more than 50 years, and certainly not in such dramatic fashion. Nor could he predict that the title, along with his philanthropic work in his hometown of Akron, would cement his legacy in Northeast Ohio regardless of where he finished his career. He had no idea Kevin Durant would stack the deck in Golden State, or that his own team would lose the general manager he trusted, then trade away the other elite player he depended on — at Irving’s demand, no less. Or that one of his closest teammates would unspool one of the greatest performances in NBA Finals history by forgetting the score of the game.  There has been some assumption that one of the biggest factors in LeBron leaving Cleveland was his strained relationship with Gilbert, a strain that is both well-documented and overblown. It wasn’t like they were close before James announced on TV in 2010 he was headed for South Beach, and Gilbert responded with the Comic Sans letter, nor had they become friends when James chose to return to Cleveland.  The distrust between them was always there. When they struck a new partnership in 2014, James stuck to his job of playing at a level to put the Cavs in the Finals, and Gilbert kept his word to spend the money necessary to keep the team competitive.  Initially, the organization bristled at James’ method of doing contracts — signing one-year deals instead of a long-term, maximum contract like the three guaranteed years he gave the Lakers in July. When James felt the roster needed upgrades in season, or if he felt a change was needed at head coach, he let it be known through his body language, his commentary and his play.  But after the Cavs won their first and only title in 2016 — the city’s first since 1964 — James did something that summer for which he receives little credit. He signed a multiyear contract, for two seasons with a player’s option for a third.  Yet that same summer, the balance of power in Cleveland’s boiling rivalry with the Warriors shifted for good as Durant, a former MVP, shocked the NBA by signing with Golden State. And after Durant and the Warriors beat James and the Cavs in five games in the 2017 Finals, James, for the first time, headed into the summer without either freedom of movement or leverage over the organization.  So when Griffin, the general manager who’d built the Cavs’ 2016 championship team and whom James trusted, didn’t get a new contract from Gilbert when his old deal expired, there was nothing James could do about it. When Irving was traded, there was nothing he could do about it."
"Kevin Durant had more points then either through each quarter in game 7.  In game 6 they were scoring the same until the last quarter when curry put the game away, but at that point the rockets were already down by 15"
1. Anthony Davis - Top 40  2. James Harden - Top 30  3. Kevin Durant - Top 12-15  4. Stephen Curry - Top 5-7  5. Kawhi Leonard - Top 35  6. Joel Embiid - Top 25  7. Giannis Antetokounmpo - Top 20  8. Karl-Anthony Towns - Top 50
"&gt; Well Curry is easier to plan for than Durant. It’s why Curry had trouble in the 2016 Finals. As much as everyone loves to say “he was hurt”, give the Cavs some credit. Cavs did the same thing in 2017-2018 only now you have Kevin Durant wide open instead of Barnes.  I mean, that just shows that KD is the better player than Barnes."
Oh you in a slump. I'm headed to Oakland like Kevin Durant 
Kevin Durant was better in the WCF as well
"Michael Jeffery Jordan would’ve bet the entire GDP of the USA on his 3 pointer, he has that killer mentality that LeBron just lacks. Like when he lost to MY Spurs in the 2014 finals, or when the Chosen One became the Frozen One against the Mavericks. Kevin Durant is already better than him in this league, Shannon."

1.	⁠Anthony Davis - top 25 2.	⁠James Harden - top 35 3.	⁠Kevin Durant - top 10  4.	⁠Steph Curry - top 15 5.	⁠Kawhi Leonard - top 35  The rest are wayyy too early to tell 
I forgot that Kevin Durant started playing in the NBA in the 2012-2013 season.
KD &gt; steph takes were pretty reasonable IMO. Kevin Durant was pretty dang good at basketball.
"Kevin ""Doubtfire"" Durant"
And is still hard doubled behind the three point line. What does that tell you.  Kyrie faced majorly single coverage against the Warriors in both finals...because they had to worry about LeBron fuckin James. Kevin fuckin Durant got lots of single coverage in the Finals thanks to Steph.
Curry plays with Kevin fuckin Durant and Klay and Draymond 
"""The idea that Kevin Durant is an all-star is laughable""  - Someone on this sub."
"KD  He got to play with great players like Harden, Westbrook and Steph and never had to play with that ass hole Kevin Durant"

The collective hate that r/nba has for Kevin Durant is all coming out in this thread
"This is not just basing it off this single game, this is just the fact. Kevin Durant is not a better player than those two."
You don't remember the daily Lonzo sucks streamable or the fact that you literally cannot mention Kevin Durant positively without getting downvoted? That was the entire first half of last season here

Says more about Kevin Durant. This is exactly who he was in OKC; his style of play takes his teammates out of the game.

"I think it's funny, for us, Jayson Tatum has basically improved in every single category except his field goal percentage has dropped just a bit, but because he isn't Kevin fucking Durant right now he sucks ass hahaha"

Putting a rookie in a designed iso against Kevin freaking Durant is retarded. Good for him for the confidence but he missed the shot. I.E. - there was a better play to be made on that possession.
"Yeah harden just has one of the best handles in he league, is one of the strongest guards in the league, can pull up or step back from anywhere, and can pass as good as any other player. There’s a reason defenders get caught fouling so often on every good player. Curry might not get as many fouls as he should, but even he draws fouls through “non-basketball plays”. Kevin Durant literally caused the swing through rule. All these players are great in the ways they can score, which opens up their ability to draw contact. "
Kevin Durant is not a leader.
Kevin Durant literally blew a 3-1 lead and joined a 73 win team to act like he did anything. Lol
"Kevin ""can't lead a team"" Durant"
How about Kevin Durant and Steph Curry
I'm not gay but Kevin Durant is pretty hot...
Hot take - Kevin Durant is good at basketball
"Kevin Durant is averaging 41.666 over the last three, actually "
Don’t have a team. Don’t live in an NBA city. Calm down. It’s just a fact that Kevin Durant didn’t choose the Warriors because of their passing. Saying that’s why he went there is dumb af
"If injuries are fair game (since Fultz clearly has some physical ailment, too), then how is Greg Oden not the top bust ever overall? Number one pick, picked ahead of Kevin Durant and Al Horford, both of whom are max contract type franchise players and All Stars. Oden was a superstar in college who put up a massive double double in the finals and played elite defense.  Expected to be the next great big man. As for injury, it’s not like it was some freak injury that nobody could foresee; he had spent a lot of his freshman year injured. And who was he picked over? Kevin Durant was balling and averaging like 30 and 10, and Horford was only winning his second title in a row. These two dudes that he was picked over were far bigger superstars in college than Lonzo and Tatum ever were. I don’t think that’s debatable. Ainge was so perturbed by missing out on KD that he concocted the Big Three and the resulting butterfly effect completely reshaped NBA as we know it.  I do think Fultz is a bigger bust than Bennett. But Oden beats all. "
And/or Kevin Durant. 
"PG: Steph Purry  SG: Meowchael Jordan  SF: Kawhi Leopard  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Paw Gasol  Head coach: Brad ""Cat"" Stevens"
"Steph Curry, being on fire, lead the Warriors during their 8 games win streak earlier the season. This win streak is the main reason they are currently sitting atop the conference.   When Steph Curry went down with an injury, Kevin Durant took the lead. And they quickly become atrocious. Just a week ago the Warriors were finishing up a 7 games stretch where they went 1-6 with their only win being a 7 point win against the bottom of the league Atlanta Hawks.   Now this person is trying to claim that Kevin Durant is in the MVP conversation because ""statistics"" and ""winning"" even though the statistics have played totally no part in their winning so he has absolutely no claim to the MVP award at this current moment.

I fucking love Kevin Durant 
ESPN tomorrow: “KEVIN DURANT PART OF CONSPIRACY THAT RESULTED IN REGICIDE IN THE RIVERLANDS???”    
"The Gasols, Vucevic, Cousins and Brook all had low 3PT % because they never took 3PT shots early in their careers, not because they were necessarily bad 3PT shooters. Most of their early career 3PT attempts were half court heaves or shot clock buzzer beaters. We won't ever know if they started their careers off as bad 3PT shooters and somehow became good 3PT shooters, they didn't take enough 3PTA early in their career for their to be a big enough sample size. That however isn't the case for Andrei Kirilenko. AK has taken three pointers his entire career (over 1.5 3PTA for his career) and has never been a good 3PT shooter. He's been below average scoring wise his entire career, 34% is considered average for a 3PT shooter, and he shot better than 34% once in his thirteen year career. He isn't going to become an elite volume three point shooter just because of the era. He took over 1,100 threes in his career that his a big sample size, he made 367 of them... That is very average to below average.   &gt;I am so sure that if Kirilenko was playing today, he will be a volume 3 point shooter.  A player that shot 31% from 3 (mostly open looks due to Deron Williams, Karl Malone, Mehmet Okur and Carlos Boozer receiving double teams) on nearly 1,200 attempts for his career, is not going to become a volume shooter all of a sudden regardless of era.  He most certainly would average more 3PT shots in todays Era. I'm not arguing that, I'm arguing his ability to make 2 3PT per game. 2 3PT per game at his career 3PT rate of 31% would mean he has to shoot 6.5 three pointers a game. That's more attempts than Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Vucevic, DeMarcus Cousins, Dirk Nowitzki, JJ Reddick, Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, CJ McCullum, Joe Ingles and a lot of players. No coach would allow a below average to average 3PT shooter to take nearly 7 three point shots per game. The players I mentioned are also elite 3PT shooters.  &amp;#x200B;"
Kevin Durant with OKC mentality is back #ScoringMachine 
"[Kevin ""Kevin"" Durant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3-d47zzvMo)"
Kevin Durant is the best player in the league like this is the best post on r/NBA today. Dude is great at scoring but just above average at everything else. His length and quickness make up for poor defense and he is only a great passer and teammate when he's drawing all the defense to him.
I actually don’t think a starting lineup of Kevin Durant and four cats would be that good. It’d sure be interesting though.

"Is the argument over for greatest team ever? Them or MJ's bulls? Cause at least talent wise, this is the greatest team we may ever see. They won 73 games. Then, added the 2nd best player in the NBA in Kevin Durant. Then, added possibly the best center in the NBA (unless you consider AD a center). Like, 5 potential hall of famers all in their primes? Like guys its been fun watching my boy Kemba tear it up this year, but at the end of the day, in June, 2019, we will see Golden State raise that trophy, even as Draymond rips the trophy from KD as he runs away to the Thunder, to finish what he fuckin started in OKC!

"There's the issue that some teams aren't exactly replete with amazing dunkers. Just looking at the sidebar, I wouldn't want to see Kevin Durant and two stone-hands Warriors big men try to face up the washed remains of the Grizzlies roster. Entertainment-wise, I'd rather see a few good dunkers dunk several times, rather than a lot of bad dunkers miss once.  It's a similar deal to the All-Star game - not every team has players that are stars."
Still obliterated the so called ‘King’ and usurped his crown. Kevin Durant a.k.a “The Kingslayer”.
"LOL if anything this is revisionist history.   You are totally ignoring his play that season and especially the series before against the Spurs where he dominated off the bench. I don't particularly like Harden but he was really good up until the Finals where he went MIA.  &gt; While it would have been great to keep Harden, it wasn't a money thing.   It was totally a money thing. Clay was considered cheap until he was given so much shit for his $5m difference. He finally overpaid Kanter. That Thunder team didn't necessarily need Harden but they legit never went after a good 3&amp;D player on the market which was basically their only hole. Anyway back to the money thing...look at any article after that trade.  [Exhibit A](https://newsok.com/article/3774653/oklahoma-city-thunder-what-if-james-harden-had-signed)  &gt;The luxury tax fluctuates, depending on league revenues, but let’s estimate it at $72 million in 2013-14. It would be in that range. The Thunder’s luxury tax for that season would be $12.75 million. That’s not chump change. Clay Bennett and the ownership group would not like such a payout. But the Thunder could live with it. It’s been a profitable franchise in OKC. Sure, the Thunder could knock off a bunch of that luxury tax by cutting Kendrick Perkins and claiming the amnesty waiver, but someone has to play center when the Lakers and Jazz and other traditional-lineup teams line up. So the savings wouldn’t be a clean $8 million (Perkins salary, minus the minimum).  [Exhibit B](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-oklahoma-city-thunder-traded-james-harden-2012-10)  &gt; If OKC re-signed Harden to a max extension, it be paying Harden, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, and Kendrick Perkins over $70 million alone in 2014-15. And would been paying the tax until at least 2016.  [Exhibit C](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/sports/basketball/oklahoma-citys-trade-of-james-harden-validates-david-sterns-design.html)  &gt; A system that forces a small-market wonder to give up a star player — to a team in a much larger market, no less — seems cruel and counterproductive. It looks even worse coming just two months after the Lakers created one of the greatest quartets ever, adding Howard to a lineup featuring Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash and Pau Gasol. "
&gt;KD didn't turn the ball over 4 times in the last 1:30 of G6. Or let Curry/Klay hit the consecutive 3PT to bring the Warriors within 1 in G6. Both Westbrook  Just gonna gloss over Kevin Durant shooting 10/31 for the game and 1/7 in the 4th quarter then huh? 
"Overall picks end up a lot worse than Lonzo.  In fact, since Kevin Durant in 2007 the only other star #2 pick is Victor Oladipo.  Everyone else has ranged from solid NBA player to huge bust.  Lonzo is on track to be a very average #2 pick."
"&gt; Especially with Thibs miles on him.  He doesn't really have that many miles for a player his age.    I have no idea where people get this.  He is 29 and at 15,650.     Kevin Durant is one year older and has 29,000 minutes.  Steph one year older has 22,000.  James Harden same age, 23,500."
Kevin Durant is All Might when he isn't buff.
So is Kevin Durant All for One?
"26% of people didn't cut the cord. Also, NFL is up.       There are 2 transcendent superstars in the NBA. By superstars, I mean they transcend culture and are well-known beyond basketball circles. LeBron James and Steph Curry. You could *maybe* include Kevin Durant.      Either way, they are all in the west. For casual fans, the players to watch all play at 10:30pm EST during the week, so they aren't going to watch. This leads to a huge decline in ratings, like the 26% you see from TNT.       Additionally, I know many fans that have forgone watching a lot of games this year simply because it doesn't matter. Sure, /r/nba will get hype midway through and keep that hype towards the end of the season that the Warriors *can* be beat, but we know it isn't true. They'll flip the switch in the playoffs and run the table. /r/nba will do again what they did last year, which is stomp around and whine that the Warriors are unfair and it's stupid.        The thing is, many NBA fans already have done that last part. There is no reason to watch games right now for casual to mid-level fans. The ones who love their team will watch, sure. The ones who kinda have interest, e.g. the large contingent who will watch *if* their team is successful and has a shot at the playoffs + championship, won't. It makes no sense to do so when you know who wins.      Why read the book when you know exactly how it ends? People hate spoilers, and the Warriors are a giant season spoiler. "
Are you serious? Enes Kanter's contract is up in 2019 so if Kevin Durant wants to sign there you bet you're ass Kanter is gone lol
Kevin Durant doesn’t seem to be much of a Grown man if he’s ranting about it and letting it bother him.

Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant 
"And he said prospect, not finished product.  Players like Ben Simmons and Kevin Durant where WAY more highly touted prospects.  Does not mean they are the best players in the end but to even have Luka on Lebrons level as a prospect is madness"
Zach Lowe has a nice piece on this -- talking about how KD has advanced his game in different ways every year but wasn't super comfortable with anything outside of scoring when he first came into the league. [Here](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23766415/zach-lowe-kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-dynasty-nba)
"I would argue the opposite, would you say Shaq isn't a great scorer because he couldn't hit a shot beyond 3 ft? Also it's not like LeBron is some scrub shooter. Kevin Durant is a much better shooter but their efficiency is similar, with Durant having a career TS% of .611 and LeBron with .587.  they average a similar amount of points on similar efficiency. Durant isn't much better of a scorer then LeBron  So I would argue it doesn't matter how you do it, just volume + efficiency."
"This Kawhi shit is still out of hand. Feels like the same thing g as saying Grant Hill was better then Kobe or T-Mac in the early 2000s. Neither the numbers, nor the play time is there. Kevin Durant is better than Kawhi Leonard and we shouldn't even have to talk about this."
"What's so different about it then? Kevin Durant switched from one job to a better job. People do it all the time. It's his life, how can you fault a guy just for accepting a better job and moving to a better city? He's only trying to make the most out of life, just like anyone else. "
"&gt;Steph added KD   Did you forget the point that's trying to be made here? The point is that KD is overrated, and somehow you think this helps his case?  Curry had already been to 2 straight finals and won a championship. He clearly didn't need Durant.  LeBron not only went back to Cleveland, where there were no guarantees (especially against Golden State), he did so after going 2-2 in the finals, he didn't run off to join the Spurs, he ran off to join one of the worst teams in the league who just so happened to have enough young assets to trade for the right pieces.  Kobe didn't lose in the finals and run off and join the Celtics. He lost to the finals WITH PAU, and they came back and won two straight.  Jordan got tired of losing to Zeke Thomas and the Pistons and came back and made sure he never lost again (for 8 years).  All of these things prove my point. While Kevin Durant is still a very good player, but he's overrated, especially in the playoffs. Dude goes to 2 West conference finals, loses and joins the team that took him out. A team that already went back to back finals and won one championship.  If dude was underrated, we'd be talking about how he closed out the series against Golden State. If dude WASN'T overrated, we wouldn't be talking about how he hadn't won anything before joining a team that was already beating him (and everyone else).  Golden State don't need Kevin Durant. He's a luxury. They were already winning championships before him.    "
"Some people may not realize how ridiculous this sounds. Only three players in the NBA history have averaged 19+ PPG at age of 19, and they are LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Kevin Durant. Luka is a big deal. "
Kevin “DPoY if not for the haters” Durant
"Curry, Harden, Lillard, LBJ, Kyrie, Kemba, KP, Trae Young, Kevin Durant, and yeah that's about all I got. "
Hes not as consistent a scorer as Harden (getting to the line has a lot to do with this.)  Hes not really a playmaker either. Hes very average there.   He can get his shot off vs anyone but thats not as valuable as getting your whole team involved especially if you cant score conisistently at a high level like a Kevin Durant can.
"Yeah, instead lebron played against Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and Tim Duncan. I’m just saying at least try to be consistent. "
At this point one could say Paul George &gt; Kevin Durant and there would be enough biased people who would agree
Sad thing is I can't be sure if you're trolling or not. Kevin Durant is not as good Michael Jordan's poophole.
"I’m not saying forgive Kawhi but just move on who cares he’s one person who plays basketball out of thousands. Same with Kevin Durant I don’t respect what he did but it’s his career and if he wants to live in Oakland and play ball there then it’s up to him. You don’t have to respect or like Kawhi but just let him live his life and play basketball at the end of the day him and Durant are just athletes doing what they love to do and wherever they want to play or not play is up to them. If Kawhi leaves after this season I couldn’t care less it’s his life and his decision. Maybe he wanted to leave Texas for reasons other than basketball who knows, whatever his reasons were for his actions and whether they are morally right or wrong it doesn’t really matter at this point, like what is your solution to this problem? Feel angry at him forever? Or think he is a horrible person for what he did? You can feel however you want to feel at the end of the day he doesn’t care what either of us think and our opinions have zero affect on his life choices. So for now I am happy he’s playing for us and Danny Green as well because he’s a sniper and seems like a cool dude, I am really happy with my team and I’m hoping we can do really well in the playoffs this year. I also love The Spurs now Derozan will always be one of my favorite players and I hope he does really well."
"I don't understand why you think we should forgive Kawhi because we don't know the full story, but you can't get over what Kevin Durant did. I'm not using any of their moves to cast personal judgments against them. All I'm saying is Kawhi isn't held to the same standard as his supposed peers. "
"Okay all this NBA drama shit is not what I care about. Whatever Kawhi did in San Antonio I don’t know full details and not gunna act like I do and you shouldn’t either. You have no idea whether or not he was still hurt or what happened in the locker room, etc. you don’t know why he wanted to leave. He obviously should have thanked the fans. But he seems like the type of guy who doesn’t want any public relations. Anyways what he did to Spurs seems shitty but it is what it is so move on. If derozen did that to raptors I would just say well whatever I don’t know him so I don’t know why he did all that but guess it’s time to move on. Kawhi plays hard both offensively and defensively. Whether he leaves after 1 year or not doesn’t matter we knew that signing him, we are trying to be successful this season the raptors obviously made the right choice.   As far as Kevin Durant is concerned, Kevin Durant is arguably top 3 players in the NBA, almost beat GSW in eastern conference finals, then joins them the next season when they are already stacked. I can’t back that I’m sorry. Imagine if Lebron James joined GSW? Imagine the criticism he would receive. He instead joined a bottom tier team because he’s not KD, he doesn’t join his rivals. He beats them. "
[NBADraft.net](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kevin-durant) described him as such. Even just the Nowitzki comparison alone is accurate. He's the closest player I've seen to truly encapsulate how Dirk's game looks like at least from the perimeter because it's always some white 7-footer that shoots three pointers that gets compared to him.
"""If you hand the turkey over to Kelvin Benjamin, he will change your Thanksgiving plans. That is the type of guy he is, no-nonsense, come to dinner type of guy."" - Kevin Durant after this weekend's turkey-less meals with Kelvin. "
I won't argue. People will make the case all day for a guy like Kevin Durant over Kobe which shows people know shit.  Guys like Kobe and Jordan didn't run off to join Boston and Detroit. People aught to be more subjective about their opinions.
"People who think Lebron should be MVP are so dense, it’s a REGULAR SEASON AWARD. It doesn’t matter what he does in the post season. Harden’s regular season was comparable but his team also won way more games and had the 1 seed over the Warriors + Kevin Durant. And winning has ALWAYS played a huge factor into MVP considerations, the value is in winning. Westbrook’s MVP season is the one of the only exception. Besides harden had an equally as amazing season as Westbrook, he just didn’t get the 2 additional rebounds per game which I’m sure he could have had the rockets boxed out for him to get the rebound all the time. Westbrook had the more aesthetically pleasing averages but Harden was much more efficient. You can debate ‘17 MVP, but not ‘18. That was decidedly Harden’s. "
"Brandon ""Kevin Durant"" Ingram"
"The worst move out of the three? I don’t know about that Kevin Durant went to the team that beat them after they were up 3-1, a team which was already the best in the NBA. Fuck outta here with this nonsense. "
KEVIN 🐍🐍🐍🐍 Durant. For being soft.
"I mean, look at him play though. I see he's listed at 6 foot, but cmon he's lying. Just like Kevin Durant lies about his height. JJ is 5'10 MAX."
**Kevin Durant at the age of 21:**  30/8/3 on 48/36/90 (61 TS%)  Leads his team to a 50 win record   **Ingram at 21:**   16/4/2 on 46/37/68  Currently a 11-7 record as the 2nd or 3rd best player playing with the 2nd greatest basketball player of all time still near his prime level.   Very much on his way 
They have a really decent roster. Glad to see that Kevin Durant is having a breakout season. Might even be better than Otto Porter Jr.
"&gt;Kevin ""not top 5"" Durant dropped 42 pts,13 rbs, and 7 assists today  ftfy"
"Tough loss, but TBH that was a fun and exciting game with a very wacky and memorable finish. Buddy Hield and Kevin Durant were both carrying their teams towards the end.   Testament to how strong this Warriors team is even with two of their superstars out. Appearances can be deceiving; I'd argue that, despite their recent funk, they're still strong contenders to repeat as champions. "
After going through an incredibly difficult period... Losing 3 games in a row.  The Warriors and Kevin Durant finally seemed to have taken the exit ramp off the longest road.  
I fucking hate kevin durant 
Kevin Durant is good at basketball.
"Kevin Durant is a world class player. What a fucking beast he is, 7 foot tall, can dribble like a guard and pull up from anywhere from the half court line. "

"To address some of the other comments here, make an Imgur gallery with each picture being a year so people can flip through it instead of zooming in.  &amp;#x200B;  Also, your FGA numbers are 201933 for each, maybe you could replace that with each year's FGA?  &amp;#x200B;  I know it'd be a lot of data to sift through, but perhaps you could add in his FG% by zone, too.  &amp;#x200B;  Small thing, but the picture of Blake is the same every year.

"Only 3 active players have had a top 50 of all time season in FTA per game:  Dwight Howard (#17 - 2010/11, #35 - 2007/08, #45 - 2008/09)  James Harden (#36 - 2016/17)  Dwyane Wade (#47 - 2005/06)  **Number of seasons with 10 FTA or more per game:**  Wilt Chamberlain: 10  Shaquille O'Neal: 7  Oscar Robertson: 6  Moses Malone: 6  Karl Malone: 6  Jerry West: 5  James Harden: 4  LeBron James: 3  Dwight Howard: 3  Dwyane Wade: 1  Kevin Durant: 1  Kobe Bryant: 1  Russell Westbrook: 1 "
"Probably, KG is literally the archetype for a player designed to fuck with GSW. He would be dominating on both ends and would have the strength and power on both sides to destroy Green. He would be able to give Durant fits, and would add a massive amount of versatility to the Cavs defense. Coupled with Lebron, that's arguably the best heavy wing combo in NBA history. GSW would be murdered in the mid range pick and roll, and in the post. KG would easily mask the limitations in Kevins Loves defensive game, who isn't a terrible defender. They would also dominate at rebounding. Love/KG/Lebron is just an absurd amount of strength on the boards, and it would take a combination of players with HOF resumes to best it. I think Bell would need to improve a lot and become the starting center in order to counter it. I just can't see the difference between Curry/Klay versus IT/WADE shooting, matching the domination that would happen in the post. I also question the mental fortitude against a team that contains Kevin Garnett. The man is insane, just a fucking lunatic. The Warriors have several players who do not handle criticism well. Switching between Lebron and Garnett would definitely have a negative effect on the Warriors composure. I don't know if it would have any positive effect, but in what could be a close series it could be a deciding factor. I know it would be the greatest finals in NBA history to watch, that's for sure. It would also be a drama and rating cyclone. "
"I saw Steve Blake at a grocery store in Los Angeles. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.  Edit: It has come to my attention that I am not /u/sirax067, but don't worry, we're both actually Kevin Durant on alt accounts so it's coo.  "

&gt;Everyone thinks they have a better chance at least making the finals in the West.   Sorry to hear about your coma. Glad you're back with us. But I have some bad news about Kevin Durant. 
"Wow, nitpick much???   So far since he’s been back, he’s had games where he shot 50%, 50%, 55%, and 47%. But you know, you choose to nitpick and call out his bad shooting nights, huh? Gotcha.   Meanwhile, Kevin Durant isn’t working his way back from any major injury, and he had six games in the entire month of December where he shot 42% or less. Did you call out Durant’s efficiency after those games?? I’m done with you.   "
"There was a five game streak in the month of December, where Kevin Durant averaged 38% shooting in that span.   What’s your point? Great shooters always have games where they don’t shoot particularly well. Calling out Kawhi for it on this one random game, when he’s still adjusting from coming back from injury, is just you finding a reason to hate on him. "

"he'd be crazy good in any era, he's Kevin Durant"
Kevin fucking Durant off the bench too. He is probably the 2nd or 3rd best scorer ever and he's not even starting. 
"The year is 2036.  Advances in medical technology have prolonged Darth Durantder's career beyond expectations, and the Warriors have won the past 18 finals.  Noah Russell Westbrook leads a fledgling Seattle squad (the 46th NBA franchise team, alongside the Shangai Sharks and the Pyongyang Pirates) beyond expectation in his first season in the league.  However, Emperor Steve Kerr, after Noah's refusal to sign on as a free agent in the summer, decides there is no place in the league for the young brodie.    EMPEROR STEVE KERR Now, young Westbrook...you will die.  Although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts  from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound  screaming through the room. Noah's body writhes in pain.  Darth Durantder grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed  figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm.   The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now  lifted high, away from Noah. Now the white lightning arcs back to  strike at Durantder. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his  helmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high  over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of  the throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength,  Darth Durantder hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.  The Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls  into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it  explodes, creating a rush of air through the room. Durantder's cape is  whipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the  bottomless hole. Noah crawls to his father's side and pulls him away  from the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young point guard and the giant forward are too weak to move.  Durantder (a whisper) Noah, help me take this mask off.  Noah But you'll die.  Durantder Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my  own eyes.  Slowly, hesitantly, Noah removes the mask from his (god)father's face. There beneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus. But the dying man smiles at the sight before him.  KEVIN	 (very weak) Now...go, my (nephew?)son. Leave me.  NOAH No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save  you.  KEVIN You already have, Noah. You were right about me. Tell Sam Presti...you  were right.  NOAH Father...I won't leave you.  Darth Durantder, Kevin Durant...Noah's (not real) father, dies.  A huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Noah rises and, half  carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a  shuttle.  A star shines across the sky above Oklahoma City.  It catches the glow of a young r/NBAer momentarily, before a wiggle across his foot catches his attention.  A Ball Kevthon.    And for once, the r/NBAer smiles.  For once... the snake is loved.  "

Larry Bird finished top-3 in MVP voting for 8 straight years and won the MVP 3 times. He also won 3 championships without having to take the hardest road. It'd be a rough debate for the Kevin Durant side.
"He really can't.   And I mean this in many ways.   Basically, people before always assumed he was the best player in the world behind LeBron, and it was just a matter of time before he passed him. His individual accolades just *kept* piling up, it looked like a good bet that he would pass Kareem, and surely he would get his ring eventually.   Then he got injured in 2015. Maybe that had an effect on him, I dunno. But all of a sudden, he went into ""I have to win now"" mode.   And EVEN THOUGH OKLAHOMA CITY HAD ASSEMBLED A TEAM AROUND HIM THAT COULD HAVE BEATEN THE WARRIORS AND WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO IMPROVE (seriously, imagine Russ, Dipo, KD, Horford, and Adams) he left.   This is a pretty fucked up world. Most people measure success by things that aren't really attributed to individuals. Like winning championships. But KD I guess valued that over literally becoming the enemy of the entire league.   But it was more than ruining his reputation as a guy who wanted to be a career player (yes, he said this like a gorillion times). He gave up his chances at being the NBA's all time leading scorer. He gave up his chances at being MVP. He gave us his chances at *being the alpha*.   Obviously, I guess some people don't care things like that. But oh boy, I would sure bet Durant does.   Durant himself even said after winning that first ring, it really wasn't as big of a deal as he thought. His exact quote was something along the lines of ""It's more about the journey than the destination.""  WELL SHIT KD, YOUR JOURNEY WAS WITH OKC! Golden State's journey to the top of the NBA *had nothing to do with Kevin Durant.* He will literally be a side quest to their eventual mythos. *Everyone knows that GS didn't need Kevin Durant, they just needed him to not be on any other contender*. Kevin Durant does not have a journey with Golden State. He joined an already formed team. They did nothing to build around him. He is not the cornerstone. He'll forever be a Scottie Pippen. Which sucks, because both players are better than their respective consensus.   He literally got played. He will get his rings, but his career has already suffered for it. Look at all the Golden State fans that basically think he's just a good role player for them. You can go back to any of the threads of KD vs Curry, and the OVERWHELMING majority of people claiming Curry is better are GS fans. He doesn't even get the credit he deserves from *his own team's fanbase.*  And that makes sense. They feel Curry *is responsible for the success of the team*. And he is. Hell, they became the greatest team of all time with him. And not with Durant.   He'll have a great career.   But he won't have the career he could have had. And *everyone* will remember. "
You misspelled Kevin Durant.
"Yeah we should look at the context, Kevin Durant had the pleasure of playing with 3 other all stars.   Kevin Durant could go to the bench and his team could have a huge lead, because another all star would be constantly out there.   If LeBron James went to the bench in 2017 the bench  would constantly blow leads and couldn't even score."
"A lot of hardens stepbacks result from him pushing off defenders. That being said, I would much rather have him do that 11 times out of 10 than his flopping near the basket because at least he’s still scoring an actual basket. He does have good handles and good court vision - probably some of the best I’ve seen from a shooting guard in recent memory. Just his flopping makes him so fucking infuriating to watch and makes me glad that he hasn’t won mvp.  As far as the warriors go, I don’t like Kevin Durant either. Obviously he’s a great player but what a bitch move to come here especially after blowing the 3-1 lead to the dubs. I kind of wish he would leave because rooting for the dubs is not as fun as it used to be."
Kevin durant....
Kevin Durant is unguardable.
See Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant. He has the skills and size to score from anywhere on the court. He's like a 7 foot Kobe. 
"What makes Bird for instance a better player than Kevin Durant? Or Magic for that matter? You said we're not talking accomplishments, but purely on that court, what makes them  better? I would take peak Durant over either of them. He's the best scorer and defender of the 3 and I don't think it's arguable to say otherwise."
"I mean, if we objectively look at Kevin Durant, who's the say he's not arguably the greatest individual talent to have ever played? "
"Kawhi's a top 5 player but he's played like 2 games this season. I don't see anywhere near that amount of respect given to Isaiah Thomas, who was 3rd in the league in scoring last season, made the All-NBA second team, and was top 10 in most advanced stat categories. But he hasn't played a game yet this season so nobody talks about his play.   So for the purpose of ""top 10 players in the league right now"" I'm gonna exclude Kawhi, IT, and also Chris Paul due to lack of games played.  Here's my personal top 15 for players this season so far. Format is (Name) - (PER) - (Win Shares) - (VORP).  1. James Harden - 30.6 - 8.1 - 4.0 2. LeBron James - 30.2 - 7.2 - 4.3 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 29.8 - 6.4 - 2.8 4. Stephen Curry - 28.7 - 4.7 - 2.1 5. Kyrie Irving - 25.3 - 5.8 - 2.5 6. Russel Westbrook - 24.5 - 4.7 - 3.6 7. Kevin Durant - 24.8 - 4.7 - 2.0 8. Anthony Davis - 28.4 - 5.5 - 1.8 9. DeMar DeRozan - 23.6 - 5.2 - 1.6 10. LaMarcus Alrdrige - 23.7 - 5.0 - 1.4 11. Karl-Anthony Towns - 23.2 - 5.6 - 2.2 12. Andre Drummond - 23.1 - 4.7 - 2.5 13. Jimmy Butler - 22.5 - 5.2 - 2.1 14. Damian Lillard - 22.6 - 4.5 - 2.1 15. Al Horford - 19.2 - 4.8 - 2.2  Paul George, John Wall, Klay, and Dray don't rate this season. They would be in the next set of names with the likes of Cousins, Lowry, Jokic, Oladipo, Beal, Tyreke Evans, Otto Porter, Kemba Walker, and Kevin Love.  I rate KD, Draymond, and Klay so low because that's what their advanced stats show. I think this can be credited to just Golden State being Golden State. When you have 2 hall of famers and 4 All-Stars, each one doesn't have to carry the load a player of their calibre normally has to on a 1 or 2 all star team.  People have been sleeping on Drummond and LMA's seasons.  I probably rated KAT too high, but his numbers are there. One thing all advanced stats have a hard time showing is defense, which is KAT's biggest weakness."
Only 54 for OKC? Damn I just assumed Kevin Durant scored 60+ when he was there.
"&gt; They get highly customized shoes tailored to their individual foot and movements on the court.  I mean, this is how guys like Kevin Durant design their shoes. I guarantee you he wears KD 10s straight out of the box. "
"I'm also quite surprised most people said T-Mac but for different reasons. I thought this sub reddit is super recency bias and filled mostly with illiterate bias kids.   But hey looks like there's some smart people who knows real basketball out here as well. T-Mac in his prime was a God, but injuries never kept him the same.    There's a reason why someone like Kevin Durant, Kobe, Melo, LeBron, Wade everyone idolized T-Mac. He was a 6'9 shooting guard with literally zero offensive weakness. He was a good defender as well, and unlike Harden, his game didn't revolve mostly around Referees lol    T-Mac was a human cheat code. One of the biggest ""what ifs"" in the NBA, because of injuries.    T-Mac was playing in a more physical era too, where refs didn't gifted foul calls 24/7. He was still smooth as butter.    Your boy Harden is great, regardless of the flopping and living in the free throw line bullshit, but he really can't hold a candle to Prime T-Mac, it's not even close. Don't trip   "
"&gt;He'll also choke to the cavs    Cavs has the best player in the world dawg. I mean, Golden State had a 2 time MVP, and 2 other all stars combined with an unreal bench. They went 73-9, but it still wasn't enough in the Finals. LeBron and healthy Cavs team won. They had to go get the second best player in the league, Kevin Snake Durant,  and had to form a super team to get past Bron and win the chip    And you expect any team in the East to actually beat LeBron and a healthy Cavs in a 7 game series? It's not choke, it's just not possible by any means"
He doesn't have it on the entire it time it seems.  https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2017/12/24/16815474/nba-2017-golden-state-warriors-denver-nuggets-klay-thompson-kevin-durant-draymond-green-jordan-bell
"Good, let the Warriors ruin basketball for the time being and teach a lesson to any bitch players that might want to pull a Kevin Durant "
Kevin Durant 
A Steph Curry or Kevin Durant 
Then choose Kevin Durant from your third favorite team 
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant over Paul George on that list? I'll take it. That's my main problem with people that say he shouldn't be in consideration for DPOY. They say Paul George deserves it over him and their main argument is Blocks≠Defense then you respond with Steals≠Defense (cause let's be honest that's the reason Paul George got this narrative because he leads the league in steals) and they get so salty because Paul George is apparently lockdown but doesn't even guard the best wing on the other team lol. 
"This was a comment on a post about KD having property on Waiters Island:  &gt;""It was my favorite place to come home to"" Durant continued, ""after a long day.""  &gt;""In the summertime, you could hear the birds chirp as dawn came. And in the evening, the cicadas would rock you to sleep. With his arms wrapped around me, I felt safe. It was just me and my Dion. Us against the world.""  &gt;""In Fall, we would play basketball on the court behind the mansion. His sweat-drenched back, up against my stomach, as I draped over him. And soon, we were on the court, naked up against each other. With my back on the warm pavement of center court, he mounted and entered me. Over and over again, he thrust inside me, each deeper than the last. Faster and faster until he let out a masculine moan. 'And one', as he burst inside me. I was forever his Kevin.""

"Dude is looking really solid. Toronto is low key developing a really solid young core in Powell, OG, and Poeltl... also got the Brazilian Kevin Durant and VANVLEET!"
"Since when is Giannis a PF? The only thing PF about him is his height, thats like calling Kevin Durant a PF "
"I mean, the entire point of playing professional sports on the level of the NBA, MLB, MLS, NFL, NHL etc is to win championships (and well, to make money). Kevin Durant gives the Warriors their best chance at winning a championship and the Warriors gave Kevin Durant his best chance at winning a championship. What was Durant suppose to do? Stay with the Thunder? Sign elsewhere? He would have had a lesser chance at winning a championship then (probably wouldn't even make it to the finals unless he signed with the Cavs). People are so hyper critical of Durant for wanting to win. "
"because i have no life  ---  1) Will anything stop Golden State from winning again?  2) Is there even an opponent that can give them a significant challenge?  3) Cleveland limps into 2018 having lost three straight games to end 2017, including losses in Sacramento and Utah. But does that change the fact the Cavaliers are the favorites to face the Warriors in the NBA Finals for a fourth straight season?  4) Can the new look offense of the Toronto Raptors give them more staying power in the postseason this time around?  5) And, if it doesn’t, does that mean that the non-stop discussion of Coach Dwane Casey’s job status will return with a vengeance?   6) What about the Boston Celtics, can their youth movement speed up enough to allow the Celtics to truly challenge Cleveland this spring?   7) Will Gordon Hayward manage to make a comeback from his gruesome ankle injury quick enough to be a factor?  8) Can Houston, Oklahoma City, San Antonio or Minnesota put a scare into the Warriors?  9) Will Joel Embiid be able to play 60 games?  10) Can The Process finally turn into The Playoffs for Philadelphia?  11) Will the Knicks, after moving on from Carmelo Anthony, be able to make the playoffs?  12) Speaking of Melo, can he get himself back on track after a rough start in Oklahoma City?  13) With 5 teams already looking like locks to make the playoffs out West, how will the remaining three spots sort out between Denver, Portland, New Orleans, Utah and the Clippers?   14) How will Jabari Parker look when he finally returns from a second ACL tear?  15) How will Isaiah Thomas look whenever he gets back on the court?  16) Can Zach LaVine’s return help continue Chicago’s stunning push for a playoff spot?  17) Will Giannis Antetokounmpo be enough to lead the Bucks on a deep playoff run?  18) Can the Wizards start playing with some consistency?  19) Which coaches will be fired?  20) Will the Suns retain Jay Triano?  21) What about J.B. Bickerstaff in Memphis?  22) What about Jason Kidd in Milwaukee?   23) What about Brett Brown in Philadelphia?  24) It seems like Doc Rivers will be sticking around for the remainder of the season. But what will happen when the offseason arrives?  25) Mike Budenholzer and Frank Vogel are helming teams that are heading nowhere with new front offices in place. Will the new regimes look to bring in their own men or will they stick with what is already there?  26) With Charlotte also heading nowhere, will Michael Jordan clean house and start over?  27) If New Orleans manages to sneak into the playoffs, will both Demps and Gentry once again survive to fight another day?  28) In Chicago, Fred Hoiberg has led the Bulls to a stunning turnaround. Will he need that to continue to keep his job?  29) With all of these potential firings, there will need to be coaches hired to replace them. Where will Monty Williams end up?   30) Could Igor Kokoskov, a well-regarded assistant in Utah who led Slovenia to the European title this past offseason, become the first European coach of an NBA team?   31) Does Ettore Messina leave Gregg Popovich’s staff to get a head coaching job elsewhere?  32) With Jon Gruden potentially leaving the ESPN broadcast booth, is this the year that one or both of ESPN’s top basketball crew, Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson, get back in the game?  33) Will the new trade deadline impact the amount of activity that goes on around it?  34) Will the new deadline potentially cause more teams to decide to stick with what they have instead of throwing in the towel?  35) Will the amount of dead money around the league prevent teams from being able to make significant moves?  36) Will there even be a star-quality player that’s put on the block?   37) Clippers are somehow staying in the playoff race even after losing Blake Griffin for most of the season thus far, will that keep DeAndre Jordan in Los Angeles?   38) Is there any way that Cousins gets put on the block?  39) The most likely star that could become available is Charlotte’s Kemba Walker. But will the Hornets be willing to blow it up, and what exactly will he bring back in a deal?  40) There will undoubtedly be a lot of teams trying to shed salary. Can any teams approaching the tax find places to move unwanted salary?  41) What will be the price for doing so (getting rid of bad contracts) in an environment with an ever-shrinking amount of free cap space around the league?  42) Can the bad teams find homes for useful veterans?  43) And can contenders in need of bench help find ways to deepen their playoff rotations despite being asset-poor?  44) Will Luka Doncic go first overall, becoming the first European to do so since Andrea Bargnani in 2006?  45) As Trae Young continues to destroy college basketball, how will people view the Oklahoma star?  46) Will Trae Young or Alabama’s Collin Sexton be the top point guard taken?  47) Where will the bad boy of the NCAA, Grayson Allen, wind up after sticking around for his senior season?   48) How will Michael Porter’s back injury impact his draft stock?  49) How will the glut of big men in the top seven — DeAndre Ayton, Mo Bamba, Marvin Bagley, Robert Williams and Jalen Jackson — sort itself out?  50) Will the players skipping college, Anfernee Simons and Mitchell Robinson, benefit from their decision?   51) Will LiAngelo Ball get drafted at all?  52) After their trade last spring, will either the Celtics or Sixers get the Lakers’ pick?   53) Will Cleveland wind up keeping Brooklyn’s pick?   54) Will this be the year Sacramento finally wins the lottery?  55) Where will cratering teams like Memphis, Atlanta, Dallas and Phoenix wind up?  56) What will LeBron James do and what will factor into his decision? (in 2018 free agency)  57) Will LeBron sign a multiyear deal no matter where he goes, or will we all be sitting here a year from now again wondering what James will do in 2019?  58) After being traded to Houston in June, will Chris Paul sign a long-term deal to stay there?  59) After being traded to Oklahoma City in October, will Carmelo Anthony opt-in to the final year of his deal?  60) What will Dwyane Wade do after serving in a bench role with Cleveland this season?  61) Will Paul George leave Oklahoma City for the Los Angeles Lakers?  62) Will the Thunder do well enough to convince George to stay?  63) Will DeMarcus Cousins remain in New Orleans, or will he go elsewhere as a free agent?  64) The Lakers will be hoping to sign at least two of James, George and Cousins. Can they get it done?  65) How will the Lakers react if they can’t get any big name free agents?  66) If Cousins does decide to leave, does that push the pursuit of Anthony Davis via trade from a theoretical discussion into an actual one?  67) There are a host of fascinating restricted free agents. What will the markets be for Parker and LaVine?  68) What about the futures of Marcus Smart and Julius Randle?  69) What about the futures of two best young centers available, Clint Capela and Jusuf Nurkic?  70) Will Orlando prioritize keeping Aaron Gordon and Elfrid Payton?  71) Will Jahlil Okafor be prioritized anywhere?   72) What in the world will Dante Exum’s market be after he’s played a combined 148 games in four years?  73) Will Manu Ginobili and Dirk Nowitzki choose to play another season?   74) Will Noah be back in New York or get a buyout?  75) Will Marc Gasol get traded after a disappointing season in Memphis?  76) Will DeAndre Jordan get a max contract?   77) Will Isaiah Thomas earn himself a payday after coming back from his hip injury?  78) Both Houston and Philadelphia will hope to make major additions in free agency. Can either?  79) Will Kevin Durant choose to sign a long-term deal or another one-year pact?  80) Will Golden State make a significant cost-saving move or bring back its core for another run?  81) Will Detroit manage to keep Avery Bradley?   82) Will Portland consider making a change if the Blazers disappoint?  83) Will Embiid manage to make an all-NBA team, and thus increase his max — and decrease Philadelphia’s cap space?  84) Will James Harden finally win the league’s MVP award, or will he finish as a runner-up for a third time in four years?  85) Will LeBron James finally get his fifth award, tying him with Michael Jordan and Bill Russell for second-most?  86) Will LeBron remain the best player but not the most valuable one by the voters’ standards?  87) Is there any way Durant or Giannis can force themselves into the conversation? (for MVP)  88) Speaking of Durant, can he go from never having made an all-defensive team to winning defensive player of the year?   89) If he doesn’t win it, will Paul George take home the honor?  90) Will anyone else besides PG and KD even be considered for DPOY?  91) Is Ben Simmons already the consensus choice to win rookie of the year or can Mitchell and Kuzma make it a real race?  92) Can the engraving begin for both Victor Oladipo (most improved) and Brad Stevens (coach of the year)?  93)Will the NBA finally get to 30 G-League affiliates? And how will that begin to change the way the minor league is handled?  94) Speaking of the G-League, will the Mexico City affiliate get off the ground by the start of the 2018-19 season?   95) Will it go well enough for the league to consider making the megacity of more than 20 million people the home of an NBA franchise?  96) In wake of recent replay complaints, will the process be changed or expanded?  97) Will there be any other rule changes after the league curtailed three-shot fouls and eliminated a timeout this past summer?  98) Will the NCAA and NBA get together and permanently alter the one-and-done rule?  99) Who will emerge as the controlling Grizzleis owner: Steve Kaplan or Robert Pera?  100) How will the league react to an impending tax crisis, with most of the league’s teams facing a tax bill next summer — including many teams that won’t be thrilled about paying it?

"Kevin Durant-Your shooting form is beautiful. Jason Kidd-You were a great player who helped us win a chip, we’ll never forget you. Rockets-I like the color red, I also like Harden. Mods-Thanks for unbanning me. Refs-Y’all still continue doing your job despite all the hate and abuse, props. Rockets fans-Y’all have a good one in Harden, don’t let the haters get you down. Although I would love it if y’all just stopped shitting on my boy Russ :("
**PG:** Steph Curry / Russel Westbrook  **SG:** James Harden / Jimmy Butler  **SF:** LeBron James / Kevin Durant  **PF:** Anthony Davis / Giannis Antetokounmpo  **C:** DeMarcus Cousins / Joel Embiid  ps: Giannis plays mostly as a PF this year.
"Eh, I think the NBA has been fairly proactive in implementing new rules to keep this stuff at bay. When Kevin Durant was abusing the rip-through in OKC it was much worse than what harden gets away with now, and the NBA made a new rule to stop it. "
"I remember Lebron driving right past Kd and dunking on him numerous times. Here: https://youtu.be/t6T1mF5yk2s?t=39s  Moreover, you seem to conveniently forget if it wasn't Kd guarding Lebron it was Draymond Green or Andre Iguodala.   &gt;Everyone now looks at the stats and says LBJ was better than durant which is utter nonsense.  You need to look at how Kd and Lebron scored. Lebron actually made more field goals but left points at the free throw line. Kd scored more because he is a better free throw shooter. Moreover, Kd is the first player in NBA history to get wide open dunks in the *NBA Finals*. There's lots of video on youtube go look at what happened in the finals. How did KD score?  What happened is KD was open because Steph and Klay ran the break with him and they ran to the 3pt line. The only Cavs defenders who ever got back were Lebron and JR, and so they ran to the 3pt line to cover Steph and Klay and KD got uncontested dunks all series *because of Steph and Klay* not because of some special talent. On the flip side, Lebron could never dream of an open shot in the finals and all of his points came right over Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, or Kevin Durant. He always faced resistance and had a more difficult job everything was too easy for Durant because of the abomination of talent. Anyone who really knows basketball saw that."
"  &gt;""It was my favorite place to come home to"" Durant continued, ""after a long day.""  &gt;""In the summertime, you could hear the birds chirp as dawn came.

Imagine a royal rumble where James harden Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were the last 3 remaining 
Yes because usually the teams with the top players attract the top free agents like how the warriors were able to convince Kevin Durant to sign with team. The hawks lost the best players they had because they went and signed with better managed teams like when al horford left them for Boston 
"He gets a little bit of the Kevin Durant treatment where people discredit what he does because of his teammates, especially being a big man who needs a guard to give him the ball. and KAJ benefited from Oscar and Magic"
I feel sorry for KD because people keep thinking people mean Kevin Durant
"Actually, Ben Simmons win shares would be more skewed because he has the ball a lot more often and thus gets more chances to directly contribute to wins with stats.    Both Al Horford and Kyrie Irving have more win shares than him, which leave fewer winning stats for the rest of the team.  I mean, I'd say Kevin Durant is on a pretty good team but he has fewer WS than Tatum right now.  As does every Warrior except Curry, which is crazy considering how much time he missed."
Im not Kevin Durant but I'll downvote you for this weird ass rant.
Are we even an 8th seed in the west without Kevin Durant?
[Kevin Durant circa 2053](https://imgur.com/a/1B65H)
"Unless someone is an absolutely generational talent, it’s a huge stretch to say a rookie will be better than an elite offensive player who happens to be perhaps the best defensive wing ever, an MVP candidate, first team all NBA etc.   Like saying “Brandon Ingram will be better than kevin Durant!”   I don’t even feel good about saying “Giannis will be better than KD” even though Giannis is already all NBA. KD gets the benefit of the doubt because he’s been so good for so long and is arguably top 20 all time"
That was before they had Kevin Durant. 
"#1 LeBron JAMES . . . #2 Kevin Durant #3 Stephen Curry  #4 Kawhi Leonard #5 Russel Westbrook #6 James Harden #7 Giannis Atentokompo ?? #6 Anthony Davis #8 Irving #9 Chris Paul #10 Paul George #11 Jimmy Butler #12 Demarcus Cousins  The Reason why i put some gap space between LeBron and KD to Others. Coz in my opinion. there no player that so close LeBron Right Now. I cant put him KD on SAME PLACE. coz i always think KD have some ease to win with his talent behind. not saying LeBron Have not enough talent with his back. but if you know some basketball you know what im saying. though.. its just my only OPINION. . And the Reason why I put Cousins Last because he is the only player i mention did not reach playoffs. yes he have some bad teamates over his stay at kings. but i think at some point to be  a great player sometimes u must lead your team in playoff berth perhaps. hes a great player thou.."" sorry for my bad english ."""
"&gt; Butler is at the center of their surge as just one of six players to average at least 20 points, five rebounds, and five assists this season (LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and DeMarcus Cousins are the others).   "
"Last thing I remember about Keyon Dooling is his scorching hot take in 2012 when he said Rondo was the 2nd best player in the league, behind Kevin Durant."
"If Kawhi is taking away Kevin Durant, Lebron James, or James Harden out of the play, then Kawhi isn't the one who has been neutralized, its the generational scorer he's guarding that has been neutralized. Eliminating them from the team's offense is about more than just that one player, it makes the entirety of the team's offense less effective. And you can do the same thing to centers in today's game by trotting out a 3pt-shooting big, which is what a lot of teams, especially the Warriors, are doing to rim-protecting bigs like Capela, DeAndre, and Adams. "
"Dude, it's not going to happen. Kevin Durant will NOT take the veteran minimum anytime soon. It would be an absolute insult to the 2nd best player in the league, and one of the best all-around scorers to ever play, in his prime. Like I said, taking a pay cut from a max deal is far different than accepting $2-$3M per year. Durant taking just $9M less this season made headlines...you think leaving $30M+ on the table is an actual possibility?   Why hasn't LeBron taken the veteran minimum at any point in his career? By your logic, as the most valuable player in the NBA, both on and off the floor, he should've taken the minimum for a few years now, to ensure he is surrounded by the best possible players to put him in a position to stack trophies.  You're essentially implying that KD retiring as a Warrior is contingent upon taking the vet minimum in the near future. That's absolutely not the case. He could retire a Warrior in 8 years, and never once take the minimum.  BTW, KD has been #2 in revenue for years now, despite playing for one of the smaller markets in the league at the time. He made like $57M in 2015-16, and $52M the year before. Why didn't he take the minimum in OKC? C'mon now, this is absurd.    "
"No, it's not the same because that sample size is far smaller than 40ish games. The stats I used don't qualify as ""advanced data"" at all. Point differential is advanced? You get the fuck outta here. The metrics I used are the most common for assessing how good a team is/projected to be. Do you actually think W-L record is better for determining how good a team is vs those stats? Especially when we haven't even had the chance yet to play those 6 less games played?  Rarely will someone tell you that the 15-16 warriors were a better team than the 16-17 warriors. They had them beat by 6 wins, does that mean they're better? That 16-17 team had Kevin freaking Durant on it. All of those ""advanced stats"" point to that 16-17 team being better. And guess what, they were right. Warriors handily won in 5 and obliterated the competition before that. "
i would like to see ESPN of the 90's go all Charles Oakley over current ESPN  Kevin Durant 
Because Fuck Kevin Durant
It’s really not. Kevin Durant is one of the most impressive scorers of all time and absolutely can be compared to Kobe
He was HC for GS without Kevin Durant yo. That has to count for how good he still manage to win. Granted they still talented all around but they became this crazy good when Kevin Durant decided to join.
Kevin Durant and Brandon Ingram are also string beans. The kid is 16 and that Ball boy can ball boi 
"Boozer and Pau gasol. Both players that were great at one point, but came to the bulls well past their prime. Obviously it's the same with Wade. We haven't drawn an actually alluring free agent, in their prime, since the 1990s. I'd love to hear about the mega star we are going to be signing in free agency. Who are you thinking? I really do love arguing with people like you because you aren't going to have any concrete examples. Lavine hasn't even played a game for us and Dunn has scored over 30 points one time in his career. I don't think you watch the mavs, but ask a mavs fan about that deal. They love him, and he's a young athletic player who can develop into something more. Instead we are gonna continue to pay big name free agents past their prime (it's always been like this in the 2000s eras, starting with jalen rose and ben wallace) because there is absolutely nothing that would draw a player like kevin durant here. Jimmy butler is averaging 28 ppg right now, with far better defense than melo. Is he a superstar? Can we justify trading away a young star that we did have in the hopes we can draw in a superstar from FA that simply doesn't exist? Your attachment to reality is warped by this dream that the bulls have a plan to break through and be a  good team. The FO is simply trying to keep their jobs. Regardless of the pick we end up with next year, one rookie player is not enough to turn an entire team around. Get ready for at least 3 years of losing basketball, followed by another period of mediocrity brought about by our clueless FO.  Edit: Also, deng was an expiring contract that year. We would have had the cap space regardless, we traded him for bynum(bigger expiring contract) and a couple second rounders which we considered a profit. It kind of had nothing to do with going after melo."
"OP is saying Kevin Durant is a generational talent and quite obviously a top 3 player in the league today. Were he to win MVP, no one should care (as in be outraged) because he's a great player and is a deserving candidate pretty much every year by virtue of being a top 3 player. However, it seems there is a lot of pushback simply because people don't like him, or because he isn't exactly carrying the Warriors. Both of those reasons are not great reasons to be outraged if he wins awards. "
"Lmao imagine your team is good enough that you deny a trade that makes your team Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, and Kevin Durant. Plus a stacked deep bench.   "
&gt; The warriors have s better defensive rating when Kevin Durant sits.   This means nothing... Durant is playing 34 minutes a game. He's most likely sharing the floor with the other teams best players.
"Kevin ""Boa Constrictor"" Durant"
"Since its paywalled heres some of the meat:  &gt;	That's how Warriors management lives, thinks and operates — it doesn't matter how well the team is going now, how many titles the Warriors have won, how many superstars they've got on the roster or, really, how many different layers and salary-cap complications they'd have to decipher on their way to this.  &gt;	The Joe Lacob/Bob Myers Warriors always have a mega target in mind, loosely timed to a future date, projected onto their whiteboards and roster imaginings. They don't bet everything on getting that player; they don't presume anything about the process; Lacob, Myers and their basketball operations just believe in circling somebody (or two somebodies) off in the distance and then working towards that goal just to see if they can get it done, eventually.  &gt;	For at least two years before they landed Kevin Durant in July 2016, he was the dream target. They didn't know if they'd get him, but the Warriors worked every realistic angle they could to make sure that they'd present the best case to him when he became a free agent. It worked out OK.  &gt;	Before that, Myers and Lacob targeted DeAndre Jordan (signed him to a restricted free-agent offer sheet only to see the Clippers match it), Dwight Howard (missed out, but then switched quickly to a succesfsul pursuit of Andre Iguodala) and — a little more quietly — Chris Paul. Among others.  Further along:  &gt;	The timetable for this? That one is up in the air, because Davis, still only 24, is signed through July 2021 but can opt-out a year earlier. There is some thought that New Orleans' prolonged inability to climb into the Western Conference elite might get Davis thinking about life elsewhere … and might trigger the Pelicans to think about trading him before risking him walking away as a free agent for nothing in 2020.  &gt;	How would the Warriors try to leverage this? Davis would have to want out, and then the Warriors would have to meet New Orleans' trade price — and that would almost certainly have to include either Klay Thompson or Draymond Green or potentially both.  &gt;	Which is a lot. I'm pretty sure there is no definitive Warriors decision about whether they could or should offer either or both in a Davis deal or any deal. Maybe it's unrealistic. But to get into the Anthony Davis market, you have to think big.  "
The warriors have a better defensive rating when Kevin Durant sits. I see all these DPOY posts and I'm a bit shocked because blocks are legit the most worthless stat in basketball...most don't even lead to a change in possession.  
I like Steph Curry. But I hate Kevin Durant and Zaza. And I like Klay. But I don't like Draymond. Kerr is awesome tho. Smh should I like or dislike the Warriors?
"Huh, today I learn that Rudy Gobert and Kevin Durant are US senators. These guys really are incredible and do it all."

"Upset?  It's possible. Rondo could decide that he's tired of the Warriors' shit in game 4 when the Warriors have a 3-0 lead and Omri Casspi is raining 3s late in the 3rd quarter as the Pelicans trail by 25. He could watch Durant and Steph be good teammates on the bench, as each has scored the 25-ish points they need on 16 odd shots, while having barely played 30 minutes. Rondo could suddenly realize that Durant has ruined the competitive balance of the league, that reptiles don't belong in the Southeastern United States, that this team is somehow paying Draymond Green half of what the Timberwolves are going to pay Andrew Wiggins for the next half decade.  So Rondo could take his frustration out on the Warriors by calling a timeout, unprompted. He could make his way towards the Warriors bench, armed with nothing but the pocket knife that arena security didn't check for when he entered the game. And he could stab Kevin Durant, repeatedly, watching the knife works its way across the smoothness of Durant's leathery hide. Rondo would be immediately grabbed by the law enforcement at the game, of course. 30,000 people at the arena, millions more watching at home, Durant's own teammates, Wanda, Steve Kerr and Assistant Coach Potato Head would all be staring in shock and disbelief, with tears on their eyes as they see the last breaths of life leave Durant's body.  That would upset the Warriors greatly, I would think."

Unpopular opinion: Fuck Kevin Durant 
"Thats a pretty arbitrary criteria. So if you play like crap for most of the games but go off for 50 in one game thats good but if you consistently perform well and help your team win each game with an efficient 24-40 points thats not as impressive? He has scored in the high 30's a number of times in the Finals &amp; WCF but was pulled because GSW had a big lead and he scored 40 in game 1 last year against the spurs.  Also, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kevin Durant &amp; Tim Duncan have never scored the arbitrary amount you require in any playoff game. Wade &amp; Kareem only did it in an earlier round of the playoffs. "
"&gt; I think contribution to the team is important but comparing and contrasting two players contributions to the same team isn't.  ???  If one player contributes more to a team, he is more valuable to the team. That's extremely important, it doesn't matter if they're on the same team.   Every role obviously has it's own duties....Saying that, ""Oh, obviously a point guard is going to affect the offense more than a small forward"" is such a weird assumption. The reason a point guard generally has that affect is because they are the best at handling the ball and **leading** the offense. If a small forward, like Lebron, is amazing at it, it doesn't matter what position is played. Leading an offense is a skill. It's not inherent to the position of a point guard. It is just expected of them. If Kevin Durant could lead the offense better than Steph, why would Kerr not delegate this duty to KD? This speaks more to the ability of Steph to be a floor general, to playmake, create open shots for his teammates, etc.   I mean Draymond and Iggy are literally the two other dominant ball-handlers and they're not even point guards. They're delegating this duty because they have the ability to **lead** the offense.  &gt; And I think I take exception to your claim that offense is absolutely more important than defense but if you explain your reasoning then I might understand better  The ruleset and the way games are officiated just lend itself to the offensive player rather than the defense. With the three ball becoming more and more prominent, defensive schemes haven't yet caught up to this evolution. In today's NBA, offense is just at an advantage. This is why we see so many offensive savants coming out in contrast to great defensive players...It's just harder. In the modern era, really only one team won a championship with a defense better than the offense -- the 2004 Pistons.   &gt;  To clarify, are you saying that Curry's offense is better than KD's to the degree that KD's defensive contributions are essentially irrelevant?  Well I never said his defensive contributions weren't relevant. Just that the net impact of Steph is greater than KD's net impact. The way I rationalize this argument is that, through the eye-test and stats, Steph's offensive contributions are so great that they result in more winning than Kevin's defensive and offensive contributions. For that reason, I find that Steph is the better player, because of his otherworldly offense.   &gt; it's just a reminder that Curry and KD on other teams might produce different results  Well yea. KD would be great for a shit team, because Durant increases the floor level of a team to an all time level with his complete skillset and versatility.   Now, since there's no real precedent of prime Steph being on a shit team, for the sake of argument, I'll say that KD's value to the ""floor"" of a team is larger. The ceiling of a team, is a completely different story. Steph offers one of the highest ceilings to a team we've ever seen. He led a 67 win team, 73 win team, and then another 67 win. He has one of the most historic offenses ever, and has won two titles. Stephs value has lent itself to creating teams that impose sheer dominance on others. His effect on the ceiling of a team is only matched by Lebron in todays NBA.  "

"&gt;Kevin Durant will go down as an all time great lite, back with guys like Dirk, KG, and Kobe.    This is false. Curry's just entered his prime and he's already shown to be much more impactful on offense than KD. On defense KD is better but it doesnt make up for the difference in their offense. And right now it's not even clear that Durant is the best player on the team  Durant is only a better scorer. Curry is a better playmaker, shooter, gives more spacing, and overall is more impactful "
"Stephen Curry will go down as one of the all time greats in line with Shaq, Magic, and Bird. Perhaps even with Jordan and Lebron up at the top.  Kevin Durant will go down as an all time great lite, back with guys like Dirk, KG, and Kobe. "

"there’s so many solid arguments against it. you probably just disagree with every one of them and refuse to accept them.    kevin durant is one of the best basketball players in the world, he was one win away from potentially winning a championship. instead he blew a 3-1 lead. so instead of sticking with his team that nearly made it to the finals, he went to (debatably) the greatest team of all time, with the first ever unanimous mvp. he took the easy way out. it’s a bitch move.  "
"Individually, Kevin Durant of the Golden State Warriors is a better basketball player than Steph Curry of the same team, but Steph curry is more valuable to the Warriors overall system due to his play style."
"LeBron started his senior year of high school as a 17 year old (which is normal). He turned 18 in December of his senior year. He was then drafted and started his first NBA season as an 18 year old. He turned 19 in December of his first season.   Kevin Durant started college at 17 years old, but turned 18 a month later (not typical, but nothing unusual about it). He was drafted when he was 18, but turned 19 a month before his first NBA season. "
" LeBron graduated at age 18, Kevin Durant graduated at age 17. LeBron turned 19 his rookie year, Kevin Durant turned 18 his freshman year, and 19 his rookie year.   LeBron's age by season:  03-04: turned 19  04-05: 20  05-06: 21  If I follow this, at age 28 he will have 9 seasons.  Also,  28-19 (his ages in your timeframe) = 9.  Same thing with KD. "

"&gt; Spacing definitely helps in isolation but having a better supporting cast which Durant has always had over Harden or Lebron eases his burden in all scoring settings. Isolation plays are very arbitrary, since Durant's teammates are always more of a threat, he has an easier time scoring in all situations, iso or not.  Watch those OKC games when KD was on the team then. There was absolutely no spacing, and Westbrook doesn't set picks for anyone else. Most of his buckets were self-created.  &gt; IMO Durant defs is not the best iso scorer in the league or he would've hit on one of the over 20 chances he had at closing out the warriors in the span of three games  lol if Harden was the best iso scorer in the league, he wouldn't have brutally choked against the Warriors in 2015 or against the Spurs last year. And Durant balled out the last game against the Warriors.  &gt;  He is not a guy you can rely on to get buckets consistently on isolation Ala Harden, Melo, or Kyrie. he is most effective coming off of picks and pin downs.  I literally just showed you that Durant in fact can be relied upon to get ISO buckets, even moreso than Harden.   &gt; Same can be said about Lebron and Harden's supporting cast. Regardless of what your opinion of those players are, they are definitely better than Harden's pre 2017/18 supporting cast and Lebron's first stint Cleveland supporting cast.  Are you kidding? You would rather have Reggie Jackson who had a 52.7 TS% that year and Serge Ibaka than Clint Capela, Aaron Gordon, and Patrick Beverly? You have to be trolling.  &gt; They were definitely miles ahead of Lebron's supporting cast of mo Williams, boobie Gibson and illgauskus.  That Cavs team had the 4th best defense in the league. That's something. Better than Reggie Jackson and Serge Ibaka.  &gt; At that time (i.e. when Lebron was age 21), the East was a stronger conference than the west with powerhouses in Detroit, Orlando, Boston, Miami, etc.  The Celtics were the 2nd best team in the Eastern Conference when LeBron was on the Heat. All of their big 3 were in their mid 30's. That Celtcis was not better than the Kobe Lakers, the Duncan/Kawhi Spurs, OKC, and the Warriors for that matter.   &gt; And also as an aside, Lebron has always been a much better playoff scorer than Durant who always seems to choke when stage is at its biggest  LeBron James in the playoffs: 28.4 PPG, 57.4 TS%  Kevin Durant in the playoffs: 28.8 PPG, 58.8% TS"
"No, you ruined the game with your nutkicking antics and recruitment of kevin Durant, dray mund "
"Nah, this team is better than last years team, and they've addressed some of the mistakes from last years team. However it's tough to address Kevin Durant, and they will probably lose unless something unexpected happens. Its impressive that they put this team together though, they were in an impossible situation with their salary cap."
That's right. I forgot about that. Who would they have signed though? As I remember there wasn't many wing options available that FA.   Kevin Durant for Adams would be a horrible move for the Warriors. 
Half expected Kevin Durant  What have you done to me /r/nba
"Curry is the second-best player in the world behind Lebron.  This has been true since his second MVP season and hasn’t changed at any point since then, and probably won’t change until Curry declines, Lebron declines, and/or Giannis or somebody young makes an amazing leap.  We’ve probably already seen the best Kevin Durant we’ll ever see, and he’s not better than Lebron or Curry.  "
"No ones complaining about you guys getting better you idiot, were bad Kevin Durant left a championship contender that was one game from beating you guys who choked a 3-1 lead, and joined the best team in the league all while being the second best player in the league."
ah my favorite player kevin durant durant.

Also Kevin fucking Durant.
"&gt;teammates Harden had on that 2016-2017 Rockets team were pretty damn good. Maybe even better than what Durant had in his OKC years due to spacing.  Lol are you serious? 36 year old Jason Terry, Corey Brewer, and Tarik Black, Kostas Papanikalau. you probably also don't know that a washed up Howard missed half the season  &gt;Im going to use Kevin durant's TS% and PPG in his best scoring years vs LeBron's best scoring year in his prime then. KD's best scoring in OKC: 2013-2014: PPG: 32.0 TS%: 63.5% LeBron's best scoring in his prime: 2013-2014: PPG: 27.1 TS% 64.9%  Compares best respective scoring seasons then uses Lebron's best all around season that cherry picks in favour of your argument. Why don't you use his actual best scoring season? 30 ppg on 57% with Mo Williams the second option. Theres a reason Lebron averages a fraction more points per game for their respective careers despite being a more willing passer and way better facilitator.  "
"&gt;  Use volume and true shooting which shows Lebron in his prime is just as good as KD in his prime.  Im going to use Kevin durant's TS% and PPG in his best scoring years vs LeBron's best scoring year in his prime then.  KD's best scoring in OKC: 2013-2014: PPG: 32.0 TS%: 63.5%   LeBron's best scoring in his prime: 2013-2014: PPG: 27.1 TS% 64.9%  In KD's MVP year, he scored far more points on not much less efficiency than LeBron, and LeBron had better teammates on the Heat as we saw in the 2012 finals. Even then, in 2012-2013, KD put up more PPG on efficiency almost identical to LeBron's most efficient year.  &gt; Thats because Harden Isos way more than Durant and Durant s teammates are way better so theres less help defence going his way when he iso. Its as simple as that.  Durant iso'd a shit ton in his OKC years, and the teammates Harden had on that 2016-2017 Rockets team were pretty damn good. Maybe even better than what Durant had in his OKC years due to spacing."
You make it seem as though players just want to drop into ready made teams.  Everyone isn't Kevin Durant.  Also take a look at the all-star voting.  There have to be some guys looking at that wondering how many votes an actually deserving player would get on the Lakers.

&gt; KD chill damn  I totally thought you were talking about Kevin Durant at first because I don't know a ton of players. Super confusing without the title of the post.
He called Kevin Durant greater than LeBron for one night one time and people absolutely lost their minds.
"&gt;The Cavs production as a whole has been garbage, don’t blame it all on LeBron especially when the best Cavs lineup has LeBron in it, the reason why he’s a net negative the first time ever in his career this season is because your starting 5 consists of two players consistently playing poorly.   Ehhh no.   First, Kevin Love has been very effective this season.  Second, Lebron James has been atrocious defensively this season. The starters, in general, are playing poorly defensively, but Lebron James' performance is unacceptable at the four spot. Yes, Kevin Love has clearly been better than Bron on that end.  Third, The top 2 two-man lineup, (To specify which player's causing the positive) does not contain Lebron James.   &gt;He doesn’t have to be the MVP to be the best player in the world, and i personally think it’s too early to call it quits (especially on your own team). I’d definitely wait for the playoffs before I say anything, we literally hear the same chatter about the Cavs every year.  I think Lebron is in the MVP discussion. I have not quit on my team either lol.  But he's not even close to playing like the best player in the world.   Harden, Curry, Durant, and Giannis.  "
Kevin Durant. [He's got such a touching life story and is so down to earth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmRJgKbibB8)  Bring the downvotes.

"Now that I know peeps call another player KD... let me clarify  GSW Kevin Durant, is not shooting so hot this game: 6-15"
"Not OP but I used to really like Kevin Durant. The whole MVP speech with his mom, talking about how he didn't want to be second at anything, all that good stuff. Between going to the Warriors(which IMO for a player of his caliber is really indefensible), the fake tough guy confidence it gave him, the multiple twitter/IG accounts, he's just clearly not the guy I thought he was(or was presented to me I guess?). Plus his absolutely tone deaf responses to anything involving him. He's an all time great and everything but my opinion of him is fairly negative."
So your saying that Steph has to make 108 3's and Kevin Durant gets another ring?

"Here's a report for [Kevin Durant](http://www.nbadraft.net/players/kevin-durant):  &gt;Strengths: A dynamic wing player with freakish length and agility and a scorers mentality ... Has the ability to essentially score at will on the college level … A special player offensively, who has fully developed post skills to go along with an NBA-range jumper … His ability to pull up off the dribble is absolutely illegal for a 6-10 player … Simply dominates even elite NCAA competition and top defenders, as his combination of height, length, athleticism, and skill is completely unrivaled on this level … Despite a laid-back nature, he has developed leadership and demands the ball in crunch time … He's skilled and instinctual enough to have an offense run through him … Already a great rebounder who understands the importance of boxing out and can simply leap over players who try to push him out of the lane … Has the potential to become a great defender with his 7-5 wing span and great leaping ability … The best NCAA freshman to play in some time … Born in September, he's a year young for his grade, further adding to his intrigue!  &gt;Weaknesses: Hasn't been fully tested in terms of competition. Does he have the fire inside to maximize his abilities and develop a killer instinct? He has a laid back demeanor; will he continue to work hard after he starts cashing 7 figure checks? … Defensively, he's very lax. Tends to be too upright, and should focus more on his defensive fundamentals, getting low in his defensive stance, especially on the perimeter … Has all the potential to be a lock down defender, but doesn't put the effort in on that side of the ball … Still needs to bulk up, although he has bulked up significantly since high school. May always be skinny and adding too much weight could slow his foot speed some … Adding weight will make him more aggressive inside, as he tends to shy away from contact and can be pushed around and affected when played physical … Ball handling could still use refinement, as he is a little too high in his dribble … Shows flashes of great passing but is inconsistent … Should block more shots with his length and athleticism … Can improve upon the nuances of the game, moving without the ball, understanding where to be in help defense situations, giving equal effort on both ends of the floor etc.  "

That makes no sense. Kevin Durant joined the Warriors even though the Warriors didn't win the championship. The Cavaliers did. 
i just looked at that list and its typical ESPN trash meets an American circlejerk. There is zero chance that more people know who Kevin Durant is or who Phil fucking Mickelson is than know who Usain Bolt is
"&gt; I don't see any real argument to hedge and keep the Brooklyn pick. If LeBron leaves they're a decade away from being competitive. A top 7 pick isn't going to significantly change that and by the time a player picked next year develops the rest of the team will be post-prime.   Thank you. I get that nobody wants to tank for years and watch your team continually go  &lt; .500. Believe me, I've had enough of that shit. But at this point the Cavaliers are so handicapped that not going all in seems weird to me. Yes, you might ""waste"" the pick if you're hedging against LeBron leaving and thus lose a year -- but you're going to have to do that regardless.   Either the Cavs are really high on this draft class, or they don't want to seem like they're getting fleeced. I don't follow college/highschool basketball enough to form a reasonable opinion about it, but unless you're picking up another LeBron, Kevin Durant, or Stephen Curry, it's not worth risking the sure-fire LeBron you have this year.  As a Raptors fan, however, I hope they keep it."
"how many non guard allstars are there in the West right now?  Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Karl Anthony Towns, DeMarcus Cousins and maybe Aldridge, George, Griffin and Jokic."
"The Cavs need Air Bud, Lil Bow Wow, dude from Luck Of The Irish and Kevin Durant to get hurt to win at this point"
"Jordan Bell is a defensive specialist that usually plays in a team with Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson etc., barely having a shot longer than right at the rim. I think he could have different reputation if he came to a weaker team.   I can see the typical threads going. ""DAE Jordan Bell gud"". ""He 5 ppg lol"" top comment."
Kevin Durant 
You are not getting in sync if you don't practice. It's not some magical trick where Cavs who coasted through the reg seasons with their new members and in fact didn't practice at all will suddenly start playing in synchronization against the Warriors in the finals.   It's a gradual process that takes effort. Not to say Cavs never had any sync when it comes to offensive plays even in 2016 when they won the ring. It was just the fact that LeBron brute forced to somehow manage to beat Warriors in 7 game series.   But this shit won't work anymore when Warriors got the 2nd best player in Kevin Durant. This Warriors just has too much ammo to fire at you and it will be really hard to even win 1 game against them. Cavs ain't winning shit.   Why do you think Warriors just not give up during reg season games? Surely they can coast to finals too right? That's the difference between great teams and a team with yes men.

but his team will still be like 10-15 games behind the warriors   Kevin Durant will also be right there with lebron in terms of stats   Durant right now is at 27-7-5 shooting likely 50-40-90 for the year plus leading the league in blocks   does the 1 rb and 2 asst difference make up for the 10-15 game difference in records 
Can I buy a Kevin Durant with Bitcoin? Where's Cuban?
"does LeBron do a streaming platform?  my favorite was when KD [bought into Pieology](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/20961955/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-buys-stake-pizza-business), much like LeBron bought into Blaze Pizza"
Is that how this works? Steph Curry's face is stupid and Kevin Durant sits when he pees. Draymond Green probably picks his nose and eats the boogers. I mean no disrespect to any Warriors players.
"I can assure you he hasn't really grown height-wise since his days at Texas \m/, where he was also erroneously listed at 6'9.   &gt;Speaking to Bob Fitzgerald on KNBR, Durant put fact over fiction when answering the age-old question of how tall he really is.   &gt;""Since I love you guys so much, I was recorded at 6'10"" and three-quarters with no shoes, so with my shoes on I'm 7-feet,"" Durant finally revealed.  &gt;So, why has Durant been listed at 6-foot-9 for so long? ""I just like messin' with people. They just ask me so much... yeah, I just like messin' with people.""  He says his reason is to fuck with people but I don't buy that. Others have said what I said and that seems much more plausible.   EDIT: found the article, turns out it is him who said it. https://www.sbnation.com/2017/6/12/15773612/how-tall-kevin-durant-height-warriors"
"Given that there are not a lot of players as good as Kevin Durant, the better question is ""Would the Cavs beat the Warriors if they signed a Kevin Durant clone?""  Probably not. They don't have the two greatest shooters of all time and the DPOY.  EDIT: ""Not a lot of players as good as Kevin Durant"" is underselling how good KD is."
kevin durant straight up
LeBron and Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is my dad confirmed
"1. Stephen Curry, Golden State  2. LeBron James, Cleveland  3. Kevin Durant, Golden State  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee  5. Kristaps Porzingis, New York  6. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia  7. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City  8. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia  9. Kawhi Leonard, San Antonio  10. James Harden, Houston  11. Lonzo Ball, Los Angeles Lakers  12. Kyrie Irving, Boston  13. Klay Thompson, Golden State  14. Damian Lillard, Portland  15. Jimmy Butler, Minnesota"
Let me give you a realistic response since no one seems to want to give you one. Irving and IT may seem comparable on paper but IT succeeded last year with the Celtics because he was the ONLY offensive weapon. He could drive to the lane and dish to Horford for easy layups. And then sit back as the best defense in the league slowed down the Warriors scoring. That doesn't work with the Cavs. Lebron is out playing the wings and tossing the ball all over the court. Not sitting in the post up position waiting for IT to toss him the ball.   When IT drive against the Warriors they have Draymond Green and Kevin Durant waiting for him. They can easily swat it away and defend a shorter big man like Love from getting to the rim.   Kyrie was a more versatile scorer who helped distract and spread the floor for Lebron. That's why he got tired of his supporting role. He wanted the IT role in Boston. He was also a better defener than IT.   And he still gave them no chance against the Monstars.  IT is great but he's not a good match for the Cavs.
The last thing the Cavs need is scoring they're like fucking slot machine of scoring. All IT adds to the table is a tiny scoring machine who drives to the hoop. Which isn't going to help at all when you've got Draymond Green AND Kevin Durant in your front court. IT will help only in floor spacing but the Cavs desperatly need a scoring shooting athletic defending big man down low and they're not going to get it. 
"Fournier? Bazemore? Bellinelli? Middleton? AND getting rid of Love? I'm sorry but this is a whole lot of work for nothing. I don't know how to spell it out to people but the Golden State Warriors have Steph Curry AND Kevin Durant AND Draymond Green AND Klay Thompson. The only player on that list you mentioned that's better than ANY ONE of those players is Lebron James. Now granted Lebron James is the best player in the league and can still drag dead weight to the finals but all of those trades are just punting pennies.   The Cavaliers can be helped by one thing and one thing only. A superstar. That's the only thing that will compete with the Warriors or even the superstar stacked Rockets.   Kevin Durant broke the league when he moved to the warriors no amount of trading pawns can beat that team. The Cavs needed to keep Kyrie Irving AND sign one of the major free agents over the offseason to have any chance of beating the Warriors. They could have done it but Irving screwed them over. Butler, Paul, Anthony, George. There were so many players looking to join a championship team and Irving steered them all elsewhere. Griffin tried to prevent from happening but the Cavs ownership wasn't having it. Instead they signed more old dead weight in Rose and Wade.   I think a big error in your judgment is that you seem to think the problem for the Cavs who have JR, Korver, Green, Frye, Shumpert and Wade is that they need more wings.  Their only chance at this point is to sign an allstar big man. Jordan wants out of LA so I don't know why they're not throwing everything they have at him. They've got plenty of talented pieces to throw around to get him.   There's another talented big man in Greg Monroe and they should be throwing everything they have at aquring him if they can't get Jordan.   Gasol or Cousins are other players who would allow them to beat the Warriors. Big, scoring, shooting, defending athletic big men who can compete against Durant Green for the paint.  And they've got to hope and pray that IT can get his legs under him and he and Lebron can figure out how to share the ball and capitalize on both of their talents. Because by the looks of it it's not happening any time soon.   Barring that the Warriors are walking to another championship.   TLDR:  Fournier, Middleton, Bazemore and Biyombo are gonna add jacksquat but confusion and a steep learning curve for the cavs. And losing Love gets rid of your only tradeable asset AND your pick which is your only hope for a rebuild for what amounts to a big fat zero. "
"I honestly think that's not the issue at all. Basketball culture as a whole is shifting into Hollywood culture the way we glorify these people, but that's an argument for another day...   However, there's nothing wrong with a literally friendly scuffle or talking shit, it's all part of basketball, and televising it shouldn't be an issue. If we lived in the 90's, Jordan vs whoever would be televised and talked about and tweeted about and instagrammed about just as well as these scuffles do nowadays. People's habits didn't change because Kevin Durant decided to go to the warriors lol.  Fans that want to watch pure basketball can still watch pure basketball. Example, the knicks pelicans game from sunday was great. NBA even put up a highlight video of it yesterday to showcase how great the game was, and (I don't follow mainstream media BUT) I'm sure it was talked about a bit in the media as well. Basketball is alive and kicking and people aren't losing interest, it's people like you guys that choose to look at a narrative and look for things that support it that try and bring it down with them, no offense. Try to look at things from a different point of view and you'll see that basketball today, albeit having some problems that will come up later on (AAU basketball and popularity of younger players becoming an issue already.. again.. topic for another day...), is a great game."
"ORL receives: Kevin Durant, Steph Curry  GSW receives: DJ Augustin  Who says no?"
Or because Kevin Durant left that city once already?
"You have to understand what you said first. Alright?   &gt;if Curry was a rookie this year    That's what you said, it doesn't matter if it's about 3 pointers or MVP, that sentence alone is super irrelevant and hypothetical, you played the 8what if* game, i played that same game. It sounds stupid as fuck regardless.   &gt;&gt;&gt;   What if Durant didn't choke that 3-1 lead with OKC in the WCF in 2016 and beat the Warriors an go on to face LeBron in the Finals?   &gt;&gt;&gt;   What if Durant had never joined Golden State?    &gt;&gt;&gt;   What if Kevin Garnett was drafted by the Spurs and Tim Duncan was drafted by that Minnesota team?   &gt;&gt;&gt;   What if LeBron didn't have his first and last worst Finals performance ever in 2011?   &gt;&gt;&gt;   What if LeBron had Kyrie and Love both in the 2015 Finals against the Warriors?   &gt;&gt;&gt;  What if u/LanaRhoades- would shut the fuck up and stop with the irrelevant hypothetical statements and go back to porn instead?   &gt;&gt;&gt;  Crazy man, the hypothetical *what ifs* goes nowhere, it's super irrelevant and sounds stupid as fuck.  So stop being a dumbass and go to sleep kid. Don't trip"

"“Man, they got to do something in The Q,” Kevin Durant called out. “Somebody call Bron!” - Kevin Durant  That's funny as hell"
"Barnes is one of only 10 players this year averaging greater than 18.5/6.5/2 (He averages 18.7/6.6/2.2) The other 10 players are:   * LeBron James * Kevin Durant * Giannis * KAT * Russel Westbrook * DeMarcus Cousins * Anthony Davis * Joel Embiid * Blake Griffin  Regardless of what you think, that's incredibly elite company to be in. He's shooting 46/35/83 as Dallas' first option, which isn't bad at all, considering how many plays we have to rely on him to score in the isolation because no one aside from Dirk can really create their own shot. His On/Off is a bit whack, because Dallas has been outscored badly this season. Barnes is posting an above average PER (16.3), and career highs in points per minute, rebounds per game, assists per game, ast%, and trb%. He's also getting to the line more as the season progresses which has slowly helped his FG% trend upwards.   I realize he isn't the franchise savior some hoped for, but those who did were delusional, nor is he worth $22M but he's been what we need, he's been a nice bridge between the Dirk era and the next unknown era. He'll be a great complimentary piece to a franchise player, but in the meantime, Dallas had the cap space, needed someone who could create their own shot and he's only 25 years old. Most players don't have their prime until ~27-30. He's played in 123/126 available games for Dallas, been able to play multiple positions, and is a low ego player that buys into Rick Carlisle's system. I would re-sign Barnes in the 2016 off season 10/10 times. "
I blame Kevin Durant for making the Warriors too good. There is no longer fun in the game and everyone is all emotional and worked up lmao.
"&gt;""Man, they got to do something in 'The Q.' Somebody call Bron!"" Kevin Durant yelled, referring to LeBron James. No one seemed angry; the situation was more humorous.  They were literally [laughing at the situation and cracking jokes](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22115611/golden-state-warriors-suffer-cold-showers-q). "
"So did Kevin Durant, to be honest. Some tweet about ""Why does everybody wanna join the Lakers, or the Heat."" Or something of that nature. "
They should just get a Kevin Durant. Those are good at rim protection.
Kobe can transform into Kevin Durant?
"Haha alright dude. Even if I was, not really sure how that matters? Kevin Durant couldn't even bench 185 at the combine. Strength is a much worse indicator of success in the nba than explosiveness and athleticism are."
"Pop has shown an ability to adjust when needed; see LMA.      No one takes into account that if LeBron were to join the Spurs, he’d be more engaged because the Spurs wouldn’t need to rely on LeBron specifically to succeed.    In this case LeBron would have a similar role to Kevin Durant in that you’d need a Top 3 player to overcome another top 3 player."
"They actually hit upon that in the article:  &gt;Two things happened after Aldridge's request. The first was Popovich told him he wasn't getting traded unless he could get a player like Kevin Durant for him in return. The Spurs and Cavs had trade talks involving Irving and Aldridge, and Popovich and general manager R.C. Buford likely considered other trade options as well. Still, Aldridge was put on notice immediately that his wish wasn't likely to be granted."
"This is what really pisses me off. They aren't just a collection of super talents. They're exceptionally coached, Unselfish and intelligent players with high BBIQ...... Then they added Kevin Durant. FUCK EM. not out of hate but out of some twisted form of admiration and respect. Except for KD of course. Cuz as we all know................FUCK KD!!!!"
New trade idea  Cavs get: Kevin Durant  GSW get: A guy named Steve who has watched a Cavs game one time.   Who says no?

I think Curry or Durant .. they are going to end up being like 5-10 games up on Houston and im sure Dantoni mins will end with another injury or two  for the rockets   would be dumb for lebron to get it if Warriors are like 10-15 games up on them and the same argument for why durant or curry shouldnt get it - because the other is on the team - could also be applied to lebron with kevin love avg 20-10 
"Idk, I'm sure some of it was kind of cathartic. The dude loves ball, and is probably constantly reading and thinking about it, probably was nice to be able to post without having the stigma of being Kevin Durant.  Obviously the part in which he was telling off high schoolers and shit isn't cool at all though."
"LeBron James is the most insecure player in the history of the league. Easily more insecure than Kevin Durant, who himself is remarkably insecure for someone as talented as he is. The degree to which James goes to shape the public narrative that he's the best ever is unprecedented in sports history."
"Gregg Popovich is LeBron's career archenemy.  LeBron has lost to the Spurs in 2007. This loss likely created a negative stigma towards the Cavaliers organization in LeBron's mind, possibly factoring into *The Decision*. LeBron formed the original superteam of this era through free-agency, which was pretty much disbanded by Popovich carving up the Heat in 2014. LeBron subsequently returns to the Cavaliers for the following season. This brings him up against a superteam that has been formed through drafting and development, largely by Steve Kerr.  Steve Kerr played under Pop. Kerr has drawn a lot from Pop and essentially replicated his coaching style. Kerr has been a major factor in assembling this extremely dominant team, picking his pieces carefully and crafting them into the players they are today. LeBron's injury-ridden Cavaliers lose to the Warriors in the 2015 Finals, showing him that there's a new superteam in town.  The following season, LeBron's legacy is now questioned by this new superteam, being down 3 - 1 in the 2016 Finals. He answers back with an incredible comeback: two back-to-back 41 point games and a Game 7 triple-double. This all culminates in a loss for Warriors' superteam. LeBron was undoubtedly the underdog in this series, similarly to the 2014 Spurs being the underdog in the two series against the Heat's superteam.  But the 2016 Finals loss for the Warriors didn't result in a player like Curry leaving in the off-season. Kevin Durant joined the Warriors, creating the ultimate superteam. LeBron was possibly an influence in KD's decision, as he handed the Warriors a Finals loss on a gold-platter a month ago, detracting from the fact that KD is joining a 73-9 win team. LeBron also previously showed the league that a superteam equals easy rings, which KD definitely seems interested in.  The Warriors' dominance continues with the time they reach the end of their road looking like the same time LeBron reaches the end of his career - in a couple years.  Pop is responsible for the Warriors in a way, detracting massively from LeBron's legacy and costing him championships."
Kevin Durant is probably going to beat it if he stays healthy.
Does Kevin Durant no longer exist?
"""Has Kevin Durant Ruined The Warriors?""   -ESPN"
Kevin Durant literally ruined the NBA
There may be a player named Kevin durant. Don't know if you've heard of him 
"Who has the most ejections in the NBA this season? Oh, its Kevin ""Never whines at calls"" Durant."
"This probably won't get too much visibility but a legit question is if Kevin Durant is the best two-way player in the game right now? If it's true and Warriors finish first seed, could KD be MVP? And DPOY?"
I feel like Kevin Durant became first fiddle when he went to GS.  
So he needs Kevin Durant
the cavs not losing to the heat in the playoffs doesn't change the fact that lebron started the culture of teaming up with superstars.   which is the game kevin durant has beaten him at. 
"I totally disagree with you and I'm more on the GSW train. You can make an argument that Cleveland was just as talented as Golden State if not more back when they had 73 wins, but that was BEFORE Golden State acquired Kevin Durant. There's no comparison now, now that Kevin Durant is on the team.  Back in 2016.  Lebron &gt; Curry, Kyrie &gt; Klay, Draymond &gt; Love, Warriors depth &gt; Cleveland depth  So the match-up was competitive back then. KD is so so great that he completely changes the balance of power."

"I mean he has a point,  2015 - ""wow lebron averaged 38 ppg and took his team missing 3/5ths of its starting lineup to a game 6, his legacy is ruined!""  2017 - ""Wow, Lebron couldn't beat Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant and Steph curry and Draymond Green? His legacy is ruined""!   2011 was the year that REALLY hurt Lebron."
kevin durant beat lebron at his own game. 
"&gt;Kevin Durant was seen exiting the locker room hysterical as he lost his teammates.   &gt;""I saw them go in. Then they got under the water and just disappeared. It's like nothing I've ever seen before."" Durant said. "
I would like to subscribe to Kevin Durant facts.
Kevin Durant - lying outside on the road until his body warms up 
Next games injury list:    Kevin Durant - Hibernation
Imagine liking Kevin Durant these days
"But he has been missing since the finals when he ""asked"" to guard Kevin Durant.  "
Kevin Durant is not nice. I do not like Kevin Durant. 
Kevin Durant is a beast he does everything so well his passing has gotten so much better. Nick Young will win them a game in the playoffs.
People kept talking about how Kevin Durant and Curry passing to each other was unbeatable because of dunks and how great they both can make 3 pointers. But I didn't think y'all were talking about Curry dunking lmao
KEVIN DURANT
king jaymz' missing multiple free throws within two minutes of a game his team is trying to get back in  meanwhile kevin durant is knocking down contested three pointers no problem..  lmao and y'all love to act you have no idea why people question his clutch gene..
How do you double team OFF of Kevin Durant? This Cavs defense is hilarious
"Well... yeah. Because that's the time for that conversation. It makes no sense to talk about how Amazon killed Walmart when Walmart has a historic quarter, does it?  Kevin Durant DID ruin the NBA. Has the NBA EVER been THIS inevitable? You lost STEPHEN CURRY. The only unanimous MVP in NBA HISTORY. And your team literally didn't even blink an eye. In fact, you rest TWO of {KD, Steph, Klay, Dray} and y'all STILL blowout teams. Literally no team in NBA history has had that luxury..."
Why are the Cavs so terrified of leaving just one man on Curry? They're leaving fucking Kevin Durant wide open behind the three-point line just to rush Steph?
"Here come all the Kevin Durant ruined the NBA whiners. Only happens when the Warriors win, don't see these comments when they lose to the Rockets/Thunder/Celtics etc etc"
Gsw are so superior to everybody else. Kevin Durant ruined Nba
"""Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant checking back in"".  My lord, that just sounds so absurd"
"I think they were highlighting the Warriors, unless I missed a ""Kevin Durant"" on top of the graphic. "
Kevin “Manute Bol” Durant
this kevin durant guy is pretty good
What the hell kind of question is this lmao kevin durant then and now
"i personally want to know what kevin durant is shooting versus jeff green to know if my given nickname to jeff green ""the durant stopper"" is legit"

Lmao yeah man the only way to beat you guys is with Biyombo. How much did we blow you out by? Also you guys haven't won a championship since Kevin Durant was on the thunder either #spooky 👀
"I gotta say it's been great the last few years. I finally get to root for Kevin Durant without feeling scummy. I get to enjoy OKC angst and all the salt from other fans.  Plus, I'll always have 2012."
"He’s starting the mending process for when he goes back to OKC. Who wins, warriors original big 3 vs okc big 3 + Kevin Durant?"
"Woj will come out and report that LeBron requested Kevin Love be traded to Steph's team, even before the draft happened.  Also, Kevin Durant has reportedly requested that he get to choose which team he's on, after the rest of the draft takes place, according to multiple sources."

"You don't think Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard could go to the Finals every year if they played in the East? What's the best Eastern Conference team LeBron has beat in his 7 straight Finals appearances? The Pacers probably?   I'm not saying what he's done isn't impressive, but let's not act like he's beating anybody worth while en route to the Finals. Hell, some WC teams that have been knocked out in the first round (2015 Spurs) are probably better than any team he's beat in the East."
"You know whats funny? You actually embody the actual Thunder as a whole haha. You see, Russell Westbrook has always had great stats and Kevin Durant was phenomenal as well along with harden and ibaka. But they could never win it. You can blame injuries and whatever but its not. The spurs, mavs, and warriors went to win titles. Its because they get the most out of their players. See you may be right, if draymond is on another team, he could be Tyler Hasborough for all we know. But the thing is, he is playing at an all star level on the warriors. And to say, “oh of course, because he’s playing with other great players he should be better”- Oladipo is now an all star because he’s not part of westbrook and kanter is balling out"
"After reading first three columns, I was expecting to see Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo in the Kings column"
"Gonna add years a la Bill Simmons' wine-cellar team.  Also I built this team to win a game so it's not just who are the best/most deserving.  Chose a few alphas but after that I wanted more specialized players (shooting/defense).  Starters:  PG - 2016 Steph Curry  SG - Michael Jordan, whatever year he peaked on defense.  SF - 1986 Larry Bird  PF - 2013 Lebron James  C - 1990 Hakeem Olajuwon  Bench:  PG - 1987 Magic Johnson  PG - 1996 Gary Payton  SG - 2006 Kobe Bryant  SF - 2014 Kevin Durant  PF - 2004 Kevin Garnett  PF - 2006 Dirk Nowitzki  C - 2003 Tim Duncan"
I read the OP but I wanna try do East vs West.  West:  G: Magic Johnson [](/LAL)   G: Kobe Bryant [](/LAL)   F: Kevin Durant [](/OKC)   F: Tim Duncan [](/SAS)   F: Shaquille O’Neal [](/LAL)    East:  G: Isiah Thomas [](/DET)   G: Michael Jordan [](/CHI)   F: Larry Bird [](/BOS)    F: LeBron James [](/CLE)     F: Bill Russell [](/BOS)   
I remember when Kevin Durant sounded like such an unusual name in the league because I was so used to the guys you mentioned above. Now that guy is second in ASG selections.
"I'm more scared of The Beard than LeBeard.  I'm crazy enough to say Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and James Harden **could** all be better..."
&gt;Is at as good as Klay while starting next to Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant on a historically great team
Kevin Durant is #outofcontrol lock him up
"&gt;be Kevin Durant  &gt;be a meek guy your entire career  &gt;join up the greatest team in NBA history that doesn't need you  &gt;now feel the need to talk shit nonstop because you're so insecure you needed to wait until joining the greatest team of all time and winning a title with no competition for three years to act like a bully, but not to any players because you literally hide behind your teammmates when player confrontation might occur, so you pick on referees who are 30 years older and a foot shorter than you because then when they eject you, your fans can claim ""soft ass refs"" and ""KD did NOTHING wrong"" and ""NBA officiating rigged af"" and he still looks like a good guy   Literally 4 ejections and 10 technical fouls in a season not even half over yet. The league needs to suspend him for multiple games, teach a top 5 NBA player a lesson. Oh wait what's that, the best team in NBA history actually is BETTER when he doesn't play and will win the championship anyway? Oops, what should we do? "
"&gt;Don't be mad at Golden State, be mad at Kevin Durant   *3 seconds later*  &gt; How can you be mad at Kevin Durant?"

He deserved literally everything he got, MVP is a regular season award, and he had the best regular season, made History.   &gt;&gt;&gt;   Stop hating and go worry about your own empty franchise. Fuck outa here kid"
"You joke, but how many times has Kevin Durant lost a shoe on the court? Like half-a-dozen times?"
"Why are people downvoting this guy? I can understand loving Klay and all that, but his 20.6 ppg, 4.0 rpg, and 2.5 apg. Meanwhile Booker is averaging 25.0 ppg, 4.5 rpg, and 4.7 apg. He is one of only three players this season to put up that many points on a nightly basis, shoot at least 43 percent from the floor, and make 38 percent of his shots from beyond the area. The other two are Kevin Durant and James Harden.  I'm pretty sure someone will try to argue that Klay is the third option a stacked team, and I'll agree with you on that. Could he have a really great season if he was a lone star like Booker? Probably. However, the All Star game isn't about ""ifs,"" it's about who is having a better season. To me, it looks like Booker is the one having a better season.  EDIT: I feel like people are gonna say ""But Klay's team isn't 13th seed."" That's true, but you gotta give credit to Booker for giving it his all, which happens to be pretty good, on a team that isn't so great."
"Kevin ""Future DPOY"" Durant."
"I mean just looking at the names on paper, will people really think these two groups of players are not pretty close:  Group A: Lebron, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Giannis  Group B: Michael Jordan, Barkley, Olajuwon, Pippen, Stockton, Malone, Drexler, Shaq, Grant Hill, Payton, David Robinson  The era that MJ dominated was pretty damn stacked even matched up to today's talent. "
"My mock draft is as follows:  **\1. Kevin Durant - Team Bron**  Best player available, next.  **\2. James Harden - Team Curry**  Tough passing on Davis, but Harden is the choice here. Curry &amp; Harden could develop better chemistry than the current Golden State or Houston backcourt. Curry’s off-ball prowess and GOAT shooting would combat nicely with Harden’s ungodly ability to get to the rack. These 2 could combine for 70 in the ASG.  **\3. Anthony Davis - Team Bron**  Gives LeBron’s team and ungodly amount of versatility. This entire front court can hang around the perimeter or bang in the post on both offense and defense, geez.  **\4. Giannis Antetokounmpo - Team Steph**  Steph-Giannis P&amp;R would be unfair.   Steph-Giannis transition offense would be unfair.  Steph-Giannis would be unfair.  **\5. Kyrie Irving - Team Bron**  I know some people will be hoping to see the former championship-winning teammates face off against one another, but I’m firmly on the opposite end. We have the rest of LeBron’s career to see the epic battles these 2 will have in store, let’s reminisce when they wrecked havoc together.  **\6. Joel Embiid - Team Steph**  Trust the process   **\7. DeMar Derozan - Team Bron**  The ASG is a perimeter oriented, flashy, offense-intense game. DeMar will excel.  **\8. DeMarcus Cousins - Team Steph**  3rd splash brother. Steph aims to draft Butler or Westbrook with the first overall pick of the reserves.  "
Breaking: Kevin Durant out of the remainder of the game due to lack of shits given about /u/1mpera's money
"nice try Kevin Durant, you're still a snek"
"Fuck the lay down and take it route. Spurs don’t do it, Houston didn’t do it, OkC went for it. Why can’t we? We beat them two seasons ago and they added Kevin Durant.  We also fired coach Blatt two years ago, Signed RJ, traded for Channing. What have we done this year? We keep waiting it out. We have assets, we can lose a bit on a trade and gain a bit in other areas. Give Lebron excuses not to leave. Don’t give him reasons to want to walk out. We’re taking the Miami Heat in 13-14 route. "
A Warriors fan complaining about excuses.   As ironic as Kevin Durant calling other people's jobs easy 
"The teams actually break down nicely, but I think the bigs take it easily. Rebounding would be too much of a struggle for the guards, and bigs shooting/ballhandling wouldn't be bad given their diverse talent. Plus the bigs would have a massive defensive advantage.  Guards:  * Kyrie Irving * DeMar DeRozan * Bradley Beal * Kyle Lowry * Victor Oladipo * John Wall * Stephen Curry * James Harden * Russell Westbrook * Damian Lillard * Klay Thompson * Jimmy Butler  Bigs:  * LeBron James * Joel Embiid * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Al Horford * Kevin Love * Kristaps Porzingis * Kevin Durant * DeMarcus Cousins * Anthony Davis * Draymond Green * Karl-Anthony Towns * LaMarcus Aldridge "
Everyone is calling lebron a douchebag for this (he is) but at least he had the balls to post this himself instead of using a fake account like Kevin Durant would have.

"Sure if LeBron is gonna play with Steph Curry and Kevin Durant I'd feel differenty. But he plays with JR Smith and Iman Shumpert. It's his own fault, no doubt, but the fact remains his teammates are pretty trash outside of Kevin Love (and Thomas once he gets healthy and stops calling out his teammates)."
“I’m okay with my team putting up the biggest choke job in Finals history because we lucked out and got Kevin Durant afterwards”
Let me try. KEVIN DURANT DID NOTHING WRONG
Celtics    Miami   Then Kevin Durant 
"Stephen Curry (PG) and Kevin Durant (SF) were voted in by a combination of fan, media, and coach voting. Klay Thompson (SG) and Draymond Green (PF) were chosen to be reserves by coaches after the starters were chosen."
"No it does not, Kevin Durant wouldnt win with Bookers team either."
They would be title favorites without Kay or Dray. Hell they were favorites without Kevin fucking Durant
"Dude, Kevin Durant himself has called out this type of behavior. Players don't speak on it because it's bad PR to insult a colleague. You are 100% delusional if you don't think many players privately believe it was a weak move. These dudes are for the most part competitive as fuck.   Kevin Durant has no binding responsibility to uphold league parity, and you are free to have an opinion on whether a professional player in *competitive sports* can be dignified in making blatantly *anti competitive* moves. It's not a matter of obligation. Personally my opinion is that it betrays the integrity of the league. If you feel differently, that's fine."
"Regular season success is a good indicator of how good a team is but you have to look at context. That Warriors team played so damn hard on both ends of the floor and brought energy pretty much every game. I live in the Bay and watch a lot of their games and can't think of one where I thought they looked like they were going half assed.   This team is different. They can be a little lazy from time to time, they rest guys, they may not be crisp in their defensive rotations. But the same fundamentals are there and you can tell when they turn it on. When they do they are quite frankly the best team I've ever seen along with the 72-10 Bulls.  So yeah, this team is better when they are going all out. They have Kevin Durant and when it's time for the big games to happen they play with the same type of intensity as the 73-9 team. If this team went all out and gunned for a 74-8 record I have no doubt they could accomplish it as long as injury luck went their way. "
"You wouldn't bring up league parity if you didn't intend to put some responsibility for parity on Kevin Durant. And putting the responsibility for parity on a player is dumb as fuck.  No one in KD's actual peer group criticized his move or called it weak. The only people still complaining about this are whiners on the internet, who no one really cares about. It's been over a year guys. Time to move on."
1. Kevin Durant  2. Dirk Nowitzki  3. Stephen Curry  4. Nick Young  5. Joel Embiid 
TT + Shump + Brooklyn pick for Kevin Durant
Haha didn’t Pop say in an interview recently when he talked about LMA telling him he wanted to be traded? Said it would be for someone at a talent level like Kevin Durant or he wasn’t going anywhere via trade. I suspect the same will apply to the Klaw.
"I disagree about the ""level of their own."" Magic was still at the height of his powers in '91, but we're talking Michael Jordan reaching his peak -- which to this day is still arguably the greatest peak ever. LBJ vs. KD is way closer of a convo, but I still say KD seized the total by way of the end of G3.  G3 wasn't some sort of Herculean effort by LBJ to gain a significant lead at the end of the game, Kyrie was playing out of his mind. KD came up clutch to bring the Warriors back, scoring on something like 3 or 4 straight possessions. LBJ choked. There really isn't a better symbolic representation of KD overtaking LBJ than the three to take the lead.  2016 shouldn't be a consideration; we're talking right here, right now, and KD is a better player than he was two years ago. Moreover, you're trying to say that we're talking ""individual"" legacy* over ""team"" legacy, which is exactly why the supporting casts aren't a factor.  Put simply, Kevin Durant plays the combined two ends of the court to a higher level than LeBron does right now (and it's not even close defensively). Offense is only 50% of the game, so if KD is an A and LeBron is an A+ on that end, and KD is a B on defense and LBJ is a D then KD is better overall.  *EDIT: Also we're not even talking about legacies here. Obviously LBJ's is way stronger, but we're talking current talent level. You have to discount all of their history, like LBJ's Finals streak and both of their MVP's. And with how poorly LBJ has been playing of late I don't see how it's even a question that KD is currently more talented and better."
"LeBron James	$33,285,709 	    Stephen Curry	$34,682,550   Kevin Love		$22,642,350 	Kevin Durant	$25,000,000   Tristan Thompson		$16,400,000 	Klay Thompson $17,826,150   J.R.

"He still incessantly whines to the refs after a call doesn't go his way, and I hate that shit. But, not as much as I hate Kevin Durant for ruining the NBA."
LeBron “Kevin Durant” James
"Why is it so high? It's a quite complicated formula, which uses statistic of a player but also of the whole team, but some of the factors were that Utah were losing few points with Gobert, he was a very effective scorer, and has a lot of blocks and relatively high amount of defensive rebounds. I think those are the outstanding factors.  Is his ""true value"" high? I would say so, guy had a fantastic season. Although many people will never compare defensive star to an offensive star, and Gobert was just that. Looking only at offense he was ok, nothing too special.   His offensive win share stat, which is comparable to that of Steph Curry or Kevin Durant, is surprising to me. I thought OWS was higher for players scoring more, and number of assists is also in the formula. Yet Gobert is among the leaders, which as far as I know can only be result of his high shooting percentage. He shot 68% with the whole team doing 56%. "

I heard that Jordan was thinking more of LeBron James or Kevin Durant than Kawhi Leonard.
" &gt; Don't get me wrong. They're great, but this season's Warriors have already shown to be vulnerable to a great defense and post-up dominance. 73-9 Warriors may have had an argument for GOAT, but they didn't even win a ring.   I disagree strongly on this. I, and I think a large majority of people, consider the 2017-18 Warriors to be markedly better than the 2015-16 Warriors. They lost Bogut, Barnes, and a few bench pieces and added godamn Kevin Durant. They went 16-1 in the play-offs last year dude, convincingly beating the Cavs team that beat them the season before.   Sure, we're yet to see exactly how much this team can achieve, but never has a team been so talented and meshed together so well. 4 all stars, 2/3 of the best players in the NBA, all in their prime.     &gt; They're not ready to play against a prime Hakeem averaging a 40pt triple double in a series and getting Draymond, their defensive anchor into foul trouble every game.   Really? A 40pt triple double? A bit optimistic but OK.   &gt; If Dream had developed a modern day 3pt shot it's not even an argument that he would just eat the Warriors alive and create easy opportunities for his team.   He'd do that anyway. But this is irrelevant, because we were talking about prime Hakeem being dropped onto the current Heat team   &gt; He doesn't even need much of a team to compete with the Warriors to begin with. A back-court of Beal and Wall is enough to keep the Warriors honest about helping and he can just go to work down-low.   Well Wall is a meh shooter, but OK I'll entertain this. Even if he does go to work down low, which I'm sure he would, this wouldn't be the magical difference between the Wizards being comfortably swept by GSW (which they would right now), to winning 4/7. Hakeem is legendary, but if LeBron could only squeeze out a game 5 against GSW last year, I seriously doubt prime Hakeem, who is arguably not as good as last year's finals LeBron (35/10/10?), would all of a sudden win the series.   &gt; The Heat could run them off the perimeter  This may be the most ridiculous thing you've said yet. Lmao you can't just run the Warriors off the perimeter, that's not how the Warriors work.   &gt; We all saw what Kawhi by himself was able to do to the Warriors in the playoffs last season before he got injured.   Ah yes, all 3 quarters of it.   &gt; Hakeem is BETTER defensively than Kawhi and would hold down the paint better than anyone in the league currently.   This is true. Wouldn't be enough though.   Hakeem is in the top 5 GOAT players though so it just makes sense for him to have so much impact.   Well I disagree with this, but that's an argument for another day.   &gt; If the Warriors are hitting impossibly difficult shots for 4 games in a row, maybe they have a chance to sweep, but I don't see that happening.  Well that is what they do anyway, but OK.   If you seriously think the Heat, a team with, at absolute best, two fringe all stars, could add pride Hakeem and win a series against the Warriors (which is what you were saying before, now you've changed it to 'won't get swept but sure) I don't know what to say to you. The Cavs, with LeBron/Kyrie/Love + supporting cast only took it to 5 last season, and that's with Klay being trash offensively.   Hakeem is amazing , an all time great, but he just couldn't be the difference between a team getting swept and winning a series. If he got dropped onto the Wizards/Heat/whoever I mentioned above, I still believe they get convincingly beaten, and probably swept. 5 games at best.   "

Patrick Beverley  Kobe Bryant   Kevin Durant  Ryan Anderson  Shaq
Kevin Durant we know it's you 
"Well, Ethan Strauss was the guy pushing those articles ([The Draymond Green Problem](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/17790252/golden-state-draymond-green-problem), [KD is the only guy who can stop Steph](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/19256296/golden-state-warriors-steph-curry-stopped-only-kevin-durant)) and he's no longer with ESPN."
The Warriors would just run pick n roll with Curry/Durant and whoever Yao is guarding to force a switch and it would cause a breakdown every time. At least Kevin Love has shown to sometimes to be able to slide his feet when switched onto Curry. Yao on the other hand was much slower and larger.
Kevin Durant would start posting up more
"1. Yes Kyrie is better than IT. What I just said was IT + the new supporting cast &gt; Kyrie  2. A player returning to the same team as last year means they're part of the same supporting cast. Just because they're playing worse than they were last year so far does not mean they're a different supporting player. They're literally the same player. As I said, they got rid of the dead weight that was Deron Williams, Richard Jefferson, and Dahntay Jones and now have Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, and Jae Crowder (also Jeff Greene). That plus they kept the other cast from last year. They indisputably have a better supporting cast than last year.  3. Yes, look at the Warriors. They easily have gone 10 men deep each playoffs even without Kevin Durant. That's the type of team you need to win a championship. The biggest reasons the Cavs lost was they had no playmakers beside Lebron and Kyrie AND the supporting cast overall weren't hitting their shots at all. Now they have two player makers in D-Wade and D-Rose plus Jae Crowder isn't shabby at all. "

Kevin Durant for Kevin Love. Lets go.
Kevin Durant is good
"Yeah, it's fun to hate but people tend to forget about the basketball and how good KD actually is. 8x All-star, **4x-scoring champ**, League MVP, Rookie of the Year, NBA Champion, NBA finals MVP, Olympic Gold Medalist.   I bolded the 4x-scoring champ because it's the most notable of all. The only two players to lead the league in scoring more times are named Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan. In 2013-2014 Kevin Durant scored 25 points or more 41 games in a row. He is without a doubt one of the greatest offensive players of all-time. Fuckin cupcake, sure, but he's still only 29 years old."
Don't let Kevin Durant see this.
Kevin Durant triggered
"Everyone knows already Durant a legit 6'11 guy, LeBron is a legit 6'9 guy, Westbrook is actually not 6'3, he's close to 6'5. Paul George is 6'10, KeVin Garnett was not 6'11, dude was 7'1.. and someone like JJ Barea on the other hand is reverse, he's not 6 feet, more like 5'10ish IRL  &gt;&gt;&gt;   Some players grow while being in the league and doesn't get their height updated, so that's that.    &gt;&gt;&gt;   FYI, Bam is not standing straight in this picture, he an inch taller than Durant when standing straight up.   "
"[Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Kevin Durant](https://twitter.com/KDTrey5/status/3613619365)"
"I suppose there's the lack of leadership. I know it's an unpopular opinion, but I actually think he's already surpassed Bird skill wise.   I think it'll be closer, with Kevin Durant definitely going down as the better scorer. "
Because many people don’t like Kevin Durant 
Lol Kevin Durant really trying to talk shit about whose job is hard when he left the Thunder to join the Warriors.  Just stop.
Kevin Durant 
"It's become a meme at this point to see a lot of salty people hating on KD for weird reasons.   To those saying that KD hating on Capela is hypocritical because KD took the ""easy way out."" What KD said is wrong because he's not really looking at Capela's game as a whole, but to say that KD took the easy way out is flat out wrong. He averaged 35ppg and slashed 55/47/92. For him to take the ""easy way out"" would be to defer to Steph/Klay and pretty much shy away from pressure moments, which is the complete opposite of what actually happened in the NBA Finals.  ""He doesn't know pressure because he was in a STACKED team!!!""  You don't think being in a stacked team comes with its own set of pressures? To sacrifice touches and shots and still manage to be a top player in a team with 3 other top players. To live up to the championship hype or risk choking and being an offender of shrivelling in the toughest of moments worse than the 2011 Miami Heat did vs. the Mavericks. Again to reiterate, what he said is completely dumb, but to rehash the ""HE TOOK THE EZ WAY!!!!"" is just as wrong.  And then there are the Cleveland Cavaliers fans adding into that pile, singlehandedly forgetting that they trashed Lebron James in 2010 for taking ""the easy way"" out when he went to Miami to form a superteam with Wade and Bosh. And then doubly forgetting Lebron taking ""another easy way out"" (by their logic) by ditching an old Miami Heat roster to rejoin the Cavs with a rising star in Irving and a potential trade for Love that basically catapulted them into the NBA Finals in 2015. Feel how you want to feel about Kevin Durant, but then realize there are a lot of NBA players who did the same thing he did."
"“They’re very tough,” Warriors forward Kevin Durant said. “I really like this team. I really like their coach. They have a good home crowd, and I think the difference between them this year and last year is obviously everyone is going to say C.P. [Paul]. But they’re just playing harder.”  KD has nothing but good things to say about the rockets. And there is a difference in saying ""We think we are the best team and can beat any other team"" vs saying ""We are better than them, we expect to beat them, if we play hard we know we will beat them"". That is the overconfidence of Capela. "
"[Guys, c'mon! You're all blowing this out of proportion like he doesn't know what the hardest road looks like. KD knows hard jobs, so he can EASILY say Clint's isn't.](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/kevin-durant-on-joining-golden-state-warriors-the-hardest-road-to-a-championship-070716)"
You do remember Kevin durant was an MVP before he even joined GSW right? It's false to say being on GSW doesn't get him easy looks occasionally but if you actually watched golden state games you'd see he's still the best player on the floor most nights

"Full quote from https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/11/kevin-durant-joe-lacob-shed-more-light-on-durants-free-agency-decision/     &gt; “I was telling one of my friends, Rich (Kleiman, his agent), who’s here, we were watching Game 7. Well, as it started to unfold, it was, ‘No question, no way could you go to this team.’ And I was just like a kid, like, in a candy shop. I’d get wide open 3s, I could just run up and down the court, get wide open layups. I was basically begging him. I was like, yo, this would be nice. So as I was thinking about my decision and who I was gonna play for, this team came to mind. You know, as they lost, it became more and more real every day. You start to think about it even more. To see if I would fit. Then once I sat down with these guys, everything that I wanted to know about them they kinda showed me. But we don’t have to talk about it though because they didn’t get the job done and they came after me and who knows what would’ve happened. But I guess you could say I’m glad that they lost.”"

"Weirdest thing is he always insisted he didn't know Harden was behind him.  &gt; World Peace maintained he did not know that Harden was behind him when he swung his elbow and that the contact was unintentional. He reminisced about the three dunks he had in the first half leading up to his ejection almost reverently, trying to explain just how excited he was leading up to the moment of the elbow following his third dunk over Kevin Durant.  ""Kevin had no chance,"" World Peace said. ""Bumped him out of the way, went up, dunked and at that point, I was just way too emotional. It seemed like anger but it was a lot of passion involved. But it was erratic. It was erratic fire, it was erratic passion. It was way too much. Way too much ...  It's really hard to believe when you watch it... I tend to think it was a combination of passion and just getting lost in the moment and just a very spontaneous instinct for violence. This was already sorta the more reformed Artest, so this was a bit out of character at the time. It's so rough to watch though, man."
r/nba would love this if anyone EXCEPT Kevin Durant said it
"Even if he has a point (acknowledging this as a Rockets fan), this coming from Kevin Durant is fucking hilarious. "
The Kevin Durant classic 
Kevin Durant??
"This is stupid. He's having one injury-riddled season, the guy will bounce back. Kevin Durant also had a lost season in his prime, it obviously didn't effect him long term. "
"Sure ask questions, but why so much shitty questions. Most of them are obviously doing a poor job at their job, sports journalism for the most part is terrible. Is it really hard to come up with a better question than ""Did playing Danny Green work very well on Kevin Durant?"" I mean what the hell is he suppose to say? lol  I'm glad he grills these so called reporters, maybe they'll put some effort into asking better questions. It's not that hard, especially if it's your job...  I'm sick and tired of listening to these questions, and I don't even hear them as much as Pop does over 20 years of worthless questions. He doesn't have to pretend to like them either, he's a grandpa who doesn't give a crap - he won't act like he enjoys asking these stupid questions."
"Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook  James Harden, Jimmy Butler  Klay Thompson, Paul George  Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond  i go with small ball, maybe add 1 more big if curry doesn't want to play  or maybe leave lillard or westbrook off if i think i need another big  i leave the old guys off   boogie and gordan hayward i didn't consider because of thier injuries         "
"A player who has been in the league for six years or fewer can sign a max contract worth 25% of the salary cap. Guys who've played 7-9 years can sign for 30% and guys 10+ years for 35%.    The Derrick Rose rule allows a player who has played less than seven seasons to sign for 30% of the cap instead of only 25% if he has won MVP, made an all NBA team in the last year of his current contract (or 2 of the previous 3 years), or won DPOY in the last year (or 2 out of the last 3).   The original rule (in the 2011 CBA) required that a player be voted to start in two All-Star Games, be named to an All-NBA Team twice, or be named MVP to qualify.  So when the new rule comes around in 2011, the only player to qualify is Derrick Rose (hence why we call it that). But Kevin Durant signed an extension the summer before that would kick in the first year of the new CBA and the NBA decided to award him the 30% max because he would've qualified (made 2 All NBA teams)  if he signed the extension under the new CBA.   This hurt the Thunder's ability to resign Harden because now Durant is making $2.5 million more in his first year and $15 million more of the course of the contract."
"I love jrue but he can not be the 2nd best player on a championship level squad. Look at the current contenders #2s. Durant, CP3, Lowry, and Kevin Love, and hes got Lebron as his 1. Paul george cant get it done as a 2, no way jrue can"
"the reality of the situation is its all a bullshit charade anyway. The reporters know they're not going to get anything of substance from Pop and Pop knows he's not going to give them any answers. Pop is obligated to stand up there an answer their obvious questions. And that is why Pop hates the whole thing and gives sarcastic answers. Pop would rather give a really sarcastic answer and make himself(and us) laugh by giving a ridiculous answer to a rediculous question. Pop's answer to ""what are you going do to stop Kevin Durant""  may seriously be ""pray he has a bad night"""
"I mean everyone's applauding Pop's bluntness but can we discuss how dumb the question actually is?   Reporter: ""Danny Green couldn't cover Kevin Durant?""  Pop: ""Duh.""  Like fucking ask how he's going to fix it or what Danny Green will do to cover a dude 6 inches taller and longer than him. Such a dumb question. "

"Damien AND McCollum are crap, this game isn't indicative of what could happen in a 7 game series against Warriors WITH Kevin Durant"
"that reporter is a fucking dipshit.  just ask ""what adjustments would you make to better defend kevin durant?"" "
"Kevin Durant, dude took the hardest road to his first chip and this year seems like it has truly been difficult for him.... S/"
Why is there a picture of Kevin Durant on Philadelphia's midcourt logo?
"I think a lot of these questions stem from the fact that these journalists have to slam out an 800 word article (or whatever) recapping the game, ready to go in the Sunday paper. So they probably have the outline of the article fleshed out on their computer or in their mind. The reporter knows he's going to talk about Green's troubles guarding KD, so he wants to be able to write a paragraph like:  &gt; But the Spurs were unable to stop Kevin Durant, which allowed the Warriors to build up an insurmountable lead. Danny Green was initially matched up on Durant, but Durant scored with ease and drew Green into two key fouls. After the game, Pop said, ""*Insert quote from Pop.*""  When we think of what we'd ask in the pressers, we think of interesting (to us) basketball questions that only someone like the coach could answer. But I think these journalists are after something else - a nice quote to plug into the article they already have sketched out."
What's with the snake around the logo? Is Kevin Durant planning on joining them next year?
"A lot of talking heads have been talking for weeks about how Golden State might be vulnerable in the 1st round (before knowing playoff matchups). For me, that's a clear indictment on Kevin Durant. If KD is arguably better than Steph Curry, how would swapping Curry for KD theoretically make them a championship caliber team (2015-16 team) to one that is vulnerable to an upset? And yes, I get it that the 73 win team had Bogut/Ezeli/Speights,etc but the major core is still there."
Legit lmao team starts with Sophomore Kevin Durant and wants to act like they came from nothing 
"I agree that they're* morons, but I'm calling total bullshit on your comment. I've been reading shit and getting downvoted for replying to it about how some of these 4-8 West teams are a ""scary"" matchup for the Warriors.  People thought that KAT (who has, btw, never played in a playoff game) was going to somehow stunt on Kevin fucking Durant in a potential first round matchup and take the Ws to 7.  It is not ""just a few idiots"" it was TONS of people on this sub that tried to believe that the Ws getting bounced was a possibility. "
"""They've got Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. We've got Lamarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, and Dejounte Murray. What the fuck do you want from me?"""
Why is Kevin Durant wrapped around the Sixers logo? 
The exaggeration was crazy. Some dude even claimed Kevin Durant was the only top 20 player left on the Warriors after Curry was injured.
"Kevin ""toss a heave two seconds late"" Durant worries about his fg% lol"
"Don't let the Raptors performance distract you from the fact that OKC once had Kevin Durant, Westbrook, James Harden, and Ibaka and decided not to run it back after making the finals."
"We all know he’s good regardless of advanced statistics. That’s his point, you don’t need these numbers to say “Kevin Durant is good.”    There’s just a human aspect of watching games and watching how they play that a lot of numbers can’t incorporate. "
"I don’t think he’s ever gone “toe to toe with LeBron” in a series, that’s what Kevin Durant does, but he is a nice playoff performer "
You can't really shut down Kevin Durant unless he's under pressure or not in the greatest system that ever existed
Kevin Durant would respect the fuck out of you
I hate the warriors as much as anyone but Kevin Durant is v v good at basketball even if he is a snek. 
"As much as Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson doninated this game, Javale McGee low-key was the MVP of this game. He was amazing on both ends of the floor and he gave the Warriors and their fans amazing energy tonight."
It's also funny because TS% and eFG% are the stats that perhaps best show that Kevin Durant is one of the three best players in the world lol
"I just learned that Steph Curry is older than Kevin Durant, and only 3 years younger than Lebron."
kEvIN DurANt cAn'T lEaD tHE wArRioRS
Kevin Durant is too good. dude got curry in his shadows since he joined GSW. Not an easy thing to do. 
"&gt;Personal trainers have been a part of professional sports for decades. Personal data analysts are newer.  &gt;As a trained mathematician, Justin Zormelo provided Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder with personalized analytics during Durant’s MVP season  &gt;Zormelo is one of the hottest trainers these days because of his creative use of stats. Not the usual stats, such as points, rebounds and assists, but an advanced analytics approach that has allowed a basketball fanatic who didn’t play past high school and never coached to help Durant become the NBA’s most valuable player."
Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant trashes TS% and eFG% and simmons agrees with him but i swear I've heard Simmons use TS% a lot
"Watching the first half highlights, I just remembered there’s nobody in the league that can stop Kevin Durant 😩"
Are people over kevin durant going to the warriors now? 
Kevin Durant is a good basketball player
[From a Bill Simmons podcast with KD] (https://www.theringer.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast/2018/3/28/17172448/kevin-durant-returns-bill-simmons-podcast-part-1) - Highly recommended. One of the best pods I've ever heard. 
Kevin Durant is good at basketball
Kevin Durant Bill Simmons podcast. Kevin called Blog Boys is a term that reference fools that talk about basketball but don’t even watch it. 
Kevin Durant said he wanted to join the rockets next year cuz if he can't beat them he'll join them
Apparently it's an unpopular opinion these days that Kevin Durant is still a top 5 player in the world and is going to handle his business against the Spurs. 
People are idiots to have ever doubt Kevin Durant. He's at the point of his career where only the postseason matters. He's showing everyone how dominant he is.
Why the FUCK   Is Bryn fucking 6'3 Forbes guarding  6'11 KEVIN DURANT
Bryn Forbes is guarding Kevin Durant. End this already please.
Kevin Durant vs Manu. Some real bald spot on bald spot violence
Obligatory fuck Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant: *scores*  r/NBA: Wow the Spurs are so bad how did they make the playoffs how is this possible they should have tanked for Doncic
"kevin Durant has detached his snake like jaw and eaten Lamarcus Aldridge whole, a stunning display at center court"
"It could be good, but it could get ugly pretty quickly. If I had to choose one game today to introduce someone into the NBA, it's gonna be either Heat-Sixers or Pelicans-Blazers later tonight. I think those games will be better than this one and really fun to watch. But if you can only check this one, out, here's where you can start.   **Spurs star**: Lamarcus Aldridge. After a less-than-impressive season last year, he's bounced back, carrying this spurs team into the postseason, when many thought they wouldn't make it. With the absence of Spurs star Kawhi Leonard, it's his job to carry the load against this juggernaut of a Warriors team. However, the Warriors have been mediocre lately, as have the Spurs. Could the Spurs pick off a game?   **Warriors stars**: Kevin Durant - the reigning finals MVP formerly of the Oklahoma City Thunder, who joined the Warriors in the 2016 offseason after losing to them in a 7 game series that year. This was viewed as one of the weakest decisions in sports history, and really spoke to KD's lack of fortitude as a competitor. With Golden State star Stephen Curry to miss all of this series, it's up to him and a couple of co-stars who I'll get to in a bit to carry this team past the Spurs. Arguably the #2 player in the world right now, some consider him the best.  Klay Thompson - one of the best shooters in the league, who can catch fire at any time and possesses a shooting stroke unmatched in the NBA. He averaged just about 20PPG in the regular season, and he had a bit of a dissapointing playoffs last year, but he's looking to get more touches and get back on track with the team's leader Stephen Curry out.   Draymond Green - another of the Warriors' all-stars; he's having a bit of a down year but people are expecting him to ""flip the switch"" in this playoffs and go back to his usual self - a triple double machine who plays very good defense. Will he flip the switch? How will he play against a Spurs team that has historically been great at punishing little mistakes? Watch and find out!  But yeah, like I said I don't think this game will be that good. Golden state has the Spurs HEAVILY outmatched in talent."
"Here's the notable players for each team :  Spurs - LaMarcus Aldridge  Warriors - Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green"
"This is the first game of the playoffs so it's a great time to start. Warriors stars are Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. Their best (or second best depending on who you ask) player Steph Curry is out for the series. Spurs only real star is Lamarcus Aldridge (their best player Kawhi Leonard is likely out for the series) but they have a lot of good roleplayers."
"Not dunk of the year, but who dunked on the better player? Larry Nance/LAL over Kevin Durant or Joel Embiid/PHI over Russell Westbrook? "
"Ok, we can agree to disagree - but just a few points:  1. I'm 30, so I'm not sure how you define relatively young, but I vividly remember this time frame. 2. When Westbrook, Durant, and Harden were on the floor, Harden was spotting up 3s. When Westbrook or Durant were paired with Harden, Harden was shooting spot up 3s and taking the occasional ISO play. When Harden was on the floor solo, the offense was running through him. I think it's totally fair to see why the Thunder felt they didn't need to max out Harden (especially when you consider they got a still-pretty-good Kevin Martin in exchange). 3. I totally get where you're coming from with D'Antioni piece, and you make really good points. You're right that he was a major player in the shift into today's offense. But if you really feel that Curry didn't change ANYTHING w/r/t how NBA franchises value the 3 point shot, then we're just too far apart to agree on anything. 4. Let's not lose sight of your original point:   &gt; Harden was definitely a sure thing. It's revisionist to say otherwise  That's simply untrue. There were many people that felt the Rockets didn't make the right move there. And I'm not just talking about 'the casuals.'"
"I just clicked on one and the top comment is ""Hes a mix between Kevin Durant and Michael Jordan honestly"""
GSW has Kevin Durant and Spurs not
#1st Team :  Damian Lillard  James Harden  LeBron James  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Anthony Davis  #2nd Team :   Russell Westbrook  DeMar DeRozan  Kevin Durant  LaMarcus Aldridge  Joel Embiid
1. Calm down  2. Kevin Durant imo is one of the best scorers of all time. He’s a top 5 scorer of all time in my mind. Nothing I said resembled me saying KD was trash.  3. Nothing you said refutes the fact that KDs TS% has jumped since joining 3 other all stars and it drops when Curry/Klay are out.   4. You’re getting mad at me for comparing his Finals and his clutch shooting when I’m not even the person who brought it up.  
How do you figure Kevin Durant?    [The Warriors are allowing 106.8/100 possessions with him on the court and only 100.4 off](https://stats.nba.com/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612744&amp;VsPlayerID=201142). That's a very high split to explain away. They allow more fgA near the basket and a higher fg% everywhere on the court when he plays. [He is literally in the **6th percentile** for allowing points/possession out of all players in the NBA](https://www.cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/984/onoff)
GSW  1. Draymond Green  2. Kevin Durant
"It was one game. The warriors could have won the next one by 30... Who knows? It happens all the time in the playoffs, don't think like Skip Bayless.  This years team got handled by a very young and injured Lakers team (No Lonzo, no Ingram) in a VERY IMPORTANT game for them at the end of the year, losing that game could've prevented them to even make the playoffs. They couldn't stop freaking Kyle Kuzma and Josh Hart. How do you expect them to stop Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson? That series will be over in 5 games. "
Kevin Durant. 
Cavs wouldn't beat u in 2015 too if we had kyrie and Kevin love. Too bad u need Kevin Durant to beat the healthy cavs. Don't come to this subreddit bashing the land we got real fans here
Because Kevin Durant plays on the Warriors. Lol they have no one who can guard him.
"Full story IIRC: Iguodala's first choice was the Warriors, but Myers told his agent that they couldn't find the cap space to sign him. So, he feigned interest in the Kings to get a high offer from then GM D'Alessandro, to leverage it for a similar offer from Cuban's Mavs. Then, the Jazz agreed to take on the bloated contracts of Andris Biedrins and Richard Jefferson, a combined value of over $30M, in exchange for soooo many future draft picks, and a three-team sign and trade was on between the Dubs/Nugz/Jazz.   I don't think this bit of deceptiveness from Andre's team back in the summer of 2013 would stop Vivek &amp; Divac from making a deal *if* it benefits whatever vision he has for the future of his squad. Looking at their payroll for next season, Randolph is due $11.6M, Iman Shumpert has an $11M player option he shouldn't refuse, and Garrett Temple has an $8M option of his own. These are three guys I think Vivek could do without, and the Warriors might want to take a chance on. What surprised me is that Shump is only 27, while Temple is 31. Iman needs to get his shit together, refocus, put together a solid 2018-19 campaign, and look to sign somewhere for the last decent contract of his career. Anyways...   Zaza Pachulia won't be re-signed. David West, in all likelihood, will retire (I don't mind him sticking around, David has been exemplary). JaVale will probably do the same thing this summer that he did last summer...wait around for better offers, but eventually sign for the veteran minimum, *if* the Warriors want to keep him. The focus will be on re-signing Looney if they can afford it, unless they go after a major front court player (AD). Either way, the backup front court will probably be Bell/Looney/Jones, in that order, focusing on maximizing young talent and enjoying their rookie scale deals. Freshly inked Quinn Cook will be our backup point guard, making Livingston somewhat expendable. And, barring some miraculous playoff turnaround, Nick Young's lazy days in the Bay are numbered, meaning his $6M MLE will come off the books.   If Kevin Durant opts out, which he already says he will in order to re-sign for more, the Warriors will be @ $102M. Livingston and Iguodala's salaries for next season are about $24M combined. Turning that into ZBo, who will have camaraderie with fellow Spartan alum Draymond Green + a great replacement for West if he calls it quits,  and Shumpert or Temple, wings with the size to fit into Ron Adams' switch-happy defensive system, may not be such a bad thing. And, I don't see Ranadive saying no if this lateral move comes with future draft picks attached. I love Iguodala, and he's been pretty solid post ASB, finding his shooting form from deep. His defensive prowess will once again be invaluable in the upcoming playoffs. The $30M+ owed to him after this season hurts, though.  Just sort of brainstorming possibilities between the two franchises."
"What you're saying is true  However - the Rockets aren't going to shoot over 50% from 3 for 4 games.  I dont underrate the Rockets at all - they are currently my favorite team to watch and one of the best teams I've ever seen.  That said, they still arent going to beat a healthy greatest team of all time + Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant wasn't on their team then
"At least size wise, he is probably closer to Kevin Durant or Giannis"
"""Kevin Durant has never been better than Steph Curry since 2017 except for the 2017 finals"" "
"If Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and the boys only end up getting like 3, there's no way in hell Simmons and Embiid are leading the 76ers to 8 championships."
"One of my favorite things about KD going to Golden State is no longer having to watch Westbrook when I want to see KD play. I don't like the Thunder but I would get really irritated when I saw Westbrook force up some dumbass shot while having time left and/or a wide open Kevin Durant on the floor.  Edit: I would like to add that I do think Westbrook is a great player, I just think he's too good to be doing some of the shit he does consistently."
[It's a quote from KD on a podcast](http://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-issues-psa-all-blog-boys-and-fanboys)
"As Kevin Durant would say, ""those some cute picks, blog boy."" "
Ya and so isn't Kevin Durant lol
"&gt;""Why am I team Kevin Durant? Hold on because now you're saying that I'd do a vote that didn't have good intentions which is a character question which is gonna make me mad if you're being serious.  lmfaooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Billy"
"Why post lies? There's ways to check things like this.   - Stephen Curry at the rim: 67%   - Kevin Durant at the rim: 76%  Everywhere on the court you say?   - Stephen Curry 3-10 feet: 43%   - Kevin Durant 3-10 feet: 51%  Curry is shooting better from midrange and 0,4% better from 3."
"Hate: Warriors, Lakers, and Toronto. Kevin durant and Harden flops"
"That's a fair point about Durant being a forward, but I think the main point I was driving at was that the Thunder had 3 players that worked best with the offense flowing through them. If Durant would have stuck around, the Thunder never would have dropped out of yearly finals contention, even after the Harden trade.  D'Antioni's offense was certainly a piece of how the 3 ball changed, but Curry was undoubtedly the nail in the coffin. The knock on Mike was always that that brand of basketball couldn't actually carry you to a championship, and Curry nixed that line of thought in the bud.  All that said, I think it's worth noting, the Thunder offered Harden a 4 year, $52 million deal ($13m/yr), which was rejected. After that, they traded him for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, two first round picks (one of which became Steven Adams), and a 2nd round pick. After the trade, the Rockets signed him to a 5 year $80 million deal ($16m/yr). The Thunder wanted to stay cap flexible (which is why they didn't offer a max), and they prioritized locking up their big man over Harden.  I mean, let's call a spade a spade here. The Thunder made the wrong move, but it's totally reasonable to see why they did what they did there. At the time, nobody was saying Harden was a better player than Westbrook or Durant (and in fact I know a lot of Thunder fans who would still take Westbrook over Harden today - and even I wouldn't try to make the argument that I'd rather have Harden over Durant in a 7 game series). "
"Kevin Durant was also name dropped in Good Drank by 2 chainz ft Gucci Mane, Quavo.  ""Oh you in a slump I'm headed to Oakland like Kevin Durant. What is your point, square with the stamp, for Kevin Durant."" "
All-Reddit AMA First Team  PG Steve Nash  SG Manu Ginobili  SF Kevin Durant  PF Peja Stojaković (or maybe Bill Walton)  C Shaquille O'Neal
Kevin Durant so I can either choose to cash in another championship like a true supervillain or pull a surprise bamboozle on the Warriors and bolt back to the Thunder and be the nice guy.
"Do you know how basketball works? How come you didn’t mention JR Smith? TT? Delly? Mozgov? Mike Miller? Battier?  It’s funny how you mentioned kyrie when his numbers dipped this year, and his scoring improved in the three years with LeBron aside from 2016 where he was coming back from injury.   But using your logic, then Kevin Durant made Steph curry much worse, made Klay Thompson worse, and made draymond much worse. And since he left OKC, Russ has won an mvp and averaged back to back triple double seasons. So according to your logic, he was actually holding Russ back. "
TS% is a worthless statistic that only blog boys care about. -Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan"
"I don't give a shit who wins MVP, but this year's Lebron is the best Lebron I have ever seen. It is like being killed by Kevin Durant in the Finals last year motivated him to unlock his full potential."
"Stevens is strong enough that he can bully Gobert in the post, I think he's an ex-factor in this. One of Gobert's defensive shortcomings is that he is pretty skinny and can't always handle the super physical guys in the post. Adams has only taken 12 shots this yea with Gobert as his primary defender and made 11 of them.  Gobert also hedges himself in the paint, so it will also come down to whether Westbrook can make he unchallenged mid range shots.   Mitchell will have a huge offensive burden. I lean 50/50, entirely dependent on Westbrooks play  There's going to be a lot of Thunder offensive plays that look like this that either go in or dont  https://streamable.com/p13pd  Last year the Warriors ran that high pick and roll with Kevin Durant over and over"
"But again.....you could argue that stat-padding has been used to win almost ANY MVP. You think Kevin Durant *needed* to average 32 points to win MVP in 2013? I mean....couldn't he have just averaged 30?   Do you think I would be able to find...oh I don't know, Kevin Durant scoring late in blowout games in 2013? And would that....invalidate his successes? Hell no. It's a fucking GAME. Everything is a stat-pad. "
Kevin Durant.
This is like Kevin Durant commenting on the troubles that come with using alternate accounts
"&gt; Just like how he took more shots than Kevin fucking Durant when they played together.  KD factually took more shots than Westbrook in the time they played together. And on average all but one individual season, 2012, excluding when Durant played only 27 games."

There's no way Kevin Durant is an Always Sunny fan. I'm guessing he watches Big Bang Theory.
"As a Warriors fan, I gotta tell you how happy I am to have a cordial discussion with a Thunder fan haha. Westbrook's off-ball movement is his biggest downfall imo. It's like if he doesn't have the ball on offense, he doesn't know what to do. He just stands on the perimeter, ball-watching.  There's a reason Kevin Durant left, and I think that reason is that it's too difficult to play alongside Russ. Same thing with Vic. When you guys got Vic after KD left, everybody was like, ""wow great signing what a great player,"" and then throughout the season, it was always, ""Vic's young he's just not ready yet."" Then they make that trade for PG13 and Vic's an allstar all of a sudden.  Kudo's to PG13. He and Russ compliment eachother fantastically and I hope they stick together for a few years - the Thunder's success rests on that.  I'm honestly more afraid of your Thunder than I am of the Rockets in the post season. I'm fully anticipating a GSW-OKC matchup in the WCF and I'm really terrified.   Russ is the most competitive player in the league, but I think he values his personal legacy over the legacy of his team. Just what I've seen"
"He's an elite athlete who excels at getting to the rim. Him getting dump off passes due to his ability to attack the rim is not high basketball IQ. I don't even feel like that's a hot take. If he couldn't attack the rim so well, it's not like we'd see him making smart passes around the perimeter. Just like how he took more shots than Kevin fucking Durant when they played together.

"Inb4 Kevin Durant takes a massive pay cut, and lebron drops a players Tribune article on July 4th ""Hardest Road part 2: electric boogaloo"""
Tends to be the way stotts runs things when a player is blowing up. Like with Kevin Durant he blew up each game against us but in the last two his team couldn’t do anything as it became more iso heavy.  Of course playoff Steph is a scary thing with playoff Durant so that probably wouldn’t work again.
"I don't think it's underrated at all actually (this coming from a huge Dirk/Mavs fan). Most people who watched it recognize how huge of a playoff run the Mavs had that year. To put it in perspective, these are the stars the Mavs beat handily during those playoffs:   **1st Round 4-2 (POR)**: Brandon Roy, LaMarcus Aldridge  **2nd Round 4-0 (LAL)**: Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Andrew Bynum  **3rd Round 4-1 (OKC)**: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Serge Ibaka  **Finals 4-2 (MIA)**: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh   Not to mention Dirk was the best player on the planet during that run. Simply unstoppable."

"I love Chuck, and to a level he feels the game (even though he hates analytics!).  He understands the game so well by feel, which is very rare even in professional players.  Im sad he got screwed in the 90' MVP voting. I don't think he deserved the MVP in 93 (Jordan was just crazy), but at least im happy he got an MVP trophy.  If Chuck once watched his own statistics, he would understand how good he really was. Way better than he claims himself to be, he was waaaaaaay ahead of his era. If you seach 20+ppg seasons, Chuck has 3 of the first 4 based on TS%. This is a PF that could barely shoot 3s (and took way too many).  In the top 10 on that list, Barkley has 3 seasons, Curry has 2 seasons, Kevin Durant has 2 seasons, LeBron has 2 seasons and Wilt has one. That's about the best company for scorers that he can have."
Steph Curry is the best shooter  Rudy Gobert is the best defender  Nikola Jokic is the best passing big  Gary Harris is the best  Klay Thompson is the best 3 and D player  Kawhi Leonard is the best injured player  Kyrie Irving is the best ball handler  Kevin Durant is the best pure scorer  James Harden is the best at drawing fouls  Marcus Smart is the best at hustle plays  LeBron James* is the best playmaker  Joakim Noah is the best at managing his money to value ratio
As did Kevin Durant.
kevin durant
Kevin Durant is an exception to this rule for sure.
"I don't know about that man, the mid-range jumper is becoming obsolete in a lot of the best offenses. Unless you're name is Kevin Durant, lots of coaches prefer the long uncontested three to the mid-range two. And the most offensive rebounding is created from threes, not twos."
"Well I guess that outweighs his whole career then? Or his own words?  &gt; It depends on what I’m shooting from the field. First quarter if I’m 4-for-4, I let it go. Third quarter if I’m like 10-for-16, or 10-for-17, I might let it go. But if I’m like 8-for-19, I’m going to go ahead and dribble one more second and let that buzzer go off and then throw it up there. So it depends on how the game’s going.  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1526943-kevin-durant-claims-he-wont-always-shoot-high-risk-buzzer-beater-shots "
Jordan didn’t have competition like the 73-9 warriors in the finals  Or those same warriors + Kevin Durant  The other times he made the finals he had to play Pop’s spurs. The one ‘easy’ finals he had was OKC.
Kevin Durant.
"Actually wingspan is really important im bigs   &gt; If we look at the 200+ players who measured at least 6-feet 9-inches barefoot at the Draft Combine in the last 16 years, there are 12 players who made the All-Star team at least once. If we sort this group by the ratio of their wingspan to their height, we find something startling.  &gt; Of the 50 players with the longest wingspans relative to their height we find 8 of those All-Stars: Andre Drummond, Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, DeAndre Jordan, Kevin Durant, Dwight Howard, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Brook Lopez. (Plus six more players who have started the majority of their career games played: Hassan Whiteside, Rudy Gobert, Nene, Brendan Haywood, Myles Turner, and Nikola Vucevic.)  &gt; Of the 50 players with the shortest wingspans relative to their height we find one All-Star (Chris Kaman) and three other players who started the majority of their career games (Mason Plumlee, Cody Zeller, and Troy Murphy)."
"Of the Warriors' 4 all-stars, Steph has arguably the largest impact on their offense. Taking the Warriors when Steph is out is the best shot they will get.  And besides, its sort of a no-lose situation for them to face the Warriors. Lose to the Warriors? They have 3 other all-stars, one of them is Kevin fucking Durant. Bounce the Warriors in the 1st round? Suck it bitches, we beat the Warriors we can beat anyone"

"&gt;This is where reading comprehension is important. I said LeBron was a better player than Curry, not because LeBron won the ring (as you suggest is the reason Kobe is better in 2009) but because he simply was the better player.   LOL that's just not true. Steph Curry had one of the greatest season I have ever seen, and was by far, the better player than Lebron. What curry was doing, while leading his team to 73 wins, was absolutely legendary.   From efficiency to box stats, to impact numbers, Curry beat Bron. So why don't you think Curry is better?  &gt; It’s widely known that LeBron coasts in the regular season but he still put up dominating numbers. Curry just put up better numbers on offense. Remember, defense is a part of basketball. And LeBron is a better defender than curry.  Lebron, because he was coasting in the regular season, was pretty bad defensively. Why would I downplay Curry because Lebron chose to coast?  &gt;This completely negates your point because LeBron put up better numbers than both of them in 2017. Unless, again, you are suggesting that because they won the ring, that makes them better? Which you can go try arguing with someone else who wants to waste their time with you.    Curry was the player who posted stronger numbers:   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CiOqGlz6zjjmjUlJBNOXflG6wYAS1RLjZjtZSQHraF4/edit#gid=0  AND WON a ring.   LOL what?   The only reason I mentioned Durant was that Durant absolutely dominated Lebron in the Finals, and people started to think Durant was better. (I also think Durant is overrated)  &gt;Wait, was Kevin Garnett better than Kobe in 2008 then?  No, because impact stats give Kobe a strong edge?   Kobe lead the league in RAPM per minute that season and was one of the most iconic impact seasons in the modern game.   Are you purposely trolling? "
Hm. It’s always those with a [GSW] Kevin Durant flair that are the saltiest. 
"You are out of your mind. Did you just link an allstar game performance to talk about how good a player is? is this a troll account?  In last years playoffs, Kawhi averaged **27.7** points on **67.2%** TS.  You know how much people in NBA history has had a playoff run with as many or more points on that efficiency besides Kawhi? 4 elite scorers and Hall of Famers.   - Kevin Durant   - Bob Lanier   - Kiki   - Reggie Miller.     Kawhi in the regular season:   - For 25 ppg scorers (regular season) Kawhis 2017 season ranks at  21 best ever from an efficiency standpoint. If you count only players (so players cannot have more than 1 season) hes the 14th best player ever in scoring efficiency.  Kawhi also took a team with no other allstars to 61 wins, 2nd best ever on that (first is 2011 Rose, no other allstars, 62 wins).  "
"I mean LeBron played with Kobe, Tim Duncan, Shaq, Kevin Durant etc and he leapfrogged all of them too. "
"Hakeems 1995 ring is the most valuable ring of all time and it's not close.  For context  Other extremely valuable rings: Dirk 2011, LeBron 2016  Examples of rings that aren't valuable: any role players ring, Kevin Durant 2017"

LMAO. Have you heard of Kevin Durant?
Yeah seriously. How would Warriors fans get triggered by calling KD a snake? They don’t care they got Kevin Durant lmao
i was thinking the same thing. maybe make the Kevin Durant player flair for OKC and GSW a snake
dude your last post is literally a defense of kobe in regards to his rape allegations. just get his dick out of your mouth and acknowledge that in 2018 kevin durant is more valuable. 
"&gt;i just assumed we were on the topic of the finals. the okc playing better without kd is similar to how the cavs this year ""play better"" without lebron. t  Cavs are playing better without Lebron, because lebron has been utter shit defensively.   &gt;he other team understands that the only time they get to rest their stars is when lebron/kd is on the bench.   This is not true LOL  There is not a single evidence for players resting when star players are resting. If this is the case, wouldn't opposing teams get worse because their star players are resting as well?  Give me possible proof that this exists.  &gt;not to mention the okc had two future mvps who played while kd was off.if you honestly think ANY team would be better without kd then you have no place in a basketball discussion.  You know what's really funny tho?   Lebron James is still a positive player in Rapm.   Kevin Durant's RAPM is far, far, far below the likes of Kobe, Duncan,etc.   Furthermore?   Team playing better than Durant has been a multiple occurrence in Kd's playoff career.   Grow up buddy. There's no possible argument for KD in this scenario. "

Kevin Durant is sasuke uchiha
"He's already a 3 time MVP in my personal record book. And also, Kevin Durant has zero championships for as long as he plays in Golden State. "
Then I fail to see what the application of the stat is.  Multi year anything will eliminate noise. That doesn't mean that I shouldn't be able to glean anything from a full 82 game season.  I mean some of these are just absolute head scratchers:  #17 LeBron James  #23 Rudy Gobert  #29 LaMarcus Aldridge   #31 Ben Simmons  #36 Kevin Durant  All 5 of those players have had HUGE impacts on their team's success this season.  Remove any of them and their team is at least 5 wins worse.  Watch any of them play and it's plainly obvious.  Edit: Here are their respective BPMs of guys that have played 40 games:  #2 LeBron   #11 Durant  #20 Gobert  #22 Simmons  #36 Aldridge   WS/48:  #8 LeBron  #10 Gobert  #11 Durant  #15 Aldridge  #53 Simmons  (Simmons likely underrated because of a lowish TS% and the fact that defense doesn't move the WS/48 needle as much)   
My dad thought Kevin durant was going to be a bust because he was the only player in the NBA combine to not bench 1 rep of 185
Coming from a filthy Kevin Durant Warriors flair like yourself. Go back to your own subreddit!
"But I thought when Kevin ""Cupcake Snake"" Durant signed in Golden State the NBA was officially over and no other team was going to win a title for at least 10 years?"
"No I’m not saying anything close to that. Im saying that Kevin Durant and Draymond Green have proven track records of abusing officials and complaining about almost every call. This is evident when you see that those guys are both in the top three for technicals in the entire league. Its not the refs job to make the game interesting or keep stars on the court? If its such an issue for you, why don’t you expect professionalism and maturity from those guys, at least enough to stay on the court for a whole game? This has nothing to do with LeBron, or fans who want to watch a team. Its about players who have to stop abusing the referees every game. Its completely up to them to offer the best product possible for fans. The mental gymnastics you’ve had to go through to blame the refs or anyone else is crazy. "
Kevin Durant is my favorite player   Jonathan Isaac and Rashard Lewis are my favorite Magic players
"The kings head coach gets to pick any warriors player to shoot the FT. Out of respect he choose Kevin Durant. He hypothetically could have picked Mcgee off the bench, but didn't. Nice move."
"Hayward isn’t LeBron James Or Kevin Durant. He’s a star player but he’s not going to make the raptors chances against the Celtics 0, they’re fairly even matched teams. Also you’re implying that Hayward is going to stop LeBron James lol."
"Kevin Durant and Rondo are the outliers, generally this is true across the league. It has to do with the arch of the shot changing. "
I think the difference is Warriors still have a pretty good shot at winning the chip without him. Miami on the other hand is a different story.  Edit: Id compare what Kevin Durant did to Lebron going to boston. Or to the stabbing of the back of Julias Ceaser Edit 2: Caesar? 
ITT: People liking and disliking social media comments for Kevin Durant liking and disliking social media comments
"KD has been pretty annoying since jumping on the Dubs, but in fairness [at least some segments the OKC media](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2047879-oklahoma-newspaper-front-page-calls-kevin-durant-mr-unreliable) did not give this guy the respect he had earned."
I mean i don't disagree with him but he's always been super defensive when it comes certain things.   https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/02/18/kevin-durant-opens-up-about-being-a-not-so-nice-guy-on-and-off-the-court/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.60337dfb50fd
"He should have won in 2009 imo, but yeah sure that's fair enough. He was still an all time great player at the time, and is definitely at the very least comparable to Curry.  Also while I was looking up the exact voting from 2009, I found [this](http://www.opencourt-basketball.com/kevin-durant-signing-with-golden-state-would-hurt-the-warriors/) article about how KD signing with the warriors would hurt them lmao. "
"KD has always been salty as hell.   http://www.espn.com/nba/allstar2015/story/_/id/12330540/kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-takes-aim-media  ""You guys really don't know s---,"" Durant told reporters.  ""To be honest, man, I'm only here talking to y'all because I have to,"" Durant said. ""So I really don't care. Y'all not my friends. You're going to write what you want to write. You're going to love us one day and hate us the next. That's a part of it. So I just learn how to deal with y'all.""   People just tolerated/noticed it more because he didn't jump ship to the warriors yet.   edit: People seem to be confused as to my point. It's not whether he's right or wrong here, but that this has been his personality for quite awhile. He had a cleaner image in OKC and people tend to forget moments like this from him. He's under more of a microscope now in GS. "
"As if the mods aren't just KD alt-accounts removing threads made by OP(KD) with comments in them by KD alts(not-OP) replying to other KD alts who are all commenting about KD Ingram likes on posts made by KD alts about KD.

"People assumed it, but during the whole alt-account thing earlier he had said the complete opposite actually, and basically said it was everything else (organization, Donovan, players except for Westbrook).  https://sports.yahoo.com/russell-westbrook-likes-thunder-cats-kevin-durant-dubbed-not-good-162700416.html  &gt; “He didn’t like the organization or playing for Billy Donovan,” Durant wrote in the third person. “His roster wasn’t that good, it was just him and Russ. … Imagine taking Russ off that team, see how bad they were. KD can’t win a championship with those cats.”"
Kevin Durant has unliked this comment. Quire Sultan has liked this comment
I'd want to put on a show since it's a pickup game so something for my current players would be something like   PG: John Wall   SG: Kevin Durant   SF: Lance Stephenson   PF: Anthony Davis   C:  Javale McGee     All time would be   PG: Magic Johnson   SG: Vince Carter   SF: Larry Bird   PF: Hakeem Olajuwon   C: Wilt Chamberlain
&gt; Kevin Durant scored more efficiently I guess.  The difference in efficiency is much more than you make it seem like lol
Peak Kobe averaged 35ppg on 56% true shooting and he was selected first team all defense. He willed a terrible lakers team to 45 wins while taking the biggest responsibility on both sides of the floor.  Kevin Durant scored more efficiently I guess.
Based on current players my mentality would be to have as many shooters/creators as possible.   PG: Steph Curry  SG: James Harden  SF: LeBron James  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Joel Embiid  As far as all time players I would probably just pick my favorite players of the past.   PG: Steve Nash  SG: Michael Jordan/Kobe Bryant (love both these players and didn’t feel like picking between the two)   SF: Tracy McGrady  PF: Kevin Garnett  C: Hakeem Olajuwon 
"What!!!! How is it arbitrary it’s literally about how many points you score with the amount of possessions you attempt points in... I cannot believe you just said this. The .44 multiplier is literally just the league average in how many free throw attempts on average you get from a possession, it leads to absolutely minuscule differences than rTS%. I’m absolutely convinced you don’t understand what TS% is if you think it’s arbitrary.  For example, Ben Simmons has a higher FG% than Kevin Durant but a lower TS% because KD shoots the three way better and free throws way better. But its not arbitrary because all it is dividing point by possessions used in scoring attempts. That’s the *definition* of efficiency, and KD is more efficient than Ben Simmons this playoffs despite the FG%. how can FG% possibly be better than TS% when 3&gt;2. I literally cannot understand your reasoning. "

"""I know Anthony Davis and the Pels are killin it, but if he wants to come and join the warriors because it's best for him, I want him to do what's best for him""  -Kevin Durant"
What do you guys think about Kevin Durant recently advocating Giannis to leave Milwaukee?
"Ben Simmons is 21, in his 2nd year after being drafted  Kevin Durant at 21 average 30 points a game. Giannis at 21 average 23Pts, 8R, 5A a game. Anthony Davis at 21 put up 24.4P, 10.2R, and 2.2 Assists a game.  Giannis wasn't considered a top 20 player but those other two very easily were at 21. I had to go back like... 3 years to Find Davis. If you haven't been following the NBA that long I get how you'd not know about these guys but it doesn't mean if someone said at 21 those 3 were going to be the GOAT they'd still be lofty expectations. "
Kevin Durant is the biggest bitch in nba history 
Hey guise new analogy Kevin Durant is a snak daeeee
Have you never seen the commercial for Undisputed? Skip goes Kevin Durant is the best player in basketball.   Shannon then goes STOP IT SKEEUPP We all know that's Lebron James. Plays all the time on FSO.

"Russ hasn't been anything close to a proven winner without Kevin Durant.  He has essentially played 3 seasons without KD...first season he missed the playoffs, then he lost in the first round and now even with the addition of George and Anthony has the Thunder with exactly one more win than last season and possibly another first round exit.  And even worse, his former teammate has now emerged as an all-star after leaving him and his team is doing better than Russell's.  Let's see what the Thunder do tomorrow though, they could still win the series and all this fuss people are making will be about nothing."
Kevin Durant called Giannis while sitting in his car right after the Warriors lost Game 7
If only they had some dude named Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant isn't Tier 1? List lost all credibility.

Lebron is almost as good as Kevin Durant
"Lebron James 2014 Finals  |||Shoo|Shoo|Shoo|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|FG%|3P%|FT%|MP|PTS|TRB|AST|STL|BLK| |1|LeBron James|.571|.519|.793|37.8|28.2|7.8|4.0|2.0|0.4|  Lebron James 2017 Finals  |||Shoo|Shoo|Shoo|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|FG%|3P%|FT%|MP|PTS|TRB|AST|STL|BLK| |1|LeBron James|.564|.387|.649|42.4|33.6|12.0|10.0|1.4|1.0|  In 2017 Finals he scored more points, grabbed more rebounds, and passed more assists, sure.  However in the 2014 Finals he shot better from the field, from the 3 point line, and from the free throw line. There is a big disparity in his free throw shooting (more than 10%!). And his 3 point shooting in 2014 was just godly. He shot the 3 in that Finals better than Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Ray Allen, or Michael Jordan ever have in any finals.  His defense was also much better getting huge blocks on Duncan and chasing down Parker, while guarding Kawhi, Tony, and Duncan at different times. Most of his points came on Kawhi or Diaw and he contained Leonard to only 18ppg while Durant gave Lebron 35 in 2017--literally double. Lebron averaged 2 steals per game as well in 2014.  &gt;2) His defense was subpar in that series, and Miami has a whole looked dispirited defensively.  Lebron was great defensively but the team was god awful. Ray Allen was 38 years old and messed up switches and was too slow all the time on defense getting beat, but had to stay on the floor because nobody else could shoot besides Lebron in that series (Battier shot 0% from 3, Chalmers and Cole shot 14%). Wade was horrible as well but he could not run and was playing through a knee injury that he got surgery for in the summer.  All in all, Lebron was clearly the best player on the court in 2014 miles ahead of everybody else. In 2017 Durant appeared to match him in a lot of ways."
They came back 1-3 against a team with Kevin Durant before they had Kevin Durant. And now they have Kevin Durant. Definitely not a hot take.
I'm not taking anything away from this series. I'm not concerned about other teams besides maybe Houston without Curry because I know how good the Warriors are and I've watched them win 2 titles in 3 years and dominate the league.  And I also think it's much more likely for teams that don't have Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson to have bad games against us than it is for those two to have bad games against them.
Warriors/Kevin Durant are used to blowing 3-1 leads.    
Jesus kevin durant is a punk bitch

"It's actually 80 points - Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Serge Ibaka.  I know it's hard to believe, but James Harden also was on the Thunder, but they decided they needed to trade him for some reason after they lost to the Heat in the finals. "
Kevin Durant is a cupcake who broke the nba. 
"We're shooting 37% from the floor. Our best shooter (min. 5 shots) is Kevin Durant, who is shooting 38%. "
The world ended in 2016 and we've all been left behind to suffer the rapture where kevin durant is on the warriors and the spurs don't matter anymore 
Kevin Durant is just a stretched Rondo 
Well yesterday a Warriors fan said Kevin Durant would run the PG position better than Russell Westbrook. 
1. Jrue Holiday  2. Anthony Davis  3. LeBron James  4. Kevin Durant  5. Giannis  5. Oladipo    6. Ben Simmons  7. Donovan Mitchell  8. John Wall  9. Kris Middleton   
Cleveland didn't have to play Kevin durant and okc.  Turns out Kevin durant gives Cleveland problems
LeBron's Fouls per 36 Minutes vs other notable players this season: LeBron James: 1.6 Klay Thompson: 1.7 John Wall and Demar Derozan: 2.0 Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis!: 2.1 James Harden: 2.4 Victor Oladipo and Steph Curry: 2.5 Chris Paul: 2.7 Ben Simmons: 2.8 Donovan Mitchell: 2.9 Kyle Korver and Giannis Antetokounmpo: 3.0 
"I would rather pay Rubio and build a solid team with depth than have Westbrook who cannot change his playing style to accommodate other talent on the team. Westbrook routinely froze out Kevin Durant, a superior player in games, and you can tell Westbrook doesn't buy into analytics.   Westbrook is going to age like Carmelo. His contract will be horrible when he is 30-31."
Surprised no one has said Kevin Durant.
"Well PG13 ain't Kevin Durant, lets just leave it there. "
They had a guy named Kevin Durant
He's ranked 28th all time in Win Shares per 48. Definitely should make it no question.  |Rank|Player|WS/48| |:-|:-|:-| |1.|Chris Paul|.2512| |2.|Michael Jordan*|.2505| |3.|David Robinson*|.2502| |4.|Wilt Chamberlain*|.2480| |5.|Neil Johnston*|.2413| |6.|LeBron James|.2377| |7.|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar*|.2284| |8.|Magic Johnson*|.2249| |9.|James Harden|.2204| |10.|Kevin Durant|.2186| |11.|Charles Barkley*|.2163| |12.|Jerry West*|.2134| |13.|Bob Pettit*|.2128| |14.|Tim Duncan|.2091| |15.|John Stockton*|.2087| |16.|Shaquille ONeal*|.2081| |17.|Stephen Curry|.2080| |18.|Oscar Robertson*|.2069| |19.|Karl Malone*|.2053| |20.|Larry Bird*|.2032| |21.|Yao Ming*|.2001| |22.|Ed Macauley*|.1964| |23.|Dirk Nowitzki|.1956| |24.|Artis Gilmore*|.1931| |25.|Bill Russell*|.1927| |26.|Julius Erving*|.1922| |27.|Dolph Schayes*|.1922| |28.|Manu Ginobili|.1902| |29.|Adrian Dantley*|.1887| |30.|Sidney Moncrief|.1873|
"man he was playing shitty, i shitted on him too.  Now, I am regretting it.  Playoff Rondo is scary man.  Jrue picked them apart.  AD is his usual beast self.  Man I would love to see the warriors series goes to 7 but we will see!  Man who we putting on Kevin Durant?  A.D?  I was thinking he could guard Draymond but I guess Mirotic would get that job.  All depends on match/lines ups looking forward to a great series!!  Rondo on Curry, Jrue on Thompson how much height is he giving up?  I'd be happy if A.D. was on Draymond roaming around make Draymond beat us we can't let the 3 beat us. "
"They have Curry, Thompson, Green, and oh yeah some guy named Kevin Durant. They are miles ahead."
Kevin Durant will go down as the GOAT.
"Maybe it's just Kevins leaving. Kevin Durant leaves the thunder, he wins a championship..."
Kevin Durant should have “was able to get Russell Westbrook out of the first round” on his HOF resume
1. Anthony Davis 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Lebron James 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antekoumpo 7. Jimmy Butler 8. Joel Embiid 9. Victor Oladipo 10. Kyrie Irving
"Oh for the love of God. Every time I think this sub can't get more reactionary, the Pelicans win their first playoff series in a decade and suddenly Anthony Davis is better than Kevin Durant."

"It fucking sucks. Everybody just posts memes or one word comments with no explanation.   The whole point of this is for a serious discussion. So I'll give you a serious answer.   Golden State in their current for is a good, but not great team. And the Pelicans match up decently.   At full health I'd say the Pelicans were the biggest threat to Golden State in the league, especially if they were playing without Curry.   Even outside of AD and Boogie dominating, we have the absolute perfect set of players to defend the Warriors. Solomon Hill has proved in the past that he can hang with Kevin Durant. He can't stop him (nobody can) but he's one of the 5 best guys at defending KD.   Jrue can take on Klay or Curry, especially in his current form. He's playing Kawhi level defense. Problem is, there's only one of him. If he's on Curry then Klay has a pretty easy matchup, and vice versa. BUT..  E'twaun Moore has also been playing fantastic defense lately. Problem there is, he struggles against bigger guys. Like seriously struggles. And Klay being 6'7 makes that a problem.   AD in the paint closes up the floor a ton for the Warriors. He's such a good rim protector, and they can literally stick him on any of the non-shooters they have on that team. If you put in Javale, Zaza, Iggy, hell even Draymond, you're giving Anthony Davis free reign to sit in the paint and keep your team from scoring just like Portland did this series with all their non-shooters.   Without Curry, I think the Pelicans can take any game from the Warriors. If the Pelicans had played the Warriors in the first round (whole series without Steph) then I believe they could've won in 6 or 7 games. Without Steph you give Jrue free reign to stick with Klay, never letting him get open. That closes up the floor for KD, who would dominate (especially since Solomon Hill is not healthy), but you'd slow the bleeding down since instead of 3 stars scoring 25+ you'd just have KD scoring 30+.   If Curry comes back 100%, the Warriors easily take it. Warriors offense would have it way too easy with Solomon Hill still about 65%. Jrue would be spread too thin, being forced to guard Curry, Klay, and even KD on the perimeter.   So what I think will happen is Curry will miss the first two, Pelicans will take one. Curry will come back in game 3 still a little rusty and the Pelicans will also take that one. But when Curry gets to 100% the Pelicans won't take a game.   I'd legitimately give the Pelicans about a 20-30% chance of winning. If Curry doesn't come back healthy it's a close series. If the Pelicans stay playing with a top 5 offense and top 5 defense, then I think it's a series either way. But when Curry comes back and starts dominating again there's no way the Pelicans beat them. At that point you just look on to next season and say ""When Boogie comes back we'll meet these guys again and have a gameplan already in place to beat them.""  A big thing I think a lot of people will leave out is the Gentry effect. Gentry knows the ins and outs of Kerr's system. He coached under that man when they won a ring together. **And** Darren Erman (the associate head coach for the Pelicans) coached the Warriors core under Mark Jackson. Coaching matchup will be a big positive for the Pelicans. "
"I hear you, but we just don't know. Kevin Durant/Klay Thompson combo is absurd and the team has so many intangibles. I'm not a Warriors fan but, they have so much talent."
yeah that Kevin Durant guy is really under the radar.
"Lol Kevin durant shot like 75% when he was guarded by LeBron. That’s pathetic.  Also LeBron smashed his way through the Eastern conference because he had a better team. If you don’t think KD’s stats matter because he had a better team, then LeBron’s stats in the eastern conference playoffs in the last 7 years should not matter either."
Most overrated NBA player of all time. LeBron has only played in the weak east. Kevin Durant has been the best player since 2012. 
"Of course it changes from season to season, but right now i'd say the best 6 teams are the West Coast Eagles, Sydney Swans, Richmond Tigers, Hawthorn Hawks, Geelong Cats, and Greater Western Sydney Giants. Here's the current AFL [ladder](http://www.afl.com.au/ladder)  Now I don't follow nba that closely to make great comparisons so bear with me. I reckon the Hawks are like the Golden State Warriors, recently dominating the scene, having great standout players etc. I'd compare Cyrol Rioli to Steph Curry in a way, smaller bloke, but jumps/shoots big, and has huge impact on games, where as Kevin Durant would be like Tom Mitchell, who was recently traded to the hawks and has been invaluable.   Maybe the Cav's are like Geelong in a way, older dynasty that has been lurking around the top 4 teams over the last 5 years even winning a couple times.   And there goes the extent of my basketball knowledge. However, I'd like to end with my favourite rivalry with the [2005-2007 Eagles-Swans rivalry.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney%E2%80%93West_Coast_AFL_rivalry) These two teams on the top of their games from 2005 to 2007, played each other 6 times, none were decided by **over 4 points** (4,4,2,1,1,1). Here's a [video](http://www.afl.com.au/video/2017-04-13/the-gripping-rivalry-eagles-v-swans) which should work in the US. The Grand final by the way, is like the superbowl, so it's like 2 superbowls in a row played between the same teams, decided by less than a single touch-down.  anyway, it's 1:30am right now, I'm going to bed "
"It's not like James Harden played well in the finals, playing next to All-NBA players Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook."
Kevin durant
Kevin Durant
"No.  I mean, one, I don't think he loses. I love the Pacers squad this year, but if he goes supernova and the Cavs role players aren't completely butt then he can make it. I think its a question of whether he wants to or not. He may also be tired.  Two, he's not going to pull a Kevin Durant to the team that beat him in the first round, if it happens. "
The tree from Evil Dead grew up to become Kevin Durant and fuck NBA records instead
Fucking classic  https://giphy.com/gifs/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-thunder-12OYYarAi8vi8
"lol ok? If you gave anthony davis or kevin durant 2 all-stars for 7 straight years, they'd basically have those same accolades (give or a take a few mvps based on luck of the year). lebron is not dominant, he's simply good. "
And Kevin Durant isn't creating offense for his teammates.
"He doesn't have to. The team still has Kevin fucking Durant.  lol @ them ""not being good offensively"" without Curry."
"You threw and intentionally lost professional NBA games in a multibillion dollar business for  consecutive years. It got to the point where the NBA commissioner himself had to come in and bring his own people into your front office after firing everyone there.  Let me tell you something about the Miami HEAT culture:  -Lebron James left his hometown team to join our organization. -We were on the list of teams Kyrie Irving wanted to be traded to. -Kevin Durant interviewed with us when he was a free agent. -We Won three championships this decade, not in the ABA Era. -We will never throw professional games intentionally for draft picks. Fans work to hard for that and the NBA product deserves to be treated better.  Batteries. Santa Claus. Philly."
"Kevin Durant averages 28.5/8/5/1/1.5 on 53/40/86 vs AD.  7 wins 4 losses. NOP has no one that can slow Durant down dude.  Jrue and Moore got killed even when the Pelicans won. Durant put up 41/10/4 on 62% FG. No one in that team can guard him, and if you stick AD to him you guys have no rim protection.   "
"It’s impossible to not like the NBA right now.  Amazing leadership that encourages activism.  An amazing product on the court. The amount of talent in the league right now is insane.  Likable athletes. Kevin Durant is the most hated player and that’s because he wanted to win more. Compare that to the off court transgressions of MJ and Kobe.  International growth and unprecedented increase in team values.  The NBA is on pace to be the dominant league a generation from now, domestically.  Basketball should surpass cricket as the world’s number 2 sport in that same time frame. "
"If you think Kevin Durant is the best player in the league, you delusional.   Up 3-0 against a team who’s coach just lost his wife and missing their best player. "
He’s a bitch!... Has a gsw and Kevin Durant tag
"Summer 2016 was ""have money will spend"" for every team. The lucky ones spent it on Kevin Durant and LeBron James. The unlucky ones did not."
"This is the key thing   It's something guys like Matt Moore and Zach Lowe have talked about at length(particularly Moore) as some ex   Often in the nba ISO ball is a choice. Players dictate. It's not as simple as a player simply saying ""fuck this shit the coach drew up I'm doing it all my own"". Although that sometimes happens   Very often if can be a player not going 100% into every part of the set because he's not really a big fan of it the set quickly devolving early on and if being a situation of ""see this set didn't work.....oh well time for me to try and do my own thing"".   People often go a bit overboard with these OKC play calling narratives for most of the game Westbrook runs what's called and follows the plan within reason. It's just come crunch time......the problem of players devolving and just wanting to do their own stuff has been a real thing win OKC for years now. And it goes beyond Westbrook: Kevin Durant used to get a pass for doing this in OKC as WB would often just get the blame"
PG: John Stockton   SG: Michael Jordan   SF: Larry Bird   PF: Tim Duncan   C: Ben Wallace    You don’t need everyone to score on this team. But everyone needs to play defense. And with Duncan and Wallace in the middle there is no chance of driving the lane or getting rebounds.    And then Stockton will set up Jordan and Bird all day. And hit the occasional 3 when needed.    Bench would be:     Lebron James   Klay Thompson   Hakeem Olajuwon   Kevin Durant   Dennis Rodman   Gary Payton
"Well as things are, they average more assists than Curry.  They have the #1 record in the league by far.  They have the #1 offense over the Warriors.  I would say they're doing just fine.   Not to mention doing all this without a 3rd superstar like Kevin Durant.  Warriors have 4 all-stars and still finished with a much inferior record."
"Kobe is perfectly rated. When its all said and done, Kevin Durant will be even greater than Kobe. "
You have Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson and Draymond Green lol  Green even averages more assists than Curry.
"They can stagger because they are both elite playmakers that can generate great offense even with role players. No other team has that luxury.  They don't have 4 all-stars like the Warriors, they have two guys who can create something out of nothing.  Give them Kevin Durant and they will blow all of the Warriors' ratings/records away."
"Except Curry had 2 MVPs and 1 ring before KD. And Harden played with KD too, where's his ring from that time?  Curry is a wayyy more dangerous offensive player than Harden. Do you remember the Cavs double teaming Curry on the 3 point line to give Kevin fucking Durant wide open dunks? Absolutely no one would play that kind of defense on Harden."
Harden and CP3 have a better Net Rating together than Thompson and Curry despite not having Kevin Durant on the court with them.
"But the following year thabo raised his attempts per game to 3.1 which is still not a lot, but still maintained 41.9 % shooting, also you had Kevin Martin shoot 42.6% on 4.8 attempts and he played almost exactly the same amount of time as thabo. Its not like Kevin Durant played every minute with starters and without at least another decent shooter. I agree he didn't have a lot of spacing, but he definitely had 2 other guys that could shoot and open up the floor some."
"[You realize that Curry is 8th in career per game average in the playoffs all time, right?](http://www.landofbasketball.com/all_time_leaders/points_per_game_career_playoffs.htm)   I mean there is crazy, there is salty r/NBA fan, and way more whack and stupid than that is what you just said.

"LeBron has to beat a 73 win team in the Finals that added Kevin Durant and we're talking about Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood, and Kevin Love.  Even the 76ers basically have a Rising Stars All Star Team plus guys like Reddick who would be the 3rd best Cav if he were playing with LeBron.  And maybe we should look at the mpg split between Clarkson and Hood with their old teams? Maybe there are some other variables?  The Cavs have too many good role players (which frankly includes Kevin Love in today's athletic small ball everyone-can-shoot NBA, but let's jsut pretend he's still an all-star for Barkley's sake). The Cavs don't know who to play from night to night, their starting lineup is still changing constantly and nevermind the rotations. Cedi Osman isn't playing, Tristan only played in about half of the games last series. You think maybe that's why role players aren't averaging the same? Maybe playoffs defense is a lot more physical and taken more seriously by the other teams and some of these guys have never been to the playoffs?  When you find yourself agreeing with a talking head like Barkley (who has admitted he barely watches games), it's time for being critical of the evidence and situation. "
"Ehh. Definitely would make the finals, but yet again we’re forgetting how good the Warriors are. Kevin Durant and Steph Curry, and their role players are Klay and Draymond."
"PG:  Stephen Curry ($1,100) SG:  Klay Thompson ($700) SF:  Kevin Durant ($1,100) PF:  Anthony Davis ($900) C:  Al Horford ($600) UTIL:  Chauncey Billups ($700) UTIL:  JJ Redick ($600) UTIL:  Ron Artest ($700)  When building this team, I was thinking of how great the Warriors are and how they have, most likely, the best NBA team ever assembled.   But how could it be improved?  Which player would fit their team and actually improve it without losing chemistry? The answer was Anthony Davis.  A supremely talented player that is cerebral and extremely active.   He would fit right in and dominate both defensively and offensively.   Adding AD to the Warriors would make them virtually unstoppable.  Once that ridiculous foursome was created, there was $2,600 remaining to fill C and three UTILs.  Al Horford is the C that would have the best chemistry for his value that I can imagine.  He is a great competitor on both ends of the floor, facilitates well and finishes efficiently around the rim.  Furthermore, his jumper demands respect enough to open up the paint for Durant and AD.  Chauncey Billups would back up Stephen Curry as the second ball handler.  He was also a true competitor.  A great floor leader that would ensure the team is playing at a high level.  He would be the calming presence; facilitating, scoring and defending.  Mr. Big Shot would be part of a balanced attack from the PG position.  JJ Redick would come off the bench for Klay Thompson.  This combination of SGs would be deadly.   They both are amazing pure shooters that would run off screens and provide excellent 3pt and FT shooting.  JJ Redick is an underrated passer as well and would keep the team’s offensive identity in tact.  Ron Artest would be the wing off the bench behind Kevin Durant.  Artest was an incredible defender who was both physical and had exceptional instincts.  His antics would be subdued on such a great team (see Ron Artest on Kobe’s championship Lakers).  He would often guard the best opposing player and I believe would play great with KD and AD, in particular.    ________________________  The recurring theme of this team would be the highest level of competitors.  There would be three of the greatest shooters of all-time In Steph, Klay and KD.  Anthony Davis would be a ridiculous PF with these players and would dominate without the ability to double team him.  I love the idea of KD and AD playing defense alongside each other.    Complementing these four are solid role players who would each bring their own contributions.  Big Al Horford is one of the most active and versatile big men who would fit right in.  Chauncey Billups would provide stability and reinforcement of the teams identity.  JJ Redick would continue the unbelievable shooting on this team and Ron Artest would provide lock down defense on the opposing offensive threat.  There is no true backup for Center, and Horford is a bit undersized.  However, much like the Warriors today, the team wouldn’t need a big Center as all other players are athletic and versatile defensively.  Plus, KD and AD at the 3 and 4, respectively, are each basically 7’ft tall.   At times, Anthony Davis could slide to the C position and Artest could come off the bench for Horford.  This would create their own version of a ‘Death Lineup’ with 5 versatile players that could switch defensively.    Another lineup would be having Billups at the PG with both Klay and Steph running off screens.  Complete it with KD and AD setting the screens and you have the most explosive offensive lineup imaginable.   "
Are you attempting to compare Bulls Rodman (I am a Rodman fan) to a prime Kevin Durant? How old are you? In 96 Rodman was an aging 35 year old who was still a great rebounder but didn't do much else. You are doing a tremendous disservice to KD by comparing him to a 35-38 year old Dennis Rodman on the bulls. 
You guys didn't win the title but you won a Kevin fucking Durant which now is going to give you multiple titles. So that 73-9 season was really a win😎
"A matured 2012 Thunder team that kept its big three  together vs 2017 warriors, although this would require us to have to clone Kevin Durant"
Welp time to dig out the Sonics Durant jersey. Idec that it's preseason. To see Kevin back in Key Arena will be too good to miss.
Sure Kevin Durant didn’t write this?
Yes. And the lakers should also trade Brandon Ingram for Kevin Durant. Too bad no one would every say yes to that
"That’s painful if you’re not a contender or if you’re a small market team. But if you’re one of 2-3 title favorites in a big market, I don’t think you hesitate.  When people talk about GSW’s future issues, they’re talking about &gt;$100M bills.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.goldenstateofmind.com/platform/amp/2017/10/2/16383160/nba-2017-golden-state-warriors-salary-cap-steph-curry-kevin-durant-klay-thompson-draymond-green"
&gt;A WB-led contender needs a lot more shooting than the Thunder have  Kevin Durant...  &gt;and ideally a second star with similar playmaking capabilities (and complementary shooting) who can stagger minutes heavily with WB.  And James Harden.  Damn it.
Dennis Rodman was a castoff from the Spurs and was old. Kevin Durant was a generational superstar in his prime.
"Rodman was pretty much wanted by nobody so Chicago was almost the only landing spot and the best place he could've played.   Rodman made them go from 58 or 60 wins to 72, but there's a pretty good chance they win the title without Rodman.   The 1996 East was really bad.  Kevin Durant would've made any team he went to 1-3 in title favorite odds, the Thunder were up 3-1 on the 2016 Warriors, I have a hard time believing the Warriors continue being THAT good without Durant and Barnes who they were losing regardless, if they played the Thunder again in 2017 without having Durant it's not a guarantee they win that series and beat LeBron + Kyrie + Love in the Finals"
"If Kevin Durant was basically the same option as Russ, Prime Melo would be a distant second."
You can't be seriously comparing the Bulls acquisition of Rodman (who was almost considered to be washed up because nobody could control him and had been injury prone for 3 years) with a guy that without LeBron in the league would be considered the best player in the world  Horace Grant ---&gt; Dennis Rodman  Harrison Barnes ---&gt; Kevin Durant   The KD acquisition was a monumental upgrade in comparison
"The only players in the NBA who are not traditional bigs with a standing reach of over 9-1 1/2"" are Durant, Giannis and Brandon Ingram (Giannis actually doesn't have an official measurement for this but it's a good bet it's true, [link](http://www.draftexpress.com/article/How-Brandon-Ingram-Compares-With-Kevin-Durant-At-The-Same-Age-5418/))."
"Are you really cherrypicking one article to try to convince me that KOC is a better writer than Zach Lowe?  As if this wasnt already Zach Lowes [second](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23364202/zach-lowe-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-nba) article of the day?  Listen, its not like Zach Lowe is even my favorite writer.  But its obvious who KOC is trying to be, and hes coming up short.  Id love if KOC did his own thing instead of completely copying someone elses style.   &gt;I'd highly suggest you actually read him before attempting to make claims that his is just a 2nd-rate version of another writer.  As I told you already, I have.  Ive given him multiple shots.  His analysis is lazy, his conclusions are usually hyperbole that is disproved in a weeks time, and his articles are usually pure clickbait.  Man, ive never met a KOC stan like this.  And it seems like you post mostly theringer.com articles.  Did Ringer employee Kevin Durant teach KOC how to have a burner account?"
"Kevin Durant had qualities that perfectly corresponded to being a teammate of Westbrook. As the article mentions, Kevin Durant during his last couple of seasons on the Thunder became the deadliest spot up shooter in the league, a skill set that is most conducive to success with Westbrook. However as the article also points out, this role was somewhat beneath a player of Durant's quality. I am not arguing that those Thunder teams were not successful. I am arguing that what Westbrook brings to the table puts a limiting factor on that team's ceiling while simultaneously raising that team's floor (floor being role players)."
"Fuck Melo for diluting the parity of whatever team he is on.   Fuck Kevin Durant for diluting the parity of the league.   Fortunately you don't have to respect one or the other, you can respect neither!"
This is the in-game example that I remembered the most:  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/heres-why-draymond-green-went-off-on-kevin-durant-in-the-warriors-loss-to-grizzlies/
"[This] (https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-says-being-with-the-warriors-is-teaching-him-about-the-game/) is not exactly what I was thinking of, but here is Durant talking about it.  I remember seeing something from someone in the organization talking about their process with him."
"I get that the “everyone against us” is a strong narrative to push, but GSW fans don’t get to take the winningest team of all time, add Kevin Durant, and claim underdog / poor me status."
"Thunder came plenty close. Until management fucked Harden, leading to the eventual departure of a certain Kevin Durant fellow.  Three MVPs in their prime on the squad and they fumbled the opportunity? I think so."
"... [and Kevin Durant will ""help close the building.""](https://twitter.com/ChrisDaniels5/status/991028605831516160)"
So Kevin Durant?
"&gt; Kevin ""Cant Win With Those Cats"" Durant (even though he was right)  ftfy.  also, damn, i really can't think of a sg even though it seems like there should be a bunch"
"All NBA ""It's Everybody's Fault But My Own"" Team:  PG - John Wall (even though he's right)  SG - ??? Edit: Drew Bledsoe  SF - Kevin ""Cant Win With Those Cats"" Durant  PF - Melo  C - Whiteside"
"Zach Lowe on Russ' mentality during games:  &gt;**Playing with so many young guys might have fed Westbrook's instincts to dominate. Winning so much that way, so early, might have made it harder for him to adjust. (These are popular theories among those who have been around the team.)**  &gt;Oklahoma City's failure to develop an offensive system goes beyond Westbrook. But we have been talking about this problem for almost 10 years. The coach has changed, the bench has changed, the stars around him have changed.  &gt;Westbrook's heart is in the right place; he wants to win, and when he takes a lot of shots, it is because he has concluded that is the best path to winning. More than one person described Westbrook's process as doing math while scanning the floor: he knows he can hit X percentage from this spot. A teammate can only do better if they are in the right spot, in rhythm, in the middle of a good game. Passing brings the risk of a turnover -- lowering the expected points per possession. There is a method.  Zach Lowe on why OKC struggles when Russ sits:   &gt;And for two straight years post-Durant, Oklahoma City's offense disintegrated with Westbrook on the bench. George couldn't reverse that trend. It says a lot about Westbrook's greatness, and the Thunder's shaky bench. It also stems from the Thunder's style: When one person is the system, the whole thing collapses when that person rests.  &gt;Some within the Cavs have long hinted that Cleveland's inability to score with LeBron on the bench -- even with both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love on the floor -- stemmed from LeBron's similar centrality. Westbrook is not LeBron.  "
"how the offense with KD/Russ transitioned under Donovan:  &gt;The Thunder have long known this (about changing the offense to a Houston-type spread pick and roll system). In their final two seasons with Durant, their offense evolved in this direction. Early in their careers, Westbrook and Durant touched the ball about the same amount, and ran almost the same number of pick-and-rolls, per SportVU tracking data examined then. Those numbers skewed toward Westbrook in 2015 and 2016. Ibaka grew into a reliable 3-point shooter, Adams into a lob crammer:   &gt;Durant worked more off the ball, the league's deadliest spot-up threat. This was intentional. ""That's what we want,"" Collison told me in February 2016. ""Russell's decision-making has gotten really good. We want Kevin catching the ball and attacking closeouts. He's getting easier shots now.""  &gt;Durant left five months later. Finding a second star for a spread pick-and-roll attack is tricky. The natural partner is an elite dive-and-dunk big who can run the offense in stretches -- Amar'e Stoudemire for Steve Nash. Anthony Davis would be the peak iteration, though he may be too good for even the loftiest version of the role.  "
"&gt;In November 2014, when both Westbrook and Kevin Durant were out with injuries, Scott Brooks implemented something of a motion offense. Nothing fancy: enter the ball to the elbow, cut and screen for each other, move it side-to-side.  &gt;For those Thunder, it was revolutionary. Sitting in the Barclays Center after a shootaround, Andre Roberson talked with something approaching wonder about getting to do things with the ball. It was fun! ""Not just a little fun,"" Roberson told me then. ""Sharing the ball, playing for each other -- I'm loving it.""  &gt;No one expected the Thunder to play that way when Westbrook and Durant returned. That would have been stupid. Stars are stars because they hoard the ball, draw defenders, and set up lesser teammates with easier shots than those teammates could generate on their own. The Thunder had two superstars who could get anywhere they wanted. Embracing a Spursy egalitarian style would have been doctrinaire and self-defeating.  &gt;But the Thunder did want Westbrook and Durant to watch and realize they could let go a little -- that the offense would be less predictable in the postseason if they sacrificed some time of possession and moved around a bit. ""Every team can take something from what [the Spurs] do,"" Nick Collison told me then. ""We've seen that in the playoffs, we have to move the ball more and rely less on one-on-one.""  for the nephews that didn't believe Thunder fans when we said almost this exact thing"
Kevin Durant leading the charts with **69%** rebounds.  Nice.  Also really great work OP!!
"&gt; Bob Myers, GM of the Warriors, explained that his ideal player ""would be 6-foot-8 with a 7-foot-6 wingspan and still be able to shoot""  Kevin Durant basically. Looney is pretty close although his shooting needs work. Surprising that Myers opted to decline his option."
"Lol no. Kevin Durant is one of the best shooters in the league from any range, he's unguardable due to his size, he dribbles better than any big man in the league, and he can get to the rim at will. He's the best scorer since Kobe. LeBron's shot is broken half the time."
Exactly man I wish that shit would happen sometime like imagine how the league would have reacted if Kevin Durant went to Memphis instead of the stacked warriors or the Celtics. Like we had a perfect team for him. Adam Silver and casual fans probably wouldn't be too happy though.
You lose either way though. Kevin Durant gets shit for giving up money to win
"&gt;THOR:  &gt;Yes, me too. On many, many occasions. There was one time when we were children, he transformed himself into a KD, and he knows that I love Kevin Durant. So, I went to pick up the KD to admire it and he transformed back into himself and he was like, “Yeah, it’s me!” And he stabbed me. We were eight at the time."
"Something something kevin durant, steph curry something something."
Helps to have a Draymond Green or Kevin Durant to pass out to.
It goes both ways. Lebron James and Kevin Love were called for 4 fouls in Game 1 and Kyrie Irving 3 fouls. In Game 3 Kyrie Irving was called for 5 fouls.  In Game 4 Kevin Love was given a flagrant foul for this after Durant complained: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiUUfDbCnhQ  
"Klay, Curry and Durant combined had games where they all scored around 30 in the 2017 finals combining for 90 points. Lebron would need to averaged like 70 points on high efficiency for the Cavs to win and Kevin Love or JR Smith would have to chip in 20. "
This was a deliberate referee rule twisting to help the Warriors. No call you want to complain about in favor of the Cavs is bad as this. Do you have an excuse for this? It's indefensible.  Meanwhile Lebron James and Kevin Love were called for 4 fouls in Game 1 and Kyrie Irving 3 fouls. In Game 3 Kyrie Irving was called for 5 fouls. In Game 4 Kevin Love was given a flagrant foul for this after Durant complained: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiUUfDbCnhQ  It was rigged for the Warriors! The refs won the game! Questionable calls is why the Warriors won in 2017!  This is the annoying bullshit you Warriors fans sound like.
"Yeah this has nothing to do with quality of players in the league. Players are better than ever, there's more players than ever all over the world playing each other younger than ever year round against each other. LeBron has to go against a 73 win team that added Kevin Durant. LeBron has shared the ball plenty in his career, he played with Wade/Chalmers/Cole, Kyrie, Mo Williams/Delonte West, his Time of Possession has been average starting PG level, nowhere near guys like Westbrook and Harden.  Dumbass post if you believe even a little of it."
"&gt; And they never made the playoffs, even in the East. Not once LOL But one man comes back, and they become a championship team, overnight. That's LeBron James  Who's they? Wiggins never played a game for the Cavs, neither did Love. They also didn't have Mozgov, JR, or other key parts of the team  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2014.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2015.html  &gt; That, and non stop blocking Klay and especially Curry, the so called 2 time regular season MVP, like a weak ass bitch. That dude got blocked by Bron a dozen times in that single series, it was hilarious. That's why they went off crying to Kevin Durant for help, even though they had a 73 win team LOL  So weak that it took Kyrie's big shot late in game 7 to win? Guess we have different definitions of 'utter dominance'. Being down 3-1 until the opposing team's rim protector goes down sure doesn't sound like 'utter dominance' either.  &gt; Just give it up kid, this is just sad. Go stand with rest of the blind delusional haters, and cry over there. Whoosh  Funny choice for words here"
"&gt;The team with Kyrie and the #1 pick where it was known Wiggins would be traded for a star? Lmao     And they never made the playoffs, even in the East. Not once LOL But one man comes back, and they become a championship team, overnight.  That's LeBron James  &gt;   &gt;Taking a team to 7 games in an extremely close final game isn't 'utter dominance'    No, but **[THIS] (https://i.imgur.com/WJhVBUg.jpg?2)** is *utter domination*, FYI   &gt;   That, and non stop blocking Klay and especially Curry, the so called 2 time regular season MVP, like a weak ass bitch. That dude got blocked by Bron a dozen times in that single series, it was hilarious. That's why they went off crying to Kevin Durant for help, even though they had a 73 win team LOL   &gt;     Just give it up kid, this is just sad. Go stand with rest of the blind delusional haters, and cry over there. *Whoosh*"
Shooters like Kevin Durant and Ibaka?
"Damn, should have called Kevin Durant first"
"&gt; at some point Celtics have to try to be good now instead of in the future  They were arguably the favorites to win the East before Kyrie went down. Add Hayward, add another year under the belts of the young guys and who's to say they can't win it all next year?  &gt; If you’re going to pass on trading a good young asset for a 26-year old Top 5 player, in the interests of saving money for some future rainy day... I don’t know what to tell you  The problem is that Tatum is more than just a ""good young asset."" No player as young as he is has *ever* contributed so much on a winning team. He just had the best age-19 season since Kevin Durant. Ainge would be nuts to trade him right now."
A lot of Rockets fans are still butthurt he won the MVP over him last seaon.  Warriors fans hate that OKC keeps shitting on Kevin Durant. 
"Kevin Durant wasn't known as an exceptional rim protector let alone defender until he joined the warriors. Both lebron and Jordan were the best perimeter defenders in the league for a 5 year stretch (lebron not as consistently).   Kevin doesn't also doesn't ""fit"" into every system when you consider his play making ability and shot selection is no where near Jordan or Lebron despite having arguably more deceptive handles. He's never been a guy that can run point or an offense. Lebron's best asset is his playmaking and Jordan when given the opportunity to run point in the late 80s I believe average a triple double over certain stretches, albeit not on the level of Lebron.   And all of this is missing the main point, you cannot be goat if you can't win a championship as the main alpha dog of a team. Joining a 73 win warrior squad effectively eliminated him from the goat contention by establishing him as unable to carry teams to the promise land. From a moral and intangible standpoint alone it wouldn't do the game justice to give Durant the goat title. To be GOAT you'd have to be the guy that hypothetically you'd take first in an all time draft. Durant is not that.   So no, him being 7 feet tall and grabbing a few more boards doesn't make him the goat. But I'll give you this, statistically, he's the most efficient scorer ever and the best all around sniper since Bird. Definite top 10 player.  "
"&gt;Kevin Durant has quietly become the greatest scorer of all time and it's not even close  That's not even true for the franchise he plays for right now, let alone the Celtics, the Lakers, the Sixers, the Bucks, the Spurs, the Bulls... Kevin Durant can shoot, exceptionally well. Leave it at that."

Kevin Durant gets up at 8am 
"Joining the 76ers after losing to them is not even close to Kevin Durant-like.  Don't overthink this, best thing for Lebron is to win as much as possible."

Who the fuck is Kevin Durant? Is he a big shot? 
"I think you're forgetting that the 2018 Warriors have Kevin Durant and the 2016 team did not, even if Curry is not at a 100%, I still think Golden State will win the ship, maybe it won't be a sweep, but I don't think it'll go farther than 5 games"
"Carmelo Anthony yelled “Yo P, they want me to come off the bench”. Russell Westbrook gave a look of genuine derangement. Paul George belted out “I’m going to a different [expletive] squad”. And before Corey Brewer hit the locker room, ex-OKC star Kevin Durant hugged him and said “You can’t win a championship with those cats”. "
" **Kevin Durant: ""Memes hurt us a lot, going to the psychologist helped me""** "
Same way he played off-ball to MVP Kevin Durant during their time together  Oh fuckin wait 
"1. GS is way better than they were in 2016, which is why everyone hates Kevin Durant  2. Nobody in the East is half as good as the Cavs were in 2016  The journey to see who wins is always fun, but we've known who was winning the 2018 championship for 2 years now. After KD went to GS, everybody knew that means 3 guaranteed rings, no questions asked. He's getting \#2 this year, and there isn't any debate. The only chance of someone dethroning them is through the formation of a comparable superteam. If Houston gets one more All-Star (PG? Kawhi? ...LeBron?) then KD's complete fucking of the NBA will be challenged. Until then, anybody predicting anyone besides the Warriors to win is just wasting their time. "
“Meth Curry” - Tyler Johnson  “Brodie” -Russ  “Feathery” - Oladipo  “Bitch” - Kevin Durant 
I feel like this is disingenuous considering that you guys added Kevin Durant lol
"Yeah it's kind of annoying when Warriors fans compare anything to 2016 when, like, they added **Kevin Durant**..."
"Lebrons unparalleled BBIQ, passing, and ability to pick his spots more than make up for his worse jump shooting. He is far more impactful than Kevin Durant. Arguably, Lebron is the most impactful player on offense in basketball history."
What is it all the kids say about this? Is it Fuck Kevin Durant? 
"What if Curry doesn't get hurt in the 2016 playoffs, and the Warriors repeat? Does Kevin Durant go to Oakland? If not (which would be my guess), where does he end up? Do the Warriors keep Barnes or find a free agent replacement?"
"Yes, but they had Kevin Durant. We are talking about this OKC team that by the looks of it will have an older, still ball dominant Russ, a bad Melo, and possibly no Paul George.  Are you a Russell fan? Most of the success Russell has experienced was with Durant."
"Nah lol. All those people were kidding themselves that they didnt want LeBron back. You're right though, people do forget how badly LeBron was hated then. 10x worse than Kevin Durant."
"Klay Thompson gasped, “There you go” Kevin Durant gave a look of struggling to breathe. Steve Kerr belted, “We got a tired fucking squad now.” And before Draymond Green hit the locker room door, ex-Marathon Runner Mo Farah hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so tired.”"
It’s a bird... it’s a snake.... it’s Kevin Durant!

No. Kevin Durant is the second best SF. Larry Bird is the second greatest. There’s a difference
A Westbrook triple double but without Kevin Durant?

"Harden never got a proper chance to be a superstar in OKC.  If he wasn’t playing behind Westbrook, his evolution would have accelerated because he’d be the ball dominant guard on that squad.    And KD absolutely has the talent to lead a team to a ring, that’s unquestionable.  A big problem is that Westbrook kept trying to be the 1a on that team when in reality he should’ve just accepted being the second option.  In no scenario should he be taking more shots in a game than Kevin Durant.    With Draymond, you don’t have any of those problems, and KD and Harden can shine properly.  Not to mention you don’t have to pay Draymond even close to what you have to pay Westbrook, making it easier to keep the team together.  "
"Their best offensive player: Kevin Durant  Our best offensive player: LaMarcus Aldridge  Their second best offensive player: Klay Thompson  Our second best offensive player: Fucking Rudy Gay, man.   Their third best offensive player: Andre Iguodala/Draymond Green  Our third best offensive player: I don't know... Patty Mills? The corpse of Manu Ginobili?   Why did anyone think this would be close lmao"
The Rockets are going to get killed. Do people forget this is a 73 win team that upgraded Bogut to West. And Barnes to Kevin Durant? This shit isn't even close. The players fucked themselves by not going for cap smoothing. Ruined the league for the foreseeable future. 
Kevin Durant just doing Kevin Durant things this game. Nothing we can do
"Kevin Durant shouldn’t be a hall of famer. If you’re going to ruin the NBA because you’re too much of a snowflake to compete, you don’t deserve to have your name next to Kobe, Jordan, Hakeem, or Bird. That should deter cowardice like this in the future "
This Kevin Durant guy is pretty good. 
KEVIN DURANT IS A BAD MAN

Steph Curry : Ian Clark :: Kevin Durant : Quinn Cook

"&gt;You have a warped understanding of what it entails competing at highest level in sports,  By joining your competition instead of getting better to beat them? Very typical of the snowflake generation to hate working hard and instead wanting to take the easy way out, but still expect people to give them full due.  What Kevin Durant and Lebron James did was put in cheat codes in a game they couldn't beat instead of getting better. But let me guess, cheat codes aren't really about making it easier to win right?  &gt;There are no extra medals for getting things done the hard way, just the opposite, actually.

"Gobert is a top 25 player easily?   Nah. And don’t say RPM proves your point because that stat has Kevin Durant and Lebron as the 29th and 12th best players respectively.

There is so much screen and roll, switching, and matchup exploitation in the playoffs that I think his impact is diminished. I’d much rather have a versatile defender like Draymond or AD in the postseason. "
Kevin Durant ruined the NBA.
"I conceded that he’s an all time great player, and that shot was nice. But this is the same guy who admitted he didn’t want to be the leader, basically admitted he wasn’t a competitor with his move, complained that they had “lost their engine” when Curry went down (even though he is good enough to be a teams engine). He also just got pushed off his block by Jrue Holiday and has a history of being guarded by point guards.

"“When you’re a scorer, you know angles” (said after a Kevin Durant trick shot)"
"&gt;Hilarious.  What’s so funny? LeBron is bigger, stronger and faster. He’s a more versatile athlete that could play more positions and sports. LeBron was being recruited in Football from Ohio State, Miami, and Alabama. LeBrons junior season in high school and only year playing football he caught [61 passes for 1,245 yards and 16 touchdowns](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2609589-the-failed-college-football-recruitment-of-lebron-james.amp.html)   Jumping is the only thing Michael Jordan does from an athletic standpoint better than LeBron. The rest aren’t close. That’s to be expected when you weigh 35 pounds less than someone.   &gt; For fucks sake he was a 190-200 pound shooting guard.  [NBA.com’s encyclopedia says differently.](http://www.nba.com/history/players/jordan_bio.html)  [USA Today published this article on Michael Jordan around his 50th. Birthday. It says his goal was to get down to his playing weight.. of 218.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/1922419)  From the article  &gt; to 248. He'll claim it's about health, or looking good for his 50th birthday party. But in his mind, there's a target: 218, a familiar and dangerous number in Jordan's world. That's his playing weight.  So we’ve established Jordan was 216. That’s what the NBA says and article covering Jordan’s weight loss says.   It was not equal weight. and your argument takes a major ding if Sidney Moncrief was only 6’1 or 6’2 like you said.    &gt;DJ was a bit lighter but look at him. He was a tight muscular guy.   Muscle weighs more than fat. [I’m looking at Dennis Johnson. He was never overly muscular nor would anyone consider him thick](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/dennis-johnson-of-the-boston-celtics-poses-with-a-ball-news-photo/180899203#/dennis-johnson-of-the-boston-celtics-poses-with-a-ball-during-a-at-picture-id180899203)  Rodman being a freak is fine, but he was better on the Bulls and a part of three Jordan title runs. Dennis   Rodman was not a perimeter defender either. Dumars was Jordan’s primary perimeter defender. [Rodman averaged 6.8 minutes a game in the 89 Eastern finals](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1989-nba-eastern-conference-finals-bulls-vs-pistons.html).    &gt;Klay, Durant, Tatum are low muscle tone guys who owe the fact they filled out to advanced training.   Doesn’t that aid my point? Players go past their potential now due to advanced training? Becoming more athletic than they would in previous eras? More importantly muscle tone isn’t everything in basketball. [Just ask Joe Dumars, since you keep defending him](http://www.nola.com/pelicans/index.ssf/2014/07/joe_dumars_is_no_33_on_louisia.html)  Look at the clear size strength difference as well. You’re acting like that didn’t matter.   Dumars is not quicker than Kawhi Leonard. Dumars wasn’t some overwhelming shorter athlete. He was skilled, well rounded and tough. He would be among the least athletic SG’s in today’s game.    &gt;4 of 7 are shorter  Everyone on that list is 6’7 or higher with 3 of them being taller than LeBron. Klay, Derozen And Kawhi are 6’7. Jason Tatum is 6’8 Paul George is 6’9 and Kevin Durant is 6’11. When you’re taller you have longer limbs. Making it harder to get around them. Size matters   &gt; 4 out of those 7 are shorter, all are at least 20 lbs lighter, except Durant who’s listed as 10 pounds lighter but is a beanpole with twig arms that plays a finesse game.   There is a clear difference in strength from 180 to 215. At 230 pounds you are incredibly strong. You are somewhat equipped to handle someone that’s 250 pounds.   Especially when compared to John Starks, Reggie Miller, Craig Ehlo, And Joe Dumars, who were trying to stop someone 35 pounds heavier while not being strong or practicing contemporary weightlifting methods.  Like you said today’s players are stronger because of their training. Training Jordan’s opponents didn’t have during the same time period where Jordan’s weightlifting and morning workouts became legendary.   &gt;Help defense today is probably worse equipped to defend him in the paint than in the 80s...centers are stretch guys in general  Team defense is better today. Help defense is not worse equipped to defend LeBron because they’re allowed to double-team him off the ball. In terms of centers, Anthony Davis, Rudy Gobert, Whiteside, Demarcus Cousins, Capella, Adams, KAT, Horford. He also played against peak Dwight and KG. Peak Roy Hibbert. DPOY Ben Wallace as well as peak Tim Duncan in 04.  That’s bad rim protection to you? Stop it.   Jordan played against worse defensive players that had to guard him one on one. Jordan had a clear size, strength, athleticism advantage over the smaller unathletic 2 guards which populated most teams. You’ve argued facts and been proven wrong with data.  Your “probablys”, and estimations were wrong. Your entire argument is nostalgia based because you haven provided one piece of empirical data this entire discourse, while consistently providing wrong information that I end up disproving"
Because the warriors have Stephen Curry and Kevin fucking Durant.
"In 13-14, Durant won MVP. Best player of the regular season. He played better against the Spurs in the playoffs than LeBron did, especially when you consider defense, and took an additional game off them.  Kevin Durant was the best in the NBA that year."
Remind me again where Kevin Durant (his favorite player) went to college?
Hot Take! Kevin Durant to join the Pelicans after WCS exit
Kevin Durant is overrated.
Kevin Durant was so soft tonight. Like old Kevin Durant soft levels. What a disappointment.
"&gt; I mean, if you don’t think the Warriors didn’t get dogshit calls g3/g4 I don’t know what to say. Just a fact.  Cavs got it too. The most blatant sign of rigging was in favor of the Warriors. It was laughable they gave Draymond's 2nd technical foul to Steve Kerr when they realized they would have to boot him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8aD6OZzIdY  Lebron James and Kevin Love were called for 4 fouls each in Game 1. Kyrie Irving was called for 5 fouls in Game 3 and 4 fouls in Game 4. Love was even called for a flagrant foul on Durant after Durant yelled at the refs and told them too. *Hurr the refs helped the Warriors that's why they won*."
"So basically we're taking the Cavs championship team that shouldn't have beaten the Warriors in 2016 if not for some luck, taking away Kyrie and adding Anthony Davis.  It's a definite upgrade from a talent perspective. Davis is WAY better than Kyrie imo, so I would definitely say they have a legitimate chance to beat the Warriors.  In 2016.  Then you add Kevin Durant.  So no, the current Cavs + AD can't beat the current Warriors."
"One thing is for sure, Kevin Durant can't influence the game the way Lebron James does. James is on a different level come playoffs."
"TIL that if you're not the next Kevin Durant, you are basically a Donyell Marshall-esque player. Dude, if you actually read through that previous dude's reasoning using actual statistical metrics, maybe you'd find something more intelligent than a 'u mad bro' response.  TIL that only players with the fire that Kobe and a rare red stone had could amount to anything. I guess guys like Kawhi Leonard and Ben Simmons will never be great either.  You have an opinion? That's great. But is it informed?  I'm not even saying Ingram will be a superstar. From the 3-4 Laker games that I have seen this season, dude doesn't strike me ever as a first option on a contending team type player. Even in the future. But you are selling him WAY short, and using ridiculous, logically flawed arguments to make your case.  &gt; I promise you that   The fact that you are so sure about this for a player at 20 with incredible improvement from his rookie career just makes you look immature. "
Lol Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry exist
It's really too bad tht on the ESPN promo where they show the two stars of each team and then close on the two stars facing each other it was Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis instead of Stephen Curry and Anthony Davis like it should be
"Guys what if Donovan Mitchell real rookie's his way into beating PG13, Melo, Westbrook, CP3, Harden, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Steph Curry, and LeBron James."
"&gt; You mean, like Lebron took the last shot of game 5 this year? Or how he put up 45 points in game 7? Which part of this is he scared of?  When he passed the ball to Drew Gooden instead of taking the final shot? Or when he has pathetic 4th quarter performances but MJ was known to elevate his game in the 4th quarter?  Or when Ray Allen bailed him out? Or when Kyrie Irving bailed him out with the 3 pointer?  I will say one thing: both Lebron James and Kevin Durant were clutch in the sense they knew they could never lead a team to the Championship so they joined super teams. Remember, Lebron went to Wade not the other way around."
"No it is not a weak comparison. GSW was not disappointing, they had numerous players injured and were never supposed to be in the top 3 of the west until 2015. In Jackson's second to last year he exceeded his expected wins by +3   &gt;Did everyone on the team just suddenly....  Uh yes, players improve? Hell, look at Victor Oladipo! No one is saying ""coaching"" from Nate McMillan is the reason he is a franchise player. **Players** can improve in the off season.   In Mark Jackson's last year they were the [4th best defensive team](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2014.html) and with the addition of an up and coming DPoY and Kevin Durant, *now* they are one of the best defensive teams ever....but they were doing alright before Kerr.  Don't use logical fallacies to defend your point. Saying my arguments are ""something casuals do"" without addressing the actual argument is not a good look. I understand what you're saying about establishing a ""system,"" but I still believe it hurts your argument more than helps. There is a reason GSW brought on a crack team of assistant coaches like Gentry (who *many* players credited as establishing the defensive identity for the Kerr lead Warriors,) as well as Adams, Walton and Brown whom all brought a wealth of knowledge to the table. Kerr and the GS FO purposefully picked a bunch of experienced assistants to *help* Kerr.   Most importantly, any capable coach with a brain between his ears would *empower* MVP Steph Curry to shoot the ball. I'm not using the Walton argument against Kerr, I'm using it against *you* as it was a reason *you think* he is a great coach. "
Of course. Not only is this Warriors team better with Kevin Durant but Draymond was suspended for a game in the 2016 finals. 
"&gt; The Cavs did it against a 73 win team,  A 73 win team that nearly got eliminated by a coward (Kevin Durant).  MJ went 72-10 BTW (and won the Finals). That's way more memorable.  &gt;He came out of nowhere to block a shot that would’ve swung the momentum of game 7, which eventually led to Kyrie’s series winner.   Oh yeah and Lebron hates taking game winners. Doesn't have the mentality for it.  MJ's ""The Shot"" against the Jazz is always going to be the most famous play in history of the NBA. It was watched by 72 million people."
"Honestly, it's only LeBron, KD, and Curry at this point.  They are the true superstars of the league.  They have reached a point where they don't need to be perennial MVP winners for people to think of them as the best.  They've all proven themselves come playoffs (Curry the least of them, but he makes up for it by winning and leading the the Warriors).  Let's call them super-superstars  Harden, Kawhi, AD, Westbrook are also all probably in consideration for super-superstardom, but realistically are a half-tier down from those three.  Let's just call them regular superstars.  Harden right now has the best chance of reaching up to the top echelon, but he needs to win a championship first.  Kawhi obviously already has an FMVP, but he has never won MVP or carried a team all the way to the Finals as the primary player yet.  He was close last year, but we all know what happened.  AD is looking like that up-and-coming superstar who will eventually hit that top-3 level like LeBron, Curry, and KD.  But he also needs to win more major awards (DPOY, MVP) and/or carry his team to the finals.  The Pelicans look super legit right now, so I can see him getting close to hitting that tier similar to Harden.  He's one or two criteria away.  Westbrook made history last year with the triple double average (which he did again amazingly this year), but once again he just isn't in the limelight enough or successful enough solo to be in that super-superstar category.    I think the most important takeaway is that beyond getting DPOY or MVP, the #1 criteria for becoming a super-superstar is winning the finals and being the primary player on your team.  The #2 criteria is losing the finals and being the primary player on your team.    The key is that the Finals are by **far** the most watched part of basketball.  Super-superstars are the players that your mom knows.  They're the players that you hear about in a one-off joke from your friend who only plays videogames and doesn't even like sports.  They're the players that get referenced in every other rap song.    My mom doesn't know that Harden has quite possibly the best eurostep in the history of basketball.  She doesn't know that Kawhi was 3rd in MVP and DPOY voting last year and tragically got hurt in the WCF.  She doesn't know that AD is a really great defender and one of the best big men in the NBA who has a super diverse skillset that transfers well to his role on the Pelicans.  She doesn't know what a triple-double is.    But she knows that LeBron is ""that amazing basketball player.""  And she knows that Steph Curry is ""that smaller guy who is on the news all the time.""  And she knows that Kevin Durant is ""that one player every dislikes, right?""    That's what makes you a super-superstar.  That's what makes your transcend the NBA.  "
An unfair reality he happens to be playing the same time that   1) LeBron is in the league   2) The following players are in their prime:   a) Arguably one of the ten most impactful offensive players of the past 30 years in Steph Curry   b) A generational talent......the 2nd most hyped one(and he's lived up to all the hype) to enter the league after LeBron in Kevin Durant( Greg Oden of course only being the one more hyped than him)   c) A guy in James Harden who the past 4 years is about to win MVP was players choice for MVP(2015) and could have easily won MVP(2017)   d) When healthy arguably rhe leagues best defender and a guy who averaged 26 a game on 61TS% last year in Kawhi Leonard   Such is life.....but let's also not act like Anthony Davis is better than LeBron/Durant/Curry/Harden just yet 
" ""WC teams just don't expect to get to the Finals every year. I think the GSW added Durant because he's incredible.""  Right after losing Game 7 to Lebron, Draymond Green called up Kevin Durant to talk about him joining them.    I think it was indeed to beat Lebron directly.  And they definitely knew they would be back to the Finals. 72-10, with KD coming.  It was a lock."

"No there’s no guessing about it. Paul Pierce, Carmelo Anthony, Tracy McGrady, Kevin Durant, and Kawhi Leonard are all better than any non-Chicago Bull or people named Clyde Drexler.   Plus Jordan could hand check and for athletic freaks like Jordan who are 6’6, it’s easy as fuck to steer 6’4 Byron Scott and 6’3 Craig Ehlo. Bron actually has to move his feet.   Jordan never guarded Small Forwards because that what Pippen did. Jordan is clearly better at SG and maybe point, but LeBron has guarded better players with a harder set of rules than Jordan ever did. "
"Draymond Green and Kevin Durant. Iguodala and Thompson defended him well on switches. Love shot 38% from the field against GSW last finals.  Even more, the Warriors will punish Love defensively in a way that Indiana didn't do consistently. "
Also Carmelo. Yea this is old. He ain’t playing some random Joe’s.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2727634-lebron-james-kevin-durant-and-carmelo-anthony-play-in-star-studded-pickup-game.amp.html
"&gt; When the 6-foot-10 point guard was told the Rookie of the Year race appears to be a two-man show, he buried his head down and proceeded to chuckle. Asked what rookies have caught his attention this year, he didn't mince words. ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  "
Ah the Kevin Durant way  Wait is he a Faceless Man due to the alternate social media account(s?)
he turns into fucking kevin durant when he plays against the celtics.
Yeah could be a Kevin Durant - Iguodala situation where they overpay him because he’s a buddy. Don’t think that’s the right way to go.
Kevin Durant when played @ the 4 for Golden State and it's not even close :).
Do you seriously believe that LeBron is more of a threat to a free agent than Steph Curry and Kevin Durant and two other all-stars?
"Hmm so how is it that lebron got his first scoring title before melo did ? Lebron got his in 08 - melo got his in 2012-2013.   If melo was one of the best in the league at scoring, shouldn’t he have more scoring titles ? Kevin Durant is a better scorer than Melo imo. Durant is kind of a mix of melo and lebron. Not quite as athletically gifted as lebron but shoots better than melo and faster and more efficient. "
"&gt; 1) MJ has a 6-0 finals record because he spent so much time losing in the first and second rounds   No one is expecting someone to make the Finals every year. Everyone makes the playoffs. The Bucks made the playoffs. The Wolves made the playoffs. Making the playoffs is a piece of cake.  MJ is 100% when the rare opportunity arises. Lebron isn't even 50%.  &gt;2) The Jazz Suns and Sonics weren’t as good as the 2000s Spurs or the current Warriors. Don’t kid yourself.  I disagree. The Warriors weren't that great. They got taken to 7 games by the Thunder as a 73 win team (compare this to MJ's Bulls who just lost 3 games in their 72 win postseason run) and the Warriors were struggling against the Spurs last year til Kawhi got injured.  And Kevin Durant is almost as bad as Lebron when it comes to being a coward.  Once again, if these teams are so great why are they focused on making super teams?  And the 98 Jazz faced a Spurs team with Duncan and beat them in 5 games.  &gt;3) He walked away from a super team. He had arguably the best defender of all time (Scottie Pippin) and another all time great (Dennis Rodman). He chose to walk away from that for no reason.  Uh what? Pippen didn't resign with the Bulls, and Jackson was going to leave. That run was over.  &gt;4) You’re telling me players should never switch team? Ever? That’s some awful logic there. Also, like I said before, MJ bailed on a super team TWICE! Why does that make him the GOAT but it disqualifies Lebron?  Because Lebron left when things got too tough.  MJ left after winning Championships. Lebron quit when he'd get his ass kicked. It's a clear difference.  If Lebron doesn't join the Heat, does he win a ring? Nope.  &gt;If he left every time the going got too tough, he wouldn’t have been in Cleveland this year. Or last year.  Some people are going to say he will leave.  But he left when the Celtics owned him in 2010 and the Heat owned him in 2014.  &gt;5) LEBRON IS A CHEAT CODE!  If he is then why do they always have to bring another superstar? If Lebron is good enough, why also get Bosh and then get Love?  Lebron got killed by the Spurs, so what does he do? He joins a new super team with the Cavs.  &gt;6) You know goddamn well that MJs ego was the reason he came back.  No he partly owned the Washington Wizards and since he's a ratings god he played to help them."
Are you talking about THE Kevin Durant!?
Kevin Durant like Lebron is a coward and should be remembered as such.
Magic Johnson \- Kobe Bryant \- Kevin Durant \- LeBron James \- Kareem   these guys will put up a challenge
"&gt; One of Jordan’s team was a super team for sure!  Jordan didn't quit the Bulls to join another team.  &gt;it’s better to be 3-5 in the FINALS than 0-0.  Lebron James took the easy way out and he's STILL only 3-5.  Imagine if a guy got destroyed on Madden, but was then able to put everyone's stats up to 99 but STILL went only 3-5 playing another person.  See how said that is?  &gt;A lot of players don’t get that opportunity.   Yeah but when most do, it's because they earned it through blood and sweat.  Lebron didn't earn it.  Kevin Durant didn't earn it."
&gt;  It's 2018 and people still think this way? LMFAOOOOOOOO  It's even worse. What Kevin Durant did was almost as bad as what Lebron James did.  Young people don't remember a time when players in the NBA wanted to compete. Now a days players take the easy way out when things don't go their way.  What Kevin Durant and Lebron James did was put in cheat codes because they couldn't win.
"Replace Dirk with Kevin Durant and then yes, it is the best offensive lineup of all time no doubt. "
"&gt; First of all he did that once , and he left his team and guess what   He did it to the Heat too remember?  &gt;then he actually came back and they because a finals team.  He had them get Love too and only went back because Kyrie was there.  &gt;You’re going way too far back and you are blinded by this super team you mentioned, but what happened after?  Kevin Durant is another punk. Goes to join a 73 win team?  I feel bad for this generation who grows up not seeing competitors compete. Back during the NBA on NBC (and CBS) era we saw teams that hated each other. When MJ kept getting killed by the Pistons all he did was swear to get better. Now what happens is they go and form super teams."
&gt;He puts in work and finds a way.   What? Anytime things get too tough he bounces and forms another super team. He's worse than Kevin Durant in that respect.  &gt;Imagine Lebron had a golden state type team around him ?  He had a 29 year old Wade and a 27 year old Bosh and the Mavericks whooped them.  I would've been more impressed with Lebron if he stuck with the Cavs OR if he didn't form a super team like he did.
"&gt; That's such a stupid way to evaluate greatness.  Greatness isn't about forming super teams because you lose badly. Greatness is about getting better and then making a comeback.  Lebron and Kevin Durant couldn't hack it in the 80s and 90s. They aren't competitors.  &gt;Move on from blind nostalgia,  I know you're young, but this era of the NBA is one of the weakest. Too many super teams."
"&gt; Lmao  NBA players just aren't competitors anymore. When things get too tough, players form super teams.  Kevin Durant and Lebon James will never reach the height of players in the past."
It might be a gentleman's sweep.  Especially if Kevin Love going off coincides with Klay or Draymond going off (assuming Durant and Steph perform even remotely comparable to what they did last year)
"the defence of michael jordan as the GOAT is so fatally flawed. so what he went 6 for 6 in the finals. I dont care  Lebron is the coach, lebron is all 5 positions and lebron is other-worldly. Do you remember the finals of 15 when he willed his team through those battles against golden state. no kyrie no klove. Do you remember what he did in the finals of 16. Kevin Durant forever took a shtstain on history by joining those golden state as I bet alot more people would be excited for a potential gsw-cle finals match-up. What about when he took the cavs to the finals in his 4th professional season. Harden is lax on defense and has a pick and roll with capela. lebron was the MVP this year.  EDIT: (It will be robbery again when they give harden the mvp) Lebron got robbed of the MVP a few years especially the year rose won it. his court vision, strength, speed its unparalleled. Lebron is truly the goat.   Anyways to my fellow raptors fans: Tough pill to swallow but the switch d doesnt match up well against Cleveland plain and simple. Ujiri has been outstanding in assembling this roster. Casey needs the axe, their is no reason c.j miles should ever be gaurding a hot Klove. I know ibaka was a liability but we should have slotted siakam or poetel in there. Too much questionable decision making in playoffs past. Jealous of stevens system, popovic. As the raptors are a team where the whole is more important than the individual we need a coach who reinforces that culture. Derozan has been decent but takes too many questionable playoff shots. Whilst his passing and team play has improved if we dont want to get swept we need to have derozan take less dash ups and potentially bench Ibaka rest of series.  rant over"
"Warriors would be worse and Cavs would be better. Trust me. Lebrons bully iso ball would fuck up Kerrs motion offense and would turn Curry and Klay into spot up shooters and Draymonds role would be diminished. KD is literally a perfect fit for the Warriors. The Warriors offense would not be as prolific unless it continues to run through The Splash Brothers, but I doubt that Lebron would accept that.   Lebron would not be a good fit for the Golden State organization because it’s bigger than just one guy.  Of course Curry’s the GSW MVp, but Draymond, Klay, Iguodala are just as important for the rise of the Warriors.     If Kd was on the Cavs , Isaiah Thomas would not have been traded because Kd doesn’t need to handle the ball all the time anyways unlike Lebron and Kd would have been ok with Isaiah being the primary ball handler... Isaiah, Kd and Klove would average 70-75 ppg... a lineup of Thomas, JR Smith , Kevin Durant , Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson ... would easily win the East and possibly championship. Kevin Love wouldn’t be starting at center because Lebron needs Klove for spacing due to his bully ball drives and Tristan obviously take away from that.  "
"Both teams get worse.   KD can fill in the scoring role that Lebron does, but not the playmaking, so the Cavs offense collapses.   Meanwhile GS would have diminishing returns in terms of playmaking with Lebron, Steph, and Draymond.  Subbing Lebron for KD means Steph and Klay are our only knockdown 3pt threats unless Lebron is feeling hot.  It also noticeably downgrades our defense and removes our primary rim protector.  Last but not least, I don’t think Lebron is a good culture or system fit for the Warriors, and I wouldn’t wanna take a chance mucking up the most successful system in basketball history by bringing in a player who basically takes over your team on and off the court.   Edit: I don’t know why everyone is downvoting me so hard, just for sharing my opinion on the topic at hand.  I don’t think it’s ridiculous to suggest that even though Lebron is a better player, he might be a worse fit for the team than Kevin Durant who himself is a top 3 player and who fits our team perfectly.  "
"East coast doing impressive competitive stuff.  Celtics winning without their all stars, lebron winning without help.  Than you look at kevin the coward durant winning with the help of a 73 win team."
 Oh Yea they had Kevin Durant that  year I forgot.  And oh yea you still have Kyrie Irving.  Sorry my memory is bad.   Ill bet you $200 that Warriors beat Cavs in the finals. DM me your venom if your about it.
Durant would lose to the Pacers in the 1st round with just kevin love.
"For sure. Kevin Durant was the beneficiary of Stephen Curry's gravity, which provided Durant with tons of open looks and single coverage. To add onto that, Curry had an all time great playoffs himself, which really opened things up for Durant to have it easy."
I feel sad the Kevin Durant paid 7 million dollars for this ring and ruined the season. 
"Kevin Durant + 7'2"" = Embiid  What a beast"
"Nba being rigged? Maybe it is, maybe it isnt. But i dont understand why youre so confidently  against even a little bit of unjustified influence by the league through referees, or even the refs themselves.   And the Rondo thing. I feel like youre not even reading what im writing. Aside from knowing the rules word for word,he plays the game. He gets certain calls, he sees certain calls being made others. One would expect the same calls to be made for him during the playoffs. Kevin Durant didnt regain possession immediately. As I said, Rondo had a firm grasp for about 2 seconds before letting go because he felt the call should have been made already. He probably should have kept goin after it, but in any other game you would have seen the jump ball called.  You seem very resolute in your beliefs and I respect that. But that makes it pretty pointless for me to keep replying. Good luck to whoever youre goin for in the playoffs. But really hoping its not another cavs  vs warriors. Be easy bud, i appreciated this convo. 👌"
Fuck that. LeBron needs to beat Kevin Durant again. He's the only guy in the east who has a chance.
the celtics wish with all their hearts that they could sign kevin durant. get the fuck outta here with that nonsense
"But that's exactly why Kevin Durant or Anthony Davis are considered to be great. Because they have the height advantage and still can play like guards. With the right switches, they are matched against defenders that are smaller, and can easily bump them, and shoot over them.  Edit: when it comes to a physical sport, any advantage of weight and height is important. See Boxing. When you get a taller boxer you immediately know that he has an arm length advantage for jabbing."
"Yes, it does have a salary cap problem, it needs to be done away with so the Knicks could transform into the Yankees.   Your 2018-2019 NY Knicks:  PG: Chris Paul SG: Tyreke Evans SF: Kevin Durant PF: Lebron James C: Demarcus Cousins"
"It's a title for what he means as the ambassador for the organization, but having a title doesn't mean anything as far as him being paid or not.   [This](http://www.complex.com/sports/2016/02/drake-raptors-partnership) Complex article from 2016 goes into the details a bit more on the agreement:  &gt;Leiweke admits that Drake’s role as Global Ambassador is loosely defined. The rapper isn’t obligated to attend Raptors games exclusively—and doesn’t. It isn’t his job to woo free agents either—although Leiweke says, “When a player is making a visit and he’s a free agent, obviously Masai will rely on Drake at the right time.” Instead, Drake and Ujiri define his role on an as-needed basis. “We didn’t have a sculpted definition on purpose,” Leiweke says. “[Drake] has his own life and his own career. And he always thought the team was better run by Masai than him.  &gt;When asked why this is, he simply says it’s to ensure that the Raptors and MLSE follow the NBA’s anti-tampering rules. “Yeah. We don’t tamper. We stay out of that,” he says bluntly. It’s also why, he adds, Drake isn’t paid.   &gt;The NBA’s anti-tampering rule is written to apply to both employees and representatives of NBA teams, and is intentionally broad in order to give the league discretion in its enforcement. If Drake, the Raptors’ Global Ambassador, isn’t considered a “representative,” then he’s exempt from Article 35A—Misconduct of Persons Other than Players—subsection (f).   &gt;“It’s likely that the Raptors structured Drake’s role with the team as loosely as possible in order to avoid the league and other teams considering him to be a team representative,” explains Jacob Cohen, managing partner at athlete representation firm Ascension Athletes, LLC. But the NBA determined in 2014 that Drake’s role as Global Ambassador subjected him to the anti-tampering rule. That August, the Raptors were fined $25,000 after Drake made comments about Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant at his annual OVO Fest concert.   &gt;“Unless anything has changed since that time in terms of the league’s policy or Drake’s role with the Raptors, the NBA would disagree with the assertion that Drake is not subject to league rules due to his unpaid and loosely-defined role,” says Cohen, before adding that the anti-tampering rule is often enforced by virtue of another team lodging a complaint with the league. “While the Commissioner is permitted to commence an anti-tampering investigation at his own discretion, it is more common for the league to wait until a complaint has been filed before conducting an investigation to the issue.”   &gt;In an article published on Aug. 12, 2014, The Globe and Mail’s Kelly wrote: “The NBA offered to drop the tampering fine if the team agreed to strip Drake of his title. The Raptors apparently refused.” He speculated that someone contacted the league, “likely Thunder owner Clayton Bennett.” The Thunder declined to comment. "
"The only people really paying this topic any mind are those that benefit from views and clickbait.  Anyone with half a brain realizes that we won't know which team made out better (or if they basically broke even, but got their preferred guy) for at least a few years.    Not only is a one season sample size way too small to judge a career trajectory, but one of the players was only healthy for 1/8 of the season.  We also have no clue what the Sac pick will turn into.  It could be a lotto pick, but Sac could also improve unexpectedly (Indiana/Utah), it could be a complete bust, or Philly even has a slight chance of keeping it and passing on their own 1st next year.    At the end of the day, Boston got their guy and so did Philly.  Unless the careers of these two players end up dramatically different or the next Kevin Durant is snagged with the Sac pick, it probably won't make a difference in the long run.  In any case, we're probably another 3-4 years away from even being able to have an educated opinion on this."
Kevin Durant is the goat

He's averaging more points per game on better efficiency than Kevin Durant did in his rookie year.

"&gt;The issue for any CP3 team is not scoring offensively in crunchtime of playoff games at all.

I'll do you one better.  Imagine Kevin Durant next to Curry.
I've been a Cavs supporter in the last 3 finals and last year was probably the one that was most obviously rigged..  but when you have a 73-9 team and add Kevin Durant to it you can still win a series in 5 with the refs against you.
Tbf to Chuck he also snagged Kevin Durant in the late rounds and that pick has aged like a fine wine
The Thunder never picked Kevin Durant tho :\(
I like Devin Durant more. It sounds special. Or maybe Kevin Dooker.
Devin Durant or Kevin Booker?  🤔
"Alright, now if any if those teams were a 73-9 team, add Kevin Durant to that and you got the warriors"
"YES YES YES. AND he said “if you don’t like it, don’t watch it.” The NBA’s second biggest star said that. I know opinions on this sub are mixed on Mike Korzemba, but this gives some really good insight into how fucked up what Kevin Durant did really is: https://youtu.be/zub0fmBxVCU"
"A lot easier than developing the 32nd, 33rd, and 34th overall pics, though, isn't it? I just am not sure we should be crediting the thunder so much for this. Wow, they knew to pick Kevin Durant. Such insight! If anything, I think they should be criticized for letting all that talent escape for so little."
"Why do people hate Kevin Durant? Larry Bird had alternate Twitter accounts too, but nobody seemed to care."
"Yes, of course. Too many K's. Imagine that, mixing Devin Booker with Kevin Durant. That's a monster scorer right there."
"Yes, but Kyrie was also extremely young and he didn't have enough of a team. When Lebron returned, he also brought another big star in Kevin Love. People talk like the only difference between those two rosters was Lebron. Kyrie didn't really have help in his first few years, but everybody could see his potential.  To me Kyrie is like Devin Booker. Everybody can see he is a beast, but has no help. What happens if next year you put Booker together with Anthony Davis, and Kevin Durant? Maybe they reach the finals, I don't know.  *Kevin to Devin."
Kevin Durant to whoever wins the title
"Yeah for all of us here who want awesome deep dive stuff, there's millions more who just want the hot takes.   Just the other day I'm talking with a guy who plays rec league basketball and knows a bunch about the sport and he said he hated the move Kevin Durant did because the Warriors signed him. Okay sure, I honestly agree with that. But then he says ""see with Jordan it's alright because the Bulls traded for him"". I think we really underestimate how unknowledgeable a large majority of people are when it comes to NBA stuff. They love hearing the same regurgitated takes every day because in order to listen to anything else they'd have to have so much more knowledge that they just don't have "
In all honesty we need a stretch 4. A lot of Jazz fans really wanted Mirotic and you can see how much better he has made the New Orleans offense. Obviously if we got a Kevin Durant that would be the absolute best case scenario but that aint happening! I would really like to see Kevin Love in the Jazz system. I think he could thrive again. 
Kevin Durant would be nice.
"At the end of the day it's popularity and how that translates to shoes and merchandise sales. All those guys are on a different level than Kawhi and anyone else in Jordan brand. [Here are the numbers from this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/06/09/the-nbas-biggest-shoe-deals/#6e667b081520):  1. Michael Jordan: $110 million, Nike (Jordan)  2. LeBron James: $32 million, Nike  3. Kevin Durant: $25 million, Nike  4. Kobe Bryant: $16 million, Nike  5. James Harden: $14 million, Adidas  6. Stephen Curry: $12 million, Under Armour  7. Derrick Rose: $11 million, Adidas  8. Damian Lillard: $10 million, Adidas  9. Dwyane Wade: $8 million, Li-Ning  10. Kyrie Irving: $8 million, Nike  11. Paul George: $5.5 million, Nike  12. Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony: $5 million each, Nike (Jordan)  Some of these are outdated (like Westbrook who signed a big deal last summer) and are pretty old contracts so they may not be great comparison numbers but I would say he's somewhere in the Lillard to PG range as far as marketability goes. He's getting offered PG money essentially (4yr/$22m). I think he COULD get more but he'd likely have to get away from Nike."
"I'd take Stevens in the top 10 for the reason that if you want to win a championship in the modern NBA, one star player isn't enough. You need a guy, whether coach or player, who will be able to surround themselves with more star talent, possibly 2-4 stars. LeBron can do that, Steph can do that, AD can do that, Harden can do that and that's why all of their teams are still in the playoffs.   Brad Stevens has attracted as much talent as any of those guys since he entered the league, drawing Horford and Hayward in free agency, getting Kyrie to refuse to re-sign anywhere else once he learned he could get to Boston, plus getting meetings with Kevin Durant and getting CP3 to say on his video documentary that Boston was his 2nd choice behind Houston.  That's the real key to success in the NBA, and Brad Stevens seemingly commands so much respect around the Association that it would be easier to build a title contender by progressively adding talents drawn to Stevens than to grab one star player and then attempt to build around them with an organization that's not as respected."
"&gt; Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant receives in the neighborhood of more than $20 million annually from Nike as well, through a combination of the annual base salary of his shoe deal, sales royalties, and several incentive bonuses. Stephen Curry's Under Armour deal (more than $17 million annually), and James Harden's contract with Adidas (more than $15 million) make up the next tier of earners.  &gt; By comparison, Blake Griffin earns a similar annual figure from Jordan Brand to what Leonard was offered, while signature athletes such as Kyrie Irving, Paul George and Damian Lillard each earn more.   Performance on the court doesn’t necessarily equate to shoe sales and endorsement numbers. Kawhi needs to get out of his shell if he wants to compete with KD, Curry, Harden"

Kevin Durant.                 /s
I can see him as the starting center on the Wizards or the Raptors or Trailblazers more than a power forward on the Rockets or the Thunder or Heat or Sixers.  It may be too late in his career for him to have a team built around him as point forward #1 option on offense but maybe he can find a fit like the above.  Definitely not as good a shooter as he needs to be which is why I think he can get away with playing center over stretch four.  Kevin Love is a tremendous rebounding stretch four who gets away with playing center mainly because the Cavs have Lebron to play a similar role as permiter power forward in the modern NBA.  This was also meant as a commentary on the league overall and guys like Lebron James starting as small forwards and becoming power forwards or Kevin Durant starting as small forwards and becoming stretch fours and backup centers and the league kind of passing Blake by (along with Drummond and other dinosaur big men of yesteryear) since he (they) never developed a reliable enough post game to dominate the smaller sizes at their positions so they go into a heavier weight class to try to use their speed and skills to overcome bigger players.

"Yes, Curry did mostly carry. That’s also why I think he’ll be ranked higher than Westbrook when it comes down to the end of their careers. Curry has proven that he can carry a team to the finals and win them. Westbrook has not, even when he had Kevin Durant as a sidekick. "
Kevin Durant  You take him away from the warriors roster and the warriors have one less weapon.  LeBron and Durant would be a big problem for the dubs
"I just averaged the top 50 players in terms of aggregate distance and found their per 48 miles ran. Looks like the average is around 3.5 miles run per 48  Lebron runs 3.1 miles per 48, significantly below the average. Among players who ran more than 2.28 miles per game \(aka the top 50 on [this page](https://stats.nba.com/players/speed-distance/?sort=DIST_MILES&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)\) Lebron was dead last in miles per 48 \(followed by Anthony Davis, Andrew Wiggins, and Kevin Durant\)."
"Lmaooooo Kevin love and Chris Bosh are superstars now? Kyrie couldn’t even make the playoffs in this “much weaker” east, yet you’re claiming he was already this bonafied superstar? And Kevin love couldn’t even make the playoffs in his 7 years prior to Cleveland. And now LeBron has no superstar and looks like he’s about to make the finals again after all year people were saying he was getting knocked out because of the Celtics, sixers, and raptors. But let me guess, since LeBron is making it look so easy, I’m sure the eAsT iS wEaK narrative is back. Keep making excuses man. Durant has to join a 73-won former champion who he choked too just the year prior. A team that already has a back to back and first ever unanimous mvp.  He could’ve gone to the east too since it’s so weak but he chose the team that embrassed him and had already won without him. Kevin Durant didn’t form a superteam... he joined an already established superteam.   Trying to say both situations are the same is ridiculous, I agree. "
There is a dirty secret of the modern NBA that very few people know. Jerry West knew it though.  Blake Griffin is a center in this current incarnation of the NBA.  It's weird that it has shifted so much but I do not believe you can play Blake with a traditional NBA center in the NBA and he is much more like a Kevin Love-type center than a Kevin Durant/Dirk Nowitski type Power Forward.

Hilarious. Kevin Durant.   Westbrook as option 1 has done what?  
if he’s a foreign player the suns might pick him top 5. I heard people are calling him “The Zimbabwean Kevin Durant”
Dirk Nowitzki=Kevin Durant confirmed
I mean you could break it down that simply for almost any player. The key to being Kevin Durant is a high release point and an ability to shoot. 
"Trust me, Im Kevin Durant and it works"
Kevin Durant was 100% the best player in the world during his MVP season.  The problem was the Westbrook thought *he* was the best player in the world against the Spurs in the playoffs.  
"When CP3 was a Clipper, I hated that obnoxious ass. Weird thing, now all of a sudden I love him. I'm sure if OKC had a competent front office who wasn't susceptible to Morey-wan-Kenobi's mind tricekry and Harden still played for OKC, I would hate him too. But guess what, for some odd reason that I can't figure out, I love Harden!!   Harden is the perfect offensive player for the social media age. He doesn't just rent space in everyone's head. he buys up every available plot of neural real estate. He uses his insane skill set to bate and for some reason,  otherwise talented and intelligent NBA players can't refuse the bait. Guys get frustrated and try to get even tighter on him, but that just plays right into his game. James loves the contact. If you watch, he'll wait for a defender to get their body on him and as soon as he feels that contact, he'll make a move because his footwork and first step are so quick, no one can stay with him. If a defender plays off of him, he can hit a 3 from pretty much anywhere. Defenses have to play him tight then rotate to perfection when he drives by cutting off the lane and perimeter guys have to maintain discipline and stay with the shooters perched on the 3 point line. This is what San Antonio did last year and its what Golden State is going to do in the next round. CP3 makes it tougher to do that now, but its why I think Golden State will still win that series. The Spurs (the Celtics do it too, but the you don't see it enough because the Rockets and Celtics don't play enough for it to stand out) are the only team with the defensive discipline to pull this off and Golden State is the only team with the depth of defensive talent to do it.   In the case of this foul, Exum was beat. As soon as James got the step on him, he needed to seal off the left side to protect against a euro step back to the left side of the rim, Favors needs to be quicker and get in front of Harden, and Jerebko needs to slide down and get between Nene and the basket to guard against the lob. Utah actually did this pretty well last night and shut down several Harden lob attempts. But instead, Exum keeps trying to get in front of Harden and everyone else on the Jazz just kinda shuffle around and watch him take a ball to the face.   THe NBA added goal tending and widened the lane because of George Mikan and widened it again because of Wilt. They added the Jordan iso-ball rule in the 80s. R/NBA darling Kevin Durant was the original master of the rip through and forced the league to implement a rule change. Shaq and illegal defense too. Every so often players come along who are so physically superior or possess a certain skill set that takes advantage of existing rules and the league adapts to it.   If any of you are old bucks around here, I'm sure you remember the hatred for MJ in the 80s by the old guard. Could you imagine Lakers and Celtics fans if Reddit existed in the late 80s? You think Harden hate is bad, the MJ hate would have buried Reddit under a mountain of salt. Bob Cousy on the iso rule:  ''Coaches with mediocre teams, who felt they were unable to compete in the five-man game, would isolate two or three of their best players and let them play schoolyard basketball on one side of the floor,'' Cousy said. ''I guess some people are calling it the Jordan Rule because when you think of one-on-one basketball, his name immediately comes to mind.""  You guys would be hating on the king GOAT 30 years ago too, so I'm not mad. Actually its an honor for Harden to be getting so much hate and a testament to how transcendent his skill set is. Doesn't mean I wouldn't be hating it too if he were still a Thunder. Go ahead, I'm ready for the ""if transcendent means he flops and runs over defenders spite"" and whatever else y'all want to bring to the table, like I said, its a compliment.  "
"This is a non-story, Kevin Durant is the best scorer in the league, Draymond can text him whatever he wants or give him the silent treatment and it wouldn’t matter."
"Ummm hold up, that season Kevin Durant went down, Westbrook tried his heart out to get the fuckin 8th seed, he tied the record with the pelicans but was ultimately beat out by head to head, do you know who the back up for Kevin Durant was at that time? It was Kyle singler lmao a bench player at best was now forced to be a starter obviously you can’t replace Kevin Durant but even a fading role player would’ve been better than Kyle singler. This was also a team built around KD at the time, and serge was also dealing with injury issues as well as WB here and there. "
"In a league gradually trending towards the 3-ball, Kevin durant has been dominating from the midrange. High difficulty of shots on stupid efficiency. His 3 point shot hasn't been there this post season (a disappointing 28%). Just goes to show just how much weapons this man has in his arsenal."
"LeBron, Kevin Love, Kyrie, Al Horford, Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall, Bradley Beal,  Giannis, Kemba Walker, Embiid, Blake Griffin, Drummond, Oladipo, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Steven Adams, Paul George, LaMarcus Aldridge, Chris Paul, James Harden, Karl Anthony-Towns, Jimmy Butler, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Rudy Gobert, Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Devin Booker.   That's over 30+ definitively better right here and I could list 15 more that would be controversial."
"If I was running the Warriors, I wouldn't do it.  I know our ownership has their eye on AD.  He's younger, taller, longer, can score all over the floor and is one hell of a good rim protector.  The thing is, I think we already have ""that guy"" in Kevin Durant.   Now, most people are saying, ""the only thing better than one KD is two KDs"" but there's very big diminishing returns with duplicate skill sets.  A team needs balance.  This team's success has not come on the back's of pure, unstoppable scoring (like what KD or Curry provides).  It has actually be the result of playing exceptionally aggressive and fluid defense (which leads to very easy transition points and rapid runs that destroy the opposition.)  This team routinely generates good offense *as a result of* good defense.  Draymond's defense, hustle, passing, playmaking, and leadership are just as important as the scoring provided by KD or Curry.   Klay Thompson is the rare sidekick who provides BOTH defense and unstoppable scoring just when you need it most.  Replace Draymond with AD, and take away Klay.  Who plays SG?  Who defends the other team's guards?   The Warriors are thin at Guard and woefully unprepared for a life without Klay.  Without Draymond, if Curry wants to play off-ball and run off screens to get open, can AD facilitate like Green does?  Can anyone not named West do a decent job?  Who directs the defense?  Who really leads this team?   Curry is a soft-spoken nice guy.  KD is a soft-spoken salty guy.  AD, as the new guy, isn't going to step on anyone's toes.    Green is the heart and soul of the Warriors and the one guy most responsible for their championship level effort.  He pushes buttons, especially Durant's.  He's the one guy who seems to be able to motivate and focus Durant.  Both Curry and KD have trouble giving consistently excellent effort at times.   Oddly enough, Klay never does.  Would kill us to lose that guy nearly as much as it would hurt to lose Draymond Green."
Prime Blake and Deandre can't even make the playoffs without him. Don't even compare that to playing with Kevin Durant.
"""If LeBron manages to come back from 3-1 he's the GOAT""  ""Actually nah beating the 73 Warriors and the greatest finals comeback of all time isn't that impressive, I'd like to see him do it without Kyrie and with Kevin Durant on the 73 win team, then he'd be the GOAT."""
"Harden is a great player in almost every aspect of the game.      He's also great at ""manufacturing fouls"" and does it a **ton**.

"I see you positing this a lot over the year or so. I my memory tells me right; Kawhi was primarily on Westbrook till game 6 and much of game 6 if that (until the 4th quarter I believe, have to check the tape though). And Roberson was on Kawhi primarily until the 4th.   In fact even in the '14 series he was Westbrooks primary defender, Green always (save a few but we'll get to that soon) took KD because you can live with KD getting his 27-31 points, its predictable, he never really strays far from it where as WB was always the focal point for the offence in stopping OKC until Kanter and Adams became a thing.   Iirc there's only been 3 games since '15 where Kawhi was indeed KD's primary defender for the majority of the game not a half or so.

And for (a coming into his own offensively) Kawhi - 31 pts on .495 shooting. 3 games sample size but you can see the obvious better performer.   And for that series in '16 by the time he was switched onto KD, he was too tired trying to will the team to a win on offense still let alone Durant going nuclear in the playoffs for once in game 7. Same thing happened in '15 when he had to chase Reddick around putting up great numbers until game 4. I wrote about this awhile ago.   &gt; Redick first 3 games Redick had 11ppg on 31% with 32 shots (overall).  &gt; Kawhi first 4 games 25/6.5/3/2/1 on 60fg% and 56 3P%.  &gt; Kawhi was dominant on both ends and just going crazy with his shots. Kawhi was hounding him like a dog and had him locked down but by game 4-5 he was just done, Pop should've taken him off him at that point because then Redick got open and spaced it out and bombed away. Then Kawhi was completely gassed for the series.  &gt; Redick last 3 games 16ppg 56% on 34 shots (overall).  &gt; Kawhi last 3 games 14/9/2/0/0 per game on 30FG% and 20 3P%.  Reddick ran him out of the building. Westbrook did too later on. That's a fault on his conditioning something I've worried about in the past, he's an incredible defender but his motor doesn't last long enough or the guy simply runs out of fuel in a few series so far to me and match-ups but your comparison is disingenuous to this discussion considering the realities of context.   edit: changed a 7 to a 6 because i'm stupid."
"in 1994, Hakeem beat 12 All Stars in their prime on his way to the title (Drexler, Cliff Robinson, Porter, Barkley, K. Johnson, Majerle, Malone, Stockton, Hornacek, Ewing, Oakley, Sparks). His 2nd option was Vernon Maxwell, who averaged 13.6/3.1/5.1 48.3 TS% in the RS and 13.8/3.5/4.2 47.1 TS% in the playoffs      And according to r/NBA, in 2016 Kevin Durant managed to ruin the entire sport of professional basketball "
"I think it's safe to say the Golden State Warriors are the 2018 NBA Champions. Congratulations Dub Nation. Congratulations Kevin Durant, another well deserved FMVP! We are all amazed!"
"Since he didn't have Kevin Durant by his side, he had to carry the team and put more impressive numbers. Now that KD is there, he doesn't need to put those insane numbers. It's a simple explanation.  It's the same reason for Lebron's numbers this postseason. Before he had Kyrie to ease the load, now he has to have 38-point games regularly if the Cavs have any chance of winning a game."
ESPN: Is Kevin Durant using height enhancements? 
Kevin Durant nods
"Even if he loses again to that team, it’s not a knock on him.  If they win a game against them it makes Golden State look bad.  The Cavs are much worse than they were last year and the Warriors got better.  Everyone knows what will happen.    Also, GS dropped a game to the Cousins-less Pelicans.  That’s sad.    I hated the NBA when the Heat superteam existed (also I’m a fair person and will say that that team had ZERO business losing twice in the Finals.   The perfect comeback to your pointless comment is “73-9”.  We all knew LeBron didn’t have a chance that year, and he did it.  Adding Kevin Durant to that team just makes it not fun.  No one is going to beat that team without injuries and this dumb discussion doesn’t take away from what LeBron James is doing, after 8 straight NBA Finals runs, 82 GP this year, when most players at his age are in decline.    Kevin Durant is a bitch for joining an already insanely good team, and winning again won’t change that - if the Warriors lose it’ll just be sad, if they win it’s just “oh well, of course they did, they have a fucking ridiculous team”.  Scoffing at what LeBron is doing because they’ll lose to Golden State is the worst but still technically current hot take I’ve ever seen, though. "
"&gt; Dwight, like Lebron and Kevin Durant (and even Curry), is mentally weak. It's something new with this generation.  Does that include things like spending millions of dollars keeping his body in tip top shape in his 13th year, or spending the offseason doing yardwork for your parents and fucking up your back?  Or having a breakdown midcareer and 'retiring'?"
Lol the fucking jokes. Draymond Green and the Warriors were well hated before Kevin Durant. The loved GS teams were the Mark Jackson Warriors where Steph was just a budding star snubbed from the All Star game.
"Or we could just look at the full series they played vs each other the year before.

&gt; Would you rather the Warriors get another 5 free rings with zero competition?  You know why that could happen? Because of Kevin Durant quitting the Thunder to join that team.  There's no competition in this era of NBA and it sickens me. Where are the players who want to compete?  &gt;We need another major superteam to compete with the Warriors.  It's why I am rooting for the Rockets. They built a great team (I am holding off calling them Championship caliber for a bit though) the RIGHT way.
"The coach of the Golden State Warriors removed the basketball player, Kevin Durant (son of Wanda Durant), from playing in a game because said player reached a threshold of 38 individual points. In previous contests where Kevin Durant (professional basketball player) scored over 38 points, his team (Golden State Warriors) has gone on to lose against the opposing team. The opposing team may vary."
"Boston is the obvious choice as I'm sure he was told they would trade in their assets to get him another all star if he jumped on. And the amusing thing is that the league would probably be even more fucked than it is with him in Golden State if you replace Gordon Hayward with Kevin Durant. As a matter of fact, I think it's almost a guarantee they would have outbid NO for Boogie last year since they would have been gunning for a title with Durant at the deadline and probably won the title last year too    IT/Rozier     Bradley/Smart   Durant/Brown   Horford/Crowder   Cousins/Olynyk     I'm pretty sure that team would have won it all rather easily. And now you would have    Irving/Rozier   Brown/Smart    Durant/Tatum     Horford/Morris   Cousins/Baynes      Ya, good luck  "

"&gt; MJ likewise was bad in the 96 finals,   Lol he wasn't ""bad."" He didn't perform as great because of Gary and the Sonics matching up well, but he wasn't even close to bad.  &gt;and was saved by Kerr's shot  He wasn't ""saved"" by Kerr's shot. See, that play was *designed* for Kerr to take the final shot. Michael passed it to him who was open.  The Ray Allen shot was all Bosh and Allen. Lebron missed his three (typical) so Ray had to bail him out.  &gt;Similarly the killer instinct of John Paxon bails Jordan out in Game 6 the 93 finals and it's Horace Grant with the killer instinct clutch block on Johnson to seal the championship  Lol what? It was Michael Jordan who scored 9 of the Bulls 12 points that quarter, and it was his play at the end that helped Paxson be so open. Once again, a designed play (though to be fair, it wasn't meant for Paxson).  Compare this to Scottie Pippen who SAT OUT OF A GAME WINNING SHOT because it wasn't designed for him but Kukoc.  &gt;Westbrook has this non-stop chucking mentality too but he's doesn't have a great coach and great teammates anymore to bail him out.  MJ never chucked like Westbrook did. I can tell you're a teenager for comparing MJ to Westbrook.  &gt;I have no doubt MJ and Kobe were lucky to play for Phil Jackson.  Phil Jackson never coached before coaching for the Bulls. He wasn't some great super powered coach that came to Chicago.  What Kevin Durant and Lebron James is so mentally weak it's laughable.  Kevin Durant going to a 73 win team is so embarrassing it's a parody."
"I would, they will 100% become better players than the young allstars from my teens. They're just as good as almost any of the All stars from MJs era at the same age, but surpass nearly all of them in athletic ability. I would also take almost any of todays all-stars in their prime over late 80s/early 90s allstars in their prime. The game has evolved and even the average player is MUCH better than decades ago. The skill floor and ceiling raises little by little every year and more is expected out of average players. The NBA is also much larger and more athletic as a whole. The average gets better, the majority of this is due to the freak athleticism, and strictly % of the population that plays. A much larger player pool generally gives you a better selection of talent. That's just how it goes. I'm sure someone will come after LeBron and be just as good if not better, eventually. It's pretty much inevitable. The game evolves and standards are raised. I'd much rather play now, rather than 20 years from now, and in the 1950s over the 80s and so on. You'd be a comparatively better player and stand out amongst your peers, despite you being the same player, just in a different era.   I like you how want to compare things that you can't compare like: touch and balance. This is your opinion, nothing that you can objectively compare, at all. Then you use an ""experiment"" that has nearly infinite variables, while providing no statistical improvement. Lebron averages more assists. That's the end of the argument, you can't even argue anything else as its mere opinion backed by precisely 0 fact.   LeBron has always been a pass-first player, what are you talking about? He only goes in scoring mode during playoffs and when his team is absolutely underperforming. Yes, he attacks the basket, but is always looking for passes for better looks from his teammates for higher percentage shots, dude has an insanely high basketball IQ. Go break down just one of LBJs games, he dissects the defense with complete ease and almost always gets the best possession possible out of his team (despite his team being shit a lot of the time and missing nearly everything). He never just puts his head down and scores possession after possession as MJ did, that's just not how he plays. Not even close to the same playstyle. It's like comparing Magic and MJ. LBJ provides so much for his team in terms of spacing, especially when he's playing in the center of the floor, near perfect passes every. single. game.  The stat book doesn't lie, you can like who you like, but you can't act like they're better than he is, it's no contest in the stat book. Which, you know is the ONLY fair way to compare players... Everything else is subjective, not objective.  Doesn't matter if they're out of their prime, they're objectively a better team, statistically and in my opinion.  Yes, he's always played as a playmaker, pass first team player, not just some dominant scorer like MJ, Kobe or Durant, although he can be just as potent when playing with a similar playstyle, he rarely ever is in score first mode.   EDIT: You're telling me you wouldn't take Simmons, Tatum, Mitchell, etc over players like: Kevin Willis, Otis Thorpe, Dan Majerle, Chris Gatling, AC Green, Tyrone Hill, Mark Eaton, BJ Armstrong, James Donaldson, John Starks, Mookie Blaylock, Dana Barros, Tyrone Hill, Tom Gugliotta, Chris Gatling, Steve Johnson etc????? All of these dudes were all-stars when MJ played... You probably have never heard of at least a few of them. There's a reason why. They're trash and would be even worse if playing today... I'd 100% take good rookies over some overrated allstars... The NBA wasn't even full of enough talent to fill out allstar games with true all-star players. I even noticed this back then. There's a TON more talent in the NBA today, that's not even debatable.  EDIT2:   &gt;Apart from the 16/17 Warriors team that had Durant, Lebron's teams actually matched up well with the Warriors in terms of talent in 14/15 and 15/16. The difference is that the Warriors actually have a system and move the ball.  Yep. That's why I said ""all but 3 of lebrons years"". I'd count the two warriors teams without durant and MAYBE the 14 spurs as evenly matched. Pretty much of his other Finals appearances his team has been outclassed all the way around."
"&gt; Dwight was actually a super athlete in comparison to MJ's competition  Dwight, like Lebron and Kevin Durant (and even Curry), is mentally weak. It's something new with this generation.  &gt;Actually helps OP's argument  Cavs were 66-16. MJ never lost a postseason series where he was the favorite.  &gt;LeBron lost in 2015. Stayed with Cavs.  Not even comparable. If he loses again this year I bet he will either quit or force the Cavs to get 2 super stars.  &gt;Implies LeBron not facing ""cheap shots"" and potential injuries makes him a worse player  He'd cry if he were barely touch. Guy can't even handle an 82 game season.  &gt;Literally kind-of agrees with OP. Bigger and more athletic competition now  There's no ""competition"" anymore. Everyone joins super teams now for a super easy Finals win. One reason I am rooting for the Rockets to go all the way. Rockets formed a Championship-caliber team the right way.  &gt;I have a feeling they won't help an argument against higher athleticism now vs then.  Michael Jordan was fat and 40 with a bum knee and still clowning 21 year olds.  This era may even be worse than the 2003-2007 era."
We all know that LeBron owns the East but let’s face it once he gets to the finals who are we kidding he’s gonna get dad-dicked/  brutally gang raped once again by Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors 
"I both love and hate Kevin Durant at the same time. Its weird, I cant explain it. Anyone feel the same?"
When Kevin Durant was recruited he was in the Hamptons.  Dray/Steph/Klay/Iguodala flew out to meet with him and convince him to join the Warriors at a vacation house out there.  The five of them got nicknamed the Hampton 5 by a local writer after the meeting.
"First of all rich as fuck talking about my flair when you are too much of a bitch to even put one up  who the fuck said KD was better than LeBron? I didn't know players in the league are separated between 'better than LeBron' level and 'can't achieve anything unless you are on golden state' level because clearly thats what you are suggesting.  Look at KD's actual stats instead of pulling out bullshit out of your mouth, KD was already the most efficient scorer in the history of the game before he joined us, his Kevin fucking Durant for god sakes, why the fuck did you think the entire sub overdosed on salt when he choose the hardest road? It doesn't matter how good we are, he was already the 2nd best player in the league on OKC, and his stats haven't really changed that much since joining us either. so stfu and crawl back to your hole so you can jerk off to your LeBron body pillow"
"I disagree. Kevin Durant just banked the same running shot off one leg against the pelicans later in today's game. The only difference is that he had a defender on his face, while lebron was virtually open because the craptors didn't even pretend to double him.  Also saying that a running bank shot from midrange is more difficult than a contested three... Do you even play basketball? It's not like he took this from behind the three point line. "
you mean when Kevin Durant joined a top 5 team of all time?
I was swearing up and down that he was NOT coming to the warriors. My post history will back that up. My brother and I were playing “Fuck Kevin Durant” on repeat after the okc series. 
Death lineup got upgraded to super lineup of Death ever since they switched Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant.
"I don’t get it. KD is better offensively than Lebron. Shooting, rebounding, handles, driving, etc. The only way lebron could take him is on assists. In addition, Kevin Durant is a better defender. Didn’t he nearly lead the league in blocks this year?   Lebron is amazing, and probably has the better b-ball I, but if you look at each of their skill sets, I am not sure how you could say Lebron is so much better that KD shouldn’t be in the convo with such confidence."
It hurts Currys legacy that Kevin Durant joined the GSW. If Steph had gotten 3 chips without KD while Lebron was in his prime he could be considered as the best PG in league history.  As far as I’m conserned stepmother KD does not get any credit for the championships they will win in the coming years. By this generation he will be known as a coward. A man that chose not to face adversity because it was too difficult. He will never have the respect of all time greats either. Many won’t say it but past great probably despise him because he stands for everything they were taught not to be.

This is a 73 win team that added Kevin Durant. It's still insane to realize that they did that. Sure a lot can change but how much? I don't think two players in their prime that good have ever played with each other. Kareem and Magic maybe and they won 5 with Kareem slowly aging.

"I really hope Loyola-NO doesn’t take advantage of this (Riverside can’t as much because tuition is way cheaper because they’re in-state). What a lot of colleges do when a student receives an outside scholarship is they deduct the financial aid already given to that student (which is probably a ton given the description of these kids’ financial situations) so that the outside scholarship has no effect.  I say this not because I think Kevin Durant can’t afford $110K per year for four years (rather than probably $50K per year if federal financial aid at UCR and institutional financial aid at LNO was left alone despite his donation), but rather because I don’t want it to discourage future donations like his."

"Kevin ""Michael Scott"" Durant  "
"Yeah I'm good bro. It's just that instead of just saying KD started playing ISO ball you said the team. I was able to answer it myself based off it being KD the one who was primarily playing ISO ball. I never once said KD was a bad player, dude is absolutely incredible and easily a top 3 player in the NBA today (I still think there is a conversation between him and Steph). So instead of downvoting anyone who criticizes KD and feeling that you have to come to his defense (as I see you do in many threads), realize that it's completely understandable for a player to be criticized for having 1 assist in 2 games. Especially having one game with 5 turnovers and 0 assists while having the lowest plus-minus on the team. Also he's practically 7 foot, you're telling me Steph should have twice as many rebounds as him? So when the article is saying ""Kevin Durant deserves his due"", I don't feel as if anything he has done in the past 2 games earns him any more respect than he already has. We already know he can put the ball in the bucket like no other.  P.S. Mental health shouldn't be something you just toss around when someone disagrees with you. I understand it can be frustrating when one of your favorite players is getting criticism, but it isn't wildly unfair."

The TNT guys referring to Kevin Durant as a seven foot guard over and over again really does throw all the rules out the window. 
Also the fact that Kevin Durant ISOs all the god damn time on the Warriors. 
"at least post the full headline since nobody here reads the article anyway.   'Kevin Durant Deserves his Due, Even If You Don't Forgive Him""  your truncated title only leads to quality discussion inducing comments such as ""no he doesn't"" or ""lul kd alt""  "
Why wouldn't I be? Kevin Durant didn't move the team to OKC? He has always been very positive towards the Sonics and the city of Seattle. 
"this article basically says that kevin durant is good at basketball, but who's saying he isn't? anyone who watches basketball knows he's a top 2-3 player in the world. it's because of his greatness that people still criticize him for going to golden state. "
I love how any time the warriors lose the go to excuse is “they didn’t care”. This is the Western Conference Finals. The rockets are the best team they have faced by far since adding Kevin Durant. They are most certainly not just “giving up” in these games. 
Kids got great potential. Can't wait to see what the future holds for him. Lamar Odom+Marcus Camby+Kevin Durant 
"Kevin Durant is a goddamn genius, but the Houston Rockets imposed their will on the Golden State Warriors. The Dubs were out-hustled and allowed the Rockets to dictate the pace of the game, especially in the second half. "
"lmao.  He plays along some of the best defensive players in the league that mask his short-comings on defense.  His off the ball defense comes from him being able to make risky plays to steal, because you got Draymond and Kevin durant ready to back him up.  But he's terrible at defense.  Put him on any team that is average to bad on the defensive side, and he would be getting crucified."
"yeah.. its fucking Kevin Durant.. a 7'0 prolific SG  Tatum gonna be a superstar, but KD is either  1) To some is unning for GOAT status &amp; building his case year by year, as his resume builds  *  and as he removes himself from alt twitter accounts, joining the warriors, hardest road, etc etc)  Or   2) He lost all GOAT credibility, but with the right career path   * OKC keeps Harden or he was already paired with an efficient player like CP3 or somethin)   He'd be fighting for GOAT status already   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tatum could be the next PP and even better, a perineal all-star superstar.   But KD is on a different level from current perennial all-stars/superstars for the past decade"
"I don't get the whole ""his frame is an issue"" argument. He's bigger than Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant were at their combines. Sure he'll never be the defensive juggernaut that Davis is but he has the quickness to develop plenty of defensive capability.  He won't be able to out muscle people like Boogie in his first or second year but if someone like Durant can put on the weight to turn himself into a monster, I don't see any reason why Bagley can't do the same.   Yes, he doesn't have the largest range but the kid doesn't give up on the offensive end and will out hustle 90% of players in the league. Rarely do we ever see someone completely polished coming out but if you mean to tell me that one of the biggest concerns is that he's still growing into his body and needs to add strength? I'm not worried at all about the kid."
Important detail left out from original post:  Death Lineup was coined in 2015 with Harrison Barnes in place of Kevin Durant
You mean when the Cavs actually had a good defense? And before the Warriors had Kevin Durant? 
"NBA players generally go by their height WITH shoes. There's some exceptions though, like Kevin Durant. I believe he measured at 6'9"" barefoot but he doesn't like the idea of being listed taller than that for some reason. Likewise with Kevin Garnett if I remember correctly."
"It's far less Curry than it is Klay.  He's played with a dynamic point guard before. But since Harden all his 2 guards in OKC were one way players, be it Kevin Martin on offense or Roberson on defense.   Klay is like the perfect 2 guard next to Durant. "
"I mean, they also needed one of the most remarkable comebacks in NBA history to beat Kevin Durant. And unlike the Finals, there weren’t injuries/suspensions that affected the outcome. Durant’s team beat a healthy Golden State team into submission and they not only needed the greatest game of Klay Thompson’s playoff career(on the road in an elimination game no less), it also required one of if not the worst games of Durant and Westbrook’s playoff careers for the dubs to win a nailbiter"
Billy Donovan went from some guy in college to Kevin Durant 
"Tatum is incredible, and I don't want to take anything away from him. Being a Sixers fan actually makes his ability even more obvious, because I hated watching him smoke us. All I am saying is that Kevin Durant is on such a supreme level that I can't see Tatum ever reaching. Durant is just that good."
Unless your name is Kevin Durant.   Guarding the air and what not. 
"It's ridiculous. I don't know a single argument against Kevin Durant as a basketball player other than: ""he's a snek!"" Good or bad, that decision really doesn't have anything to do with his skills on the court."
I feel like he’s a poor mans Kevin Durant. 
I heard 7 foot and this sub and thats why I said it. And growing 5 inches from 18 to 24 isn’t that ridiculous especially for NBA players. The draft combine is not the real numbers and if you believe that than you believe Kevin Durant is 6’10 which he’s not
Fair enough.  &gt; KD is an absolute monster.  This is true. It's also indisputably true that Tatum just had the best age-19 season since Kevin Durant in 07-08. We'll just have to wait and see how it plays out from here
Realistically the Rockets can just let Kevin Durant torch then and focus on the rest of the playmaking since he’s the only warrior who can truly make his own shot. He’ll get his points regardless and focusing on the rest of the teams offense could work like it has for the Celtics against Lebron so far.

"I forget LBJ fans don't understand anything about basketball:   &gt; Kevin Durant scored 39 points on 14-of-20 shooting to lead the Warriors to a Game 5 NBA Finals victory over the Cavaliers Monday. In doing so, Golden State went 16-1, with one of the most impressive playoffs runs we have ever seen.  &gt; But Durant was on an impressive run, too. On the path to claiming NBA Finals MVP, he pelted the Cavaliers with remarkable precision. Through five games, Durant averaged 35.2 points on 55.5 percent shooting from the field, 47.4 percent shooting from beyond the three-point arc, and 92.7 percent shooting from the foul line.  &gt; In doing so, Durant became the most efficient scorer in NBA Finals history.  &gt; Only one other player has ever averaged at least 30 points per game on 50 percent shooting from both the field and the three-point line, as well as at least 90 percent from the foul line. That was Magic Johnson in 1987, but he only attempted two three-pointers in his six-game series against the Boston Celtics.  &gt; A few other NBA greats were close to Durant’s mark:  &gt; Michael Jordan in 1992: 35.8 points, 53 percent from the field, 42.9 percent from three, and 89.1 percent from the line  &gt; Chauncey Billups in 2004: 21 points, 51 percent from the field, 47.1 percent from three, 92.9 percent from the line.  &gt; Ray Allen in 2008: 20.3 points, 51 percent from the field, 52 percent from three, 87 percent from the line  &gt; Penny Hardaway (swept by Rockets) in 1995: 25.5 points, 50 percent from the field, 45.8 percent from three, 91.3 percent from the line  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/6/13/15772410/kevin-durant-most-efficient-scorer-nba-finals-history-warriors-vs-cavs-game-5"
"When you're sharing a court with Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson and the offense is known for getting switches and iso, they're obviously gonna go at Curry instead of any other player on the court who is a plus defender."
"In game 1, the Rockets were relentless in their assault on Curry, almost to a fault. They grinded the game to a halt in an effort to get their switch, using 10-14 seconds of every shot clock, lulling Rockets, Warriors, and fans alike to sleep. This stagnation is what did them in, despite Harden's efficient heroics. The Rockets came out of the gate with much more urgency. They pushed every numerical advantage almost immediately and started the game with a dizzying pace. They'd slow it down during the mid-quarter lulls then pick it up again once they sniffed out a weakness.   In game 2, the Rockets continued their brigade against Curry with some necessary adjustments. Instead of solely hunting for the switch, Harden and Paul used slip screens to their advantage. As Curry hedged (properly), a pass was already in motion towards the screener (usually Ariza) and Curry was behind the play. This let Ariza play 4 on 3, the main reason they won 65 games this year. Using Ariza as an ancillary playmaker not only resulted in his team high 6 assists (tied w Paul), but it freed Tucker for open 3's. As Ariza rolled downhill, Draymond Green (perhaps the best help defender in the NBA by a considerable margin) was in the paint to meet him. With Curry scrambling and wasting time in no man's land, Tucker was ready to launch.   In the 2nd half, the Rockets were not content with one set of looks for Curry. As Curry started to call switches for his teammates before his man screened Harden, the Rockets immediately pivoted to Curry's new assignment setting the screen. Then they got the switch and torched the shit out of him for 2 quarters. Forcing Curry through multiple switches and defensive assigments may take its toll on him. Requiring him to think and expend effort on his weaker half of the court is probably the best way to slow him down on the skyfucker side. I was thoroughly impressed with the Rockets' adjustments and can't wait to see how Kerr will counter. Game 3 is going to be a blast.  &amp;nbsp;  As for the Warriors, it seemed like they started the game believing their own hype. Sloppy passes and simple miscommunications ruined their chances at establishing a rhythm. No doubt Kerr will ream them and they'll be more locked in for game 3. I'd like to close by saying that Kevin Durant is insane. He should not exist. It is mind boggling how good he is. Thanos couldn't even guard him. "
18 points on 15 shots is completely fine. He's shown countless times that he values team success over personal achievements and he's willing to find his red hot teammate.   Playing worse than Kevin fucking Durant in a given game doesn't mean the game was even close to bad by any stretch of the imagination.  LeBron wouldn't get shit if he scored 18 on 15 shots if he was setting up an on fire Love who scored 40 and (most importantly) they got the W.
"He was usually top 10 and for around a decade was always at least debatably top 10.  I'd say Chris Paul, James Harden, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Giannis, at a *minimum* are all ""superstars."" Some years it's more. Some less. But it's pretty rare for only 5 guys to deserve that title."
Kevin Durant with the -38 while scoring 38 points on amazing efficiency. That's gotta be a first. 
"&gt;Kevin Durant gutted some of our depth, didn't replace nothing   Kevin Durant 2017 Finals: 35ppg 56/47/92  Harrison Barnes 2016 Finals: 9ppg 35/31/60  And you are acting like Kevin Durant barely improved the warriors..."
From a team building standpoint the Warriors made a team built on spacing that allowed Steph to play his way on offense that typically had matchups that let him hide on defense. He is putting up effort on D but this is part of how you disrupt Steph's game. That Kevin Durant dude does whatever the fuck he wants though is a complete monster so idk what you do with him 
"Lilliard team get destroyed, because he doent have a defensive anchor like Draymond or the best shooter in the world in Klay, or great bench players in Livingston, Iggy and West, oh i forgot to mention he also has KEVIN FUCKING DURANT."
"So in this scenario 1960s Bill Russell is just thrown in against the 2018 Warriors? Or does 2018 KD go play in the 60s? If KD was born in the 40s he wouldn't have that game. If Bill was born in 1988 he would have been able to guard the players of his era because he would have practiced against people like that. These things cant happen, so there is really no evidence for either of our cases. Yes KD is a freak but [Bill was too.](https://youtu.be/j2AlFrOj5Mc). And you really need to go watch some film of Wilt Chamberlain if you think that he was easier to guard than Kevin Durant. You cant just think that because KD has HD highlights of every game he ever played in and every highlight of Bill was grainy and dudes hadn't developed the dribbling/pull up skills yet that this era is head and shoulders above the NBA in the 1960s. Just being lazy and using a time machine and throwing present KD back to the 60s of course he would dominate. Kevin Durant's game was built on the foundation 70 year old NBA, and all the knowledge that came with it. Bill Russell's game was built on the foundation of an NBA in its infancy. But the simple fact remains we will never really know so if you really think that Bill Russell could not guard Kevin Durant I guess we're going to always disagree. "
"He was an MVP candidate ONE YEAR and never came close again.  And that year they lost to the actual MVP, Kevin Durant. What's wrong with that?"

"He was top 10 arguably in 2014 and 2015, that's pretty much it. He is not a HOF level player like Karl Malone, Kevin Durant, etc."
How did Kevin Durant get ZERO assists in 35 mins in a playoff games with his amount of usage? 
Kevin Durant:  &gt;38 points   &gt;60fg%  &gt;100ft%  &gt;0 assists and an assist/turnover ratio so bad it can't be measured   &gt;team worst minus mother fucking 28   Hot take: KD is bad for the warriors and should go to the Suns ☀ 
Kevin Durant something something hot snakes. 
"This Warriors team is built around two of the greatest shooters of all time who also have arguably the quickest releases as well. Then they added to that with Kevin Durant, a legit 7 footer who can handle the ball like a point guard and can shoot blindfolded. Kerr could have implemented any offense in the history of the league and this team would dominate. "
How did the Warriors play so well offensively in game one?  I think it’s probably because of (squints)...  * (Looks at 2 time MVP Steph Curry) * (Looks at 1 time MVP Kevin Durant) * (Looks at All Pro Klay Thompson) * (Looks at All Pro Draymond Green) * (Looks at former all star Andre Iguodala)  ...iso basketball. That’s the culprit. 
"For real I just don't understand what OP was thinking all the Cavs have to do is get the ball out of the hands of Lebron James and let high IQ players like JR Smith makes those plays. The Warriors have made a multi\-year dynasty of 2 championships by using free flow offense and elevating the play of people like Kevin Durant to a level that could be MVP level one day. What have the Cavs done with their ISO basketball? They only have 1 championship and are nowhere close to a dynasty. Now sure for the Warriors first finals win Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were injured and they still managed to take it to 6 games but that was luck definitely not giving your best player like Lebron James the ball more and letting him make more of an impact on the game. As you could tell by the next year when the Cavs just got lucky and won with their ugly ISO ball. Because the very next year the Warriors managed to win again and they only had to add an MVP player in their prime. Get out of here with your nonsense OP. If the Warriors trust players like Durant, Thompson, Green, Curry, and Iggy to make plays for them then the Cavs should trust players like Tristan Thompson, JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson, and Kevin Love to make plays too"
GSW iso’ed more than houston. It was kevin durant iso all day.  Jus saiyan...
Kevin Durant with 38 points 3 reb and 0 assist on 35 mins. What a bitch
Yeah then they got Kevin MOTHERFUCKING Durant. 
"Wasn't this Rockets offense the most effecient in NBA history? I'm comfortable in saying they were firing on all cylinders today and this fucking madman Kevin fucking Durant was keeping up with them for almost 3 quarters.  KD has his faults but please just look at this big picture, GSW played like absolute ass and KD single handedly kept them close with the greatest offense in NBA history for 3 quarters. Dude's an insane offensive juggernaut. "
"Kevin Durant: 38 points, -28."
The real NBA finals. Damn that Kevin Durant he doesn't miss. GG.
Kevin Durant sole job for the Warriors is to shoot open 3's or score in isolation/1 on 1 situations. That's all he's asked to do.   Seriously 99% of his Isolations are single coverage because teams can't send help off Curry or Thompson.

kevin durant is their best mismatch on offense
"It's because Curry has statistically been the better player than Durant on average in the playoffs for their career. Curry has a higher TS%, BPM, and net rating for his career than Durant. In 14-15 and 16-17, the Warriors two championship years, Curry led all players in the playoffs for OBPM.  Stephen Curry is one of the best playoff performers in NBA history. The bar for him is perfection though, so any bad performance has been unreasonably held against him. It's not like Curry has ever gone out there like Lebron and averaged 11 PPG for a finals series.   Kevin Durant is also one of the best playoff performers too.   I think Durant will be better statistically moving forward though because he gets to benefit greatly from Curry's gravity, while Curry is the only player whose Curry's gravity negatively impacts.  "
Lebron James put up 40 and the Cavs got crushed.   Kevin Durant put up 40 and the Warriors got crushed.  Rockets vs Celtics confirmed 
Dopey Kevin Durant can't take the heat. Confirmed for Rockets trade this summer. 
I thought Kevin Durant ruined the NBA
Kevin Durant needs more help 
I present exhibit A Mr. Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant would like a word
Who no showed in game 6-7 against the Cavs in 16 and in the finals last year. Kevin Durant was a huge reason we won last year. I’m not saying he’s trash dude in saying there a handful of very important games he played like ass and we needed him.
same warriors. It’s just Kevin Durant going nuclear hasn’t saved them this game. They bricked a lot more shots. Houston’s help actually showed up.

"2015: No Kyrie or Kevin Love, won in 6 against Lebron and Dellavedova, some Knicks rejects, and Mozgov  2016: Biggest choke in NBA history  2017: Added Kevin Durant to a 73-9 team and won a meaningless, empty chip. Still tried to act like it was a huge moment. Guaranteed win because KD pulled an unprecedented move of being a superstar to join the established superteam that beat him, just pouring money on the rich.  2018: KD is still a bitch, but if he loses, he should retire. There’s no coming back from losing on a supersuperteam."
"Kevin Durant yelled, “There you go!” Kevin Durant gave a look of pleasant surprise. Kevin Durant belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Kevin Duran hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Greg Ostertag hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Kevin Durant is a physically unattractive man. 
Kevin Durant is a better basketball player than stephen curry 
Apparently Kevin Durant is the only player on the Warriors. Who knew?
Imagine other animals with the proportions of Kevin Durant 
They've actually said this. It's exactly what they were missing. Imagine this game but sub out Kevin Durant for Harrison Barnes.

The mere existence of Kevin Durant on GSW is killing basketball.

BREAKING NEWS: Kevin Durant can score on James Harden...can the announcers stop acting like its surprising that he can?

Spoiler Alert: Kevin Durant hits a lot of shots
Maybe because Lebron is shooting it better from 3 than Durant? Lebron is more efficient his TS is 62% right now in the playoffs Durant is at 61%. Why wouldn't you just look things up yourself instead of creating a thread based purely on narrative? Their playoffs stats:   |Season|Age|Tm|FG%|3P%|FT%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS| |:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |2017-18|33|CLE|.545|.324|.735|8.9|9.4|1.4|1.1|32.9|  |Season|Age|Tm|FG%|3P%|FT%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTS| |:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |2017-18|29|GSW|.504|.309|.911|7.2|4.3|0.8|0.9|29.6|  For their career they are almost identical scorers if anything Lebron has the edge:  |Rank|Player|PPG| |:-|:-|:-| |1.|Michael Jordan*|30.12| |2.|Wilt Chamberlain*|30.07| |3.|Elgin Baylor*|27.36| |4.|LeBron James|27.15| |5.|Kevin Durant|27.12|  The two are basically tied as scorers there is no clear winner.  &gt;has more offensive moves  We can never prove this either way.

"The Rockets played game 1 like they were afraid of Kevin Durant. The Warriors played game 1 like they were afraid of Houston.   The Rockets played game 2 like they were afraid of GS.

"I mean when you don't catch the obvious hyperbole and try to make a point out of it...I have to call your comprehension skills into question. I mean, do you really understand how far 39 feet really is? But hell, Curry hasn't seen a 30+ footer that he wouldn't take, so I can see how that may have gone over your head.   The Warriors brand of basketball is only beautiful to you bandwagoners. The constant flopping of Curry, Draymond acting like a moron nearly every game, Klay's cool but the guy takes moronic shots too, Livingston's completely ugly midrange game (but for some reason, also completely unstoppable), frontrunning of Curry, the HIDING of Curry on incompetent guards because he can't play defense on half decent ones, Zaza playing as dirty or as unathletic as possible (I can't tell), Nick Young (that's all I need to say), goons like David West, and Kevin Durant being a beta and joining the team that waxed him.  Fuck Golden State.   And at least I'm a real fan. We've supported our team when they were trash, and are supporting them now that they're trash again. Don't forget, we put you out of the playoffs a few years ago. You definitely weren't a fan then. I don't care how much Google-Fu you can do. You weren't there when Run TMC were a thing, hell I doubt you were born."
No and here's why:  Kevin Durant is on the Warriors and the Cavs don't even have Kyrie anymore. 
Is Kevin Durant not on that list or am I too high to read? 
"First off your rebounding argument is incredibly flawed. Dirk has played out on the three point line all of his career so naturally he isn't going to be in position to grab a ton of offensive rebounds. He is in fact a good rebounder, with many seasons in the top 10 for defensive rebounds and he currently is 5th all time in defensive rebounds. Dirk has averaged as many as 8.9 drpg, Duncan's career high was 9.7 drpg. If your criteria for a ""good rebounder'' is a difference of 0.8 rpg thats bad criteria.   Kevin Durant would function as the 50/40/90 team's rim protector. He averaged just shy of 2 bpg this season while playing as Golden State's primary rim protector.   Also I don't see how I ""exaggerated his SPG and BPG"". I said he averaged around 1.5 steals and blocks per game at his best. He averaged 1.4 spg one season, and 1.5 bpg in 2005 and 1.4 bpg in 2004. Go look at basketball reference, Dirk has had 7 seasons with at least 1 bpg, and 5 seasons with at least 1 spg. "
Kevin Durant: My next chapter 
"I know I really should be thinking like that, plus we have Steph fucking Curry, Kevin the cheat code Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson...yet one does not forget the 2016 Finals meltdown easily haha. (At least these days I can joke about it, progress I suppose...)"
Are you telling me that’s Kevin Durant in disguise?
"Larry Bird and Kevin Durant are the only ones who are average or above average defensively. Nash, curry, and Nowitzki are all completely garbage defenders and will be exposed even more when they have to play with eachother and can’t be hidden. Have no clue where you got the number 4 from"
Kevin Durant 
"Finals last year, Kevin Durant vs. Kevin Love"
"I think, when all is said and done, that Kevin Durant was a better ball player than LeBron James."
"Nobody is ever going to think, when it's all said and done, Kevin Durant was a better ball player than LeBron James."
Do you *really* want to use this argument in favor of Kevin Durant?
"I’ve already said this but if he’s a bust I’m deleting my account.  I said it once before and I’ll say it again.  The dude is special.  6’8 220 two way player who at 19 commands double teams in the second toughest league.  Not only a leader on his team, but MVP.  If he was at Duke or Kentucky he would be as hyped as Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, or Carmelo Anthony coming into the NBA.  Those guys he is facing are grown professionals and teams in this league bench most young guys regardless of their talent because it’s an extremely physical and difficult league with a high learning curve.  He’s gonna be good.  I just hate that he’s going to an in division team."

"Well day-to-day sure, it's most often his friends and his dad. But in the last couple months alone he's had Kevin Durant, Al Pacino, Ethan Hawke, Chuck Klosterman, Chris Bosh, Bill Hader, Jimmy Kimmel, and Daryl Morey. For a sports podcast that's pretty ridiculous. "
Kevin Durant 
Doncic is also younger than any NCAA player of the year winner. The only two freshmen to win the award are Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis. This just highlights how rare it is for someone to be this good this young.
"No you fucking idiot, it's not. Your predictions for who may be MVP leading up to a season based on how they played the season before mean jack shit. Just like calling Kawhi top 5 right now means jack shit. Maybe he comes back from injury and he's never the same player after, how long does it take you to remove him from top 5? Like I said before, these spots aren't reserved and if you aren't fit to play you lose your spot. He was never in conversation for number 2. He needs sustained numbers to do that. Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Steph Curry have been putting up numbers for way longer than he has, with varying degrees of success. He had an amazing 2016-2017 season, what about the seasons before? Sorry, but 21/7/2, 16/7/2, etc. Don't earn you shit and definitely not a reserved top 5 spot while injured. He's had one amazing season. The rest of the top 5 have had numerous amazing seasons. Maybe in a year or two we can revisit this conversation."
It’s kind of amazing that the Warriors has something called “the Death Lineup” And added KEVIN BLEEPING DURANT while losing Harrison Barnes lol.

"NBA straya podcast exclusively calls him ""the coward, Kevin Durant"" and it fits so well"
Of course it's just a prediction. The whole draft is a prediction of who you think will be best in the future. It just looks that way now. It could completely change and Ayton is Okafor 2.0 while Doncic becomes Kevin Durant. Who knows? But my first comment is just a prediction of the future that is most realistic to me. 
"Come on man. You think the Spurs wouldn't have traded the Duncan pick if MJ was on the table? The only untradeable pick ever has probably been LeBron. The other ""guaranteed slam dunks"" I can think of:  Kevin Durant (went 2nd)  Andrew Wiggins (got traded, also isn't nearly as good as the hype)  Markelle Fultz (lol)  "
Kevin Durant. Easily. Im not counting Lebron i think his ego is at least well deserved.

Kevin Durant :/
They’re discussing a Kevin Durant and Capela sign and trade
I wouldn't give it up for Kevin Durant or LeBron James either if I'm Phoenix considering they have player options for next year.
No. If Kevin Durant or Lebron James played for the Atlanta Hawks this thread wouldn’t even exist.   Hawks actually have an owner that’s willing to invest capital into the team now so the periphery aspects as to why the hawks drew poorly when they did have a good team should correct themselves over the coming decade.   ASG were the worst ownership in all of sports and they ran the organization on the cheap. (This goes beyond player payroll as that is capped) It negatively impacted aspects of the brand that dampened the popularity of the team.   
This is of course after the 76ers blew a 3-0 lead against reformed heel turned face Kevin Durant who returned home to the Seattle SuperSonics.
"2018 - Celtics - Terrific ball pressure and defensive cohesiveness and better execution, Warriors average 18 turnovers per game in the series.  This is the first of a Celtics-Warriors trilogy.  2019 - Warriors - The Empire Strikes Back.  Lebron signs a one-year, $5.3M deal for the taxpayer MLE to be the Warriors 5th starter, and ends up being Finals MVP against the Celtics after once again averaging a triple-double in the Finals.  However, the cracks in the core are evident as various Warriors struggle to ""fit in"" or ""fit out"".    2020 - Celtics beat Warriors in the Finals.  This season becomes known as Anthony Davis' year.  He wins regular season and Finals MVP in his first year with the Celtics, after being acquired with juicy first-round picks the Celtics owned from the 2019 draft and from the Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward trades that the Celtics made in years prior.  Draymond gets thoroughly outplayed in the series and grouses all season long about his pending free agent status and his icy relationship with Steve Kerr.    2021 - Celtics dethrone the Lebron James-Kevin Durant Lakers.   The Warriors run is clearly over - Draymond, Lebron, and KD all left in free agency, the effects of the luxury tax and picking No. 28-30 overall in the draft for 6-7 years have left the cupboard bare around Klay Thompson and Steph Curry, who are dubbed ""The Puddle Brothers"" in a savage takedown by u/bootum after their turnstile defensive showing in a first-round exit.    2022 - Bucks in 6"
No he doesn't everybody loves LeBron. Are we going to pretend that LeBron gets criticized for not passing enough more than Kevin Durant now?

Kevin Durant
Are you kidding me?! Have you only been watching basketball for the last 5 years? Melo is a 10x all star and 19th on the NBA's all time leading scorers list. None of those players you mentioned ever made an all star in their entire career. Those players shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as Melo. The fact you called him a mediocre role player tells me you haven't watched Melo's career. Career wise dude is one of the best scorers of his generation. He was at one point arguably the best scorer in the NBA before Kevin Durant. For someone to call him a mediocre role player is insanely disrespectful.
Did Kevin Durant retire?
"Expansion draft can take any player as long as the affected team gets to draft another one, like a white elephant gift exchange. For example, a team could draft Kevin Durant, but that would mean Golden State gets to pick any player from any team in the league (no takebacks tho obv). This continues until the Jazz have exactly who I want so the league can make up for Jordan pushing off. "
"Texas would also have a really solid team, although they'd be a bit weak at Guard.  Starting Five of  DJ Augustin / Avery Bradley / Kevin Durant / LaMarcus Aldridge / Myles Turner   With Corey Joseph, PJ Tucker, Tristan Thompson, and Jarett Allen off the bench. "
"Kevin ""Kobe"" Durant"
"I'm not sure how using the basic box score stats is a ""flaw"". They paint a picture just like any stat does.   If you look at the more advanced stats like BPM, WS, per 100/36 or VORP they actually seem to favor Harden a bit more over the past 2 seasons which was a little surprising to me.    However in my opinion I'm not sure it is really possible to show how much Kevin Durant changed Curry's role through any stat available to us. If Durant chose Houston over Golden State, Harden's volume stats might very well go down since Durant is one of the better scorers ever. CP3 is great but he isn't KD. "
"D-Rose fanboy here, chiming in:  While I will certainly agree  Rose's game was and always will be heavily predicated on his athleticisim..,  he was a very good shooter in the past (just not from 3).   http://grantland.com/the-triangle/can-derrick-rose-shoot/  &gt; The numbers back that up. In that season, only three players attempted more midrange shots than Rose: Dirk Nowitzki, Kobe Bryant, and Kevin Durant. But Rose outshot all of those hacks (jk, jk) in terms of field goal percentage in the midrange. Of the 25 NBA players who attempted at least 500 midrange shots that year, Rose ranked first in efficiency, knocking down 47 percent of his 794 midrange attempts. Those numbers are straight-up Dirkish, and that’s a fake adjective I don’t throw around very much.  And while that was a while ago, pre-injuries and all that..  the guy does have quite a bit in the way of basketball skills beyond athleticism, he just isn't the best at a lot of things. "
Kevin Durant. 
"Yup, you’re right.  Jordan, Kobe, West and Wade are obviously the top 4 shooting guards but that fifth spot could be Drexler, Iverson, Allen...  Point Guard has the top 4 of Magic, Robertson, Thomas and Stockton but that fifth spot could be Kidd, Cousey, Frazier, Curry...  SF is impossible. Lebron and Bird are clear one and two but then you’ll get tons of other people making the 3-4-5 like Baylor, Pippen, Havlicek, Dr J, Rick Barry, Kevin Durant, etc.   But PF and C have a clear top five. I mean, you’ll still get some asshat trying to convince you that McHale is better than Barkley but it’s rare."
How can you idiots hate the Warriors for adding Kevin Durant and then turn around and praise LeBron for hypothetically teaming up with Kawhi and two other potential superstars?
?? Westbrook has averaged triple doubles the last two years. Probably the best pure talent in the backcourt in the entire world.  Won last seasons MVP.   Harden is the eventual winner of this years MVP and is the league scoring leader or in it's top 3 last few years running.   Kevin Durant is the best wing shooter alive. Another 25+ scorer on average...Former MVP  Kahwi is the best 2 way player in the game. He's known for being a total lockdown defender and could guard anyone and succeed. Not to mention his ability to score 20+. Guards LeBron. And doesn't struggle.  AD is the most unstoppable player on the block. He also is a plus defender and candidate for defensive player of the year on top of his offensive abilities. He's is more than Aldridge ever could be close to.  Besides lebron and curry this team has arguably the next 5 of the top 7 in any order. And that's about as common a take as anything....   
Kevin Durant would have a lot of assists if the overrated bums he passed to made shots. $15 million a year for Brickuodala. Steph “but he injured Doe” Curry getting outshot by PJ Tucker.
"Knowing words is different than having a conceptual understanding of what you are reading.  I said Durant did not elevate his game in crucial situations when the odds were stacked against him. You bringing up the finals where he was on a clearly better team is irrelevant to the discussion. You then quote ""mental fortitude"" and talk about ""confidence issues""  when I didn't mention any of that in the post.   I've felt Kevin Durant was the best basketball player on the planet for the last 2 season. The distinction I was making is that Durant did not want to be the GUY in all aspects of the game, he didn't want the Kobe, Lebron, Jordan, role where the offense runs through him, the Batman role. No, Durant chose to play in the Robin role where he didn't have to dominate possession and where the success of the offense was not determined solely by what HE brings to the table night in night out.   That's the distinction I was making and why I don't think his legacy will live up to his talent. When you look back on his career, when he was the Batman he never came through when his team needed it, in fact, he came up small."
"&gt;Seattle Supersonics LeBron won't sign with this team because it doesn't exist.  This assumes that LeBron can't time travel, which is lame.   Let me correct that.   LeBron loves sound, and he heard there was once a team that was actually more super than sound. He decides to travel back in time and join them. Going to Seattle, however, he realises there is not so much sound there as the ocean is essentially a bunch of water. He convinces Seattle Supersonics to become the Thunder, which produces sound, and move to OKC, where a lot of thunders happen. LeBron actually changed his physique when joining the Supersonics by growing several inches higher and becoming lankier. Yes, he was actually Kevin Durant and he now plays for the Golden State Warriors.   There you go, I explained why the Supersonics transferred to OKC and solved the puzzle whether Durant or LeBron is GOAT and who is a bigger snek (they are actually the same person). "
June 6th: Kevin Durant joins the Warriors  June 7th: Lebron James announces retirement.
Kevin Durant will sign with the Celtics to teach them how to beat LeBron. 
"Just straight up multiplying TS% and your initial outcome above may work. Here's what the numbers come out to.     | PPG * sqrt(GP) ---|--- Michael Jordan | 986 Kareem Abdul Jabar | 972 Karl Malone | 960 Lebron James | 920 Kobe Bryant | 917 Shaquille O'Neal | 823 Dirk Nowitzki | 813 Kevin Durant | 752   | PPG * sqrt(GP) * TS% ---|--- Kareem Abdul Jabar | 575 Michael Jordan | 560 Karl Malone | 553 Lebron James | 539 Kobe Bryant | 503 Shaquille O'Neal | 482 Dirk Nowitzki | 470 Kevin Durant | 459   The only change between the two after TS% is added to the equation is Kareem moving ahead of MJ, which I think makes sense in this list of scorers. If Lebron does average 27 while playing 75 games next season and his TS% remains unchanged his score here would be 556, which would move him just above Malone.  In case anyone checks my math I rounded down to the nearest integer."

Probably but you should not compare eras for so many reasons. If Kevin Durant was a player in the 60s/70s his game would be drastically different then what it is today.
Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant when he wasn't playing with a 2x MVP. Curry when he wasn't playing with another MVP.  They used to be two of the most fun scorers to watch, they would just straight up torch other teams from everywhere and hit crazy shots while remaining extremely efficient.  They're still fun to watch, but its not the same anymore when they play together on such a stacked team. I miss them both averaging 30ppg on 50/40/90. Nowadays they rarely go off like they used to. Obligatory Fuck KD. "
"Being a net positive on defense isn't close to being elite, which Kevin is. LeBron has to frequently take plays off on defense to have enough juice for the game whereas Durant is likely making an All-NBA defense team this year, it's not really even close.  Kobe would take the last shot because that's who he is, not because he's dumb, he's just confident. No way in hell Kobe takes a quadruple-teamed shot if he trusts the guys around him to make it. Kobe wasn't Westbrook. When he carried his team it was because he had no talent around him, but when he actually had guys like Pau, Shaq, or Odom he was a willing passer and consistently lead the Lakers in assists. He's actually a GREAT passer, too, but played the role of a scorer more.   Regardless, that doesn't change anything about what I said about being unable to objectively rank LeBron's IQ as the best ever, or even beyond the names I listed.  If all you can say definitively is that he's clearly the better playmaker, and Durant is clearly the better defender.. then yeah, it's debatable which one is the better overall player."
"Lebron will end up joining the Magic once Disney gets involved. They will offer him a advance copy of a bugs life 2 and his own ride at Disney world. They will call it ""the hardest path"" and start off with riders getting on a giant Lebron's back and be taken on a fun ride that ends when Kevin Durant cuts him off taking the easy path. "
"He definitely could be choking. He's known to be streaky especially in the playoffs, so it's possible. He also hurts his ankles a lot. Doesn't change how this justifies every bit of hate that Kevin Durant received since he joined the warriors "
"Did you watch game 1 when the Rockets were up 21-12, hitting on all cylinders and Harden/Paul were making shots in people's faces? In that game, the Rockets needed a lead to win, the Warriors pull away in the 3rd quarter a lot, so you can't be down and you can't be tied. The reason the Warriors won game 1 was because in that first half, Kevin Durant decided to not miss and completely took apart the Rockets defense as a 1 man offense. "
"It means that the individual has a  great  propensity for gaining weight,  specifically fat mass. There are body types,  most  people are a mixture of two.  There are ectomorphs (Kevin Durant types)  and mesomorphs (Karl Malone types) "
While Thorpe might go overboard a bit on overstating the injury of Mbah A Moute he really is low key huge in this specific matchup   I really think he's the best defender on Houston when fully healthy. He wasn't far off from being a viable candidate for all nba defends consideration. Fully capable of truly guarding any player on GSW for long stretches: this season despite being 6'9 he spent 25% of his poss guarding point guards   Past two years he's shot 37% from 3 and 65% at the rim on average  On 3 drives per game this year he shot 51%. Note amongst qualifying players that figure is 82nd percentile  Note Ariza was at 42% and Tucker at 25%: he's way better at them attaching close outs    Over the past 5 years Kevin Durant has shot 31% on possessions guarded by Luc Richard Mbah A Moute   He really was a big loss. I really think with a healthy Luc Capela/Luc/Gordon/Harden/CP3 would've been Houstons best possible lineup 
"Speaking of which, why are the top guys attending the combine this year? I thought lottery picks used to avoid that shit like the plague since the Kevin Durant debacle."
"I'd say they mostly attack Curry and Dray, which is kinda the traditional way to have a shot at the Warriors. Still works. KD can score a lot, but when Dray is frustrated with lack of playmaking possibillities and being made a fool for not being able to score when given space, he's off-focus on defense, and then Durant and Klay get exposed with all their real flaws (they don't show up to places they could help).  Klay plays a normal offensive series for him I'd say. Shoots well. Kinda everyone shoots well on GSW, Looney, Iguodala, Nick Young. But Rockets probably make a good bet to focus mostly on two key players, Curry and Dray.  I think Tom Ziller wrote pretty well about what I thought about this game. Focusing on Steph and Dray on both ends makes Warriors' way of playing on both ends collapse. Durant left off not doubled is gonna score a lot (for one man), but the rest of the team isn't made better on it since he doesn't really do much else well. KD is also not really a good defender if Dray doesn't secure.  https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/17/17364290/kevin-durant-warriors-rockets-invisible-masterpiece-nba-playoffs"
R/NBA after every Warriors loss: **LMFAOO WARRIORS GONNA LOSE EAT THAT CUPCAKE!**  R/NBA after every Warriors win: Kevin Durant ruined the game of basketball. 
"I agree with you 100%. That's what I'm saying is the Warriors haven't been pushed or put into pressure situations. The last time it happened they lost to the Cavs, after beating Kevin Durant in the WCF (who also hasn't shown an ability to handle pressure really well). The Rockets have absolutely crushed them on defense. I don't disagree with you at all. Rockets deserve all the credit without all the excuses everyone keeps handing out on why the Warriors are losing. That's what's great about a 7 game series, is you can't say ""the better team lost"" "
"If you'll recall, Kerr actually forbid Curry from taking long 3's as it was not part of his ""system"" and he considered it a ""bad shot"". It was only when Luke Walton told Curry to feel free to shoot it whenever he wanted to that they unlocked that one super-saiyan season... But let's just be revisionist...  You'll also recall that 4 years ago, none of these players were in their prime. So you're comparing 22-24 year old guys fresh off their rookie contracts to the current 26-28 year old guys. If Mark Jackson had this crew, he'd be averaging 65 wins a season as well. He also didn't have KEVIN FUCKING DURANT."
if the ref saw it live he would have (he was facing the other direction when it happened). its a taunting penalty. [remember when richard jefferson got a tech for winking at kevin durant?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-D4WuoCwDU) or when [embiid pointed at beasley after a dunk he didnt even make?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xr-h51OHzE) standing over a player out of bounds to talk trash him is a tech 100 times out of 100 in todays nba.
"Amazing, it almost like there’s more than one person on a subreddit and there can be conflicting opinions  The warriors have done both though, they’ve ruined the competitive balance in the league, maybe not to the point where they’re unbeatable, but to the point you’d need to stack 2-3 stars against them, which doesn’t leave enough for smaller market teams and we have half the league ranking because they can’t fill seats or beat the warriors  At the same time, most dynasties, especially in the NBA, have ended prematurely, and usually their fall is expedited by bad luck/injures (as a heat fan, I had to watch D wades knees go to shit and Chris Bosh retire after getting a max contract) yet the warriors are this frustrating combination of guys with purchased arrogance booty calling Kevin Durant at 4am in the oracle parking lot, and a super team that’s faced not a whiff of adversity and almost always takes advantage of the adversity of other teams "
"You need to think of it this way. Some people are born to be accounting gods and no one questions their social awkwardness or lack of charisma.  Kevin Durant has that kind of soul, only in a freakishly unguardable seven foot body."
"I used to want to asterisk the 2015 championship, and I still sort of do because I'm a homer and I hated it. Like we obviously don't know what happens if Kyrie and Kevin Love play in the series, but we definitely have a better shot than with Mozgov and Delly.  And I don't really like the asterisk for last year, I just want it to go down as an asterisk for Kevin Durant individually and no one else because it was a soft move. And all the injuries they lucked out against, honestly, it's just how the game happens. If the Cavs went 4 straight against the Celtics, we'd be getting so much of ""oh but they're missing their 2 best players how good is LeBron really?"" So it's just how the narrative plays out."
"Yes I did. And if it was just the rockets defense, I don’t think Steve Kerr would have been telling MJ stories and begging Durant to trust 2 of the best shooters ever. He would have said “keep doing what your doing and the shots will fall”. Yes, the rockets are playing great defense. But part of that great defense is baiting Kevin Durant into taking OK shots. "
Kevin Durant is the greatest choke artist of all time and it’s not even close.
"""if the warriors can win 73 games and be within 1 win of winning back to back titles, why should they want Kevin Durant?"""
Kevin Durant
"1. OKC got beat by a team who played Chris Bosh at the 5.   2. [Durant signed his rookie max in 2010](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/kevin-durant-2717/cash-earnings/) In fact he fought for more money from the team after the new CBA made him eligible for the ""Rose rule"".   3. [Westbrook signed his 5-year max rookie extension in 2011](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/russell-westbrook-6141/cash-earnings/)  4. Because of those two deals Harden wasn't eligible for the 5-year max, OKC was only able to offer him a 4 year max available to every other team. They didn't even offer him that. What are these pay cuts you're talking about?   5. James Harden would help the Thunder win more games than Kendrick Perkins. This last one is more of an opinion, but in hindsight it's obviously true. And at the time it was still pretty clear.   6. If the owners of the Thunder didn't want to deal with small market problems, they shouldn't have moved the team away from a big market. The Sonics would probably have two more titles by now. But the Thunder don't have any because Oklahoma City is in the middle of nowhere. "
"Kevin ""Russell Westbrook"" Durant"
STEPHEN A BRUTALLY DESTROYS DERANGED LIBTARD KEVIN DURANT
"Honestly it's not that tough because of the circumstances. Houston as a team are playing amazing defense right now, whereas that has never been the Raptors strong suit even if we have good one-on-one defenders.  Also, I think Durant is a much better match-up for Tucker. Tucker seems to do better against guys who are more pure scorers, he can just lock in and worry about them, whereas with LeBron you have to be equally concerned about his passing, which is worlds ahead of Durant, and therefore Tucker doesn't seem to do nearly as good of a job on him.   And let's face it, the best defense ever played on LeBron is either: A) Kawhi and the Spurs when he dropped 27 ppg on like 57% shooting, or B) the entire Warriors team in 2015, when he still averaged 36/13/8 or something like that. Kevin Durant is an amazing player no doubt, but LeBron is an entirely different beast in the playoffs. "
Why would you try to run the offense through Kevin Durant?!? That guy sucks at offense 
Kevin Durant
Team 1:  PG: Goran Dragic  SG: Manu Ginobili  SF: Joe Ingles  PF: Zach Randolph  C: Greg Monroe   Team 2:  PG:  George Hill  SG: Gordon Hayward  SF: LeBron James  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Al Horford   Team 3:  PG: Manu Ginobili  SG: Thaddeus Young  SF: Trevor Ariza  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Mo Speights
"It’s really not. Golden state was injured for much of the regular season but now they had their whole roster back, a roster that won 73 games, and then added Kevin Durant, won a ring with only one playoff loss, and is playing at home. The Vegas odds are never ridiculous , they start off based on the best statistics that are out there and then they shift based on public perception and bets coming in. Clearly a ton of people expected them to have an easy victory so the spread rose. Vegas spreads are only ever ridiculous in retrospect.   Let me put it this way, if Gs went out and won that game by 9, would you be sitting here saying “omg that is insane!! I can’t believe they won by 9 at home! No, you’d probably look at it as a totally typical result for the situation. "
Double plot twist: Kevin Durant moves to Asia and becomes an actual warrior.
"James Harden yelled, “There you go!” Trevor Ariza gave a look of pleasant surprise. Eric Gordon belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Chris Paul hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Durant hugged him &amp; said, “Can I join?”"
What does Kevin Durant use so he doesn't stink?  DeoDurant.
"Durant: What's up? Wanna dance?  Ariza: Yes.  Durant: Alright, take it easy.  David West: Kevin, he said yes!  Durant: ...what?"
Are we comparing Jaylen Brown to Kevin Durant now?
"Kevin ""Choke Artist"" Durant. "
"That’s not a fair comparison.   LeBron was the defacto coach, and had the freedom to ISO as he pleased.  In Golden State, Kevin Durant is coached to constantly pass the ball just so that David West can fumble the ball out of bounds, or so Draymond Green can brick yet another 3.   It’s hard to get in a groove and truly take over a game when the offense demands that you pass the ball to bums so they can turn it over."
"Kevin Durant truly brings people together  Oh, by the way, fuck KD"
Kevin Durant doesn't even move lmao
"I didn't make a comment about the whole game or even Draymond's overall performance. I mentioned a few times during a very specific and crucial time frame.   There was the awful inbound pass to Kevin Durant leading to an easy basket for Harden. There was the rebound where he passed instead of calling a timeout preventing the Warriors from advancing the ball. Then he fumbled a pass by looking away before he secured the ball which led to a turnover, effectively ending the game.  And yes I remember the crucial three and tip-in Draymond made to keep the Warriors in contention for the win. These moments aren't the reason GS lost this game and there is nothing in the single sentence I posted that would imply that.  I actually made this post *because* I remember Draymond performing well and wasn't thinking about how many little things went wrong for him until it was condensed in the highlights after the game."
"No idea which pic you're refering to, it's a slideshow.  Dragic is 6'4 barefoot. Pau is a bit over 7 barefoot too, he's around 7'2 with shoes on. It's kinda like Kevin Garnett using 6'11 as his height even though he was closer to 7'1 with his shoes on, or Durant using 6'9 for a while even though he was closer to 7' with shoes on by the time he was done growing."
"Kevin Love would be a capable scorer against Houston. Back down guys like Tucker and drag Capela away from the hoop. Also won't be dragged out on defense as much because CP3 and Harden don't nearly give pressure at the 3 vs Curry and Thompson. Feel like Capela might struggle against a guy that bangs down low as well. He falls for pump fakes quite bit.   On the other hand, Cavs don't play nearly at the pace Golden State does and it gives Houston an advantage since their guys can relax a little on defense compared to what they're going up against right now in Golden State and having to always be on constant alert on switches and screens. Houston also got multiple wings to throw on Lebron (not as good as Golden State's Durant and Green but Ariza and Tucker ain't pushovers) and Cavs have no one to defend Harden or CP3 nor the pick and roll with Capela. "
"While everyone was sucking his dick in free agency telling him he’ll be the face of the franchise. Golden State’s sale pitch was that he didn’t have to be the face and the attention wouln’t be on him, he must have liked that.   However he has 3 more FGA per game during the playoffs than Curry. So he is the nr.1 option.  But he is showing up to the arena in the same dusty ass tracksuit every game to idk not attract attention to himself or something.  But he releases a shoe with with messages to his haters [WARNING CRINGE.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportingnews.com/au/amp/nba/news/kevin-durant-kd-10-new-shoes-photos-nike/nzb05l6qvlp5zw0t04dd1nin?source=images).

""It might be different for other players. But for me, I'm more free and aggressive, and it's way more fun for me if I don't care about the outcome. I know if I go out there and be who I am, the outcome will dictate itself.""  This was the closest thing I have ever seen a professional athlete admit he does not like being the alpha on a team.  ""I'm at my best if I don't care if we win or lose""  is the same as:  ""I'm not at my best if I care if we win or lose""  Which is literally saying ""If everyone counts on me to win the game, I am not going to play at my best because now I have to care if we win."""
"[Spears] Just saw sullen forward Kevin Durant jump into a Ferrari California outside the Toyota Center and he said: “Fuck John Paxon” I next asked about Game 6, Durant said some other shit I didn't understand in parseltongue."
"fuck off with this nonsense. Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, but Andre fucking Iguodala is deciding the series huh??  Rockets are missing Luc but you don't hear us bitching about that shit because we don't have 4 all stars to take for granted."

"Results are everything. Of course I want the Cavs to win... but if not us, I absolutely want it to be the Rockets or Celtics. And if the Warriors win, it'll still be shitty that Kevin Durant made the softest move in NBA history."
"Well yeah but he is also delusional and a crybaby. I'm honestly surprised this sub thinks Kevin the snake Durant is good enough to put just below LeBron James. Flying in the face of James Harden or Kawhi Leonard, both of whom know how to pass a basketball.  Is everyone forgetting his major choke artistry at OKC so quickly? "
"I would say Kevin Durant, his overall numbers are still very good and his defense has been great. Everyone is inconsistent this series tho "
"I'm seeing a lot of people saying the Sixers could sign them. They can't.  The Sixers have a an active roster cap (renouncing all bird rights and non-guaranteed contracts) of $70,494,696. With an estimated cap of $101m that would give roughly $30.5m in space, which is short of a full max for Lebron. If you moved every except literally Embiid and Simmons (and I mean literally everyone*) you still would need Lebron and KD to take pay cuts.  Embiid+Simmons is $$25,250,000 + $$6,434,520; including 8 incomplete roster spot holds at $831,927 required to fill out a 12 man roster costs $38,339,936. Lebron is eligible for a salary of 35% of the cap; so is Kevin Durant. If the cap stayed at $101m that would mean each of their maxes would be $35,700,000. Which wouldn't fit under the Sixers cap. Both players would need to take pay cuts of roughly 5m dollars.  So even if the Sixers shed every salary not attached to Embiid or Simmons they still could not sign two max players this offseason."
"Bayless has a fully guaranteed contract. NBA contracts can't just be ""restructured"". Signing Reddick to the mid-level will give you less room, not more; you don't have room for a full max contract with his early bird rights renounced, so signing him for less doesn't free up anything.  The Sixers have a an active roster cap (renouncing all bird rights and non-guaranteed contracts) of $70,494,696. With an estimated cap of $101m that would give roughly $30.5m in space, which is short of a full max for Lebron. If you moved every except literally Embiid and Simmons (and I mean literally everyone*) you would just barely have room to give max contracts out to Lebron and KD.  Embiid+Simmons is $$25,250,000 + $$6,434,520; including 8 incomplete roster spot holds at $831,927 required to fill out a 12 man roster costs $38,339,936.

"I'm sorry but I don't think that is true at all, you really underestimate how good these two are and how well they compliment each other... the best possible superstar to pair with LeBron is a superstar who can play offball and shoot very efficiently.  Who is the best non primary ball handler superstar in the NBA right now? Kevin Durant.  He is literally LeBron's dream teammate. Those two would fuck the league raw and repeatedly."
"Just saw reptile Warriors forward Kevin Durant jump into a burrow outside the Toyota Center and he said: “I will be all right.” I next asked about Game 6, Durant said: “Oh yessssssssss” before slithering away."
"You think a team with Kevin Durant and LeBron James wouldn't make it out of a conference.   Hahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahhahahahahahaha  That would literally be the best big two in the history of basketball and frankly it wouldn't be close.  Kareem and Magic? Never really peaked at the same time.  Kobe and Shaq? Close, but Kobe wasn't in his prime yet.  Jordan and Pippen? Pippen is awesome but doesn't hold a candle to LBJ or KD.  Curry and Durant? Well, LeBron is better than Curry and Durant is Durant."
"You remember that series vs. Memphis when KD was absolutely shit, and Russ got to the line and KD was sitting on the court arms folded, facing away from Russ who hit the clutch free throws?

I wouldn't be touting the fact that a 73 win team that blew a 3-1 lead in the finals needed to go get KEVIN DURANT to win the next year as a redeeming accomplishment.
"In the 2016 NBA Finals the 73-9 Golden State Warriors blew a 3-1 lead to the Cleveland Cavs. In response to losing, Draymond Green called former MVP and top 5 player in the NBA Kevin Snake Durant crying and begging him to join the 73-9 Golden State Warriors. Kevin Snake Durant would join in the off-season and thus rendering any accomplishments he achieved irrelevant. Kevin Snake Durant is now considered the biggest bitch in NBA history. "

“AND Kevin Durant”   Hahaha quick reference 
"But now he doesn't have fucking Morris and Myles Turner guarding him, he has Kevin Durant, someone who can actually matchup height and length with him.  Lets see him drain those jumpers over KD. 1 of 2 guys in the entire league who can defend him. \(Him and Kawhi\)"
Kevin Durant ruined the NBA
Kevin Durant....back to back NBA finals mvp inc.
The safe bet says Kevin Durant. 
Lebron is one man. He is the greatest basketball player to play the game. The Warriors have now made 4 straight finals. They signed Kevin Durant for cheap. You cannot compare one man to 5.
"I don't think anyone hates on the organization for signing him. They would be stupid not to. The point is that he was too afraid to not get a ring in his prime and pulled a bitch move by going to the team that beat him. Then he doubled down and took a 7 million dollar paycut. All because he isn't competitive enough to earn his own ring. Kevin Durant is the bitch, not the Warriors as a franchise. "
&gt;i do not like kevin durant   You a hater lol 
Yea I would have loved to see a true rubber match. FUCK KEVIN DURANT. 
i do not like kevin durant
Thanks Kevin Durant!
Rockets were 7/44 from the field  Had to make just 11/44 and they would be going to the Finals    And fuck Kevin Durant
"Curry has probably already surpassed Kobe.   Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant,  James Harden, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Lauri Markannen, Karl Anthony Towns are going to have a chance to."
"People wanna hate GSW. I can  tell you guys one thing. At some point in every franchise history, teams had the players to build a dynasty but rarely do they sieze that opportunity. Warriors build a team which went on to win a championship in 2015, if they hadn't signed Durant after the 2016 loss, I am pretty sure they would have ended up with only one chip. Their management knew they need Kevin and they got him."
"The same call was made 3 times in game 6 for Kevin Durant. The exact same call. Unless I skipped over a rule change from game 6 to game 7, those should be free throws. "
"Kevin Durant should not have been allowed to sign with Golden State.  I don't know what you do about that.  Maybe a player who was first team All-NBA cannot sign with a team that was in the conference finals the previous year or something like that, which would encourage parity and franchises to retain their drafted players.    But regardless of how you go about it, that kind of ridiculous free agent addition shouldn't be able to happen again."
Maybe a lot of us think the same thing about Kevin Durant. 
*ahem*  The Golden State Warriors  *500 downvotes*  Kevin Durant  *1000 downvotes*  
Right...and Kevin Durant is the best player on the planet.
Because you have 4 all stars in your starting 5 and Kevin Durant ruined basketball???
That whole ceremony was Cringe! It started with Mitch Richmond only congratulating Kevin Durant 😂
Kevin Durant Stephen Curry *and the refs...**
I do not understand. How is a literal picture of Kevin Durant considered a meme?
"Look man Kevin Durant went to GS cuz It WaS tHe HaRdeR PaTh ok. Its tough out there for them ok. Its so tough, and the league and the refs know it too so they let a few obvious calls slide because they know how difficult it is for him. They have to be fair to Kevin and keep things even."
"I agree that you should reward teams for great drafting.  ""Superteams"" that are completely homegrown shouldn't be discouraged.  The problem is when you allow a Kevin Durant to sign with a team that was in the finals the year before.  It just tips the balance of power too much imho."
"Seriously, something is wrong with the rims during these games.  Kevin Durant missed his first two free throws last game in the first half. Second half, Houston is missing everything thrown that way. Something seems off with these rims. "
This is fucking amazing. That dude hates Kevin Durant. 
I fucking despise Kevin Durant.
Can we just forget the game and go back to what we do best - trashing Kevin Durant the snake for destroying the nba? 
"Congrats to the golden state warriors and Kevin Durant . Good for you, Mitch. "
"Without CP3, the Rockets will never beat the top teams like the Warriors.  He would have made a big difference if he played.  The Warriors got 3 X factors really 4 with Green, Thompson, Curry, and Durant.  Kevin Durant was brought in to bring in that extra umph to that team.  "
Kevin Durant Era
What era are you talking about? Pre Kevin Durant? 
"Kevin Durant didn't just cause the Rockets to miss 25+ 3-pointers, man. They should 30% on those and they blow the Warriors out. He upset the competitive balance, but this was the year the Warriors had real competition coming out of the West. "
"""Congrats to the Golden State Warriors and Kevin Durant"" lmaooooo"
Lol congratulations to the golden state warriors *and Kevin Durant*
Why did he say Kevin Durant separately wtf
"Yeah, Kevin Durant went from one of the best players in my mind to just another guy. Obviously he’s still one of the best players in the league, but I’m so unimpressed by him now because he plays with 3 of the other best players in the league and has way less pressure on him than someone like Lebron or even Westbrook. I liked the warriors before he joined them, but now they’re just annoying and all we can do is wait for them to get old. "
"""congrats to kevin durant""? what kind of trash is that"
"I don't know what this dude is saying, I'm gonna make sure my kids tell their kids the story of Kevin Durant "
SAS threatened similar players before like Kevin Durant. let's see if he's overstepped by taking on the king.
I like Kevin Durant.
Shut the fuck up he was battling against Kevin Durant Steph Curry and KT/DG this is literally lebron vs rondo allen pierce and garnett except shaq didn’t get injured like cp3. Houston is the only team to push them to 7 so suck my ass
"Blame Kevin Durant that Ariza was 0-12 (0-9 from 3, shut it down man). This was a good game and a good series."
"The NBA needs to do something to prevent super teams.  It's hurting the game, and eventually people are going to tire of the same finals matchup every single year.  Is anybody really going to be impressed if Kevin Durant gets a 2nd title?  As far as i'm concerned, nothing he has ""accomplished"" since joining GS means a damn thing.    It's lame, it's weak and it's a shame that we have to watch predictable, one sided basketball in the playoffs.  /rant"
FBI should arrest Kevin Durant
"Fouling Capela, moving screens, having Kevin Durant on the team..."
Kevin Durant literally ruined the NBA
"Warriors. Rockets. Celtics. Cavs.   Long ago the four franchises lived together in harmony, but everything changed when the Warriors signed Kevin Durant.  Only the the Rockets, master of the threeball could stop them, but in the 3rd quarter when threes were needed most, they vanished. "

"I'd like to take a moment, on this day, to thank Kevin ""The Servant"" Durant for leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder on July 4th, 2016. Not for going to the Flubs, but for leaving. The Bitch is all numbers, especially his favorite number, 2nd, and him leaving gave Russell Westbrook an opportunity to pursue history. Remember all of our 4th quarter meltdowns last year? It's because Russ would always defer to Skin n Bones. Look at Russ's clutchtime stats this year, it's remarkable. Little Nipples makes history by taking the hardest road, Russell ""King of the Prarie"" Westbrook makes history by breaking a 55 year old record that may never be broken again. Kevin is cursed, it's why he got injured, and now Steph is injured, he'll come up second again this year. And to top it all off Trump takes away our Szechuan sauce, damn. So thank you Mr. Durant, for being the real MVP, the real Ms. Durant, for getting your unclutch ass outta town.

"How does Kevin Durant hug, does he just wrap his slithery body around people?"
"I just have a hard time respecting a player as good as Kevin Durant joining a 73 win team that beat him from down 3-1, and then spend a year bitching about how he's being called a bitch for that decision. "
"Kevin Durant has ruined basketball, I’m not afraid to say it"
Time to take the hard road like my new idol Kevin Durant and become a warriors fan
"Well I was really upset with the way the last game was called, and I was upset with a few calls in this game, but I'm not upset. Taking it to 7 was more then anyone expected and we lost cp3 for the two most important games. Can't expect to win when you miss 22 3 pointers in a row. This game was in reach even without Chris and our guys couldn't execute down the stretch. But even with that said, fuck Kevin Durant, it took a miracle for this season to even be the least bit enjoyable for me and I can't imagine how I'd enjoy it if I was a fan of the 28 other teams in this league who know they don't have a shot from the beginning. "
Kevin Durant has really done willickered my nillickers!  Sorry for using such harsh langauge but Kevin is a meanie.
"Enough is enough! I have had it with this Warriors dominance. Adam Silver needs to fix this mess before the league becomes even more lopsided. It's not even fun anymore to watch the NBA when you know your team won't win anything important. The fact that Kevin Durant can take a paycut to help out the dirty owners and keep his dirty and unfair team alive. He's a dirty filthy snake that's only success has been to latch onto a 73-9 team and completely RUIN the NBA!!! Kevin Durant could have gone to any other team and it would have been fine but NOOO, he had to take his dirty talents to a team that has already proven to be dominant.  I want someone to start a go fund me page to stop this nonsense! Maybe if we raise enough money, Adam Silver and the NBA will have to do something about these snakes and this unfair game!

"The records show Green placed 134 calls to free agent Kevin Durant — more than the 126 posts Green made to his snapchat — between June 2016 and July 2016, the period during which he has confessed to either tampering or recruiting certain opposing players. The majority of the phone calls lasted no more than two minutes and occurred prior to and after games Green lost and on which he admits crying after."
where the fuck was this 11-21 2 turnover Kevin Durant when his team needed him the most in 2016?
" Injured forward Andre Iguodala yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Klay Thompson gave a look of pleasant surprise. Forward Draymond Green yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Durant hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"

Kevin Durant is just a choker who couldn’t get it done in OKC and joined a 73-9 team. Don’t forget that. 
"I don’t care what anyone says, Kevin Durant ruined basketball for the foreseeable future "
"My beef with Kevin Durant isn't that he's a bad player, it's that he's an exceptionally good player that joined a 73 win team that beat him when he was up 3-1. "
Kevin Durant isn’t the shadow of LeBrons shadow 
I wouldn’t have if they had Kevin Durant 
Thank you Kevin Durant for ruining the NBA
I just hope we can all agree that Kevin Durant doesn't really deserve any of his accolades past 2016 and this should forever be remembered by basketball fans. 
Kills me that the rockets tried so hard to compete with golden state and it's still not enough. Kevin Durant fucked the league
"I know what you mean.  Remember when Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden were all on the Thunder together?  It's insane that it's allowed."

Kevin Durant is much taller than Gordon
"In the Quadrilogy Era (2014-2015 through 2017-2018), here are their stats:  I've included all 25+ PPG scorers during that time period.  Regular Season:  * Stephen Curry - 26.4 PPG on 65.0 TS% * Kevin Durant - 26.5 PPG on 64.0 TS% * Lebron James - 26.1 PPG on 60.2 TS% * James Harden - 28.9 PPG on 60.9 TS% * Anthony Davis - 26.3 PPG on 58.6 TS% * DeMarcus Cousins - 25.9 PPG on 55.5 TS% * Russell Westbrook - 27.7 PPG on 54.2 TS%  Playoffs:  * Stephen Curry - 26.8 PPG on 61.8 TS% * Kevin Durant - 28.6 PPG on 59.5 TS% * Lebron James - 30.9 PPG on 58.0 TS% * James Harden - 27.9 PPG on 57.9 TS% * Anthony Davis - 30.5 PPG on 59.3 TS% * DeMarcus Cousins - Undefined * Russell Westbrook - 28.7 PPG on 50.7 TS%  All things considered, Curry is probably the best scorer. His volume is right there, and he is the efficiency leader of the pack for both regular season and playoffs.  With that said, for this playoff run specifically, Lebron has currently been a better scorer than Curry and Durant."
Kevin Durant 
Everyone posting in this thread is Kevin Durant and should feel sorry about their defense.
Also according to the website:  Kevin Durant scored 3-5 (60%) against Lebron. There’s no question who’s the better player though. 
"This is a pretty hot take. You're forgetting that that's Kevin Durant. If you have a choice between Kevin Durant and someone like Otto Porter (both are getting paid like 25 a year) to go to the Warriors, you would seriously pick Porter? That's just stupid. KD is a generational talent and would make any system better 100%."

"LeBron may have killed IT by now. And if he didn't, Kevin Durant would have roasted him in the Finals."
"The dude ruined his chance to be an all time great because I think he didn’t truly believe he was good enough to shoulder a load and face adversity as a leader and solidify his own legacy. You can talk about the decision and lebron’s choices all you want, but especially after 2011 he’s done nothing but rise up to the moment and defy the greatest odds. That’s how you forge a legacy for yourself and get put up there in the basketball pantheon. Kevin Durant instead decided he couldn’t be bothered to do that and just wanted the easiest route possible to rings so he piggybacked and bandwagoned off of something that was great and had its own legacy without him.   It’s his choice but I never want to hear him mentioned in the same sentence as the true greats when it’s all said and done. Unless he chooses to leave, that decision tarnished his legacy forever.   I think 90% of people agree with this though, but I’m just ranting lol. "
"Seriously I don't like Durant, but this was obviously a block.  Want to be mad at the officials, than be mad about them calling multiple clean strips on him as fouls, or be mad at George Hill, or Jr. Smith, or even Kevin Love.  This was pretty obviously a block, and Lebron gets this called as a block all the fucking time."
Kevin Durant has lost every game this year when he scored more than 40.  It's almost like singular stats don't necessarily win games or something.
"I agree that Kevin Durant definitely doesn't fit the mold. I still think they're at their best when Steph is just going bananas.  **HOWEVER** Kevin Durant gives them so much room for error. When he is on during the late stages of the 4th quarter it's not possible to beat the Warriors. In game 7 versus the Rockets he literally hit 3 ridiculous jump shots that buried them. While Durant wrecks some possessions, when hes on he literally makes a lead uncatchable "
"Kevin Durant himself literally said after last year's Finals ""Lebron passed the torch to me.""  It's been talked about all season how people think he might be on Lebron's level now.   Just because we know he's not doesn't mean there isn't talk about it. "
Kevin Durant is a bitch
Have you ever seen Kevin Durant and Toni Kukoc in the same room?
And he will be switched onto Kevin Durant as soon as he makes it past half court.
"You're wrong. Bron was clearly at the 3 point line and hadn't actually moved his feet for the entire possession when that Judas Kevin Durant did his best ""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch"" impression and gored James.  Sincerely, Cleveland Fans on this sub"
&gt;	LeBron passed me the torch.   -Kevin Durant
"this will be the 4th straight time GSW and the Cavs are meeting in the finals.  GSW: a generational team because of smart draft picks in Curry, Thompson, and Draymond Green, combined with sheer luck because of the cap situation which allowed them to sign former MVP Kevin Durant in the summer of 2016.  Cavs: Once thought as a cursed team, they were able to turn their fortunes around in 2014 as they hit the jackpot winning the draft lottery and getting the first pick. This attracts Lebron back to them and they trade the pick for Kevin Love to pair up with their young star in Kyrie Irving. Lebron was drafted by the Cavs but left for Miami for a bit, and comes back in an effort to win Cleveland a ring.  2014: Lebron's first year back as a Cavs player coincides with Warriors uprising after hiring Steve Kerr in the summer. Both teams make the finals but the Cavs are without all-stars Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving for the finals. Regardless, Lebron puts up an incredible performance, taking the Warriors to 6 basically on his own, but lose the series. Iguodala wins Finals MVP for ""guarding him"".  2015: Warriors have a historic season, breaking the regular season win record and go 73-9. Lebron gets his revenge as the two teams meet in the finals again. Warriors take a 3-1 lead but Lebron and company miraculously take 3 games in a row and win the title. Lebron and Kyrie had huge games and Kyrie hits a huge 3 in the end in game 7. Legendary finals comeback. Cleveland erupts, the curse has been broken. Long Live the King.  2016: Former MVP and top 3 player Kevin Durant announces that he is signing with the Golden State Warriors, having been knocked out by them in the previous playoffs, and many people are angry about this considering OKC had a 3-1 lead against the Warriors and almost beat them, and now he was joining the other side. If you can't beat em, join em I guess. This powershift in the league shocks everybody. Both teams reach the finals and GSW basically steamrolls the Cavs, 4-1. Gg. KD gets his ring but GSW are now seen as the villains of the NBA.  2018: Here we are. JR Smith dun goof'd game 1, robbing us of a historic moment in the NBA and Lebrons career. The story continues    "
"Here’s my quick rundown for you  LeBron gets drafted in 03 to his hometown Cavs plays with them until 2009-2010 season. In that time he made one finals carrying a shit team but getting swept by the Spurs   LeBron leaves for the Miami Heat, making one of the first modern day “superteams” joining other star players Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. This team makes 4 straight finals, winning two of them.   LeBron makes his return to the hometown Cavs, who were a terrible team while he was away. They got assets like Kyrie Irving Tristan Thompson and Andrew Wiggins (who was then traded for Kevin Love)   Meanwhile in the Western Conference Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green were becoming star players. Curry and Thompson showing a skill for shooting that the Leauge has never seen.   LeBrons Cavs and the Warriors make the finals in 2015 (the first meeting of the teams.) The Cavs were already down Kevin Love who got hurt earlier in the playoffs when at the end of the first game Kyrie Irving gets hurt, the Cavs lose in 6. LeBron still puts up amazing stats.  In the 2016 Western Conference finals the Warriors are down 3-1 to the OKC Thunder, who feature star players Russel Westbrook and Kevin Durant. The Warriors end up grinding out a win, coming back with the Win and making their Second straight NBA finals. With a dejected OKC team wondering if they will ever jump over the hump.  The Cavs and Warriors meet for the second year in a row. The Warriors are up 3-1, then much in the fashion of the Western Conference Finals, the Cavs end up coming back in the series and winning in 7 games helped my some historic games of both Kyrie Irving and Lebron James. The Warriors had beat the NBA regular season record for wins with 73 that season.   Because of the perfect storm that was my last two paragraphs, Kevin Durant, who two months earlier lost to the Warriors in embarrassing fashion, announces he is joining Golden State.   The Cavs and Warriors again meet for the third straight year. The 73 win warriors added another superstar, and the Cavs were no match losing in 5 games.   Kyrie Irving wants his own team and announces he wants to be traded from Clevland. Clevland trades him to boston.  The Cavs never fully recovered from losing Irving, and the players they got back in the trade never panned out for them. It is Lebron and Love vs the world.  The Cavs, absolutely willed by amazing performances night in and night out by Lebron, make it back to the finals, meeting the Warriors who just got past the 65 win rockets.  JR Smith drinks too much henny. Now here we are.   TL/DR: Kevin Durant is a snake    "
"GM: ""You have the ball under the basket with 5 seconds left in a tie game. You are likely to be eaten by a Kevin Durant. What is your action?""  JR: ""Do I have anything in my inventory?""  GM: ""No, just the ball.""  JR: ""I search the court for loot!"""
LeBron James scored 49 points for his team and was running back to get on defense in case Kevin Durant got the rebound which he almost did.  Contrary to popular belief LeBron does need some help from his teammates out there and JR Smith and ty lue did not live up to the challenge.
do you not remember how dray was so shook that his team couldn’t beat lebron he called Kevin Durant in the parking lot right after game 7
Remind me to never turn my back on Kevin Durant.
"https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/31/17416184/lebron-james-charge-kevin-durant-overturned-block-foul-cavs-warriors-game-1-nba-finals  This explains the call, and how they got it right, if youre interested  If they did that to my team, sure is be a little pissed, but they did get the call right...so you cant really get too mad about it"
I mean if GSW could get Kevin Durant in free agency.....
I will forever dread the day that Lebron retires and we're left with Kevin Durant being the 'best' player in the NBA.   It just won't feel right.
"Kevin Durant definitely made the right decision he's such a great player, also this was the hardest route and he couldn't win with OKC. I still respect him as a player he's so good"
westbrook is not on that same level as kevin durant and harden and kawhi
&gt; LeBron had 51 points and a near triple double and still lost  It's a testament to how out of reach the Warriors became after Kevin Durant joined the team.  I don't think it bodes well for the popularity of the league in the foreseeable future. 
Kevin Durant isn't even the best player on his own team.
"So?  Here, I'll let you check this out. Should clear things up for you and anyone else who is confused by the call  https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/31/17416184/lebron-james-charge-kevin-durant-overturned-block-foul-cavs-warriors-game-1-nba-finals  🍻 "
There is a Kevin Durant right there with the “oh shoot I messed up” level of retaliation mindset. I don’t know if I go for it there.
"Well, if you put Melo instead of Lebron on this cavs team, would they even make playoffs??  I think people expected to much of Melo. He's not an elite player.  I don't even think Kevin Durant could take this cavs team to the finals though.   This begs the question, is there any other single player besides Lebron that could have taken this current Cavaliers team to the finals?  Edit: I'm talking about active players on this Active cavs roster in this active season. Not historical players. "
"&gt; KD didn’t show up,  that is the problem. if KD doesn't show up, he can rely on Curry, Thompson, and Draymond to show up. If Lebron has a bad game for his standards (shooting less than 60% FG for example), he relies on Kevin Love, JR Smith, Thompson and Korver to show up. Kevin Love outside of the Toronto series hasn't been much of a scoring threat and his defensive issues are well documented. Everything has to go right for the Cavs to win whereas the Warriors can play poorly (like they did last night) and still win. Kevin Durant has a history of performing well in the playoffs. If anything last game was an outlier for KD. Lebron isn't scoring 50 a game.   By the way, I think it is telling that KD didn't show up and logged **26 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists, 3 blocks.**  "
They're supposed to win because Kevin Durant joined a dynastic talent.  Was anyone surprised when the Dream Team won gold?
"They stated why the reviewed it. Per [ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23665810/call-reversal-pivotal-call-leaves-cleveland-cavaliers-lebron-james-frustrated-game-1-loss-golden-state-warriors):  &gt;""It's not about proximity [to the restricted area],"" McCutchen told ESPN. ""It's about doubt. There are many instances when, as an official, your head is on a swivel. **For instance, on that play, Jeff Green's foot is on the line as well. What looks on the front side to be obvious, isn't obvious from [where the lead official is positioned].** When you have a collision of three bodies in the restricted area, sometimes if you caught that play late, sometimes there is doubt.""

"Dude EXACTLY lol I can't believe we don't roast Draymond more for this PUSSY ass shit.  Especially when he was so cocky calling LeBron a bitch in game 4 after their scuffle.    Then LeBron owns your team for 3 games in a row to complete the greatest comeback ever, and your bitch ass is crying calling KEVIN DURANT in the parking lot after game 7 saying how much they need him?    Draymond Green is a straight up loud mouth pussy ass BITCH lmao god damn the warriors suck"
" Heres the quote for those too lazy to read 4 paragraphs of set up.  TL:DR; 12.3, near same as last year, but higher peak than last years.  Scoring a 12.3 in metered market results, Game 1 of the 2018 NBA Finals was basically even with Game 1 of the 2017 match\-up. That Warriors winning face\-off with LeBron and crew at Oracle Arena [on June 1 last year](https://deadline.com/2017/06/nba-finals-game-1-ratings-warriors-kevin-durant-beat-shazam-the-amazing-race-abc-1202106405/) went on to garner 18.7 million viewers, which turned out to be the lowest viewership of a hard fought five game series eventually won by the Warriors 4\-1. In context, this virtual match with 2017 comes in an environment when almost everyone and everything \(I’m talking to you NFL\) is down year to year in the ratings.  Interestingly and perhaps very telling of where this NBA Finals could go, the 14.9 ratings peak of last night’s Game 1 was up 7&amp;#37; from the best that last year’s Game 1 did in the 10:15 – 10:30 time period. That peak last night came in both the 11:15 – 11:30 and 11:30 – 11:45 time periods as the tied game went into OT. Having its best night since the Oscars earlier this year, ABC obviously cleaned up on broadcast and cable."
Kevin Durant 
I like Kevin Durant 
I understand how retarded that play was. But if Kevin Durant does his job we aren’t even talking about JR. We’re talking about the refs and George Hill
No. George hill missed the ft. JR Smith got the rebound OVER 6’11” kevin durant. Not JR’s fault
"Kevin Durant was driving towards the basket, and LeBron stepped in front of him. That's a legal play if certain criteria are met about how soon he got there, whether and how he was moving, whether Durant had already started to shoot--and, in particular, whether LeBron was inside the ""restricted area,"" a small semicircle near the basket. Durant ran into LeBron, who fell down. It was called a charge (foul on Durant), but one ref thought LeBron was in the restricted area. If there's uncertainty about the restricted area part, they can look at the video to check, and a relatively new rule says that if they're doing that they can also reconsider whether it was a charge or a block. They did that and decided that while LeBron was outside the legal area, he did not meet the criteria for a legal play in other respects, so they changed it to a blocking foul, which meant that instead of the Warriors losing the ball, Durant got two fouls shots.  People here will tell you it was obvious that he was outside the restricted area so the review shouldn't have happened. But we have a better angle to see such things on TV--the refs have to figure it out at eye level and full speed with lots of bodies moving around. "
Don't forget that 73-9 roster was pre Durant. They ADDED Kevin Durant to a 73-9 roster at the cost of essentially Bogut Barbosa and Barnes. 
"The main reason that call was reviewed was because the two referees had conflicting calls on the play.  Ken called it a block, while Tony called it a charge. - this is one of the main reasons they went for the review.  And the rule that you can only review if they are within the restricted area is outdated and obsolete.  This very year two games - one for OKC and one for the Knicks had such a review.  Last year the same call was overturned, against Kevin Durant in the playoffs.  The precedent for such calls are there. "
"Over the course of an entire season Lebron is still ahead, comfortably.  In terms of head to head matchups?  Kevin Durant is right next to Lebron, as much as Lebron fans may not like to admit it.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/h2h_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;player_id1_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1_select=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players  Aside from this atrocious first game.  KD does a very respectable job at going HAM everytime he plays Bron."
"Kevin Durant has made himself the new Robert Horry. He'll have the rings, but will become a punchline when people discuss the GOAT."
"With all due respect to Kevin Durant, I feel like the gap between him and Lebron is a lot larger than I thought it was. Last year during this time, they almost seemed like equals. Sure some of it can be credited to Durant playing with a couple of great players and lebrons usage rate being so high this year, but it just feels like Lebron is head and shoulders the greatest player in the world."

All that plus KEVIN DURANT!!!!  hohoohohohohoo
"LeBron goes 19/32, rest of the team shoots 38%,  or 33% without Kevin Love. When the best player on your team takes 1/3rd of your shots and makes 60% of them AND goes 10/11 from the line, you should only have to play sort of competently to win. Nothing exciting, just get out there and shoot 44-45%. Something like a team in the bottom 3rd of the league. And yet the Cavs can’t even manage that.   Meanwhile Kevin Durant, taking a ride down the hardest road, goes 8-22, 1-7 from 3 and it like, doesn't even impact the Warriors. They still effortlessly put up 124."
"Per 538, it is true. And I believe it passes the eye-test too.  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/kevin-durant/"
"&gt;the only time they got lucky was when Kevin Durant decided to sign with them  yeah, through the warriors dynasty, the only time they ever got lucky was KD signing with them. only thing. yup."
"You don't have to pretend Durant is your favourite player to make a post criticising him, you can just criticise him. This is r/nba, home of Kevin Durant Haters."
"I got downvoted a ton, but Durant is not a Top 5 player, per 538 statistical projections. And he's really not that close either.   Curry, Draymond, LeBron, Westbrook, Harden. These guys are all (pretty significantly) better than Durant.  And I don't hate the Durant; I love his jump shooting game. He's just NOT THAT AMAZING.  And the Warriors are definitely a super team. They have 5 great players (including Iggy who might be their 4th best of that group; he's that good).  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/kevin-durant/"
"This is the point people forget. The Warriors were talked about with great respect before KD went there. Because they built it from the ground up, and did everything right, and won 73 games. Then they lost in the finals after being up 3-1. The Cavs became a story of David vs. Goliath. Then the warriors got Kevin Durant. So that’s like saying Goliath lost, so he found the strongest, albeit weak minded, beast to team up with. How do you not root against that?"
"I do not understand why people the Golden State Warriors. They're amazing, and they became amazing through being an incredibly well run organization. They didn't draft their talent by being balls to the wall terrible and getting a few first overalls, they drafted it with phenomenal scouting. Klay and Steph were mid first rounder and Draymond was drafted in the second round. They absolutely nailed it with Steve Kerr. They make extremely smart free agent additions like Andre Iguodala, and they take risks on players like Jordan Bell that end up paying off. Everything the Warriors have they worked for and earned, and the only time they got lucky was when Kevin Durant decided to sign with them. That didn't put the Warriors over the top, though, they already had the best team in the league that had won the championship the year before, all through being a phenomenal organization. And with all this success, they also seem to have the best culture in the NBA and an extremely tight knit group.   Then there are the Cavs, an organization that hasn't really been able to put together a good roster in 30 years and happened to have a top 3 all time talent born in Akron, who they were shitty enough to draft in 2003. The Cavaliers is a pretty bad organization, that makes pretty bad decisions frequently, and will go back to being at the bottom of the league if Lebron decides to leave this summer. Their success is entirely attributable to Lebron being born nearby, and not any particularly smart drafting or smart moves in free agency.   Yet everyone hates the Warriors, an organization that completely homebrewed its success through really smart decision making?  It's so dumb. "
"LeBron hopped from super team to super team with dreams of sitting back while other stars helped with the load , didn't work out but for Kevin Durant is has.  Durant is living LeBron's dream. "
Almost as crazy as..... the warriors core plus Kevin Durant!!
There's no way you can guarantee that JR would somehow rebound it over Kevin Durant. Hill was trying to make that FT for sure.
Lebron and Kevin Durant are both professional basketball players
"I mean, Kevin Durant wasn't Kevin Durant tonight either. Dude was not there the 2nd half at all."
"To piggyback on this post, among 20 PPG scorers for the playoffs from the 14-15 season to the current season, Curry is tied with Giannis for the 2nd best defensive player from that group of 21 players in terms of defensive rating.  The only volume scorer that has been a better defender than Curry in the playoffs over that timespan? Lebron James, by a single point.  During the Warriors dynasty run, Curry has a better playoff defensive rating than Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Kawhi Leonard, Al Horford, Chris Paul, Klay Thompson, Danny Green, Marcus Smart, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, etc.  Since 15-16, there are a total of 63 players in the NBA that have played in 20 or more playoff games and averaged more than 24 MPG.  Of those players, only 6 have a higher defensive rating than Curry. Draymond Green (who is #1), DeAndre Jordan, Paul Millsap, Bismack Biyombo, Dwight Howard, and Lebron James. Curry is tied with Bazemore and Gobert with a defensive rating of 104 for the playoffs.  This means that Curry has been the best defensive guard in the playoffs for the past 4 seasons according to defensive rating.    "
You mean like the Warriors when they had to sign Kevin Durant in order to overcome Lebron when they already had a team capable of 73 wins?
[Look at the official tweets from the NBA](https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/31/17416184/lebron-james-charge-kevin-durant-overturned-block-foul-cavs-warriors-game-1-nba-finals) they say it was reviewed because  they weren't sure if LeBron was in the restricted area.
Yeah man when will this sub start hating on their golden child Kevin Durant
fuck kevin durant and the stupid warriors 
"https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/31/17416184/lebron-james-charge-kevin-durant-overturned-block-foul-cavs-warriors-game-1-nba-finals     Second one is a missed call     Third one: clear foul on Nance, so the end result is the same"
"&gt; Being the OG that he is, JR could not, not take them and was crossing into the astral realm right as he corralled the rebound over Kevin Durant.  JR: Dormammu, I have come to bargain!  Dormammu: **PASS THE BALL, YOU STUPID FUCK.**"
"This was posted further up:   &gt; There’s a common misperception that a block/charge call can only be reversed based on whether the player was in the restricted area or not. The official wording is somewhat unclear, but this is not the first time a block/charge call was overturned in the final two minutes despite no change in where the defender’s feet are located. It happened in a Thunder-Pacers game in December, when this charge taken by Josh Huestis was overturned on a replay.  https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/31/17416184/lebron-james-charge-kevin-durant-overturned-block-foul-cavs-warriors-game-1-nba-finals   "
Kevin Love gives curry the and one.   Foul call changes from charge to blocking.  Clean wipe from Hill on Durant gets called a foul 
"Kevin Durant is more valuable offensively than defensively. That's not just true of him, it will be true of any star, with the exception of maybe some big men. If you have a player who's a 7/10 offensively, and a 7/10 defensively, he'll still be more valuable offensively because the defensive aspect of the game is a lot less distinct. Defense is still important, and some guys are still better than others, but the variance in value is not equivalent to what we see on offense. Durant is likely to compromise himself on defense to avoid foul trouble, and to save himself for offense, which is the right decision...that would be the case regardless, but even that idea withstanding...yeah, he could've been better defensively. "
OP forgot to mention that he didnt box out on that Hill FT and got out rebounded by JR fucking smith.  People killing JR but how the fuck does a 7ft forward not box out a 6'5 guard on a free throw when its tied.  JR smith saved Kevin Durant.
"&gt; What? You don't get tossed after one tech.  Come on man, have you not been watching the NBA this season?? At least know the rules before trying to tell other people they're wrong about how they work.  LeBron got ejected after one technical:   [""Fitzgerald also said he ejected James “on one technical” foul instead of issuing a double-tech, and that there was “nothing at all. Nothing that I’m aware of” in the third quarter that fed into LeBron’s ejection.""](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/11/29/16714822/lebron-james-ejected-referee-explanation-why-cavs-vs-heat)  Durant got ejected after one technical:   [""It appeared that it only took one technical for the referee to eject Durant, who was mad that a foul was called on the floor and not as an and-one floater.""](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/12/1/16726590/kevin-durant-ejected-lebron-anthony-davis-trend-nba)"
Kevin Durant from Draymond in the parking lot
Kevin Durant was trash on both ends. Dude looked lazy defensively and that's inexcusable considering who you are guarding. 
"2016 was unlikely, this is absurd.  It sort of reminds me of that Jim Gaffigan joke ""having 3 kids feels like you're drowning, and then somebody hands you a baby.""  It's like that, if that baby was Kevin Durant joining the Warriors. "
"Should be the one of LeBron ""maybe in the restricted area.""  A 73 win team needs Kevin Durant and can only win at home with a rigged game. The worst part is morons in the future will count it against LeBron's legacy and for Durant."
"They were unsure if he was within the restricted zone when they called the foul, hence they went to the replay. Obviously they were in disagreement if two refs signaled different calls.   Once in review, you can look to see if the defender was in legal position. They determined he was not set, and was sliding with his shoulder into Kevin Durant. Textbook blocking foul.   I get your upset, but they did everything by the book. The call went against you. It was close, but I believe it was the right call.   I only watch kings games and playoffs, didn’t see it happen before. Doesn’t it mean it wasn’t the right call.   Edit: also look up the damn rule yourself, it takes 10 seconds to google."
That Cavs team had Kyrie Irving. That Warriors team didn't have Kevin Durant. 
I really don't think there are adjustments to be made. They came out and had a near perfect game plan and GS shot terribly and Lebron had an insane game and they still lost. Fuck Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant got so lucky. Got out muscled and pushed under the hoop by JR on that rebound. And somehow comes away with the game. Durant choked in the 4th quarter too.
Kevin Durant should be hated on just as much for forgetting how to box out
"The gap isn't that large. People need to keep in mind this is only 1 game.  Since 2014-2015, here are the key guys stats in the playoffs:  * Lebron James - 30.6 Points on 57.8 TS%, 9.8 rebounds, 8.2 assists. * Stephen Curry - 26.8 Points on 61.8 TS%, 5.6 rebounds, 5.9 assists * Kevin Durant - 28.6 Points on 59.7 TS%, 7.3 rebounds, 3.9 assists  It's hard to say that there's much of a gap at all. Curry is probably the best scorer of the bunch. He has less volume (almost entirely a product of playing less minutes), but his efficiency has been significantly better than Lebron's.   Lebron and Steph are probably pretty close in terms of playmaking, and both are better than Durant.   Lebron has the highest offensive rating of 117, followed by Durant 116, and Curry 115.   Lebron has been the best defender of the group at 103, followed by Curry at 104, and then Durant at 105.  Curry is actually tied with Giannis as the 2nd best defender by defensive rating among the 20 PPG playoff scorers during this time period, despite having a poor defensive reputation.  Overall, Lebron edges Curry for the best, with Durant slightly below Curry. "

"&gt; For whatever it's worth I don't feel good about it.  Thank you. Your words mean a lot coming from a Warriors fan.  For context, I should be a neutral, but I enjoy watching great basketball first and foremost, and as such I have a soft spot especially for the Spurs and the pre-2017 Warriors. Great defensive schemes, coaching, and ball movement on the offensive court all excite the basketball fan within me.   My favourite player in the league is Klay, I really like Steph, and (for the most part) I find Draymond's antics extremely entertaining as an NBA product.   And yet with all this I **STILL** can't stomach cheering for the Warriors post-2017 purely because of Kevin Durant. I cannot respect the man for the absolute lack of a backbone in wanting to compete for a chip and for him to continue to accrue rings which he could win seated on a bench for the duration of the Finals irks me to no end.  I have so much vitriol toward KD not only because his cowardly decision (from a competitive standpoint), but also because he took away my enjoyment of watching one of the greatest basketball teams of all time. "
i mean kyle korver and kevin love are basically just fine it's just they're not kevin durant
Lebron James was called for a blocking foul that gave Kevin Durant 2 free throws to tie the game when it should have been Bron with the ball with the Cavs up 2. That was not even a reviewable call. Biggest bullshit I’ve ever seen man. Under a minute left in the game too. 
https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/31/17416184/lebron-james-charge-kevin-durant-overturned-block-foul-cavs-warriors-game-1-nba-finals
"[Bruh, they made the correct call based on a rules change.](https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/31/17416184/lebron-james-charge-kevin-durant-overturned-block-foul-cavs-warriors-game-1-nba-finals)"
"You're getting downvoted for flair, but I just wanted to let you know.. Kevin Durant is a bitch "
"Draymond Green of all the Warriors players somehow has the audacity to talk smack. He was a second round pick for a reason. He isn’t shit without Curry, Durant, and Thompson. Period. J.R. fucked up, yes. I hope with all the power that comes from the league wide hatred of the warriors that the Cavs supporting cast pulls of an amazing game. J.R. redeems himself with a great shooting night. George hill takes some distributing pressure of Lebron. Kyle Korver and Kevin Love knock down their shots. Lebron deserves this retaliation from his team. No one should lose after a 50 point performance, I hope the Cleveland Cavaliers are blood thirsty in Game 2 for revenge and serve it up on a platter to even the series. "
"No, it really isn't. The fact Kevin Durant can play so poorly and the Warriors still win the game is honestly comical. If LeBron plays like that the Cavs lose by 50 and he never hears the end of it. Durant ain't even in the same stratosphere bruh. "
Kevin durant and being bitch made
Welp. Cavs are fucked. This is a 73 wins team plus Kevin Durant and 3 refs. Not to mention the Donkey Green learns how to poke eyes besides dick kicking. Historically lethal team it is.
It also happened to you guys just this season.  https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/31/17416184/lebron-james-charge-kevin-durant-overturned-block-foul-cavs-warriors-game-1-nba-finals
you didn’t see tentacle arm Kevin Durant standing right next to him?  he should have just gotten LeBron the ball. 
Kevin Durant made himself look silly by joining the Warriors. 
"* They try to sign Dwight and he goes to HOU.  * They win 2015 playing against the Cavs missing 2 all-stars and it still went to 6 (not to mention Memphis earlier).  * They go down 3-1 in 2016 only to see OKC choking and Klay going supernova. * Kevin fucking Durant decides to join after apparently the only time luck wasn't on their side. * I looks like the Spurs might oppose them in 2017 but Zaza kills Kawhi * Some terrible calls against Houston too that shifted the momentum of the game completely * They almost lose Thompson at the beginning of this game but he comes back and makes some huge shots  Seriously, fuck them."
because ~7ft tall Kevin Durant was standing next to him
"This series is over.  I know this sub has a bi-polar love of Lue, I do as well, but the reality is that first game absolutely fucking demoralized this team. Why Lue didn't tell everyone they had a time out and to call it as soon as they got the rebound is just as fucking stupid as JR dribbling out the clock.  Secondly, I like Jeff Greene but why the fuck is he jacking up so many 3s? Why isn't Korver taking more off the screens?  Also it seems the Cavs have gotten completely away from the Pick And Roll, which is odd to me because they do well at it. It seems whenever Lebron straight up drives in they score.   This is frustrating as hell to watch, at the same time I didn't expect them to get by the Raptors, I thought they may lose to Boston in game 7... yet here we are. I guess I'll take it.  In a way I take solace in the fact that we won a chip on one of the greatest comebacks ever. With that being said, it's my opinion that we may have won the first meeting as well with a healthy Love and Kyrie. And that it took a Kevin Durant to go to Golden State to really beat the Cavs.  /rant"
no kevin durant was. curry was downright turd in 3 of the games. you have no idea what you are talking about. but keep acting like this sub is beneath you to make yourself feel better.
"Can someone explain to me why the Cavs switch on screens so damn easily? I'm sick of Kevin Love having to be on an island against Curry. I get that trapping isn't going to work because he's a great passer but why can't Hill/JR fight over screens more and make Curry attack the rim. Also, why tf do Cav's defenders HUG Draymond on defense. Make the man shoot and live with the results. Switching screens may have worked for Houston but they are 10x the team defensively the Cavs are. Props to Durant for shooting over 6'3"" Hill all game and for Curry cooking Love, but Lue has to make an adjustment. Bringing Green into the lineup would help. Put Green on KD and Lebron on Klay. IDK, just my two cents but Kerr is outcoaching Lue but Lue has to make an adjustment at some point. "
"Cap wise? Not a lot they can do. They're already over the cap for next year with all of their guaranteed salary (Steph, Klay, Draymond, Andre, Shaun, Quinn Cook, Damian Jones, and Jordan Bell). This would force LeBron to sign either some form of the Mid-Level Exception, or take a Veteran Minimum if he'd like to SIGN with the Warriors.  If he were to opt in however, there are a couple of trades that you can construct to get him, but it would require sacrificing one of the All-Stars not named Kevin Durant to do so if you wanted to acquire him in July (which you would have to)."
Kevin Durant
I think he's citing the Kevin Durant foul on LeBron. But I believe it was called a rip through and he only got shots because they were in the penalty. The announcers just called it improperly.
Kevin Durant. 
"No one blames your origination for signing KD, personally I like Steph, Klay and Dray.   I just hate Kevin Durant more than I like everyone else in that team combined. "
"This may be an ""eye of the beholder situation"" though.   Prior to Kevin Durant, the Steve Kerr-Splash Brothers Warriors got worse during the playoffs (as most teams are expected to do). They fell from a 85.3% win percentage down to 67.4%, and their point differential fell from +10.5 to +5.8.  **2015 playoffs**  R1: 4-0 over New Orleans (+30 differential)  R2: 4-2 over Memphis (+48 differential)  R3: 4-1 over Houston (+41 differential)  R4: 4-2 over Cleveland (+43 differential)  **2016 playoffs**  R1: 4-1 over Houston (+96 differential)  R2: 4-2 over Portland (+22 differential)  R3: 4-3 over Oklahoma City ( - 6 differential)  R4: 3-4 loss to Cleveland ( - 6 differential)  So either the team wasn’t as dominant as presumed before Durant, or now they’re so good that they don’t need to try in the regular season at all (which skews off the “they’re better in the playoffs!” idea.)"
Lol since when are Kevin Durant/warriors/thunder fans insecure about LeBron? 
the thing is hill deserves more hate than jr. he missed the free throw in the clutch moment kevin durant was all over jr and he would probly miss the shot if he attempted it 
"- Phantom calls on Kevin Love? Check.  - Draymond Green fouling everyone with no calls? Check.  - Lebron gets fouled and no calls? Check.  - Refs coddling Durant when he gets embarrased with strips? Check.  - Lue and TT getting an overreaction Tech after another embarrasing refball game? Check.   Nothing out of the ordinary...  EDIT: Real men don't downvote without responding or challenging, bunch of cowards afraid of truth."
"I don't think so. There were super teams and then you guys added Kevin Durant to your super team. So the only shot at winning is praying some draft picks are homeruns and get some stars hrough trade or free agency to match your mega super team. The league is soon going to be as top heavy as ever because of the Snek move. And because of that, rings will definitely mean more than they have for the past few years."
"First, LeBron Akron.  Then, LeBron gone.  In Miami, LeBron enjoy thongs.  Next, LeBron won.  Then, LeBron correct wrong.  But with injured team, LeBron only scrape along.  In 2016, LeBron was doubted yearlong.  Against all odds, LeBron prove them all wrong.  Then, Kevin Durant come along.  In 2017, LeBron's challenge too strong.  Now, LeBron play with team of tag alongs.  Soon, LeBron say so long.  In Philadelphia, he belong.  But instead, he team up with Klay to hit the bong.  Finito, LeBron's Swan Song."
Harrison Barnes is actually better than Kevin Durant. Warriors fucked up big time
"Direct quote from 2016:  Durant says this is ""the hardest road,"" not the easiest to a championship.   Don’t downvote me for quoting Kevin Durant."
Even as a giant Kevin Durant stan there is something oddly satisfying about a players patented move being used against them. Bad call or not KD has been doing this for years to the point the rule is named after him. Same thing with James Harden not getting those 3pt shooting fouls in game 7 last series
It's too bad they can't double him because he'd have Kevin Durant and Klay just waiting for wide open shots.  
It gives you one Kevin Durant
" Kevin ""Weakest move by a superstars"" Durant"
We all know you're talking about Kevin Durant lmao
LeBron didn't average 40/10/10 on 56/45/85 splits while playing 46 MPG in 2015. Kevin Durant wasn't on the GSW in 2015 either.
Fantastic hesitation pull-up jumpshot by Kevin Durant.  
I'd rank Kevin Durant in my top 50  But I'd rank him number 1 in my list of most deadly snakes.
Kevin durant
Kevin Durant for JR Smith
"Garnett, Durant, McHale, and Johnson?   He and Kevin Johnson are honestly probably pretty comparable - career PERs within 1.0, eFG% within .002, WS /48 within 0.003, comparable BPM and VORP, relatively comparable per 36s (similar scoring, Love considerably outrebounded Johnson and Johnson considerably outassisted and stole him which is to be expected for PG v PF), 5 all star games for love v 3 for Johnson but 3 all NBA teams for Johnson vs 2 for Love. Love probably finishes better than Johnson imo but depends where his next few years go.  Willis is probably also not far behind but falls off so hard once the turn of the century hit I can't really think to put him above Love, especially given that Willis' peak also wasn't better than Love's.  The next closest Kevin in terms of WS is Kevin Joyce, a career 10.6/1.7/3.2/0.9/0.2 guy in the ABA with a career .447 TS% , so it's one of those."
"Curry is healthy, Draymond will play all games, Kyrie Irving is in Boston, Kevin Durant is in Oakland, perhaps most importantly... Harrison Barnes is in Dallas."
"PG: Patty Mills &lt;&lt;&lt; Steph Curry  SG: Kawhi Leonard &gt; Ray Allen  SF: LeBron James &gt; Kevin Durant  PF: LaMacrus Aldridge = Draymond Green  C: Shaq &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Zaza Pachulia  6: Rudy Gay &lt;&lt; Klay Thompson   7: Manu Ginobili &lt;&lt; Reggie Miller  8:  Pau Gasol = David West  Coach: Gregg Popovich &gt; Steve Kerr  I think I take San Antonio in 7, but it's very close. I don't think GS has an answer for Shaq at all. "
I agree.  I did a lengthy video essay on why I see his championships as unearned and also comparing his decision to the one LeBron made in 2010:  [Kevin Durant is a Bitch](https://youtu.be/4DSUEnBclQ8)
Was a great shot but why the hell is Kevin Love guarding Steph Curry?? Is Lue ever gonna do any coaching? Switching every screen obviously isn't working. George Hill got roasted by KD all night. Its not physically possible for guys like George Hill and JR Smith to guard Durant or for Kevin Love to guard Steph Curry.. This is not something thats happening a few possessions a game. KD's primary method of scoring was to post up a guard a 1/2 foot smaller after getting the switch off a bs screen. I could understand if the screens and offensive sets were that great but half the time they're switching on screens where theres no physical contact between the screener and the defender. Seriously the worst defensive strategy I've ever seen in basketball games that are supposed to mean something. NBA fell off.. Nobody wanna compete anymore.
"If you would have told me in 2016 when the Warriors signed a guy named Kevin Durant, that he would be one of the best players in the world and win back to back Finals, I would have called you a fuckin dumbass. I never heard of the guy before. This is unprecedented. Has a no name ever become so great overnight? This is remarkable. He has truly ventured the hardest road and come out better for it."
hey remember the time in 2014-2015 when he and the warriors beat the cavs in the finals without kevin durant?
Kevin Durant.   Karl Malone was 40 I think and already paid his dues. 
From my experience on r/nba the reffing has been terrible in every Warriors game since Kevin Durant joined them
"No Kevin ""Better than LeBron"" Durant."
Let it be a Kevin Durant 3 buzzer beater
The Golden State Warriors + Kevin Durant + the refs did well today. 
"List of players (loosely) I would rather have for any given game in a vacuum, going by the order of team flairs in the subreddit banner:  Nikola Jokic, Paul Milsap, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, James Harden, Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan,  Marc Gasol, Jimmy Butler, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Boogie Cousins, Jrue Holiday, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, (Devin Booker?), Damian Lillard, Cj McCollum, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kawhai, Rudy Gobert, (Donovan Mitchell?), Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, Kemba Walker, LeBron James, Blake Griffin, Victor Oladipo, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kristaps, Joel Embiid, (Ben Simmons?), DeMar Derozan, Kyle Lowry, John Wall, Bradley Beal.    I'm probably leaving out a few and overrating a few, but he's top 30-40 ish in my mind. That list is a lot longer than I was expecting it to be. "
Kevin Durant*   Warriors with Steph and Klay leading the team would've been a lot more entertaining. 
"You can be a Suns fan and also be a fan of LeBron James. A novel idea, eh?   No one gives a damn about you. Your opinion is irrelevant. Kevin Durant will be an NBA champion &amp; FMVP regardless of how you feel."
"If Golden State doesn't exist, he may honestly have 0.  2015: James Harden and Dwight Howard win their first championship with the Houston Rockets over the Cavs, who were missing Kyrie Irving (broken knee cap in game 1 of the finals) and Kevin Love.   2016: Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook win their first championship for the Thunder, joining their former teammate as champions. The Cavs trade Kevin Love for Carmelo Anthony during the summer.  2017: Kawhi Leonard wins the MVP, leads the Spurs to a 60+ win season, and finishes up his dream season without getting cheap shotted by any Georgian players, beating the Thunder in 7 games, delivering the Spurs their first championship without Tim Duncan. The Cavs look much worse i the finals as it appears trading for Carmelo Anthony was a big mistake.  2018: The Thunder, in their 2nd season with Oladipo and Al Horford gel and  win 73 games and go 16-0 in the playoffs. NBA fans say the league is going to be too boring because of the OKC super team.   "
"People generally like JVG more than the other color guys. He's not a ""play-by-play"" guy, mike breen is there to give us 0 opinions on anything. He talks about basketball, its his job. Hes allowed to talk  about rules, players and what he does/doesn't like.  Reggie Miller is garbage. C-Webb can be good but sometimes fucks up. Guys like Hubie Brown and Fratello were much worse that JVG. JVG is more entertaining than most.   JVG is one of the few TV guys with the balls to call out the NBA and actually state his opinion. That doesn't mean you have to agree with it all the time, but its refreshing to hear it.   Dude doesn't like the NBA all time winning team adding Kevin Durant, get over it. The reason this sub is on his dick is because most of us agree with him. Therefor his opinion matches that of the majority. "
Kevin Durant in his prime &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 number one picks in 4 years
"Bad precedent to encourage pay cuts to keep a team stacked. And the ""except 1"" being KEVIN DURANT is a big deal when he is widely considered the best player on the team"
"[yeah, it kinda does](http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/kevin-durant-tristan-thompson-funny-trash-talk-finals/446711)"
"Yeah, like that whole signing Kevin Durant thing."
And an extremely fortunate cap spike that is a once in a lifetime event to sign Kevin Durant 
I'm not blind to it and this isn't a knock on the warriors. You put the best team you can out on the floor. The cap went up giving them room to sign a player like Kevin Durant and like I said of course you sign kd if you can. What I don't like is how much of a bitch move it was for kd to go to the team he was a game away from taking out a month later. Warriors are amazing. Steph is the greatest sharp shooter I've ever seen. KLay can drop 37 in 12 minutes of play. Draymond is a fuckin ass hole but I can't sit here and act like I'm not impressed with the way he has learned to thrive in the NBA while being under sized. They have likeable role players like iggy and Livingston. The warriors did everything by the book but KDs move means every ring they win starting last year will always have a but next to it. Because no shit this team is gonna win until someone assembles the damn avengers to take on the justice league. No shit they're great.
I don’t want to hear “Kevin Durant” and “fmvp” in the same sentence for the next few days 
"Yo, the refs suck.. JR is an idiot.. Sure, but Kevin Durant took a 7 million dollar paycut and the Cavs lost their second best player before the season. Why do we pretend like we didn't know exactly this would happen. We've all been talking about how terrible this is going to be since last summer and now here it is, terrible and we're surprised and bitching about ticky tack shit? Stop watching and go outside. #NotMyFinals"
Trying to help out his ex teammate Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant isn't a Warrior right now if Curry had healthy ankles.
Did the Warriors really need Kevin Durant?
"Kevin Durant ruined the NBA though by doing what LeBron did twice. Yes, LeBron did it after losing in the Finals, but Durant did it after losing the Western Conference Finals. That's so much worse.   /s (because I can't trust /r/nba to see the obvious) "
"&gt; Kevin Durant is such a loser. I discount any ring he wins in this squad. Cupcake.  If it makes you feel better, KD probably discounts your comment."
"&gt; and knew rings wouldn't change shit  Where are you getting this from? Everything I've seen from him implies he can't seem to figure out why everyone hates him lol  One example:   &gt;KD said to B/R:  &gt;“Everybody just loves to hate on the Warriors,” Kevin Durant told Bleacher Report at Wednesday morning’s shootaround in preparation for their game against the Portland Trail Blazers. “Whatever we do, they don’t want to just say they hate us, so they’re going to make excuses up on why they don’t like us or why it was disrespectful. That’s what rubbed me the wrong way, because who gives a s—? Who cares? "
Yes and now the Cavs don't have Kyrie and the Warriors added Kevin Durant.
Dude we can't keep doing this...no shit the warriors are the best org in basketball. Yes they drafted 3 of their all stars and put together a 73 win team. Yes they had every right to sign Kevin Durant and who the fuck wouldn't try to if you could? But Kevin Durant signed with those guys after they dominated the nba on their way to 73 wins. That team was about 2 minutes from back to back championships. The team was already at the top and they signed Fuckin Kevin Durant. So please don't tell me not to hate the warriors.
Imagine being as big a bitch as Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is such a loser. I discount any ring he wins in this squad. Cupcake. 
"This might sound like a homer comment, but I don’t think any team would’ve done any better tonight than we did. The Warriors shot 60 percent! Our defense was bad in the first half, letting the warriors in the paint at will. But our second half defense was good, the warriors just made every contested shot. What do you do when Steph plays like that? We weathered the 3rd quarter storm. We kept fighting back into the game. Kept it close for 3 quarters. We got beaten by insane 4th quarter shots. That’s not to say there doesn’t need to be adjustments.  1. Don’t have Hill guarding Durant. It can’t happen anymore.  2. Get Kevin Love inside on the block more. 3. Have Jeff Green be the primary defender on Durant.  I think we’ll take a game at home. Maybe that’s being optimistic, but we’ve shown we can play with GSW, which no one expected. "
"(Adam Silver calls emergency press conference after the Finals)  “After speaking with several team owners, we have decided to implement a forced trade within the Golden State Warriors organization. With that said, it’s an honor to announce that Kevin Durant will be traded to the Brooklyn Nets, and Stephen Curry will be traded to the Orlando Magic.”"
Kevin Durant ruined the NBA. 
imagine respecting kevin durant lmao  e: i went from +5 to -5 real quick as soon as you bandwaggoners checked the thread lol 
"No one, that’s why we all hate Kevin Durant around here"

Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team
Seeing Kevin Durant smile brings me great anger.
"""Once again Kevin Durant being efficient""  ????  Killed it tonight, but he has been anything but efficient in like 6/7 games before this  Man I hate Mark Jackson"
"I'm happy Kevin Durant has been able to locate his father after all these years, Bryan Colangelo."
Kevin Durant why did you do the NBA dirty like that 
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green.....KEVIN DURANT vs a clearly tired Lebron, Kevin Love, and a bunch of under performing role players. What would you have him do differently? How would you have him defend Steph pulling up from 35 feet? Or KD shooting over the outstretched arms of defenders? I'm genuinely curious."
I love it when they play team basketball instead of catering to Kevin Durant. Curry running the offense makes the game fun to watch even though he's an aimbotter
Coming up with more reasons why Kevin Durant is a 🐍.  It takes more effort than you think 
Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team
"Kevin Durant, 2 time NBA champion*    *won as snek"
This game should cement kevin durant as the biggest coward in the history of the nba. 
Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team
I would enjoy watching the Warriors if not for Kevin Durant joining them to ring chase.
Imagine how much fun this same rivalry could’ve been without Kevin Durant atleast the cavs would’ve stood a chance lmao
Yeah like how the fuck is Jeff green and George Hill not beating Kevin Durant and Steph curry? Lebron gets so much help and still can’t get it done. 
"Fuck the Warriors, fuck Kevin Durant, fuck Draymond, and fuck all you shitty Warriors fans. Ruin the NBA four years in a row – I gotta watch this putrid bullshit. Fuck you J.R., fuck you Tyronn Lue, and fuck you Jordan Clarkson. You’re all shitty people as well. Fuck me too for watching this shit every year but pain and anger are addictive. "
"Right. He’s only good because of the players around him. He’s a good defender but he thinks he’s some kind of superstar.  Man, he’s so good at passing to the 2 best shooters of all time and Kevin Durant. "
Kevin Durant ruined basketball -_________-
"If you rearrange the letters in Kevin Durant, he becomes Native Drunk  Just thought everyone should know"

Kevin Durant has a vagina the size of Greater Manhattan. 
"Kevin Durant, finals MVP may have helped the last one a little bit"
"Imagine having Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and a bunch of above average role players and thinking that winning the championship is an actual accomplishment. "
Kevin Durant has aimbot
"Kevin Durant, refs, no Kyrie and they still need JR Smith to fuck up to win"
You mean Kevin Durant right?
Russell Westbrook becomes my favourite player Everytime I see Kevin Durant
Kevin durant made this not fun to watch
Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team
"Kevin Durant, in his prime, joined a team that had the most regular season wins in NBA history. The team he joined elimated his team in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.    I've heard that KD doesn't join the Warriors if they beat the Cavs in the Finals, but I don't think that's true.  He joins them anyway."
"It took a gift from referees for Kevin Durant, curry, green. And Klay to beat ONE PLAYER. Hahahahaha WITH ONE EYEBALL"
Imagine being a grown man and being as big of a bitch as kevin durant
"Kevin Durant ruined his legacy, he'll only be remembered as a mentally weak sensitive nancy, not a top talent ever"
"Kevin Durant was more efficient but please do not use FG%, it doesn't tell anything about scoring efficiency. "
"I mean, that’s objectively false. Kevin Durant these past two seasons has been far better than Wade ever was with LeBron. I guess you could argue that Durant’s teammates and coaching have a more positive effect than Wade’s did, but I don’t think that’s a great argument.   At their absolute peak’s, Wade and Durant are pretty similar talents, but Wade’s peak was very short and over by the time he and LeBron teamed up, while KD has played some of his best ball with the Dubs."

Kevin Durant was better in game 2.
“why don’t people like kevin durant??”
Kevin Durant -Lose. Join. Win. Again. 
"FUCK KD  OUR LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN SO GOOD, BUT KEVIN DURANT HAD TO FUCK IT ALL UP  NOW r/NBA DOESNT FUCK WITH THE WARRIORS (HELL NO)  NO, r/NBA DOESNT FUCK WITH THE WARRIORS   COME ON, SING IT WITH ME   r/NBA DOESNT FUCK WITH THE WARRIORS (HELL NO)     "
I don’t want the accolades to make people forget the fact [Kevin Durant is a Bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DSUEnBclQ8)
"Ben Simmons now isn't even 1/20th of the player that Prime Wade in 2011 was. Wade and Lebron's fit was also far from perfect until the Heatles developed chemistry through months and years playing together as well, it's an underrated part of them losing in 2011 despite Wade going off for 28 PPG in that finals series.   Simmons has never even attempted, let alone made, a 3pt shot in his entire career as the primary ballhandler for his team, cannot reliably hope to make a shot outside of 12-15 ft from the basket, had a single point in a critical playoff game against an injury ravaged team, and is a prime target for hacking despite labelling himself as a point guard.   Not an ideal partner for Bron at this point in his career to say the least, let alone if he's trying to beat the 73 win team that added Kevin Durant in a 7 game series. "
"It was a jealousy like any winning team gets but there was the sense that you guys earned your success and were great for the nba. Nobody cried foul about that team.  Adding kevin durant made it all seem so hollow from outsiders perspectives.   I mean you even got jared dudley tweetin sayin “kd should leave eventually, it aint supposed to be this easy” and chris broussard saying he hears plenty of nba players dont respect durant because of that decision."
"In the comments on the tweet, there is speculation regarding the team disliking KD or the other way around, KD disliking the team.  My own thoughts are this:  I would not be surprised if Klay and Steph don't really like playing with Kevin Durant.  Draymond Green seems like a sociopathic winner. He doesn't seem to give a damn if they win via Splash Brothers and beautiful offense or by KD isolation.  It has been reported that he was the impetus for the Golden State interest in getting KD.   This team is not best described as the Golden State Warriors. It's best described as the Golden State Warriors and Kevin Durant. Or, Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors, however you like it. He came to the Warriors in a mercenary fashion and he has performed like a mercenary - not fully embracing the offense, not having to in order to win two championships and two finals MVPs.  It would be hard to believe that it isn't a little galling for Klay and Steph. They were drafted, developed together and they won 73 games in a regular season and went 1-1 against Lebron James and Kyrie Irving. Bringing Durant to the team for the rubber match felt like overkill to everyone else. How do you think they felt, as the stars of the team? "
After this postseason performance ending in not only a title but a Finals MVP...where do you now rank Kevin Durant all-time?  Top 20? Top 15? Or has he nudged himself closer to breaking through the top 10 barrier? Curious to see what y'all think.
"If Curry’s gravity is so important, why was Kevin Durant +86 for the series and Curry +47? The Warriors were outscored by 26 points with Durant on the bench, with Curry playing just about every one of those minutes.   If Curry is so impactful that he’s more important than KD even when he’s not putting up numbers, the +/- would bear that out, but it doesn’t.   There is literally no argument for Curry being MVP that doesn’t come from a place of bias and emotion."
Steph Curry has Kevin Durant and Klay to pick it up when he goes 0-9. Quit being a sore winner. Fucking most whiniest fan base for how fucking loaded your team is. 
"First Take on Monday: ""Who REALLY deserved finals MVP and why WASN'T it Kevin Durant?"""
"As he rose up from his locker just now, Kevin Durant spotted the world's leading herpetologist @natgeo studying his walk to see how well he was moving. ""Looking to see if I slither?"" Durant asked Windy with a smile. ""Even if I was I wouldn't sssssshow you."""

"The only thing the Warriors ""get"" more than other teams is a guy named Kevin Durant. "
People are upset about this GS team but forget the NBA's history. There have been more dynasties in the NBA then any other league. This is just the shittiest way one of these dynasties have been put together. Boston and LA had multiple dynasties. Chicago won it all 6 out of 8 years. You know how boring that was to watch. With 2 years of Hakeem in the middle. Shortly later the Lakers won 3 in a row and added 2 more a couple years later. In the mix the Spurs won 5 rings. LeBron has been to 8 straight finals. We have the new GS dynasty which I never would've expected in my life. The NBA has the least parity of any sport. It's always been this way but you know what. I still love the game and fuck Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant didn't invite Kerr to his birthday party probably 
"Can't believe this is upvoted. Durant leaves OKC to Westbrook, who averages a triple double for the season and gets MVP. LeBron leaves Cleveland to who, Kevin Love? "
"Kevin Durant missed one shot in the entire first half so I'm not sure what you're talking about.   Oh and if you're going that route, Cavs managed to outscore the Warriors in the 3rd quarter despite the Cavs being awful in 3rd quarters and the Warriors being amazing, and I'm sure Curry going 0 for 5 had something to do with it. "
I too hate Kevin Durant for being successful.   If LeBron could have joined the warriors instead do you think he wouldnt do it?  Did he team up with another top 5 player and another top 15 because he wanted to struggle and have to will his team to titles? 
"It took them two years to win a championship.   How long did it Kevin Durant and the Warriors to go 16-1 in the postseason? Remind me, because I have forgotten thanks to you."
"If anyone were to discredit the Warriors it would be because they picked up Durant due to the spike in the salary cap brought about by the Players' Association voting to not smooth out the cap increases. That puts a half asterisk on this run but the Dubs drafted and traded well to get the original championship team and had the balls to keep Steph over Monta, keep Klay over acquiring Kevin Love, and cut Mark Jackson and replace him with Kerr when the team was on the up. As someone mentioned somewhere else, the stars have to line up for a run like this but the Warriors management were directly responsible for everything except Durant."
"In my opinion, kevin durant is the most overrated superstar in the nba right now. He took the easy way out and now he's winning championships and mvp's of the back of Stephen Curry and company.   Before Golden State warriors, he couldn't do what he's doing now. GSW didn't need him but KD sure as hell needs that team. I guarantee that if he hadn't make this anti competitive move, he wouldn't have won a single championship in his career. "
https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kevin-durant-i-thought-championship-would-fill-void-but-it-didnt/  KD telling the world that.
"When Inside the NBA turns into just the Warriors 4.  Ernie: Lebron James Jr. has now won his 3rd championship in 4 years, but has yet to win finals MVP. LiAngelo Ball won it in 2027 for his defense on Lebron, and then Zaire has won it the past two years. What advice do you have for him Steph?  Stephen Curry: Well the most important thing is getting the team win. That's what this sports all about. Lebron Jr. played great, he's now beaten Lebron 3 of the last 4 years, and has really been unselfish in setting up his teammates. I don't know what more you can ask for him, he's been excellent in all these finals.  Kevin Durant: Finals MVP's Erneh.  Klay: Uncontrollable chuckling.  Draymond: Shutup, you snake. You had to join 73 win team to win a championship.  Kevin: Finals MVP's Draymond. I've got 6, you have 0.  Draymond: You know what, I'm going to kick your ass.  "
Lol idc about Cleveland I'm a Lebron fan if there's a way to only have Lebron as my flair please let me know. Also he fucked you up you got slapped up. His team is absolutely garbage I'm from Toronto we got swept by him. Just know that you choked a 3-1 lead and called Kevin Durant crying. Just know that you'll never be considered legit. Currys legacy is ruined. KD will always overshadow him ahahahahaha I could give less of a fuck about Cleveland
Because they won the nba title then they went 73-9 and then they added Kevin Durant
"no problem, man. here's a good article i read earlier today about the whole thing.  https://www.si.com/nba/2018/06/08/kevin-durant-warriors-nba-finals-free-agency-lakers-thunder"
"I honestly don't disagree with this.  Durant is the best player on the Warriors.  You will not get an argument out of me.    The problem is that the Warriors would have been the title favorites these last couple years even without Durant.  They won 67 and the title in 2015.  They won 73 and should have been champs in 2016, but choked game 7 with 53 seconds left.    So for instance, if LeBron were to hypothetically join the Warriors for the MLE this Summer, he'd be the best player on the Warriors without a doubt.  He'd win the MVP awards.  The titles would be as much LeBron's as these last couple were ""Durant's"".    And if you understand that, you'll understand why [Kevin Durant is a Bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DSUEnBclQ8)"
"LeBron James yelled out, “Off I go! Off I go!” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave his usual finals performance. Guard J.R. Smith grabbed the rebound: “We got an [expletive] lead now.” And before Kendrick Perkins hit the locker room door, his former teammate Kevin Durant hugged him and said, “Fuck you, bitch ass.”"
"Nobody was surprised, only Warriors fans had fun, and the NBA took a major popularity hit.  Kevin Durant won. Rejoice, r/nba/. "
"Ah fair. Well I'm glad I could help - it's always good to have more people interested! Despite the ridiculous way this finals series turned out, you're tuning in at a great time with a lot of talent and lots of independent content coming out about the league in the way editorials, stats, entertainment, and other media. Lots of teams will be making big moves in the off-season to compete. The Rockets just took the Warriors to 7 (debatably only losing because their star point guard went done), young teams are getting stronger in the East, Lebron is likely going to form a powerhouse somewhere outside of Cleveland, and there's no reason to believe the Warriors are getting stronger than their current ridiculous state.  I don't hate KD but I think what he did was cheesy as hell, and I let out a cathartic FUCK KD at the end of the game. To give a bit more (slightly biased) context:  KD is an all-time great scorer that lead his time to the finals at 23 (with plenty of help, but he was the star) and was at one point supposed to be the guy to take over the league after Lebron declined. The Warriors team that beat him went 73-9 in the regular season, breaking the previous record of 72-10 held by the Chicago Bulls when Michael Jordan (whom I assume you know) played for them. So this Warriors team at the time already had an argument for being the best team ever, and then they added the best scorer in the league in Kevin Durant.  At the end of the day, players owe nothing to anyone, and there's even a precedent of older star players leaving mediocre teams to chase rings being cheered on by their fan base. But when KD made that trade, he was in his prime at 27 years old, and with a bit of luck would have been in the finals. So KD breaks this precedent by:  1) Being in his prime, theoretically going to play his best basketball  2) Leaving a very good team that was already a title contender  3) Joining a team that, by one metric, was the best to ever play  4) Joining the team that had just beat him. People pretty much only ever say ""If you can't beat em, join em"" as a joke, or to illustrate someone's cowardice. While being mad about getting beat is a bad quality in everyday life, this is sports! You should be at least *a little* mad when someone beats you  I don't want to get into the psychology of why people find all these unappealing, but surely it reeks of an anti-competitive nature, and ""taking the easy way out."" His first interview after the trade was titled ""The Hardest Road,"" which as you can imagine was memed to hell.  As a final fun piece of basketball trivia, in the 2011 post-season, Chris Paul was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers where he would have played with Kobe Bryant. These two are up there as some of the best to ever play their respective positions. The Lakers had won the title in 2010 and still had a great 57-25 record in 2011 despite a second round loss to the Mavs (who eventually won the title). The trade was voided by the NBA and the then-commissioner David Stern for ""basketball reasons"", which was code for ""this team would be way too good and ruin the balance of the league."" This of course gets memed like crazy, but it just sets a precedent for stopping ridiculous good players from joining ridiculous good teams. By most metrics, KD was better than CP, and the Warriors were better than the Lakers."
Kevin Durant is that you?
There is absolutely no reason to pretend that the Kevin Durant warriors era is normal or fun to watch or even all that interesting. Some ppl will yell about how you have to appreciate greatness or whatever and that's fine.  The fact of the matter is that they're the most stacked team of all time and KD pulled the weakest move possible. His legacy will always be tainted bc of this and rightly so.
Yes it was well know the cap was going to spike because of the new TV deal. [There’s this article from November 2015 discussing how feasible it was](http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-warriors-free-agency-thunder-wizards-stephen-curry-golden-state/1t6dmolxwdo8a1aldv684guf3c) 
"I mean, if I am upset about it, and I have no tangible reason to be other than that it ruins the fan experience for myself, I cant imagine how guys who have worked their entire fucking lives to compete at the highest level feel just getting steam rolled by Kevin Durant after he joins a 73 win team. Think about that.   Maybe they don't care, none of em. But I highly doubt that. "
"I can't say for certain given my fandom but if I were a Warriors fan I'd start to think of 2016 as an anomalous bump on the road of a dynastic run of Warriors championships and dominance like the league has never seen. I wouldn't watch any highlights of game 7, exactly, but I would keep in mind that losing that series probably unlocked the option for Kevin Durant, which pushed Golden State above and beyond all the other great teams in NBA history."
"We sure about that?  https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/08/sports/basketball/lebron-nba-finals.html  ""Over all, James has contributed 32 percent of the Cavaliers’ stats. In contrast, Golden State’s roster is filled with many more All-Stars who can share the burden. The Warriors’ stats leader is Kevin Durant, at only 22 percent."""
"Different era, but the simple fact that Golden State has 3 of the greatest shooters in NBA history on one team + another all-nba player makes them pretty unbeatable.  [Kevin Durant is a Bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DSUEnBclQ8)"
"Got most of my info from here: https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2017/10/2/16383160/nba-2017-golden-state-warriors-salary-cap-steph-curry-kevin-durant-klay-thompson-draymond-green  Basically just assuming we don't keep McCaw (and the 7-8m they project), and assuming Iguodala is not re-signed after the deal is up, and just throwing out spitballs on Klay and Dray's potential pay cuts to stay.  The other option is neither of them take paycuts and they still keep the 4 All-Star's together and our salary is like 180m and the luxury tax we're paying is like 200m on top of the 180m and the ownership has to eat that cost and basically lose massive margins. But it's not on the players to save their owners money. They should only take paycuts if they think it can help them free up space to make a move with it."
"LeBron did it in 2016. He did it, that’s all he needed to do in Cleveland. Fuck Kevin Durant for being the biggest bitch in sports history. Thank you LeBron and Kyrie for 16. Fuckoff KD. Zero real ships for that bitch. And that’s not even to take away from Klay, Curry, Iggy, and (hate to say it) Green. But KD is a bitchass for going to the Warriors."
kevin durant is a bitch ass titty baby. 
Durant may technically be a champion but I still don't consider Kevin Duran a man. 
"3.2% better FG percentage is ""way more?""  Well Kevin had 6 more assists and 6 more rebounds.  Everyone saying Steph was better game 2 when Durant was 10/14 and Steph was 11/26. Only one more made shot and 7 more points in almost double the shot attempts.  By chucked I mean just taking higher volume of shot attempts. "
And he can say thank you to Kevin Durant who won another time the NBA Finals MVP.
"3 time Finals MVP Kevin Durant and James Harden are leading OKC. Meanwhile, Russell Westbrook is somewhere else. "
"Yeah Kevin is a guy that can thrive with other great players around him but not the type of guy that can carry a team on his own. That's what separates him and Lebron. Thing is I think with Kevin it's more of a mental aspect because he has all the tools to carry a team, just not the proper mindset. Even with Lebron there are some games where he looks like he's just deferring. I think if Durant had MJ or Kobe's willpower he could be a GOAT over Lebron. But he's the type that would rather take the easy road."
"""dangerous from literally anywhere on the offensive half of the court""  You can say the same thing about Durant. The guy can score from anywhere and hit plenty of long 3's. Steph is the better pure shooter but Kevin is the better pure scorer because he can get his shot off over pretty much anyone."
"He's really good at basketball  The 2017-18 Eastern Conference stinks  And at the end of the day, if you don't want to respect Kevin Durant, that's your choice. Plenty of people never will"
"Because there's no comparison.. Lebron made super teams or whatever, sure. But Kevin joined a team who just went to two straight finals and won the most games in  league history.   Lebron is the greatest basketball player of this generation and  yet already arguably the warriors were a better team than just Lebron. Then they added KD.   Kevin Durant is my favorite basketball player and even I hate this. He will never get any validation for his titles until he leaves. The warriors already are an amazing team without him and with him is just extra. It's greatness I understand but it's a bad move by him "
"Everyone expects Lebron to leave the Cavaliers.  Everyone is wrong.  Here's the real plot twist. There are two things Lebron James knows: basketball and redemption. Lebron damages his rep by forming a superteam in Miami, but won it back by re\-joining the underdog Cavaliers. This is a lesson Lebron could impart to someone who might listen. And that someone is his good bud Kevin Durant.   Over the course of this off season, Lebron will convince Kevin Durant that, after tarnishing his reputation by joining the team that beat him, the only road to redemption is to join the team that he swept.      Durant to the Cavs this off season. Practically confirmed. "
KEviN DuRaNT aNd LeBRoN JaMEs dID The SAme ThInG
Not the warriors. Only kevin durant. I believe the warriors would have won at least 2 if not the same 3 without him. Though it probably would be 2 at this point. May have lost to Houston this year. But they would've been right back at it next year. The warriors were a dynasty in the making before KD. 
"I didn’t really get the personal life impression from the quote, but I could be misinterpreting.  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kevin-durant-i-thought-championship-would-fill-void-but-it-didnt/"
I know. Kevin Durant took the hardest road.
"&gt;Fuck Kevin Durant. Anyone who thinks what Kevin Durant did is not spineless, and within the competitive spirit of the game is lying to themselves.   Sure fuck Durant.  Also, fuck Lebron too.  Anyone who thinks what he did is not spineless and ruined the competitive spirit of the game is lying to themselves.    What other cunt admitted to telling Bosh/Wade in 2006 to take the same length contracts so they could all team up together later in 2010?  Lebron started this superteam bullshit. Planned even before the Celtics big 3 formed in 2007."
"I understand how great Curry is, he's the second-best point guard of all time, but Kevin Durant is a potential top 10 player of all time when it's all said and done. KD's the best player on that team."
it seems like the Warriors are resorting to great defense and then the Kevin Durant iso show of the old days. Sprinkle in a game here and there of Klay or Curry getting hot and its blowouts and sweeps.
Because Kevin Durant is more valuable to their winning. Without kd this team doesn't win the West and for sure doesn't win game 1 of this series
"Fuck Kevin Durant. Anyone who thinks what Kevin Durant did is not spineless, and within the competitive spirit of the game is lying to themselves. "
Congratulations to Kevin Durant for taking the easy way to a second NBA Championship and the NBA Refs for ruining Game 1.
"&gt;Yet, not enough for a finals MVP   LOL, it would have been enough if he was the best player on the team. No, that's Kevin Durant, who's known as the 2nd best player in the world, so he'd get the nod always above Curry, in these type of situations  &gt;   But that being said, **KD literally averaged more in every single category**.. Only LeBron had better numbers, but he's on the other team  &gt;   So he won the Finals MVP, as deserved. I mean, if you are a Curry fan, you shouldn't feel bad, because Curry dug his own grave when it comes to these type of situations. He recruited Durant, even though he had a 73 win team and was the best player on that team. He still recruited Durant, just to beat Bron in the finals.  &gt;  That's his own doing. But hey, he will have another ring. So that's something, i guess  "
Ehhh...having Kevin Durant come and help him out certainly makes these feats easier.
He still has one mvp and one title over Kevin Durant. He’s doing okay for himself.
"I mean, it's not like Kevin Durant was a moving roadblock, as evidenced by the consecutive finals MVPs. He picked a situation with the right system, like-minded, unselfish players and coaches that would allow him to perform to the best of his capabilities.  He picked the best situation for himself, as does any player. I don't see see why he had to stop and think, 'ohh they won 73 games last year, the fans will be mad'. "
Kevin “The Serpent” Durant
Athletes show you who they really are when they face adversity. Kevin Durant in the face of adversity pretty much chose to pretend like adversity doesn’t exist. And for that he will never have the respect of any of these fans. It’s really that simple. This shit extends to life. When we face tough times we can’t just run away and be saved by other men. We can’t relate with this bs. We certainly won’t give him our respect for it. Simple as that. 
Kevin Durant doesn't seem to agree since he's already said he's going to resign with the warriors. 
"He’ll NEVER get respect? Nah, he’ll get all the respect. History will be kind to Kevin Durant. A lot of the opinions right now are clouded by anger. "
"&gt; Love was borderline top 10, which is why even the links you're rating call him a top 12 player, and why he finished 11th in MVP voting. Some would have him a bit higher, some a bit lower. But he was in that 8-12 range. Borderline top 10. Not in top 5 contention.  Your argument here basically comes down to “all the media members who agree with me and put love outside the 10 top ten are right and all the media members who put love in their top 10/5 are wrong” which is stupid.   And regardless of love being a fringe top 10 player or not, the 2015-2017 Cavs were a supterteam and no one would argue against that.   &gt; There are superteams and then there's the current Warriors line-up is the point I'm making. Which is a tier above the standard ""superteam"" we've seen before. Steph gets less credit because the rest of his team is better.  Yes, Steph has more talent, but it’s not like Lebron’s done more with less than Steph. He’s done less with less. And my argument here isn’t that Steph is more valuable than Lebron, juss saying that he’s done more for the dubs than Lebron’s done for Cleveland  &gt; They were a weak 57 win team. You trying to separate them from the numerous 56 win teams Lebron beat is ridiculous.  Again, every “playoff person” on ESPN picked the nuggets to beat the dubs, and that was before David Lee got injured. The dubs were rightfully the vast underdogs in that series, so idk why you keep saying that everyone thought the nuggets wouldn’t succeed in the playoffs. And I’m not tryna “separate them from the numerous 56 win teams Lebron beat”, all I said was that Steph’s beaten a team with a better record than just 3 of the 32 eastern conference teams that Lebron’s beaten since Lebron formed a superteam in Miami in 2011  &gt; It's telling that you're comparing the 8th/9th/10th men on the Warriors bench players to Heat starters. (That's not revisionist history, that's the minutes they played and when they were on the floor).  But also compare the Heat’s competition to the dubs. In their respective first years it was   Late 30’s dirk, mid-30’s Jason Terry, late-30’s Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler, and Late-30’s Jason Kidd vs Prime Lebron, prime wade, prime bosh, haslem, and chambers   Which is a wayyyy worse talent disparity than  Curry, KD, Klay, Dray, and Zaza vs Kyrie, Lebron, Love, TT, and JR  And even then, Lebron still lost, so either supporting casts don’t matter as much as you think it does or Lebron isn’t as good as you think he is  &gt; Kevin Durant is, right now, the best basketball player on the Warriors.  Steph outplayed KD in every playoff series except last year’s finals and one game this finals. You aren’t paying attention if actually think KD’s the best player on the dubs  &gt; "
I hate Kevin Durant 
"Kevin Durant wins the ""Fuck KD"" award for the second year in a row."
Well NBPA President Chris Paul gave them the cap space to sign Kevin Durant
Teams clinch the championship 100% of the time when Kevin Durant scores fewer than 25 points in the Finals
"Because the warriors were an incredible team, won the title, went 73-9 next year. They were a dominant dynasty in the making.   And then got Kevin Durant. The warriors would still be amazing without him and he took the easiest possible path.. "
"   **Kevin Durant:** 28.8 PPG, .526 FG% (.409 3P%), 10.8 RPG, 7.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 2.0 BPG  &gt;  **Stephen Curry:** 27.5 PPG, .402 FG% (.415 3P%), 6.0 RPG, 6.8 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.8 BPG   Plus Steph also had a stinker in Game 1"
"I felt the same way just because Curry really led them in Games 2 and 4 but looking at the Final Stats for the Series I can see why KD got it. That Game 3 performance really screwed up his numbers tho.     Creds to u/thesmark88 for series stats  Finals Stats:  Stephen Curry: 27.5 PPG, .402 FG% (.415 3P%), 6 RPG, 6.8 APG, 1.5 SPG, 0.8 BPG, Led team in scoring 3/4 games  Kevin Durant: 28.8 PPG, .526 FG% (.409 3P%), 10.8 RPG, 7.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 2.0 BPG  "
"Nah, but I'll give you a Fuck Kevin Durant."
Nope... http://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/3975/stephen-curry http://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/3202/kevin-durant  KD bested Curry is almost every single category...
Titles are a team accomplishment. I am talking about Kevin Durant.
"As he rose up from his locker just now, Kevin Durant spotted the world's leading herpetologist @natgeo studying his walk to see how well he was moving. ""Looking to see if I slither?"" Durant asked Windy with a smile. ""Even if I was I wouldn't sssssshow you.""   "
The assasination of LeBron James by the coward Kevin Durant.
Title is a team accomplishment. I am talking about Kevin Durant.
Do those 7 not realize Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team that had already won a championship
"Kevin Durant averaged more points, rebounds, and assists on better shooting from the field and three. "
Kevin Durant won 2 MVPs tonight:  Most Valuable Player 🏀🏆 Most Valuable Snake 🐍
Is Kevin Durant 
"Nah it's Kevin Durant's fault. People don't hate the Warriors because of their team name and history. People hate them because of Kevin Durant's bitch ass move.   The point that you completely chose to ignore (or went over your head) is the fact that those teams have COMPETITION. They compete with each other, year in, year out. Barca wins, then Madrid wins, Madrid wins CL, Barca wins La Liga. Kevin Durant made it so that the Warriors have a hard 0 when it comes to actual competition.   Edit*** The worst part is, KD could have gone numerous other places (or stayed) to be competitive and have a chance at winning it all every year anyway. But no... he literally took the easiest way out "
"Kevin Durant scored more and shot better from the field, a lot of people forget that Curry was having an awful Game 2 before the 3pt rampage in the 3rd and 4th. "
LMAO Steph. You gave up your rights to be FMVP when you brought Kevin Fucking Durant to your team.
GG. Congrats to GSW and Kevin Durant.
Congratulations to the Dubs. Fuck Kevin Durant. Fuck Ty Lue.  That's pretty much it.
Kevin Durant went to a team that was already the best in the nba before he joined.
Multi-time Finals MVPs:   Willis Reed   Magic Johnson   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   Larry Bird   Michael Jordan   Hakeem Olajuwon   Shaquille O'Neal   Tim Duncan   Kobe Bryant   LeBron James   Kevin Durant      Pretty good list to be on.
Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team
HOW IS KEVIN DURANT 7.75???????? HE DOESN'T EVEN TAKE CARE OF HIS HAIR
"There is a difference between disagreeing and missing. Lebron did score a lot in that game, but he also had 8 assists. Kevin Love took 20 shots, Smith took 10, Clarkson 9, Green 9, Nance 6 with 4 free throws. Clearly on various possessions Lebron did not see taking the shot as the right or only the answer. Lebron is looking to make the right play, he knows when he should score and when he should pass. He had Curry on him with Dray and Durant near the free throw line ready to close out on him if he drove to the hoop. Hill got a cut behind Dray for that reason. He made the right play, like he has always done even in this game. It's a poor view of the game which sees passing as just taking the game out of a particular players hands. Him passing it there is him deciding whether they win or lose by making the right play.  On some level, I'm just going to trust Lebron on having made the right play. The guy reads the game at a supreme level. It's simplistic to boil it down to Lebron having to take the shot, Lebron is not viewing the game simplistically like that.   Is it always the case that the star players has to take the shot if he is having a great scoring night? Even if he is triple teamed? "
"I enjoy the Warriors but lets be clear.  I think we've associated success with the team and in doing so, we've associated handsomeness.  In the same way that rich people are seen as attractive to some, I think that is what has happened.  Klay's goatee is straight up cartoon-like.  Kevin Durant has a triangle on his chin, and Steph well...   Anyways, https://imgur.com/a/xcor4ry  Maybe I'm too harsh..."
Dennis Rodman is great but he’s no Kevin Durant. And the original threepeat Bulls weren’t as good as the 2016 Warriors.
"Looked at this comment before reading the file.  Assumed it was [this quote](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/washington-wizards/kelly-oubre-jr-insults-fans-and-how-he-can-see-why-kevin-durant-made-fake-twitter), but that one OP selected was good too.  &gt; ""People call me a lesbian a lot. They think I look like a female girl or a teenage girl or something. I understand I'm a pretty dude. They might be mad that their wife likes me or something,"" he said.  &gt; ""I'm not a lesbian. I'm a grown man. I've heard that multiple times. I guess it's something to try to get under my skin, but at the end of the day I know who I am. The whole Boston crowd screaming 'F U Oubre,' that was pretty creative of everybody in their arena. But I loved it, it was just part of the game."""
"They need some SERIOUS 3 point potential on that team.  They need some catch and shoot and spot up shooters too.  That being said, I do think that this Spurs team is strong, but I think that Lebron would have higher chances of winning the title in Houston and Philly.  Here are my suggestions for signings:  - Marco Bellinelli  - Luc Mbah a Moute  - Seth Curry  - Omri Casspi   - Also if they could somehow get Kevin Durant you know, that would be sort of nice."
"Cool, now imagine this article comes out, then Kevin Durant joins them. "
"The NBA has always looked at players for their offensive talent.  A defensive side to their game is always seen as a plus, but its never something that draws the casual fan to the game.  Because of that a player such as Draymond Green or Rudy Gobert would never be seen as a top 15 player.  His offensive game has gone down significantly with the arrival of Kevin Durant for obvious reasons.  I think right now Draymond is a top 25 player in the league.  However he has the potential to be a top 20 player in a different circumstance. "
"Since you didn't seem to actually *read* his comment, I'll pull out the key point from [this Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/07/07/kevin-durant-says-joining-warriors-super-team-is-the-hardest-road/?utm_term=.85e61e1c8ba0):  &gt;“Nothing in this league is easy,” Durant said at his introductory news conference after signing a two-year, $54 million deal with his new team. “There’s no shortcut. This is the hardest road because I don’t know anybody here. I’ve never lived in this community. … This is not the easiest situation because I’m out of my comfort zone.”  It wasn't the hardest road in terms of *basketball* it was the hardest road for him *personally* because he knew he would be burning bridges with his team mates and he'd have to build a new life for himself in a new city that already had established super stars.  This sub epitomizes exactly why Durant was 100% correct that joining the Golden State Warriors was the hardest road for him personally. Durant makes a basketball decision that puts him in the best position to win and learn from arguably the second best coach in the league and play with unselfish talent that would let him grow as a basketball player. He said his personal life would be very hard as a result and look at the criticism he has received. KD is a bit of a cupcake when it comes to criticism. He said he only felt like a Warrior after beating the Rockets in game 7, that's how out of place he has felt for the past two years. He created burner accounts and has been way too focused on how others perceive him and he *knew* he'd take a lot of shit for joining the Warriors and it would be really difficult for him, personally. On the flip side he could have taken the *easy road* for himself and stayed in OKC and have been a local hero where everyone praises him and no one criticizes him while making max money.  The ""toughest road"" comment wasn't about *basketball*, it was about how hard it was going to be on him personally and he was right."
"Bad wager. It's not more sensitive in terms of the reasons he took the discount last year. This is a very homer type take that doesn't reflect the reality of what he did last year. The question this year is years not dollars. Here is what Chris Haynes reported regarding the situation.  ""It has yet to be decided what contractual route Durant will take, sources say, but there are no real incentives -- for himself or for the team -- to take such a drastic reduction in pay this time around.""   https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kevin-durant-decline-player-option-restructure-deal-warriors/story?id=54383284"
"For those of you who think he is being dramatic about ""denial of basic human rights"", it's not.  ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"" in the Pre-amble to the US Constitution is most often interpreted as meaning people have the right to work as they see fit and to live off of their own labor.  The idea that you are NOT allowed to make money off of your likeness because of your skills and talents WHILE the NCAA is, is just absolutely against everything that Americans should believe.   It's 100% robbery. I am not saying the NCAA has to pay it's athletes, it doesn't and probably shouldn't.   But, they absolutely should allow athletes to make money as they see fit. The NCAA is allowed to tell a Kevin Durant UT jersey, but KD wasn't allowed to sell his own signature?   The more I think about it, the more angry it makes me.  Most NCAA athletes are compensated pretty well with their scholarship. How many of the 85 players can you name on your favorite football team? 10? All 22 starters?   That means, at best, over 70 athletes are no-names. They are all getting pretty good deals. The guys you know by name and especially the stars are getting fucked by the NCAA.   That's what this should be about in my opinion.  "
"I heard Kevin Durant Jr just started passing notes in class criticizing the move and is confused as to why guys are forming super teams. On an unrelated note, Stephen Curry III is tearing up low-ranked preschool courts by shooting 3s but coaches don’t think he’s got a future because of a small size "
i dont think 100 players the size of kevin durant would fit on the court homie
"KD had the advantage of being able to go against players like George Hill and JR Smith without a double team while playing with three other all NBA talents. LeBrons's stats are at LEAST comparable to Durant's while playing with Kevin Love and a load of bums after carrying them through the first three rounds.   That's how he was better. He WAS the Cavs. Durant had the luxury of having defensive pressure focused on other players, LeBron did not.  "
1 Kevin sized Durant 
JUST IN: Kevin Durant opts of of his 2018-19 contract to play with Sierra Canyon High
It went away with one acquisition of Kevin Durant though... at least it made my life easier lol

"I don't think you know what amateur means... once you go professional there are no takesie backsies... so yeah, no, he can never play college ball... unless they change the rules... and that would actually be awesome! Failed and retired NBA players going back to school, getting their degree, teaching these young bucks to ball... totally down to see Kevin Durant retire at 35 and finish his three years at Texas or Rose at Memphis.  Greg Oden back at Ohio state. So many possibilities! You get 4 years. Leave that door open and college sports could be really interesting..."
"Lebron has a great game 1 no doubt. But, he was the third best player on the floor Game 2. The clear second best in game 3 and might as well had a DNP how much he disappeared Game 4. What about last year when the Cavs had one of the best offensive teams ever in the playoffs with  Kyrie and Kevin Love but Durant STILL outplayed him on his own gym in Game 3?"
Kevin Durant is about to join them...

"&gt; What about when the 2-time defending Houston Rockets champions added...Charles Barkley...That team still wasn't good enough to even make the Finals and beat Jordan, because you know, there were plenty of good teams.  You mean when they added 33 year old, injured Charles Barkley that averaged less than 40 games a season for them? That Charles Barkley? When Hakeem was also mid 30s and had also fallen off a cliff?  Adding an injured Charles Barkley to an older and already not that great team isn't the same as a 73-9 team with 3 prime all-stars and the first unanimous MVP adding Kevin Durant in his prime. That's an awful comparison.  But you're right, Barkley joining the Jazz isn't quite accurate. It would be more like if Barkley or Hakeem won MVP, then joined Jordan's Bulls during their first threepeat. Even that team didn't win as much as the 2016 Warriors but it's a close comparison.  Jordan's Bulls were the Warriors of that era because they were stacked and because Jordan was amazing. It's important to remember that it's because of both.  &gt;But Jordan never had as weak of a run to the Finals as Lebron has and you continue to not address that.  Jordan has never had a team as bad as this Cavs team except since *maybe* his first few years. He didn't even sniff the Finals with a team of that quality. Jordan Clarkson and JR Smith literally had historically bad playoff runs, and players like Korver and Hill sucked in the Finals.   You know the stats that LeBron's put up this postseason. It's one of the greatest playoff runs of all time, statistically and in the eyes of people like Zach Lowe. It's not on him that his team would easily be a lottery team without him."
&gt; The heat were basically the warriors. 3 allstars joined together.  The Heat would have been the Warriors if they also had Kevin Durant 
Kevin Durant is overall better than Steph Curry so there’s no reason to have both
"LeBron's HoF he's played against are Chauncey Billups ('06), Tony Parker ('07), Tim Duncan ('07), Ray Allen ('08 - technically not prime, I'll give this .5), Paul Pierce ('08), Kevin Garnett ('08), Dwight Howard ('09), Dirk Nowitzki ('11), Durant ('12), Westbrook ('12), Harden ('12 - technically not prime, I'll give this .5), Kawhi could end up making HoF but isn't there yet, and he didn't really play 'prime' Kawhi so I'm not counting it, then of course Curry ('15). Draymond/Klay technically aren't HoF yet and it's tough to say if they'll end up there, but let's give him the benefit of the doubt and say both of them make it. That gives him 14 Hall of Famers faced, not counting rematches because I'm too lazy for that.  MJ : Robert Parish ('86), McHale ('86), Bird ('86), Isiah Thomas ('88), Ewing ('89), Joe Dumars ('90), Rodman ('90), Worthy ('91), Magic ('91), Drexler ('92), Dominique ('93), Barkley ('93), Shaq ('95), Payton ('96), Stockton ('97), Malone ('97), Reggie Miller ('98).  That's 18 players right there. Fucking insane."
That's definitely the fault of the owners and the economic model of the league. But the amount of vitriol in this sub blaming the Warriors and Kevin Durant for this dysfunction in this league is asinine.

"&gt; You think AI and Barkley don't wish this phenomenon happened sooner so they could have played with enough talent to beat the Bulls or the Lakers?  Barkley and AI would quit before forming a super team in their primes.  That's the difference today- back then players wanted to compete.  Kevin Durant has 2 rings but they don't mean shit. No one will respect him for it. Dirk's 1 ring will have 94395395359353 times the value of KD's 3-4 rings with the Warriors.  &gt;Malone and Payton joined the Lakers in a last ditch effort to finally try to get over that hump.  Malone was 40 and Payton was 37.  Lebron was 26 and Kevin Durant was 28.  &gt;They both did it the ""right"" way and lost.   Let me ask you this:  what's more impressive? Working out, eating healthy, and being patient for 2 years to get that physique you've always wanted.  Or taking steroids, other performance enhancers, and surgery to get those results in 3 months?  See what I am saying now? KD and LePippen both put in cheat codes in a video game, then ask us to respect them."
Kevin Durant is the Soul Stone and that season was the thing we loved
Yes Kevin Durant is part of the team
"&gt; We saw what was already an all-time great team, ONE GAME AWAY from back-to-back titles, become even more unbeatable.  We were beaten that year.  We weren't unbeatable.  You people twist history in whatever way fits the narrative you want out there.    It took you 1000 words here to say nothing more than you're pissed Kevin Durant did what he felt was best for his life.  Maybe when you've lived a little longer you'll realize that it's always the right call to do whatever makes you happy as long as you aren't truly hurting anyone in the process."
BREAKING: Kevin Durant plans to join Sierra Canyon next year 
Youre retarded. It's a team game now whereas back then Jordan would be taking Kevin Johnson or Jeff Hornaceck one on one in the post.  I can't even imagine how much Kevin Durant would destroy if we sent him back in time. The game has changed. For the better. People are incomparably better now than back then outside of Jordan who was ahead of his time.

Kevin Durant ruined the NBA Championship
"If Chris Paul to Houston and Kevin Durant to Golden State can happen, some team would take Green/Gasol if they include the 18th pick or Bertans."
"I made a similar post like this [well over 2 years ago involving Kevin Durant.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4iqauk/every_single_nba_team_subreddits_do_you_think_we/) If the same logic applies, he ended up going to the team with the most comments in the Warriors. If the same logic applies this summer, welcome to the Spurs Bron!(Cavs don't count since that's more-so about thanking him)"
"It depends on the trade of course, but it's not the same situation. Kevin Durant is a competitor who has failed to get over the hump despite playing for some incredibly talented teams. It isn't all his fault because although he's come up small at times I also think the Thunder roster wasn't constructed the right way with their lack of 3 point shooting and players who can be liabilities like Robertson or Kanter. Also the Westbrook, Durant on court relationship has been a narrative for them not winning as well.  If Durant went to Boston, LA, San Antonio, Washington or anywhere else to construct a super team no one would have cared other then perhaps Thunder fans. Durant joining Golden State has the perception of him wanting to join the bang wagon, and win championships as easy as possible to validate himself to rectify his past failures. It comes off as weak, and Durant consistently making excuses about it shows how insecure he is with the move.  Durant went to the best situation possible, and has become very successful because of it. Last season they steamrolled everyone but with all of Steph's injuries, and the rise of the Rockets the Warriors needed KD, and he showed everyone why he can be argued as the best or second best player in basketball. The move was very controversial and it should be easy to understand why so many people have a problem with it. If you don't mind that's great, but others do."

Kevin Durant releasing an apology commercial confirmed 
"Piggybacking for visibility. Here's what TK actually wrote:  &gt;2. The Warriors will not even think of breaking up of the Big Four this summer or into the future.  &gt;Are the Warriors still targeting New Orleans center Anthony Davis? Sure. Lacob and Myers love to circle the best names possible years in advance of their potential availability, and figure out how they might be able to land the biggest fish out there.  &gt;It used to be Kevin Durant. Now the Warriors’ biggest target is Davis, and they understand that their clearest way to get him was to sacrifice several big parts of their foundation — maybe Klay Thompson and/or Draymond Green — in a trade.  &gt;But the Warriors have also just won back-to-back titles, riding the backs of Durant, Stephen Curry and, yes, Draymond and Klay. Add in Andre Iguodala, and those are the guys who have made this dynasty possible and set the culture, and they’re all irreplaceable.  &gt;If the Warriors had lost to Houston in the conference finals? I think Warriors management would’ve been slightly more amenable to at least considering some big deal that would’ve taken apart their foundation to try to build another one.  &gt;But not now. Warriors management has always been clear: As long as they’re winning, they will do everything they can to keep the core together, and it would be crazy not to.  &gt;If anything, the Warriors are well down the path of signing Thompson to an extension this summer and could do the same with Green either this summer or next.  &gt;“All good things cost a lot,” Lacob told ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne. “We’re going to try to sign Klay and Draymond to extensions this summer. … We’ll do whatever we can to keep them.”  &gt;Just as a side note, here’s the count of Warriors titles, player by player in this era (counting only when the player was on the playoff roster for a title run):  &gt;3 — Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, Klay Thompson.  &gt;2 — Kevin Durant, Zaza Pachulia, David West, JaVale McGee, Patrick McCaw, Kevon Looney, Damian Jones, James Michael McAdoo.  &gt;1 — Harrison Barnes, Andrew Bogut, Leandro Barbosa, David Lee, Festus Ezeli, Ian Clark, Mo Speights, Nick Young, Quinn Cook, Matt Barnes, Justin Holiday, Brandon Rush, Jordan Bell.

Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant and him were a really good duo.   If he stuck around a little longer I think they could have pulled a better supporting cast but man at the time they had issues with the team having no shooters or shot creators.   They had some downfalls together but never really had too many moments where a role player would save them, something we often see on championship teams.   Such a shame because they were arguably the one-two hardest guys to defend at once. "
"Kevin Durant = Kylo Ren, extremely confused, thinks Lebron/Anakin did the right thing when they went to the dark side and follows in their footsteps. "
"&gt;Yes, the Warriors cemented themselves as a dynasty with an all-too-easy sweep of the Cleveland Cavaliers, but to say that they are bad for basketball and the NBA is ludicrous.  &gt;Since the beginning of their incredible four-year run — the winningest four-year run in NBA history — the Warriors have pushed the NBA to new heights by raising the bar of success for the league’s other 29 teams.  &gt;Many — perhaps most — will fail to notice it, but the axiom is true: a rising tide raises all ships.  &gt;Right now, the Warriors, having won three of the last four championships and back-to-back titles after adding Hall of Fame scorer Kevin Durant in a shock move in the summer of 2016, seem to have an unfair advantage. But those who are complaining and ascribing a larger value to the Warriors’ dominance are failing to see the big picture.  &gt;There is a larger value, but it’s not negative: the Warriors are the best thing that ever happened to the NBA.  It's good for the NBA, but imo not great for fans. Personally, I like competitiveness. I am rooting for LeBron, so ofc I'm not in tears about him dominating the East, but it also means I've missed my fair share of Eastern Conference playoff games featuring him because the victories are a foregone conclusion and/or are completely expected.   As for the Finals: Losing in a closer series hurts way more than what happened 2017 or 2018. This year, I was extremely mad about game 1 and JR, but other than that it was kind of emotionless for me. Compare that to 2015: Sure, the chances of winning were equally slim, but LeBron made it a series and I started to hope he could win. As we know, those hopes were crushed and the loss felt worse than 2017/8, but it was also better, more memorable and I was a lot more invested.   As much as I want LeBron to win, it's not the absolute priority. The most important thing for me is that the wins mean something to me as a fan(and to the players ofc, but those are tied together). They don't or not nearly as much if they come easy or if the defeats are clear and quick. "
I think the major thing that swings in the bulls favor is the rebounding even this Cleveland team was giving them trouble on the boards and the bulls had a pretty big knock down shooter MJ ultimately it would come down to Kevin Durant because he’s the anomaly to me but those rebounds our my deciding factor 
"[\[Haynes\] For those interested, I'm told Kevin Durant was in on the Peyton Manning gymanistic team roast at #ESPYS2017. KD played his part well.](https://twitter.com/ChrisBHaynes/status/885532181166084097)"
"To be honest, I think that if you guys lose 2016, I don't know if you guys lose 2017 or 2018. Replacing Kevin Durant with Harrison Barnes means I can see you guys taking one or even both of 2017 or 2018. "
Nah. Kevin Durant
"You went 73-9 and then added Kevin Durant.     You are the 1%.    EDIT: I’m cool with this analogy pre-KD, but adding him is like getting a huge inheritance when you’re already rich. "
"On the 3rd play ""I like it, Kevin Durant saying I don't need a screen, let me play Lebron 1 on 1."" - Marc Jackson  Right after, Durant get's a screen. "
"Have it easy implies that the warriors somehow broke the rules or had an unfair advantage in assmebling this team. Yes a couple things had to break right for it to happen but you can't cry about how Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team without acknowledging that the Warriors built a 73 win team in the first place. The whole adding KD is a lot less effective if you didn't spend the previous few years drafting and developing those 3 other all stars.   Either way, shouldn't every team be trying to get better each season, win or lose?"
Kevin Durant
"Kevin durant is Jafar  ambitions, etc... but true form is snek"
I agree with you. I have no expectation of *ever* seeing the Hornets win the title in my lifetime. None. Zero. It's never going to happen. The same goes for plenty of other small market teams. Small market teams just can't compete in free agency. You'll never convince someone like LeBron James or Kevin Durant to go play in Charlotte or Sacramento or Minneapolis or Salt Lake City when there are so many other cooler cities to live in.
You mean you don’t think Klay Thompson is buzz lightyear and Kevin Durant is the Little Mermaid? It fits in perfectly if you compare Derozan to Abraham Lincoln
Kevin durant = kylo Ren?
"Looney, West, Zaza and Nick Young, McCaw are all possibly gone.  Draft Khyri Thomas, buy a pick a draft Mo Wagner/Vanderbilt, Sign Trevor Ariza, sign Seth Curry/Ian Clark  |Point Guard|Shooting Guard|Small Forward|Power Forward|Center| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Stephen Curry|Klay Thompson|Kevin Durant|Draymond Green|McGee| |Shaun Livingston|Ian Clark|Andre Iquodala|Trevor Ariza|Bell| |Quinn Cook|Khyri Thomas|Patrick McCaw|Vanderbilt|Jones|  This would basically make them younger and give them a more balanced and skilled team than this season and if they don't draft Vanderbilt I would just sign Omri Cassipi again since he knows the system and is a great cutter. "
It’s so sad you can even say it aloud and not realize you’re wrong. Yeah no shit it’s Kevin Durant plus your 3 other all stars? That’s why we say y’all have it easy. No other team has 4 allstars let alone two top 5 basketball players on the same team. No team can have their best player have a shit game and rely on another 30 ppg scorer to pick up the slack. Y’all should enjoy your team but don’t act like y’all did some act of god. Cap spike plus fa timing gave y’all this chance. 
"They were different players doing different things though. I liked what Kevin Durant brought to the Sonics more than what I thought oden would have. When you are comparing those two players, it’s comparing apples to apples because they were both fantastic in college. "
But Kevin Durant doesn't miss.
How did the Ingram 3 beat out Nance murdering Kevin Durant in cold blood [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XncEQeUnQc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XncEQeUnQc)
"I did not say being bigger/stronger was a knock. It is not necessarily make you a better scorer. You simply have an easier time at it.  No one says Allen Iverson is a better scorer than Kevin Durant because Kevin Durant has the same moves in his arsenal if not more. LeBron shooting 50% doesn't mean that every time he takes a shot it's going to go in 50% of the time. Kobe shooting 45% doesn't mean there's a 45% chance the ball goes in every time. Averages are affected by a lot of things, including fast break opportunities as well, and LeBron definitely for much of his career benefited from fast break opportunities than Kobe. Getting an open dunk more often than th e other guy doesn't make him a better scorer.  It is never as simple as a pure career average or even a season average. Do you think it's okay to forget how many 40 point, 50 point, 60 point games Kobe has had compared to LeBron? Is a player who scores 22 ppg at 47% better than Kobe who scored 25 ppg at 45%. Numbers at face value have no meaning, I don't know how you dont quite see that. Is Harden a better scorer than Kobe because his 3 point percentage is higher? Is Harden a better all around player because he gets more rebounds and assists? What about Westbrook? He averaged a 30 point triple double, therefore he must be better than Kobe who never came close to that, right? Klay? Steph? What about them, are they better scorers?  Then you pause and realize how ludicrous these statements are because there are obviously many things that go into the game of basketball that are not included in basic numbers and box scores."
Daily dose of Fuck Kevin Durant. Thanks dude.

It’s more that it’s not even close. Each of MJs finals had us wondering if the Bulls would win (other than the 96 finals).  I wouldn’t mind the warriors winning titles if they had to go through interesting adversity to get there. Instead they got injury luck and Kevin Durant.
Does that mean Kevin Durant is Draco Malfoy?  JR Smith is totally a HUFFlepuff
&gt;My Journey -Kevin Durant -Lebron James
"Basically a more even distribution of talent.  The Finals has been the same matchup for four straight years leading to the conclusion that two teams have too much concentration of good players.  Two years ago the Golden State Warriors set a regular-season record for number of wins with 73 and had the first unanimous regular-season MVP.  That off-season, the top free agent (Kevin Durant, considered by many to be a top-3 player at the time) signed with the Warriors.  This seemingly ensured that the Warriors would be the team to beat for as long as their nucleus stayed together.  The result of this move is that anyone who wants to compete for a championship will have to join a team with an already-high concentration of talent, theoretically widening the gap between the top teams and every one else in the league."
"&gt;An aging 3rd best player who by the time they won was not 3rd. And the NBA was changing and Wade's skills were diminished  Yeah because how the fuck was LeBron was supposed to know that when he went there? lmao the mental fucking gymnastics here  Nobody is fucking arguing what Durant did isn't worse than what LeBron did, but LeBron still joined a 28 year old who had  27 5 6 2 on 47 FG% season and a 20 10 guy. So don't fucking act like LeBron is this great competitor.   &gt;LeBron cares about legacy and if you guys refuse to acknowledge how you get your RINGZ then idc if he does an bitch move like KD and joins warriors to win 8 chips. If legacy is defined by Rings. Then go  Yeah because KD is in the same breath as LeBron. give me a fucking break. LeBron's career is weighted wayyyyy differently than KD's.  &gt;He would be fucking with them, Dray says he doesnt know if he would stay. If Lebron can convince management to take him for the MLE he could destroy them from the inside within a year or they all stay and win chips and he still is considered greater than them.   Lmao i'm dying here, how the fuck would he destroy them when he himself is helping them? Do you really think GS wouldn't be fine with trading Draymond for LeBron? LeBron would ultimately be doing them a bigger favor   &gt;KD just wanted to win. And he acknowledges now he is the best on the team. Hard to stand out etc.  If you actually understood the context, you'd know he's talking about being the best player on a team, not on the planet, which he's right. Guys like Kevin Love were feasting around bums but struggle to stand out in talented teams.  &gt;KD may have not said it. But thats what Nike wanted. And KD is easily influenced by outsiders opinions and thoughts. Sneks do snek things  No wonder this post is so silly. Grow up "
LeBron took his teams to the finals. KD needed to join a super team. Kobe and Jordan did the same as LeBron. Hop off K's Dick. Kevin Durant is incredible but he can't get that credit anymore.
The Golden State Warriors have a realistic chance to sign Kevin Durant. 
"As in a previous post, we as fans value rings way too highly. Like we always talk about how Malone or Barkley are ringless guys and its kinda unfair. But we also value HOW you get it.   &gt; How is he the the worst for being a ring chaser like everyone else is?  Because he is Kevin Durant. He is a top 3 player right now and we dont compare him to other role players chasing rings like David West,. Most of those people are way past their prime and even during their prime, they're not the same player like KD is. Being one of the top players in the league comrs with a baggage. People will really scrutinize your every move. True it was the best decision for him but from a fan's POV, it isnt. As a Knicks fan, I was rooting for everyone that Warriors were up against but deep inside I know they will win. "
Kevin Durant. 
"""but if he actually told the FO firmly not to trade him there’s no way they would’ve.""  So we should blame him for speculations that you're making that he didn't actually tell them not to trade him? Strange   Also, he hand picked the roster, sure, he didn't hand pick them to suck, he didn't hand pick Korver to go 1/16 in the finals, that's not on him, or handpick JR to forget the score of the game   Also, he hand picked best available, he wasn't like yeah JR and Jimmy Butler are free agents, lets get JR instead , oh Kevin Love and Kevin Durant are free agents, KD is alright, but let me get Kevin Love   He doesn't get paid to be the GM/executive/president, I'm not giving him blame for those things "

t. Kevin Durant
"The guy deleted his account but check out this post from 2015 [1997-2014 every MVP shot chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2azdev/19972014_every_mvp_shot_chart/) or just the [imgur](https://imgur.com/a/igfUa) if you wanna save a click (screw it I'll save you from scrolling and link those directly below).   [Kevin Durant](https://i.imgur.com/a05ykub.png): Hot from the top and shaded to the right of the arc, good on both blocks and the right free throw line elbow, phenomenal at finishing at the rim where he does most of his work.  [Dirk Nowitzki](https://i.imgur.com/6mIU5RE.png): Rarely ever finishes at the hoop, doesn't shoot top of the arc 3s but good at both left and right while completely avoiding the corners, has the McDonald arches as his heat map from 15 feet and the free throw line.  Compared to Garnett who was left side dominant on his 15 footers, or Duncan who was a perfect brick at 13 feet either direction. Kevin Durant finishes his drives to the rim at a LeBron level, but without the unpredictability that LeBron had with where he would take his other shots to open the driving lanes up."
TIL Kevin Durant was talking about 880 this whole time
U know who that sounds exactly like? Kevin Durant lmao
"But if he wins outright he doesn’t end up in Radiator Springs and there’s no movie.  Similar to how blowing a 3-1 lead allowed the Warriors to sign Kevin Durant and form an unbeatable superteam, blowing a 2 lap lead allowed McQueen to mend his character issues and become the inspiring legend of a racer he was meant to be"
&gt;  Durant looks to slash to the hoop more while Dirk would beat his man of the dribble to take it to the hoop as a changeup mixed in with his jumpers  i stopped reading after that....we get it r/nba you hate Kevin Durant  
"Neither did Lebron, in fact he is getting swept all the time. Harrison Barnes =/= Kevin Durant"
"I mean, there’s such a big difference between what someone says publicly and to be politically correct versus how they truly feel(example Kevin Durant and him accidentally trashing his OKC teammates on twitter) We don’t know what Kevin Love actually feels, and it’s bad to just assume his public comments are what he actually believes "
Dirk is not a better player than Kevin Durant so....
Kevin Durant is above Dirk Nowitzki on my all-time list

Pretty similar (numbers-wise) with KD having an edge in regular season scoring. Dirk was able to keep more consistent with his postseason scoring and efficiency. He also never got the benefit of going to go play with Steph, Klay and Draymond (or even had a Westbrook or Harden).   Also important to note Dirk's prime was in the 2000s vs KD's being in the 2010s. KD was averaging 7.1 and 7.6 3PA per 100 vs Dirk's 4.5 and 3.7."
"Of course the 3PAr is higher because he takes fewer shots, no one is denying that he shots less now, the point is he was already shooting a lot of threes for a big man, LeBron didnt make him do it, 6.6 threes for a power forward 5 years ago is insane  He was 6th in the league in 3 point attempts in the last year in Min, the only big man in the top 15, he took more threes than James Harden, Kevin Durant that year"

"That's great and admirable, but not at all what we were discussing.

I love Kevin Durant. 
Why do you get so angry over people getting so angry over Kevin Durant?
"Kevin Durant is a poor sportsman who by taking a pay cut to play with the 73 win Warriors effectively paid for and bought a championship LMAO.  He's allowed to make his own choices, good on him, but he is a poor sportsman and of weak character, as evidenced by his twitter burners and his generally whack and aloof public persona "
"I think when we look back at the career Kevin is probably the better player especially with his shot blocking recently. That being said Durant will never earn a trophy the way Dirk earned this one, I have never seen someone so focused and precise as Dirk in the 2013 playoffs. I think this has GOT to be one of the greatest displays of leadership in any sport.  Edit 2011 playoffs lol"
I call him KD. Or Kevin Durant. 
David West and Kevin Durant. 
Kevin Durant isn't considered a conventional playmaker by most people. If anything he's been criticised for his perceived inability to facilitate for others and his ISO-ball tendencies.
Anything but whatever Kevin Durant is.
"People will meme but Shaq is not wrong.   Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, two of the most unselfish superstars in the league, both with great off-ball abilities, have had trouble in the past 2 years meshing together. In the 1st year together, Steph was out of rhythm and performing relatively poorly (esp compared to the crazy MVP season he just came off of) for the whole first half of the season. It was only when KD went down that he finally got his full mojo back. This year, there were reports about how KD wanted more touches, was feeling distanced from the offense, and when Steph came back in the Pelicans series, apparently he was feeling a little disengaged while the team tried to reintegrate Steph. Steve Kerr said there will probably always be some stylistic tension.  So considering that, if you want to pair THREE ball dominant, iso-heavy scorers together....that's going to be difficult to work great within a single year. "
Kevin Durant says hi
"""The [Insert foreign country] Kevin Durant"" is not my favourite trope"
"&gt;a 1 on 1 basketball orientated system beat them in 2016   Well, that's different because the ""1on1"" guys were LeBron and Kyrie, who can do what majority players, even most ""superstars"" in the NBA just can't. Both dropped 40+ on over 60% shooting in game 5, and that changed everything that year.  LeBron is not the guy you want to give a second chance to. Warriors should have aimed for the head.. LeThanos never looked back since then, and totally obliterated. He was blocking Curry especially left and right, and even in dead ball situations. That shit was scary.  Kyrie was FANTASTIC as well, outplayed the fuck out of Curry in the entire series, even to the last shot of Game 7. LeBron and Kyrie was just so perfect and spooky together, complimented each other extremely well.   &gt;   But the main difference is, that GSW team didn't have the 2nd best player in the world, 7 foot slithering snake, Kevin Durant. GSW before him was great, looked cute, more like a well run machine. But they never looked ""scary"", or ""unbeatable"", no matter what. But with Durant, they just make opponents quit even before the game starts. Durant made them scary as fuck, and unbeatable. In 2017, LeBron averaged 33-12-10, Kyrie averaged 30 as well, but the series ended in 5. This year, Bron averaged 34-8-9, dropped 51 on 63% shooting in Game 1, and the series still ended in 4. Durant took this 73 win team to a level, where the league is really ""broken"" right now, and one or two more superteams have to be formed (which will soon) just to make the NBA competitive again. So that sucks. If you think GSW and Durant fucked this league up, wait until few more sueprteams form to take them down. Everything will be a big fucked up mess"
People said he was the next Kevin Durant and turned out to be pretty mediocre compared to him at the same age so in that sense he’s a bust. 
You're severely underestimating evolution. Russell Westbrook would be Michael Jordan reincarnated. Plus Kevin Durant and Ibaka blocking everything in the paint. Lol. 
"That system led the 2017 cavs to one of the greatest offenses of all time. The Lebron system is fine, Lebron hasn't won since 2016 because he faced the Kevin Durant Warriors. "
"Chris Paul, Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant exists "
Do you even reddit? The finals embargo has been in place since the extreme cap jump allowed Kevin Durant to join the Warriors. it’s our money why let them decide how it’s budgeted?
Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant my favorite. Getting Anthony Davis would be p good

"""Kevin Durant scored more than 20 in every playoff game this year"" how hard is that"
"&gt;He’s objectively a better overall player than Larry bird in almost every aspect other than passing  Larry was a much better rebounder and defender too. KD is a better shooter but Larry was a great shooter too. Sorry, but that was a blatant incorrect statement.  Larry averaged more rebounds, assists, and steals than KD. Larry was a 3x all defense team. KD has never made one.  Its close though. KD is a good comparrison for Bird. But Bird was a little better at everything except scoring. And that may have something to do with the era. If he was taking 4-5 threes a game instead of 1 or 2 he might have more ppg than Durant too.

"The bad publicity has gotten to Kevin Durant and he's decided to leave the Warriors. However, since he's still on good terms with the team and wants to go to a particular market where he'll be guaranteed to be the top guy, the team signs and trades him to New York for Kristaps Porzingis and filler. The Knicks then use this year's draft pick to get rid of Noah's contract, (Dallas may be a potential trading partner) freeing up enough space to go after Paul George and/or Jimmy Butler."
"Not even close, Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant. Durability matters in a sport where you may play 100 games a year. KD isn’t exactly an iron man but he has a clear edge there. 
Kevin Durant but last year I had them tied at 2nd best
Kevin Durant is 2nd only to LeBron.
"LeBron, Bird, Magic, Russell, Shaq and Hakeem.  1. Wilt 2. MJ 3. Kareem 4. Kobe 5. Magic 6. Bird 7. LeBron (assuming that he averages nearly the same seasonal averages for 3 more years) 8. Bill Russell 9. Hakeem 10. Shaq  Kobe has been the most disrespected ATG by a large margin. He actually had complete garbage on his team for a stretch of his prime. He couldn't get his assists up if he tried all game (and he did actually try to do so to prove a point in the playoffs).  I feel that he's been robbed of at least 3 MVP's, but I understand why most people would say only 1.   Kobe spent his entire life playing basketball with heart. He mastered the craft from every possible aspect. The guy worshiped Magic and become one of the most incredible passers I've ever seen which goes extremely unnoticed. He may have copied the greats (which the greats also copied their forefathers) but one thing people don't point out is how he even adapted to new changes in the league as they were happening. Kobe on a mental level is leagues above many of the players in the top 10 list and it's not even close. Most of the centers had the gift of being extremely tall, but as a guard to make the list, it's just not as easy as people make it sound.   Aside from Kobe, Wilt is also extremely disrespected as an ATG. For a man his height, there will never be another person like him. I'm trying to imagine him, 7'1"", ripped as fuck, faster than LeBron's chase down blocks, insane reach just devastating other teams on every level of basketball. He was a monster and he would absolutely dominate any big man to exist. Just looking at the raw stats of Wilt vs Bill head to head, it's insane that he consistently out played Bill, but still lost more. It shows how much a system works, and if a team doesn't have a system that works well, they aren't going to win as much.   It comes down to this, what does GOAT mean to you? To me, GOAT is the judgement of how good a player is, regardless of how their team roster/coaching staff is. Kobe, Wilt, MJ and Magic were always the hardest fighters on the court, extreme dedication off the court, and 1 v 1 game that would just completely rip the rug out from under anyone. If they are down, they will come back even stronger. I've only been around to witness MJ and Kobe's greatness and onward, so I can only speak about how I witnessed rise to power, which was much more surreal to watch than LeBron's.   I am more amazed by Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and even Anthony Davis than I am with LeBron's play style. There is just something about LeBron that brings me down while I watch him, and I know it's also hurting his team mates as well. Some of the guys on his team can play much better and probably would with a different system that I know LeBron could be capable of, but coaching staff decide's they play the way they do regardless, just to make LeBron play as the main ball handler. People are hating on WB this season so badly, but praise LeBron, while in my eyes, their team's overall game plan and styles are so damn similar, just finished in a different approach.  I know this is an unpopular opinion but I am happy with my point of view."
"Thanks for reminding me to unsubscribe until the next season starts. Can't stand to think of this league anymore, nor watch Kevin Durant get praised for existing."
"omg I can't believe Kevin Durant is actually here posting on the subreddit lol Come on Kevin, you're better than this. Oh wait no you weren't you choked away a 3-1 lead and then joined the team you choked against LOL "
"Your point? Doesn't mean the team isn't great, lolll.   How do I even rationalize with someone who claims that harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut are more valuable than Kevin Durant. "
"We got robbed of potentially one of the best rivalries of all time.   Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden (Serge Ibaka)  VS  Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green (Andre Iguodala)"
"So Bagley had the highest deal since Kevin Durant, now Ayton makes ever more than that? They should really go after Guards though. Like Young/Sexton."
"It doesn't matter how well you draft if the player just leaves after 6 seasons to spend his prime somewhere else. The jazz are probably one Kevin Durant away from a championship, but they'll never get one. "
Imagine getting mentored by Lebron James AND Kevin mf Durant. Got damn
Kevin Durant
"Look buddy, I get it. I do. We’ve been there. Let us help you through this grieving process. What you need to do is tuck your kawaii Leonard shirts in the back of your dresser and get a new black spurs shirt. Then when you’re looking for your thunder-er I mean spurs shirt you like you’ll inevitably find your Kevin-Kawhi Leonard shirt and you’ll relive this all over again. Then you can throw that on the ground, you’ll wash it while collecting the laundry and the process will start over. Let that shirt you own be the snake with memory venom in it.  When you get drunk you may even consider wearing it during a game just to test the Leonard shirt’s luck. You may get a little black out drunk, wake up in your Durant shirt and feel like you cheated on Westbrook. I mean put Leonard and Aldridge in the previous sentence wherever seems appropriate."
Everyone together  FUCK YOU KEVIN DURANT
my interest in the nba plummeted   Fuck Kevin Durant 
[This one still blows my mind](http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sporting_news/11/f1/kevin-durant-stephen-curry-getty-ftr-051616_1s0p6zwz36jk515xg38h3d0evp.jpg?t=-1164327596&amp;w=960&amp;quality=70)
anything that bumps kd down is a ok in my mind because fuck kevin durant
The point is people nitpick Curry’s game 3. One game which tanked his stats. Meanwhile kd had a terrible game 1. Curry’s impact led to Kevin Durant having the easiest way to score efficiently all series. No doubles.  Curry won them game 2 so I’m not sure how you consider it shaky.  Durants game 1 would of been all time bad if he got called for a charge or jr smith did something in the end. I dont credit the disparity between the players fts to really support that kd carried them when most warriors fans are on the record curry doesn’t get calls/fts.  Plus/minus can also be accounted for subsitutstion patterns and rotations you face/play with.  
"Most dangerous sneks in the world: Black Mamba, Tiger Snake, King Cobra, Kevin Durant. "
Kevin Durant is Kevin Durant.
"No, it’s Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant is a virgin and pee is stored in the balls
Which part did Kevin Durant say that winning rings is *no big deal*?  God forbid he has a multifaceted approach to basketball that differs from yours. 
"The “geriatric” Spurs had the best record in the league, the only team to win 60+ games. They also beat the Thunder in the playoffs with MVP Kevin Durant and the 2nd best record very easily that year. Won by an average of 21 points. “Geriatric” Tim Duncan killed Bosh, averaged double his rebounds in less minutes and Gonobili (off the bench), Parker, and Kawhi all outplayed Dwyane Wade. Lebron was by far the best player in that series."
Yeah it was pretty big news for a couple days. Where you been man? You know Kevin Durant joined the Warriors right?
"Here's a list of people who shot &gt;.400 on &gt;5 attempts per game for the 17-18 season.

Don’t let that distract you from the fact the 2015-2016 Thunder lost three consecutive games after gaining a 3-1 advantage. This loss led to Star Player Kevin Durant leaving to the Golden State Warriors. 
"If Jayson Tatum bulks up, he could be absolutely unstoppable. Shades of Kevin Durant in that kid...... basically KD but not a fuckin' snake"
I'm thinking a poor man's Kevin Durant. 
Kobe Bryant  Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant  Karl Malone  Kareem Adbul Jabar  Let Kobe be the point guard for more fun

Anyone else think he’d put Kevin Durant as Snake?
"You sound like this person - https://youtu.be/WqSTXuJeTks  Maybe you're KD using alternate accounts.  All in all, if you feel that deeply about Kevin Durant that what I said hurt your feelings, I apologize.  We're on a sports forum and none of us will ever know KD, nor will he give a damn about us if we're in the hospital and can't pay for life saving surgery. Most people don't develop family like attachments to celebrities.  But again there are such people, and I once again apologize if I hurt your feelings. To me Kevin Durant is a character in an entertaining show called the NBA. That's who I'm making fun of.  If he's more than that to you, I'm sorry."

"Based on how people perceived them heading into the draft? Not knowing how their careers would play out, I'd draft in this following order (in 2010 as stated):  1. Shaquille O'Neal  2. David Robinson  3. LeBron James  4. Bill Walton  5. Tim Duncan  6. Kevin Durant  7. Jason Kidd  8. Dwyane Wade  9. Steph Curry  10. Dirk Nowitzki"
Snake -Kevin Durant  Missed such an opportunity 
When you quit your job at Toys R Us to work for Amazon.  Kevin Durant!
Steve Kerr and Pop are friends. You think there are many Coaches who think highly of a player pulling Kawhis bullshit? Dude is gonna be a bust when he gets booted out of San Antonio  Steve Kerr says no. Shit Kevin Durant will say no to the system player too 
"Think about it this way.  Tampering can directly affect the competitive balance of the league.    For example, let's say Kevin Durant agrees to like a $20mil one year deal with the Warriors, with a handshake agreement that he'll sign the max after it ends.  That's basically a slap to face of fairness that the Warriors can build a team with a severely below market value star player.  It doesn't give anyone else a chance to really speak with him.   Likewise, I'm sure there's tons of legal reasons, CBA details, etc.  What if KD inexplicably bombs or gets injured during that year?  It would create a giant mess for the FO and the rest of the league.  It also gives front office an unequal amount of power.  Again, if the Warriors decided to renounce that max contact they were gonna offer KD, there's not really anything to stop them.  I believe the CBA also exists to stop these kinds of scenarios from ever happening.  Anything not in writing really doesn't benefit anyone here.  "
"For OKC, it has to be Kevin Durant leaving. The rumors of Al Horford being interested makes it even worse. Westbrook, Oladipo, Durant, Horford, Adams would be a killer lineup. "
"I disagree, btw. I think the unicorn term is meant to describe guys who are long enough to defend the post while also being able to move and score like guards. KP was the first guy I heard the term for, and Embiid is the other name I consistently hear now, but Davis and Giannis have both come up before, and I think they're relevant. I don't think it has to do with the ability to shoot the 3-pointer at all. I also think Kevin Durant has probably become a unicorn in GS which is terrifying to think about."
"*Cough* Kevin Durant *Cough*....I mean....""Kevin Durant is making so much money with his Silicon Valley investments!"""
Kevin Durant said the same thing too
"&gt; A 23-year-old Pratt left Wanda Durant and their sons, Kevin and Tony, about a year later and was in and out of his family’s life for about 10 years.  Am I misreading something?  It says he left and popped in from time to time for stuff like basketball games."
"""I went there for some easy ass titles, as that Curry boy and LeBron were too much for me to handle""  - Kevin Durant,2018 "
"Kevin Durant but I see Brandon as more of a mix of KD and Giannis, closer to Giannis though"
Respect to the self control that it must of taken to not put Kevin Durant as snake purely because of his name
"Mychal Thompson is on the record as far back as April 2015 saying Warrors would pursue KD.  http://www.warriorsworld.net/2015/04/30/warriors-rumors-kevin-durant-to-be-targeted-on-good-authority/  &gt;The Warriors already have two Splash Brothers, but is there room for three? According to Mychal Thompson of ESPN LA 710, the Warriors will reportedly pursue Durant hard in free agency in 2016 (9:55):  &gt;&gt;“I also heard it on good authority from a team that plays in the Bay Area that they’re going to go hard after Kevin Durant.”"
"&gt; If I was a multi millionaire, taking care of myself, my family and my community all while succeeding on the highest stage of my profession, then there’s not much that would bother me. Certainly not online bullies.   Imagine humans having human emotions...  Kevin Durant being rich doesn't exclude him from feeling self-conscious. You just sound like you don't have any empathy here because you think anybody with a million dollars shouldn't have any problems. "
"As I've seen other redditors comment, Kevin Durant raises Golden State's floor, while Stephen Curry raises their ceiling."
"Game 1 WCF - GSW vs SAS:  Kawhi leaves the game with 7:53 remaining in the 3rd  (19:53 minutes left in the game).  The score is: **78-55** for San Antonio. Curry scores most of his points in the 3rd (scores 19 there) and Durant takes over in the 4th (scoring 12).   - Even after missing the last 20 minutes, Kawhi ends up with 26/8/3/1 on 7/13 shooting (24 minutes played).  Kawhi up until that point is clearly the most valuable player and the best performing one in that particular game. Most of Curry and Durants points come after he gets injured.  Impact in the game:   - Kawhi Leonard +21. Net Rating: +44 (only starter in the Spurs positive)   - Kevin Durant: +14. Net Rating: +26   - Steph Curry: +8. Net Rating: +14  If you wanna check the highlights (re-watching the game takes a while), you can look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buo3wN-ncoQ) video, 2:50 out of 8:24 minutes of the Curry highlights are pre Kawhi injury, and thats with the video intro. Until Kawhi gets injured, the Warriors struggle very hard.  If I had to take one for the Warriors, it would be Curry, but otherwise I might go with Leonard (assuming health). His ability to defend at a DPOY level and then score easily and efficiently on the other end is unvaluable. Very hard choice to make though, and obviously 24 minutes of that game is not the difference, hell, I don't even think the Spurs would have won the series had Leonard played."

But you can’t discredit the warriors for the progression the organization has made in the past six years. "
Kevin Durant easily 
"The Warriors are the villains of the NBA. Nobody besides their own fans want to see them succeed any more. Kevin Durant is the least likable, and best player on their team. I don't understand why you think people should respect them. It's just how sports are. When you're starting to get good everyone loves you because you're the new ""darlings"" of the league. After you've been good for a while the hate starts. That being said, fuck KD and the Warriors lmao hArDeSt rOAd my ass KD a bitch."

It's literally what most people expected. We are mad at him because he joined a team that would make it easy for him to win titles. Now he is easily winning titles. Why would we not be mad anymore?  Did you really expect people to just be mad for a week and then cheer him on while he steamrolled all their favorite teams with his fucking Voltron Super Team? Is that a rational thing for you to expect from people? Maybe you are caught up in the backlash against the backlash."

Getting weird Kyrie and Kevin Durant to Knicks vibes (in 1-2 years). They keep praising each other in the press and may want to go somewhere to prove themselves all over again.
Kevin Durant because once a beta always a beta.
"i hate to be a downer and im sure that a lot of this is genuine.. but i think this is too perfectly timed. i think with a lot of fans getting frankly.. bored with the gsw domination of the nba, and kevin durant being considered a snek, having his legacy tarnished by going to gsw, having the burner twitter account, and just not really being celebrated as an nba champion with his 2 ring with gs .. i think blowing up this kind of story is an attempt to humanize him and to be honest, win him back some fans. family stuff doesnt HAVE to be publicized and neatly packaged in an article like this.. doesn't make it any less genuine, but i think whoever's behind this is capitalizing on an obviously positive event in kd and his dad's life.. that said.. fuck golden state. houston 2019 baby  "
lebron james needs to give delonte west and kevin durant some fathers day gifts
"He's got it wrong and he has it over generalized. All we think is that in 2015 is that it's a series if Kevin and Kyrie don't get hurt. LeBron took us to 6 games, so having Kyrie and Kevin for the full series gives us more of a shot. And 2017 it's also a series that we have a legitimate shot at. Consensus isn't that we win, consensus is that because of Kevin Durant, the series was pretty much wrapped up before it even started."
"Using players nobody else has used:  **2008-09 Chris Paul** (arguably the best season ever for a point guard, although probably falls behind 2015-16 Curry. 9th best season ever according to BPM, and is a pass first point guard so that opens up opportunities for me to add elite scorers at the other positions.)  **2002-03 Tracy McGrady** (by far McGrady’s greatest season, his ability to lead that far below average supporting cast to a winning record is insane. Averaged 23-7-6 on over 56 TS% which ranks in the top 25 in the NBA that season, when TS% was around its lowest point in league history.)  **2013-14 Kevin Durant** (Only season in NBA history where a player averaged more than 31 PPG on 61.5+ TS%, seems like a pretty obvious pick.)  **2003-04 Kevin Garnett** (the best regular season for a PF ever in my opinion, and was 3 votes away from being a unanimous MVP. Played all 82 games, averaged 24-14-5 on 55 TS% with also one of the greatest defensive seasons in an NBA season ever. Also managed to win 2 games vs. the Shaq and Kobe Lakers in the conference finals with his 2nd best teammate battling injuries, and the rest of the roster being subpar. I’d be looking more for his defensive impact than his offensive production since I already have 2 all-time great scorers in my squad, but he is a very good scorer and distributor anyway, and has an efficient mid-range shot so he can be relied on offensively if needed.)   **2003-04 Ben Wallace** (arguably the greatest defensive performance in a single season. Anchored the greatest defense ever and was arguably the best player on a title team that took down Shaq and Kobe. Most defensive advanced stats agree this is the greatest defensive season, if not, it’s probably another Ben Wallace season. Also an elite rebounder and easily makes up for his lack of height and would be just as much of a force today. Having Garnett and Wallace on the court at the same time would easily lead to one of the greatest defenses in NBA history and makes up for any defensive liabilities coming from the others in the lineup. With the other 4 players in the lineup capable of averaging an efficient 20+ PPG, scoring from Wallace wouldn’t be needed, and his defensive impact and rebounding are easily amongst the best in NBA history.)

Kevin Durant: A letter to my son Lebron James on Father’s Day 
"This is very sweet and sentimental, but I have a feeling Kevin Durant is annoyed he did this."
"&gt; Pratt was there to listen as his son made perhaps the biggest decision of his life. He advised Kevin Durant to “be selfish.”  Did Wayne Pratt ruin the NBA?  Nah but on a serious note, I implore anyone still open-minded about KD to check out his backstory and the things he has done off the court all through his career.  It's fair to hate his decision from a basketball perspective, and his obvious character flaws, but the dude has a genuinely big and good heart. "
"I know with context that it is a good advice, but the irony is quite rich coming from an absentee parent.   “Pratt played an advisory and support role for Durant when he decided on July 4, 2016, to sign with the Golden State Warriors as a free agent. Pratt was there to listen as his son made perhaps the biggest decision of his life. He advised Kevin Durant to “be selfish.”"
"It's really not that difficult lol. Dude left a contending team to a team that had already proven to the world that they could win a championship without him. Not only that, but he uses burner accounts to justify his decision and shit on [literal children for still living at their parents' house](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2017/9/18/16327672/kevin-durant-private-instagram-account-arguments-nba-warriors).

He was Kevin Durant 2.0 his last year of high school. 
"His shot at the end of regulation against OKC on opening night in 2016 was my breaking point.  Kawhi's coming out game just obliterating Kevin and Russ, then we're down 1-2 points with 20 seconds left I think.  We inbound the ball, Danny gets it and you see Kawhi coming to get it to start his ISO. Danny proceeds to shoot a straight line drive 3 over Durant I thnk leaving 17 seconds on the clock and misses.  Camera cuts to Pop and hes like ""DANNY WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING!"", Danny's all like ""aww Pop I though I had the shot. Dang almost go it too""  It wasn't because he thought he could make it like a Jamal or JR, he's not really that confident. Just a complete dumbass moment for Danny.   Funniest shit to piss me off so much. That's how I remember it at least. Still love him though. Hahaha."

"What does this prove? Tell me the worst team LeBron has lost to when he had another All-Star with him?  He has lost to the Pistons, Spurs, Celtics, Magic, Mavericks, and Warriors. Against the Pistons in 2006 his next best player was Big Z who averaged 10 points per game for the series compared to LeBron's 26.6. In 2007 against the Spurs his next best player was Drew Gooden or Big Z and Gooden was the second leading scorer averaging 12.8 points per game to Lebron's 22. In 2008 against the Celtics his next best player was Big Z again who averaged 11.9 points per game to LeBron's 26.7. In 2009 against the Magic his second best player was Mo Williams who averaged 18.3 points per game to LeBron's 38.5. In 2010 against the Celtics his second best player was Shaq or Mo who averaged 13.5 and 13.3 points per game to LeBron's 26.8. In 2011 against the Mavericks Wade was the best player who averaged 26.5 while LeBron averaged 17.8 points per game. In 2014 against the Spurs his second best player was Wade who averaged 15.2 points per game against LeBron's 28.2. In 2015 against the Warriors his second best player was Mozgov who averaged 14 points per game against LeBron's 35.8. In 2017 against the Warriors his second best player was Irving who averaged 29.4 points per game against LeBron's 33.6. In 2018 against the Warriors his second best player was Kevin Love who averaged 19 points per game against LeBron's 34.   LeBron has run into dynasties, other than the Magic and Mavericks, every time he has lost in the playoffs. Detroit during their best years, Celtics during their best most recent years, Spurs in their prime, and the Warriors who may be the best team ever assembled. I do not see your point in asking who the worst team KD has lost to without an All-Star is.  You know what the craziest thing about LeBron is though. He is his teams leading scorer and playmaker in every single series other than 2011 against the Mavericks. He was still the team leading playmaker though. What series has KD won being the leader of his team as both the main scorer and playmaker? One. 2013 first round vs Memphis when Westbrook got hurt. They would go on to lose in the next round. LeBron has been his teams best scorer and playmaker on every single team he has ever been on. And he wins this way when Durant could not."
"You shouldn't. You're by and large the best team in the NBA, both on the court and seemingly in the locker room as well. I get that y'all have survived acquiring swaggy and javale, but what dwight could potentially bring to the table you just don't need with all the damage he could do. He's completely toxic.   From wiki: &gt; On March 15, 2012, on the day of the trading deadline for the 2011–12 NBA season, Howard signed an amendment to his contract, waiving his right to opt out at the end of the season and committing to stay with the Magic through the 2012–13 season. He had previously asked to be traded to the New Jersey Nets, and the Magic were prepared to trade him had Howard not signed the amendment, to avoid losing him as a free agent.[48] On April 5, Van Gundy said that he was informed by management that Howard wanted him fired. During the interview, the center walked up and hugged his coach, unaware that Van Gundy had confirmed a report that Howard denied.  Then in LA: &gt;""You play with Kobe Bryant you know, he's going to get them up,"" Howard said. ""But, at the same time, I have to find ways to still be effective. I can't allow that to affect how I play. There were a lot of times early in the season where I would get upset you know, because I felt like he shot the ball a lot. And you know, I wanted some touches down low. Do I want touches, yeah. But, whatever I have to do to help this team win, I have to keep my mind in that area.""  Then you can't forget Durant getting in a shouting match with him while on the bench in a leg cast, yelling at Dwight over and over, ""You're a pussy!"" Gary Payton later said about it, which is sort of confirmed by a lot of the podcasts that Durant has done with Simmons: &gt;""I think he’s disliked by a lot of players. What Dwight does is, you know you see all the smiles and all the antics, that is getting on player’s nerves. To get this guy, Kevin Durant, to do what he did, you know it’s starting to become a problem with players, because Kevin Durant doesn’t really talk to anybody … [Durant] goes at people that are fake with stuff. Only fake guys. Fake guys to me are when they’re always woofing, woofing, woofing, and they don’t really do nothing.""  Now you have two franchises in back-to-back years doing what they can to dump the guy. That Hawks trade was awful.   A player as gifted as he is shouldn't be looking towards his 7th team in 7 years. That's an awful, awful sign and the Warriors are exceptional enough to not need anything to do with that mess, even for a minimum. "
I think people are honestly mistakenly directing their hate at Warriors. I keep saying this but no one really hates the warriors. That team was home grown and complete as evidence by a championship and a 73-9 season. What people hate is Kevin Durant and him joining an already proven team. It’s the Warriors and Kevin Durant. I think a lot of people would agree with me that we respect what the Warriors did but hate Kevin Durant. Losing in 2016 and going out to grab arguably the second best player in the league is just wildly frustrating because it eliminated all hope of a competitive series for the next few years. 
The warriors go small with Kevin Durant whos 7 feet tall.  Its a style of play more than height.

"It would be awesome.  Kevin Durant, Nick Young, Draymond Green, and Dwight Howard.  Next season would be short on competitiveness, but drama everywhere. "
"Confidence is good, I'm concerned that Porter is arrogant. If he thinks he's already a more physical version of Kevin Durant then how can you have faith that he's going to work hard and improve his game?"
PG - Chris Paul SG - Klay Thomson  SF - Lebron James  PF - Kevin Durant  C - Jokic 
51/8/8 with no other All NBA teammates   And Kevin Love is an All Star but not a two way player   LeBron is way better still he has way less to work with and still showed up against a better team - next year again we will see LeBron outplay Durant
Don't forget Kevin Durant too
because they have a despicable player named kevin durant. they deserve shame and pain because of that
"But so many wings from 2017 immediately succeeded. If you can see the future it's nice to be forward thinking, but 2020 is 2 years away! Kevin Durant is still going to be 32, Lebron might still be in the finals.   Tatum, Mitchell, OG, Kuzma, Josh Jackson. Those long, switchable wing players who can score on or off (-Jackson) the ball were making immediate impacts. They should still have more value in the draft. "
"&gt;But at the same time, it’s difficult to conclude that this is a true heyday for taller players when you consider how little difference any of them made during the playoffs. The percentage of total postseason minutes logged by players 6-foot-10 or taller has fallen from 29 percent in 2009 (the year 6-foot-11 Dwight Howard led the Orlando Magic to the NBA Finals) to 22 percent this year. At the same time, the share of playoff VORP belonging to big men has fallen from 34 percent to 26 percent. Only two players 6-foot-10 or taller — Kevin Love and JaVale McGee — played any significant minutes in the NBA Finals.  &gt;In recent postseasons, the switch-heavy defensive schemes that top teams play have often made it a tactical liability to rely heavily on traditional big-man types, to say nothing of the negative effects of playing a nonshooter like most bigs have been throughout NBA history.  I think there’s a ton of merit to this point. If these big men have the scoring, shooting, agility and ball skills they’re projected to have they will have an impact in the NBA. But at the highest levels there’s still the difficulty of consistently scoring at the three point line, sometimes off the dribble and defending those same shots on the other end.   There’s also the resource allocation question, you need multiple wings and 1 big. Wings can manufacture isolation while big men can more easily be doubled. The big man is still devalued by the current game. There’s also the career arc/developmental curve to consider, shorter players last longer, some players with elite length come into the league raw.   There is a flaw in their data here though, they're counting KD as under 6-10. But I think it's fair to say Ayton, Bamba, Bagley and Jackson don't project to have the kind of handle and lateral agility that Durant has.   "
"&gt; Only two players 6-foot-10 or taller — Kevin Love and JaVale McGee — played any significant minutes in the NBA Finals.  Plus Kevin Durant, who's for some reason listed 6' 9"""
"Everyone is pointing to his defense but the real reason is just that the Western Conference was too crowded. He probably would have made at least one ASG if he was in the East.  In his best season, the West All-Stars also had Kobe, Billups, Tony Parker, Chris Paul, and Brandon Roy filling up the guard spots.  He even had to beat out other Western Conference All-Star snubs like Deron Williams, Kevin Durant, Steve Nash, Stephen Jackson, Jason Terry, etc."
Or FInals MVP Kevin Durant/Andre Igoudala.     Or Shaqtin MVP Javale McGee!
"Better question: If the league was full of only clones of Kevin Durant, would the league grind to a halt because all the Durants would try to join the same team?"
"Instead of showing historic MVP winners, why not every day we show a different picture of Kevin Durant or Draymond Green with a **2018 NBA CHAMPIONS GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS** banner over it? Maybe some of them smiling, out on the town, etc. "
Its because of Kevin Durant.   You need someone who can play like him or close to and someone who can defend multiple positions since we in a switch everything era. 
"I asked the side image at shootaround if he's playing tonight. ""Kevin Durant wins his 2nd NBA Finals MVP to lead The Warriors to back to back NBA Championships!,"" he said. I was taken aback, then I realized I was wearing a ""1956 Bob Pettit"" hoodie with a different image on it. The old r/nba might have died, but shitposting lives! (And yes, he said NEPHEW)"
His Wikipedia even says “not to be confused with Kevin Durant” right at the top lol.
"maybe i’m biased but i don’t get how people could be mad at kevin durant for leaving in god damn free agency and not get much more angry about someone like Kawhi basically backing out on his contract and forcing his team to trade him for less than he’s worth.   i don’t get how someone can have that little integrity. maybe having millions and a finals mvp changed him, but that shit is such a bad look as a person. "
This past season Kevin Durant shot 48.7% from 16ft-3pt line according to Basketball Reference. 44.9% for his career.  Don’t go cherry picking playoff runs for KD when you’re using Kareem’s entire career for the comparison. Especially when the playoff runs you’ve chosen are KD’s two highest percentage runs from that distance of his career.  This doesn’t take away from the fact that you invented a percentage for the Skyhook that is based on nothing at all.
"Fair enough, as the reigning champs I think we should get to select the historic MVP winners, at least for this off-season. Maybe give them a week each?  On behalf of my fellow dubs fans I propose the following order to start out:  Stephen Curry (2015-2016), Kevin Durant (2013-2014), Stephen Curry (2014-2015), Wilt Chamberlain (1959-1960), Steve Nash (2004-2005), Fuck you Steve Nash again (2005-2006), Kevin Garnett (2003-2004), Derrick Rose (2010-2011), Dirk Nowitzki (2006-2007), Allen Iverson (2000-2001), Karl Malone (1989-1990), Bill Walton (1977-1978)... and that should do it for awhile  e: Added Rose "
Kevin Durant was an mvp 4x scoring leader joining a team with a 2x mvp and 2 other all stars that had just broken the bulls record to become the best regular season team of all time.  Lebron and bosh joined a team with one all time players who had just gotten eliminated in the first round.  I would say there’s a difference
Is Kevin Durant good?
"The one-and-done rule needs to go, but it's not preventing anyone from making the NBA (i.e. Kevin Durant, Karl-Anthony Towns). On a separate note, there aren't just ""more LeBrons"" out there."
"Where are your stats coming from?   This season alone LeBron is 27/8/9 with 62.1% TS to KDs 26/7/5 64% TS. But LeBron played 82 games to KDs 68 and LeBron had about 1800 more FGA this season than KD which makes it much harder to be efficient. That negates a 2% gap in efficiency and, if anything, makes LeBron’s more impressive than KD. After all, you stated in another comment that “if LeBron took more shots his efficiency would drop.”  This years playoffs LeBron averaged 34/9/9 on 61.9% TS against KD’s 29/8/5 on 60.6% TS. LeBron also had .5 more steals per game while KD has .2 more blocks per game.  Kevin Durant scored fewer points this years playoffs than LeBron James with worse efficiency and fewer rebounds and assists. You can’t use career averages to determine who’s the best right now."
"&gt; I don’t understand the point you’re trying to make.  He's not really making one. He's just randomly grabbing narratives in an attempt to justify his broken Warriors team.  The point is that if the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead and won the year before, then we have _competitive_ finals. Kevin Durant hopping on that bandwagon ruins that competitiveness."
"Did  He  Just  Say  Fake  Allstar  In all seriousness can't you argue that all of Kevin Durants rings and chips are fake because he joined a 73-9 team that won a championship the year before. A team that he LOST too. Also, if you put Kevin Durant in that mess of a franchise they call the cavs, he wouldnt do nearly as well as Lebron."
 Kevin Durant.
"The meaning of going small is basically that the traditional center has died out in today's NBA. It's more about stretch bigs, basically tall players who can dribble and shoot especially from the perimeter. Think of guys like Kevin Durant he's a good example. In traditional NBA he would most likely play SF, but in today's NBA he can even play Center at times if they really wanted to. And for a team in today's NBA it'd be a dream to have tall guys who can do it all like KD, Giannis etc. Those juicy Eddy Curry's or Eric Dampier's days are gone for now at least."
"If you're lucky though, you might get someone like Victor Oladipo or Kevin Durant or LaMarcus Aldridge."
Kevin Durant: playing with 3 all stars 
2018 Finals:  Kevin Durant: 10.8 rebounds per game  Lebron: 8.5 rebounds per game
Terrance Furgeson. aka Kevin Durant. 
Kevin Durant is also the only Superstar to have an opportunity to go to a team that good as a Max level player due to the cap spiking 24 million in one year.   We would have seen it before if the spike was a regular occurrence.
emphasis on kyrie  and add james harden and kevin durant.
"Thats just false, court is 2 feet shorter and half a foot narrower its not 20 meters dude... Why did Kevin Durant average 35 when he played? Lack of explosiveness and inability to finish in traffic is the main reason for preferable passing game, there is a reason most best euro players play in NBA. Help defense comes faster because attacker cant get there in time as much as because court is narrower, and there is a difference if help defender is DeAndre Jordan or Adrian Moerman. Why did Rudy Gobert suck most of the time he played for France if your theory is flawless?"
THAT SHIT IS MAD CORNY MAKE IT STOP. It’s like trying to make fetch happen. Why retire “Death lineup”. THEY HAVE KEVIN DURANT NOW. To me it seems even more fitting
Kevin Durant is the only 4x Scoring champion and MVP in history to sign with a team that won 73 games and broke the all-time record in regular season games.

Don’t think it’s fair to say LeBron has been the best player since 2008. Steph Curry and Kevin Durant had those historic seasons where they were clear cut playing absolute lunacy basketball 
"Kevin Durant, snek. "
"&gt; Kobe was 25 when Lebron entered the league, and Tim Duncan was 27. Also if Kevin Durant ends up a top 10 player their primes will overlap.  Right, and that's why their primes didn't overlap. Kobe/Duncan were already in their primes when LeBron was 18. By the time LeBron became the best player in the league (2010ish), Kobe/Duncan were 32-34 years old and he was competing with Dwight, Wade (who's probably top-20 at best), and 21 year olds Durant + Derrick Rose.  "
"Kobe was 25 when Lebron entered the league, and Tim Duncan was 27.  Also if Kevin Durant ends up a top 10 player their primes will overlap.  Also, there were plenty of years Jerry West wasn't even the 3rd best player in the league (Oscar Robertson and Elgin Baylor had a bunch of years better than him).      "
Can Kevin Durant join our Framily plan?
"""And last, something I constantly say, don't forget to glory in the wonder that are snakes. The slither, they squirm, they come right out of the grass and betray your ass. Kevin Durant, signed in free agency by Golden State Warriors like a bitch after choking against them in the playoffs."""
Those Kevin Durant legs tho xDD
"Okay this is a fair criticism of my point. As a counterpoint I want to submit that the 2015-16 Cavaliers were a better team than the Warriors (if the Cavs were 100% healthy). The Warriors had to solve the problem of how do we get better than the Cavaliers. Kevin Durant was how. He made them a superteam. Maybe they were a superteam without him, but if so, then the Cavaliers were as well before Kyrie left."
"&gt;Kevin Durant is the only player to sign with a team that won over 50 games.  is straight up false. MVP? sure. all star? i haven't done the research.   anyway, it is funny."
Not everyone can just add a Kevin Durant when they can't get past lebron
"Oh come on now. Fine. One more time:   Kevin Durant is the only MVP in the history of the NBA to sign with a team IN HIS PRIME that won 60+ games the prior year. That makes it look even softer, haha."
"Golden state is a model franchise that did things the right way. They were everyone’s golden child. 73 wins. Championship favorites. Beat by Lebron who some argue is the GOAT. Became a laughing stock with the memes but everyone knew they would still be the favorites next season. Everyone loved em still.   But then they ruined it by signing Durant. It was probably the weakest move ever in NBA history. Arguably the second best player in the league and will go down in history as a top 20 player of ALL time joining the team with the best record of all time.   When I watch the warriors I don’t hate them. They did what any franchise would to get better. But they were stoppable before signing Durant. Now who knows what it’ll take to beat them.   The Miami heat were stoppable with the big 3. That made things fun. They lost to Dallas. They lost to the spurs. They beat a young OKC and got taken to 7 by the spurs.   The warriors just stomp everyone. Swept Lebron. How does anyone even enjoy this? Even warriors fans have to feel this isn’t basketball.   Now as a cascade, teams will outright tank or form super teams. Or they will try to build through the draft so by the time golden state dies off, they’ll be at the top of the realm. This all started because of a mentally weak super star in Kevin Durant. It might make him happy that he’s winning rings but we know he’s insecure with his burner accounts. He was never strong mentally in okc and we saw the Batman Robin dynamic with Westbrook/Durant. So he took the easy way out. Joined Steph to take out Lebron.   No one is mad at golden state. They did what’s best for them like any franchise would. But it was Kevin Durant’s decision to ruin the league. "
"Russell Westbrook, drafted. James Harden, drafted. Serge Ibaka, drafted. Andre Roberson, drafted.    Kevin Durant, drafted, first max contract retroactively increased without salary cap room.    Kevin Durant, signed 2016, highest salary cap increase ever.  "
"Such an excellent team, ADam... that they only won a ring when LeBron had 2 injured all-stars and then promptly shit the bed and lost the following season when the Cavs were full strength.  The only thing that makes Golden State ""great"" is abusing your CBA like a rented mule and signing Kevin Durant. That's the only reason they've kept winning, ADam, so go fuck yourself.  Now we have shitty Finals every year and the Warriors still need players to get injured and help from referees to advance because all you care about, ADam, is selling advertising slots. THAT'S ALL YOU CARE ABOUT ADam."

"&gt; ""I'm hearing they're going for Josh Jackson"". This is speculation based on his sources, he isn't definitively saying they will get Jackson. He also says about half way in the video that they're also eyeing Markelle Fultz as well but I'm guessing that part was conveniently skipped by some.  This is a conversation about his sources, and as you said, he's going off of his sources, which are clearly garbage because literally everyone knew Philly traded up for Fultz and he was hours away from doing a mock workout for them.  &gt; ""He wants to wear the purple and gold, and if there’s a way for it to happen, again he’s restricted, if there’s a way for it to happen, DeMar DeRozan will be in a Los Angeles Lakers uniform next season.

Haven't seen a lot of Demar in LA though.  &gt; Key word is trying. He didn't definitively say that there's a trade done where the Bulls will trade Butler for the #3.

I don't even know what Stephen A said directly. Why is this even in this list of evidence?  Why do you have to his exact words? He was suggesting that he wanted to join the Lakers. But if that matters so much: https://www.slamonline.com/uncategorized/stephen-a-smith-says-theres-a-big-possibility-kevin-durant-signs-with-lakers/. Now I'm not sure what you consider a ""big possibility"", but I'm definitely not thinking ""big possibility"" and then ""doesn't even take a meeting"".   &gt; but again it was likely speculative and based off his sources. Not definitive.  Baseless assertion  &gt; Stephen A is giving his opinion on what Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh will do, not what he reportedly heard from sources. For what it's worth he did say he believed Wade and Bosh definitely want to stay in Miami and he was right. He was just incorrect about them opting out.  If you're being a reporter, and you straight up say something in a professional context, it's assumed you basing it off of your sources. Regardless, as you stated, he was still wrong, and doubly so because Bosh definitely did not ""definitely want to stay in Miami"", as the Rockets subreddit can attest to.   &gt; This is just a completely wrong claim. Stephen A said this is a possible option IF LeBron saw Bosh was leaving Miami. That's completely different than LeBron actively trying to replace Bosh with Melo. In regards to this Stephen A also said ""That is my personal belief based on the people I have spoken to over the last several months"". He isn't reporting this based on sources, this is just what he personally deduces based on people he has spoken to over months of time. It's different than officially reporting something based on his sources. One is his opinion, one is what he's hearing.

"I don't think anyone -- including Kevin Pelton -- would say he's a better prospect than Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant and definitely not LeBron."
"Putting Dwight on the Warriors makes them worse, are you guys serious? The dude has a horrific reputation to demanding his inefficient post touches. Do y'all really want to see Steph Curry and Kevin Durant handle the ball instead of Dwight frickin' Howard?"
"To replace it there needs a nickname with flow that pokes at Kevin Durant joining a 73 win team that lost in the NBA Finals because Draymond got suspended, Steph wasn't 100%, Bogut got hurt, and Kerr played Festus Ezeli in a critical moment for some ridiculous reason."
"&gt;The NBA allowed Kevin Durant  I didn't need to read anything after that. And dafuq is your point? You the one who took the time to post some dumbass trades, don't try jumping on the ""fuck the Warriors"" bandwagon to feel better about yourself or save your karma."
"The NBA allowed Kevin Durant to sign with a 73 win team that won a championship 2 seasons prior, made back to back finals, had the unanimous MVP, 3 ALL-NBA players and a DPOY level defender. And a FMVP off the bench. Yet you guys still find a way to complain and play the victim. Lmfao. "
"Neither violated the rules. KDs came at a time to the cap jumped like crazy. It was the right place right time. He liked the city and the style that they played. It was a good fit. I just think people are hypocritical for being totally cool with what the Heat did and thinking Kevin Durant is some evil person. Neither were “fair” to the rest of the League and both were done for the same purpose of wining rings and dominating the league. LeBron didn’t say “maybe one, perhaps two of things really go our way.” As a fan in the East we always knew we had no chance against the Heat superteam. They were unbeatable. "
Kevin Durant is the only MVP in the history of the NBA to sign with a team that won 70+ games the prior year.   S O F T E S T
"Fine, let's move the goalposts. Kevin Durant is the only MVP in the history of the NBA to sign with a team that won 60+ games the prior year. That makes it look even softer, haha. "
"""...and of course Kevin Durant is a snake..."""
"Yeah, how can you watch [this video](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2702557-br-gives-kevin-durant-slim-reaper-treatment-for-his-return-to-golden-state) and tell me that ""Slim Reaper"" isn't a cool nickname? That image of KD as the long, cold-blooded assassin is the main reason I don't view him solely as a cupcake who took the shortcut to rings.  EDIT: Actually I guess he's cold-blooded either way, since he's a reptile."
"Come on man. There were plenty of questions about Wade and Lebron clashing, since both are ball-dominant, and non-shooters. Zach Lowe covered some of the differences between the Heatles and this GSW team after KD signed in 2016: [http://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/16766273/the-warriors-makings-all-super-team-addition-kevin-durant](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/16766273/the-warriors-makings-all-super-team-addition-kevin-durant)"

Why is this even in this list of evidence?  &gt;Lakers get either Melo or LeBron in 2014  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INFNRNWBOlg  Okay this is just plain copyright blocked so I still have no idea what was said but again it was likely speculative and based off his sources. Not definitive.   &gt; Lakers get either Melo or LeBron in 2014 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMnhayk9uGI  Stephen A is giving his opinion on what Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh will do, not what he reportedly heard from sources. Opinion without sources =/= Reporting what sources told him. For what it's worth he did say he believed Wade and Bosh definitely want to stay in Miami and he was right. He was just incorrect about them opting out.   &gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j5WuI5dbvQ  Again, Stephen A is giving his opinion on the matter. I didn't hear him once talk about him basing this information about Dwight going to the nets based on his sources or someone close to Dwight saying he'll go to the Nets. He specifically even says ""Dwight Howard, TO ME, ends up in Brooklyn""  &gt;LeBron was waiting out the 2014 offseason to try to replace Bosh with Melo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDEPwsoHRig  This is just a completely wrong claim. Stephen A said this is a possible option IF LeBron saw Bosh was leaving Miami. That's completely different than LeBron actively trying to replace Bosh with Melo. In regards to this Stephen A also said ""That is my personal belief based on the people I have spoken to over the last several months"". He isn't reporting this based on sources, this is just what he personally deduces based on people he has spoken to over months of time. It's different than officially reporting something based on his sources. One is his opinion, one is what he's hearing.  So overall two of these videos were just invalid or not directly from Stephen A. Two of these videos were Stephen A giving his personal opinion, not reporting confirmed news or even rumors. The rest were videos of speculation by Stephen A, some of which was contingent of certain other events happening (Bosh didn't leave before LeBron, there may not have been a feasible way for Derozan to be a Laker since he's restricted).  The problem is for some reason alot of people on this subreddit can't differentiate between someone giving his opinion, someone reporting what he's heard based on sources, and someone officially reporting and confirming something has happened. For some reason some people believe all are one in the same which is why some believe his opinions are reports from his sources and vice versa. In this case Stephen A is giving an entire statement of what he's heard from a source which indicates it's definitive and not a wishy washy source. If it was an uncertain source he likely wouldn't have the strong words of ""I don't want to be in San Antonio"", the report would probably be ""Kawhi reportedly said he's unhappy about things in San Antonio"" or something not as definitive.

Must be nice to be Kevin Durant. 
"Hahaha this isn't even true and you dumb motherfuckers are agreeing with him. Remember when MVP Kevin Durant missed an entire season? We missed the playoffs that year. And sure we've always been competitive, but one Finals, zero championships, bye bye Harden, lots of tough injuries at the wrong times, the blown 3-1 lead, and of course that baby back bitch KD running away to gargle Draymond's balls in Golden State. The odds of KD even being able to join that team were ridiculous- so many small things had to happen perfectly over a span of like 5 years. So yeah, we're not the Phoenix Suns or anything, but shit hasn't been all cookies and rainbows for the Thunder."
Why not just suggest they all play for the veteran minimum? And why did you leave out Kevin Durant?
Tyler Ulis for Kevin Durant and Steph Curry
"More likely to be remembered as a success coupled with poor timing. Came back to Cleveland just in time for KD to become the biggest wuss in NBA history so that GS could put together a video-game worthy team. Don't honestly think you can fault him for A) the loss to GS pre-KD when both Love and Kyrie were benched with injuries (won 2 games in that series anyway lol) and B) losing to GSW w/ Durant and only having a lackluster Kevin Love. Dude was pretty unlucky in his second go around with the Cavs.  First time with Cleveland, his only finals appearance was against the Spurs dynasty and he had no teammates to really call home about. The dude's finals legacy is rife with situations where you're asking him to basically solo-carry against all-time teams. Sucks for him, tbh, but that's the way it goes. "
So you think Paul George = Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
Correct. My bad. Still   Westbrook Harden Durant  Ibaka  Is better than what they have and they broke that up by essentially not wanting to pay Harden by sending him to the Rockets for the draft pick that got Adams and Jeremy Lamb and Kevin Martin.
will Kevin Durant be there?
Golden State didnt have Kevin Durant. Kyrie Irving wasnt hurt.  How fucking simple is that.  
So you dont want to be done with this yet? I am deeply sorry you were offended at my being offended that you were offended about an off color remark at the expense of Kevin fucking Durant of all people....I am sorry Cupcake.
Kevin Durant is no longer allowed to sign with a team that beats him
"Kevin Durant not invited, snakes aren't allowed"
"&gt;Per OP: [Sources: LeBron James has no plans to meet in person with Cavaliers when free agency opens]  &gt;""I understand why Lebron wouldn't give Gilbert the same time of day.""  Is that you Dan Gilbert? Please understand the point of the thread and my post isn't to personally attack you or your choices as an owner. The thread was a discussion on Lebron not meeting with the Cavs in person. Please remember this point as we move forward:  1. A player is not required nor obligated to meet with team nor owner. That's why they have agents.   2. If a team really wants to recruit a free-agent they'll bring in the players, coach, GM, ownership, ex-greats and HoF guys, etc. Pop and Duncan went out of their way to try to meet with Kawhi. Pop flew twice. On the hand, the Pop might not even meet with LiAngelo Ball. [The Celtics flew to meet KD with their players, front-office members, and even Tom Brady.](https://nesn.com/2016/11/kevin-durant-free-agency-redux-how-close-were-celtics-to-landing-warriors-star/ )  3. If a player really wants to go to a team. They'll meet with said team in person and listen to the pitch. If they aren't that interested then they won't meet with team or have the agents go. If there is no interest at all then it will be an outright decline via agent. [KD declined even meeting with NYKs for his FA because *""Uh, because I didn't want to.""*.](http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/kevin-durant-rejected-meeting-knicks-free-agency-article-1.2912206)  So back to the original point. Lebron doesn't have to meet with any team and Lebron doesn't like Gilbert. I think Lebron loves Cleveland and his love for the Cavs is because the Cavs are in Cleveland. However, the Cavs are owned and controlled by Gilbert."
As a Raptors fan I throughly enjoy seeing Bruno Caboclo in this! 😂  “The Brazilian Kevin Durant”😂
Lol I don’t think Kevin Durant would have been missing out on much if he got financial advice from someone other than Lacob.. he would have however stood to gain significantly more with 5.4 mil extra invested. 
I feel like the 76ers are the equivalent of the Celtics for Kevin Durant. A team that is a good fit for winning and would bring a good balance to the league. But there is not much actual interest from the player.   
Skip Bayless and Colin Cowherd are basically the LeBron James and Kevin Durant of bad sports reporting.   I like this list
"Bruh, his NBA salary is only half of his yearly income. He makes more than 50% of his nearly $60M income in endorsements alone. I think players value being able to decide what they do rather than lock down a big deal nowadays. Lebron set that precedent. If he gets hurt, every team is still offering him the max cause he's Kevin Durant"
"Holy shit, Kurt Russell playing Kevin Durant.  Freaking perfect."
"3-67 would be a slump of biblical proportions for anyone, let alone Kevin Durant "
"How is this hard for some people to understand?  Kevin Durant joined a team that was in place, and already the best team in the league with its 2nd finals appearance in a row.  No star player has ever done this.  "
"Everything Kevin Durant is going to garner some sort of hate.   I don't like him leaving to GSW, but he's still like one of the three best players on the planet right now.   That said, I think it's a negative for the players association when big name players take pay cuts. It's as bad for KD as it was for Tim Duncan."
"The Warriors are proven winners, whereas this hypothetical Lakers team (should it actually come together) hasn't done anything yet. What's more, he's friends with Kevin Durant and with Warriors GM Bob Myers, who was his agent for many years before he decided to do front office work."
Imagine being able to slot Wade/Lebron to point guard when Rose tears his ACL and gritty Butler into the starting lineup.  And then switching Butler for Wade when Wade declines. And then Taj Gibson in for Bosh when Bosh retires.   Could have signed someone like Kevin Durant during the cap spike. 
"DeAndre is not in the same situation as KD was.  DJ is trying to leave after he was essentially forced to re-sign with the Clippers by Doc, CP3 &amp; BG. DJ isn’t leaving after nearly defeating the Warriors in the WCF. DJ isn’t leaving a team with the 3rd best record in the conference for a team with the 1st best record.  DJ also wasn’t the face of the Clippers’ franchise. DJ is a great player, but he’s not Kevin Durant.  Don’t try to compare them."
"So many bitches in the NBA these days. You got pussies like John Wall who can't take constructive criticism in a team meeting. Assuming Marcin Gortat said that about Wall without malice, Wall has no right to be upset. Why? Because, bitch, no one on the Wizards has the ball in their hands more than you and yet you still get dick slapped around in the Eastern Conference playoffs year after year, so obviously you're not Mr. Perfect. You still need to work on your game, so learn to take constructive criticism, ya big baby bitch.  Then there's Kawhi, ""Mr. Sensitive."" Just own up to it and say you wanna play in L.A. Stop it with this ""Spurs didn't have my back"" bullshit narrative you and your gay uncle have got going. I'm looking forward to when his career is over and he admits he shoulda stayed in San Antonio where he woulda won more titles under Pop's system, sorta like how Kobe and Shaq admit they should've stayed in together in L.A. (but obviously those two had less remorse about it; I am certain Kawhi will drop from a top 3 NBA caliber player to a top 15 on a team without Pop's system. Book it, mf'ers).  But that's all drama, we've seen it all before, in one way or another. A new breed of pussy has evolved in the form of Kevin Durant. Never before has an MVP player in his prime joined the team that eliminated him in the playoffs. There is no precedence to this kind of pussiness (not even in the WNBA where the athletes have real functioning pussies). And LeBron recognizes the pussiness in KD, otherwise he would not have called KD about joining him in L.A shortly after KD won a title. Imagine Shaq calling Hakeem to join him in Orlando, right after Hakeem took out his godly 14 inch Nigerian dick and swept Shaq's ass with it in the '95 Finals. You can't, right? It'd be a pointless phone call for Shaq to make. LeBron didn't think his was, and for good reason; a new breed of pussy has evolved in the form of Kevin Durant; anything goes in this pussy-centric world that we live in today.  Edit: grammer"
"no, that's not true. they have to have played for the same team the entire time, or be on their rookie contract and be traded. see: [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2016/12/15/a-deeper-look-inside-the-nbas-new-collective-bargaining-agreement/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.27603af360e7)  from the article ""And this crucial stipulation: He has to be on the team that drafted him or has to have been traded on his rookie deal to another team. That means players like Stephen Curry, DeMarcus Cousins, Russell Westbrook, John Wall and Gordon Hayward are eligible for this exception, while Kevin Durant is not.""   also, how would that make any sense if you could only get it after your 10th year. curry has a supermax but he hasn't been in the league for 10 years. players need to be entering or just completed their 8th or 9th year, but that's not the only thing that makes them eligible for it. there's other requirements they have to meet. "
"First they came for Andre Iguodala, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Nuggets fan.   Then they came for Kevin Durant, and I did not speak out—  Because I was not a Thunder fan.  Then they came for DeAndre Jordan, and I did not speak out—  Because I was not a Clippers fan.  Then they came for Kristaps Porzingis and there was no one left to speak for me."
"&gt; I mean, you just go to dinner with these guys, hang out with them. You start to meet these types of people at games.

What if Kevin Durant didn't sign with The Warriors 
"Judging by his flair, Kevin Durant is my guess"
Mitchell is to James Harden as Tatum is to Kevin Durant.  I’ll take tatum.
"That's a bitchass mentality to have. Shrug it off, whatever. If he's past his prime, why do I give a fuck what he says? If this bothered kawhi, which I don't think it did, then he has the softest skin ever. Even Dwight Howard is tougher than that, even Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant staying in warriors he’s a snake and ruined his legacy no matter if he wins 20 rings. 
Imagine James Harden and Kevin Durant on the same team. Wild
"Here I'mma tell you the facts. Kawhi averaged better efficiency, and is less reckless with the ball. Kawhi I'd better at defense and his most recent year was elite offensively. The same year Russ did something historic and I'm not gonna downplay. (Mvp and best player are different tho. Lebron would win every year if it's just whoever is best)  The year before Kawhi averaged only 2 less points while being a better shooter, and averaging 1 less rebound (assists are down, completely different positions)  The playoffs in 2016 it's unfair to say Russ straight up outplayed him. Kawhi was better game 1, game 4, and they both put up 31 points in game 3. If Kevin Durant didn't save them in games 4&amp;6 it's quite possible the Spurs move on  Of course no convos to be had this year, Kawhi didn't play. This is where youth comes in, Kawhis best offensive season was his most reason, and he's gonna be entering his ""prime"" age of 28 next year. Kawhi will be better for years to come IF his injury is fully recovered. Kawhi has a fmvp.   I find it odd that you continue to downplay defense as well. Kawhi is better than everyone else sure, but Russ is a BAD defender"
"yes, more or less  brands aren't stupid, they're not gonna *not* endorse popular players just because they live or work in another city lmao  I mean FFS Kevin Durant is endorsed by *Alaska Airlines* and Klay Thompson is endorsed by Anta, a *Chinese* company"
"[Checkmynewsong] LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, and DeAndre Jordan have reportedly all agreed to join the Brooklyn Nets"
Kevin Durant has informed the Warriors that he will not re-sign with them
Kyrie would have stayed because he would be with a real superstar and Kevin Love would have elevated his game for Durant and he would have probably taken his time and taught JR how to play basketball. 
That's because Lebron isn't as good as Kevin Durant
"Because we are talking about cores that were drafted together like the pre-Durant warriors. Lebron was not drafted with that Cleveland core. He was signed as a free agent and then brought Kevin Love, JR Smith, etc. "
"Depends. Are we talking historical rivalries or current rivalries?  Because right now, our biggest rival is the Warriors. We've built our whole gameplan around them and execute it the same way for the entire season just so we're ready when the conference finals roll around.   If we're trading Chris Paul and Clint Capela for Kevin Durant or Steph Curry, we've got to consider that.  But if it's a historical rival like the Mavs, Spurs, or Jazz, then that's a hard no. Would've been a yes to the Spurs if Kawhi was healthy and not a nephew."
George Hill and Kevin Love for Kevin Durant? YES PLEASE!!!
You can't spell Kevin Durant without KD
"Lonzo's age and being a rookie definitely matter as well, as there is 100% an adjustment period that goes on when players go from college to the NBA. For instance, Kevin Durant, one of the greatest shooters of all time, shot only 28% from 3 in his rookie year. Now I'm not saying Lonzo is gonna be KD-like as a shooter or anything, but people need to give Lonzo a chance before proclaiming he'll never be a good shooter again based on his rookie year percentages."
"Kobe, Shaq, Kareem, Magic  PG picking Brodie over Bron, now that’s tragic  King James will certainly have the last laugh then  When it’s game 7 and he draining 3’s over Kevin Durant"
"Nah, Kevin Durant to whatever team he bandwagons next."
"It really isn't dude, beating Steph, Klay and Draymond in the playoffs is definitely easier than beating, Steph, Klay, Draymond and Kevin fucking Durant."
Damn Kevin Durant to hell for what he did 
&gt; How can you have LeBron 11 out of 15 years and only get him one ring?  Why don't you ask Kevin Durant this question?  (his 1st tenure was awful though. 2nd was just bad luck)
"This is a team that had/has: Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Serge Ibaka,Victor Oladipo, Steven Adams.. and no championship? That’s an embarrassment. Poor execution by the players while they were in OKC and a poor front office for letting so much talent go for nothing. If they had just one championship, I wouldn’t feel like this but they have none. And when you have that kind of talent on your roster over the last 10 years, theirs no excuse. "
Oh no woe is me we lost Harrison Barnes and replaced him with Kevin Durant
"Ever heard of this guy, Kevin Durant?"
"Kobe averaged at least 25/5/5 in 7 seasons, which trails LeBron (14!!), Oscar Robertson (9), and Michael Jordan (8).  Among active players not named LeBron, we've got James Harden (4), Kevin Durant (3), Russel Westbrook (3), Dwyane Wade (2), Stephen Curry (2), and Demarcus Cousins (1).  So, LeBron has 14 seasons of 25/5/5, and all other active players have 15 seasons of 25/5/5.  But somehow you call that averaging a Kobe smh..."
"If Portland had picked Kevin Durant instead of Greg Oden, Portland would be significantly better"
"Beating the warriors with Kyrie and Love BEFORE Kevin Durant joined doesn't really prove shit, you say it's called knowing basketball but you're conveniently ignoring the part where golden state replaced harrison barnes with one of the best scorers of all time."
"We don’t know where LeBron is going yet, but the USA men’s basketball team [was defeated by Mexico yesterday](https://t.co/gRySmrYfC7?amp=1), so Kevin Durant is expected to sign with Mexico soon. "
"Their homegrown core included Harrison Barnes. That team went 1-1 in the finals, they were great but beatable. The dynasty they have now is because of Kevin Durant. "
"&gt; From What I'm hearing, from a text from dear friend Kevin Durant, Dan Gilbert doesn't mind the thought of LeBron James Leaving Cleveland AT ALL."
"\[Charania\] Kevin Durant to sign a four-year deal with Archbishop Hoban, sources confirm."
"I know we all joke about this, but he did called out that Kevin Durant was going to the Warriors."
"And also added Kevin Durant. That’s important as well. Hell, it would probably be 2-2 between us and the Warriors right now if KD wasn’t there "
"Yeah, fuck Kevin Durant. Not fuck the Warriors, just Durant. "
I wasn't but even if I was I'd say Kevin Durant is easily higher all time than Gary Payton is. 
Nothing but bored GM's and Kevin Durant burners.  Which one are you?
"Part of why they were down 3-1 involved a certain Kevin Durant, who is now on their team. Warriors would wipe the floor with a healthy Thunder team in the playoffs."
They also has Kevin Durant they had to guard though 
I respect Cameron Payne more than Kevin Durant.
"Love and Irving were out hurt when Golden State beat them the first time, before KD left.  Only special kids type L3-6ron instead of Lebron, or don't use commas in the correct places.  Only special kids rant about Lebron James to dodge the fact Kevin Durant took the easy way out to a ring because he is a bitch.   The regular season isn't meaningless because it provides CONTEXT.   You are fixating on Wrestling...the art form that has exists longer than Basketball has. That is normal for kids like you though. You know films and television shows are fake right? You watch those year?  So back on topic. Durant failed to beat Golden State. He had a 3-1 lead the blew it. Then he choose the easiest path to a Championship. You said it yourself, he needed to be on a team where everyone else would step up and carry him because he didn't have the balls to be the leader of OKC and cowered into the corner letting Westbrook run the show."
“Kevin Love did it.”  Immediately followed by Durant diving for The Last Dab to dab his wing. Beautiful. 
"Great guy, Kevin Durant."
Breaking news: Kevin Durant signs with Soles De Mexicali
"Putting Larry Bird in the same tier as Kevin ""Snek"" Durant is disrespectful TBH. I'm sorry but one of them was way more dominant relative to their peers, way more competitive, and a way greater champion.  One is a three time consecutive MVP winner while Magic Johnson was in the league (and had zero MVPs) and the other had to jump to a superteam that just beat him in the conference finals to win rings."

John Havlicek 7. Rick Barry 8. Scottie Pippen 9. Kawhi Leonard  Tier 5  10. Paul Arizin  I can give more detail but just wanted to put that out there.

Not fair enough. Kevin Durant is 6'11 with any basic research done on his height.

1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. James Harden 4. Anthony Davis 5. Stephen Curry 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7.  Russell Westbrook 8. Kawhi Leonard 9. Chris Paul 10. Joel Embiid   The players from 2-5 are really close imo as are 6-8 (if Kawhi is healthy).  Edit: Forgot Chris Paul.
"My original post wasn't about a direct comparison of how big Kevin Durant and Karl Malone are..... it was about how Malone, being a big (tall and heavy) guy, managed to miss so little games through out his career.  I only mentioned Durant, in regards to being another big (tall) guy because I know his height has forever been listed as 6'9, which is how tall Malone is.  I wasn't trying to make any point about Durant being the same size as Malone... so I don't know why the post has devolved in to that. At the end of the day, I don't give two shits how tall or heavy either guy ACTUALLY is, that wasn't what my post was about..."

"&gt; thats all the only role he can perform in the NBA.  [hmm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45czWPhWQOI)  Not convinced?   I don't blame you. Most people never talk about it except as a joke really.   The time slenderman just went insane and made a bunch of 3's out of nowhere. A silly coincidence, a statistical anomaly that we can't pull much from. I used to be one of those people. But in 2018? I'm not so sure any more. Let's break it down.  Here's the hypothesis: Manute could shoot, but simply wasn't allowed to, unless he wasn't missing and, independently, he went along with it because he probably didn't want to pull his FG% down in an unjustifiable way.  [This is a list of every game manute had 1+ 3PA, 133 games in total.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=game&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;player_id=bolma01&amp;c1stat=fg3a&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=1&amp;order_by=fg3_pct)  Notice how in most of them, he took a 3, missed, then didn't bother for the rest of the game. Why is that? Why is he even taking that shot to begin with? Why do it over a hundred times? For sake of argument, let's assume his coaches pulled him aside every time he tried and reminded him why he was out there. Okay. But what happened when he made his first shot?  [Lets zoom in on the ones where he made one 3P, 32 games in total.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=game&amp;year_min=1986&amp;year_max=1995&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;player_id=bolma01&amp;c1stat=fg3&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=1&amp;order_by=fg3_pct)   In 27 of the 32 games where he made a 3 (and if the logic follows, was allowed to shoot again), **he went on to shoot 50% or better from beyond the arc.**    Is this a coincidence?   Or was he simply taking a shot that inherently requires a high degree of volume to be taken seriously but was satisfied with shooting 50% on any given night, as was his role, and was discouraged from taking more so he never really got a chance?  We'll never know for sure.   Manute passed away a few years ago from kidney failure after decades of giving his money away to those in need and not having much left for himself, so he can't speak now and I doubt he ever really cared enough to speak publicly on it anyway. The guy was a humanitarian of the highest degree, basketball was just how he paid the bills.   But look at Kevin Durant.   Look at Dirk Nowitzki.  Hell, look at Rashard Lewis.   Look at Porzingis/Markkannen/Towns.   If you are ~7 feet tall, **the point of release on your shot is so damn high**, you may as well be taking them in an empty gym. Manute played in the '80s, when no one knew better, despite watching kareem chuck the ball from distance and consistently make them for 20 years because he never had any fear of getting his shit blocked. It was rote. Imagine if some coach got in his ear and told him he wasn't allowed to take a shot from farther than a foot out if he missed his first skyhook. Now look at Manute, [again](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199303030PHO.html). Notice the 3P%. 50%, 6/12, all his makes in the first half.   Life is full of coincidences. I don't know if this is one of them. "
"I never said I believed it... I just said that is where I got the information from... Durant is listed as 6'9 240lbs on his wiki page and Malone is listed as 6'9 250lbs. They're both tall guys, one has missed a lot of game time due to injuries and the other hasn't, that's all I was looking at.  I love how this post spiraled in to a debate about Karl Malones size compared to Kevin Durant lol... I was only using their height and weight, based on the information listed on Wikipedia as a size comparison in relation to injuries for big men.   I was never saying that Durant is physically as big as Karl Malone or trying to compare their physiques. I don't really care how big either player actually is, that's not what my original post was about..."

Bob: well, he was the 2nd best player in the league and a free agent, so we signed him.  Q: but certainly, the cap machinations must have been unreal.  Bob: no, the league just told us one day we have like 24 extra million to sign guys with.  Q: but even so, you couldn't have just spent crazily beforehand. for example, andre iguodala, i imagine you got him on a great deal?  Bob: nah, we gave him $12M a year.  Q: to come off the bench?  Bob: yeah, why not?  Q: but andrew bogut. the aussie. tell me what sweetheart deal he took just to be on a winner?  Bob: 14 million a year.  Q: 14 mi...14 million? but he didn't even play the ends of games. barely even played against certain matchups.  Bob: yeah, i know, crazy stuff.  Q: but klay and dray, you had lined their contract extensions up perfectly ?  Bob: nah, had already signed them to basically max deals.  Q: but certainly, harrison barnes. you had expertly anticipated kevin durant and kept your powder dry by not signing him the season before.  Bob: oh no, i mean we tried. offered him 16 million a year.  Q: 16! million! for harrison barnes?  Bob: yeah, couldn't give it away.  Q: okay, moving on, tell us about this boogie signing. how did you clear the cap space for this one and convince joe lacob to taken on such an expensive player.  Bob: funny story, he signed for only 5 million.  Q: 5 million? wow. so you had expertly scanned the free agent landscape and seen he was getting no other offers and made your move?  Bob: scanned the free agent landscape? huh? what do you think gm's do all day.  Q: well i mean i thought that was exactly what th...  Bob: amateurs like danny ainge and daryl morey scan the free agent landscape! we were trying to talk to someone else, he just called us.  Q: called you, to take below market value?  Bob: yeah, in real hysterics, too. ""mr. myers, mr. kerr, please let me on the team. please give me a roster spot. i suck yo dick for a roster spot."" his agent came on the line and told us that wouldn't do and he actually needed the MLE, but still, pretty crazy stuff.

"Let me break it down to you, here are the key moments that got us to this point.   * July 2010, the public announcement of the sale of the Golden State Warriors to the Joe Lacob/Peter Gruber group by Chris Cohan for $450 million dollars.  * A week prior to the announcement of the sale, Joe Lacob has given GM Larry Riley the green light to offer David Lee a 5-year 80 million dollar contract. This would be turned into a sign and trade with the NYK.  * GM Larry Riley is retained as GM/Executive VP for 2011-2012 while they also name Bob Myers Assistant GM/VP of Basketball Operations. Basically grooming Riley's successor in a 36 y/o Bob Myers.“We are tremendously excited about the addition of Bob Myers to our Basketball Operations Staff,” said Joe Lacob. “I think it is important to recruit some of the best young talent in the business and we, unequivocally, believe Bob has the potential to be outstanding in this field and will be a great asset to our organization. He’s young, energetic, hard-working and, most importantly, he’s earned tremendous respect in basketball circles and has fostered many positive relationships with key people in the sport both domestically and internationally. I think those traits are extremely vital when you are looking to build a team and establish a solid foundation for the future. Bob simply possesses many of the great intangibles that I have come to appreciate during my time with the Celtics and Warriors and I believe he brings an entirely new positive dimension to a very solid Basketball Operations Staff.” * May 20, 2011 - Jerry West hired to Warriors Front Office.  * June 7, 2011 - Mark Jackson hired as Warriors Head Coach.  * June 23, 2011 - SG Klay Thompson is drafted with the 11th pick.  * March 14, 2012 - Warriors trade starting SG Monta Ellis, F Ekpe Udoh and C Kwame Brown  for C Andrew Bogut and F Steven Jackson.  * March 20, 2012 - Chris Mullin Jersey Retirement Night. Joe Lacob is boo'd mercilessly by Golden State Warriors fans. Chris Mullin and Rick Barry have to intervene as it began to get ugly.  * April 2012 - Bob Myers promoted to GM/Executive VP after 12 months as an assistant to Larry Riley.  * June 2012 - Warriors draft Harrison Barnes, Festus Ezeli and Draymond Green.  * November 2012 - Warriors sign Steph Curry to 4-year $44 million dollar extension.  * July 5, 2013 - Free Agent Andre Igoudala is signed to a 4-year $48 million dollar contract. The Warriors would dump salary with the Utah Jazz in order to make the contract work, surrendering 1st round pick in 2014 and 2017.  * May 2014 - Head Coach Mark Jackson is fired after 230 games, a win loss percentage of .526.  * May 15, 2014 - Steve Kerr is hired as Head Coach, having no prior NBA coaching experience.  * June 2014 - Kevin Martin, Kevin Love deal for Harrison Barnes, David Lee and Klay Thompson is vetoed by Jerry West.  * July 11, 2014 - Free Agent Shaun Livingston is signed to a 3-year $16 million dollar contract.  * June 16, 2015 - Warriors defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers 4 games to 2, and win their first Championship since 1975.  * 2015/2016 Season - Warriors break the regular season win record, going 73-9.  * 2016 Finals - Warriors fall to the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-3, losing the Finals after a 3-1 lead in the series.  * July 4th, 2016 - Kevin Durant announces that he plans to sign with the Golden State Warriors.

Edit: for people saying the size/weight difference isnt that big. 2 inches and 40 pounds is roughly the difference between Deandre Ayton and Michael Porter Jr. Id actually take kevin durant over lebron because he has the length to bother lebron down low and can approximate some of the tough shot making that kobe has.

Kevin durant is just a regular pussy. 
"probably because it wasn't the same level of dominance and didn't come together the same way?  no one said the 73 win warriors ruined basketball either.  it's like warriors fans just pretend everyone is talking about the whole 4 year run instead of the part where kevin durant saw an inadvertent break in the system and decided to take advantage of it instead of competing.  now he's on twitter arguing with high schoolers about how no really, kevin durant is really awesome."
"If the previous 3 summers had gone better for them, LaMarcus Aldridge and Kevin Durant."
"since durant is all this argument has ever been about, how was kevin durant's career or money at stake?  or if we're going one step removed, how were klay, draymond, or steph's careers or money at stake in 2016?  they were all guaranteed max money at that point."
Kevin Durant
"Me personally,  his chapter never changed, he made an extremely smart decision joining Golden State. But for everyone else, no. Kevin Durant wasn't/isn't hated for his decision. It's just everyone was already hating on how successful the Warriors were and KD choosing to play there increased their success chances, adding fuel to the fire. Everyone will hide behind some low brained excuse like ""KD's a bitch for something related to taking the easy way like he didn't take the hard way for 9years and proving nothing works that way.😂😂""   It was literally the best and only option to play for Golden State. "
That isn't the issue. Players should choose where they want to go but they should not throw games. That is some type of collusion going on. I am referencing Kevin Durant. I legit think he was trying to derail the Thunder's post season in his final year there. He was showing little effort in the DAL and SAS series. Adams and the others were stepping up crazy for his lack of production and defense. The Thunder were completely dominating them Warriors in their series and out of nowhere they go down to them? That wasn't out of the realm of possibilities they are offensive juggernauts but then the best player on the team leaves OKC and joins the team they had finished playing in the post season? And then Draymond comes out and says he had been talking to KD the whole season? There should have been some type of formal investigation by the NBA on that series and if KD really did anything to lose that series.
"No one was saying ""the Warriors ruined the NBA"" before Durant joined. Yeah they were a great team, but they were beatable. That was proven in 2016. Other organizations built their own super teams to make the league more competitive, but then the Warriors go and add Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins. "

*Kevin Durant puts his kids up for adoption and conceives a new set*
It's honestly pretty funny just how badly /r/NBA pisses their pants any time Kevin Durant is mentioned.
"&gt; As for KD, some random comment by a high school kid is enough to distract him from such an important goal. What else are you supposed to think of one who has such a weak sense of purpose, besides that he's mentally weak?   Is ignoring criticism by random people on social media Kevin Durant's purpose...or is his purpose doing stuff like winning championships?  Isn't Kevin Durant paid to be an elite professional basketball player and hasn't he attained that goal his entire career? And, specifically in the last two years, won starting All-Star spots twice, won 1st and 2nd All-NBA honors, won two Finals MVP's, had the two most efficient scoring seasons of his career, and significantly improved his rim protection game?  Doesn't seem like periodically arguing with random people on social media has distracted KD from his goals or eroded his sense of purpose."
"“He got me,” Kevin Durant said of bucketcenter's twitter post. ""That f***ing bucketcenter boomed me.""  Durant added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times.  KD then said he wanted to add bucketcenter to the list of 12 year olds he argues with on twitter this summer. "
"He will never be looked at as a great player.....I really dont think I have an answer to that, do you know who Kevin Durant is?"
Never forget the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the 2016 NBA Finals and so did Kevin Durant in the 2016 Western Conference Finals.
"That has nothing to do with my original point. Everybody here is getting all defensive acting like I was criticizing them when I acknowledged they make good decisions. This is basically a fact: if Curry wasn’t injured in early years, they wouldn’t have Kevin Durant. "
Nah... That kid baited KD. He didn't say anything wrong.  P.S: I'm not Kevin Durant.

"this is my favourite piece about kobe   http://grantland.com/the-triangle/wolf-on-the-rock-the-ludicrous-glorious-doom-of-kobe-bryant/  &gt; Even at his peak, Kobe Bryant made greatness look grueling. He had every gift, every natural blessing — but he made having them look hard. He could do whatever he wanted on a basketball court, but being in charge of that kind of skill was exhausting, and the strain showed. It was as if he had to keep the Amazon flowing with nothing but his own force of will. The scorn he directed at other players — at rivals, at his own teammates — always seemed to come from a place not just of superior ability but also of superior suffering. [...]  People wanted to be like Mike. When Kobe came around, they wanted to get the hell out of his way.  &gt; He wasn’t humorless, nor was he above showboating. But where Michael Jordan’s little backpedaling shrug was a gift to the crowd, a way of inviting fans in, Kobe’s smirk was a provocation. Jordan knew instinctively that the final inch of dominance was earned through a certain lightness, and he cultivated it as ruthlessly as his jump shot — the tongue-waggling, the pranks at the All-Star Game, the celebrations where he wept unself-consciously or seemed to float in the air. It was theater, but it completed the aura of invincibility; here was an athlete whose supremacy was so unshakable that he could afford to act unconcerned about it. Kobe could never be unconcerned, because unlike Jordan (or LeBron, or Shaq, or Kevin Durant, or Allen Iverson), he didn’t inhabit his talent so much as angrily oversee it. His smile had a way of making moments feel more tense, of ratcheting the stakes to a level at which only he could cope with them. It wasn’t in him to be generous. If you’re Superman, you can have fun flying; if you’re the CEO of Exxon, oil is never a joke.  &gt; [...]  &gt; Kobe never seemed as dominant as Jordan because, unlike Mike, he refused to recruit us into the construction of his dominance. He couldn’t trust us with it. He had to do it himself, the way he did everything. This made him fascinating, not that he cared. He was a narcissist, but a strangely impersonal narcissist, like a general whose army happens to be deployed inside himself. Over the years, his success, his vivid bitterness, and his adherence to his own impossible standards created this confounding paradox: He made misanthropy look like a key ingredient in a team sport. Or, to see it from the other side: He made a team game look like a viable path to a life of chosen solitude. "
Not for me at all.   1) You can see the impact Luc has on a teams defense   2016-17:   Clippers def rating with CP3 DeAndre Jordan and no Luc Mbah Moute: 105.3   Clippers Def rating with CP3 DAJ and Luc together: 96.0   Rockets last year:   Hou defensive rating with Harden+ Luc Mbah Moute+ CP3: 95.0  Hou defensive rating with Harden+ CP3 but no Luc: 108.5   2) I looked this up but per matchup data the past 3-4 years on over 1700 poss when guarding Russell Westbrook/LeBron/Giannis/Paul George/Jimmy Butler/Dame Lillard/Gordon Hayward/Kawhi Leonard/Kevin Durant he held them collectively to 39% shooting. LeBron and Dame in particular he held to 31% and 21% shooting in &gt;120 poss each.   Overall an extremely versatile and hounding on ball defender.   3) Not only has he shot 36-37% from 3 the past 2 years combined he's a very good slasher on close outs.

"Politics has Donald Trump, NBA has Kevin Durant "
"The Warriors didn't ruin anything. Kevin Durant did.  Were they supposed to tell Steph, Draymond, Klay to not be too good?"
A heart to heart isn't fixing this. Kevin Durant can't deal with the criticism and lack of respect even though he thought multiple titles will validate him. He knows he won't ever be seen in the same light as LeBron/Jordan/Magic regardless of how many rings he wins.  Kevin Durant wasn't prepared for the consequences that came with this decision. He thought his move would be and remembered like LeBrons but it wasn't because the Warriors and Steph had already been the story  of the NBA for the past 2 seasons.

Kevin Durant is the DJ Akademiks of the NBA
"Never had a problem with the Warriors or even Boogie who supposedly didn't even get a call and made the best decision for him. Kevin Durant. That's the guy that I have an issue with. Not because he left but because he went to the Warriors. You went to the team that you should have beaten but instead choked it away. And the worst part is, he left Russell Westbrook as the sole scapegoat, however valid the criticisms against him or not. Russ gets the large bulk of the blame for the way that series ended but last I remember, KD played too. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth that he mostly gets a free pass for how that series turned out because blaming Russ is so easy. That doesn't sit well with me at all. "

"Kevin Durant is exactly like r/nba users, except he’s pretty good at basketball."
*Kevin Durant throws some frozen mice at his kids to shut them up for a few minutes*
"The GMs don't care about what fans think of their achievement--they have a job and that's to put together the best team possible. The players are the ones that have to worry about their legacy (if they care about that).   You're conflating separate things--I said in my original comment that the front office tries to get as many great players as possible, which is exactly what they should do and should be praised for doing.  But it's just illogical to claim that from a pure sports perspective, one team having a huge talent advantage is irrelevant. It obviously tilts the court in their favor, and at some point it becomes too much.   Personally, I wouldn't want my team to have an insurmountable talent advantage. I watch sports because its an enjoyable experience and an essential part of that is the excitement inherent in seeing a team that has a reasonable chance of losing play and try to win. It's just not enjoyable to watch an overwhelming favorite stomp on teams that have essentially no chance. If that's your thing, then OK, but it does nothing for me.  Again, my criticism isn't directed at the GM's and team offices. It's at Kevin Durant for bitching out on actual competition in favor of racking up largely meaningless wins."
Kevin Durant reincarnates dead burner accounts to argue with his kids.
Lol I forgot that Kevin Durant is also human. 
Lmao what a insecure bitch.Fuck Kevin Durant.
I've said this before and I'll say it again. Imagine how big of sneks the children of Kevin Durant and Taylor Swift would be.

"Kevin Durant, since I know you’re in this thread defending yourself, hire me as your new PR guy"
"Since acquiring Kevin Durant, the Warriors have gone 32-6 in the playoffs, 3 of those 6 losses coming in a single series against the only team even seriously considered to have a chance of winning against them - and a lot of the hope was extinguished after Chris Paul got injured in Game 5. Every other series has been wrapped up in 4 or 5, convincingly. They've got 4, potentially 5 all-NBA guys + Iguodala.   Now, Lebron's Heat/Cavs for the past decade or so has been able to stomp through the East consistently, but there's a big difference between dominating a Conference and dominating the entire Association. LeBron's dominance gave us some amazing Finals series. The KD Warriors, not so much, and I expect this season to be closer to 16-1 than 16-5. "
dae murder kevin durant for his crimes against humanity?? 
There will be more teams with cap space next off season with the cap going up to a projected 109M mark   But there are also a lot of other free agents out there:  DeAndre Jordan Klay Thompson Tobias Harris Rick Rubio Robin Lopez Brook Lopez Thad Young Nic Vucevic Marcin Gortat DeMarcus Cousins Kevin Durant Kemba Walker KCP Wilson Chandler Tyreke Evans Danny Green Bojan Bogdanovic Darren Collison Rajon Rondo JaMychal Green Markieff Morris Nikola Mirotic Al-Farouq Aminu Cory Joseph Pat Beverley D'Angelo Russell Dwight Howard Marcus Morris Lance Stephenson Ed Davis  This isnt going into the number of RFAs out there.  There are a ton of UFAs that can be contributors on a winning team still or flat out better than Capela.  There will be more money out there but way more people fighting to get that money.  The market for 25M a season may not be there next year either then what?  Take the MLE or vet min?    There is way more risk involved on Capela's end IMO.    I think what will ultimately happen is they will settle on a 3 year 55M or so deal which is still the same amount but gives Capela a chance to prove he is worth the max in 3 years where will just be entering his prime for a big payday.

Completely crazy conspiracy theories of teammate sleeping with his mother 4. ""LeBron is feuding with his coach/teammate/front office/owner"" chatter - non stop 5. ""LeGM/LeCaoch"" - again, non stop  When did he ever break? When did he ever respond? I don't think he has to prove anything to anyone "
You felt the need to run an analysis on how much I hate a player? You see the irony here lol? And yeah I ain’t going to run from it boi I strongly dislike Kevin Durant 
[I honestly don't care what he does as long as he isn't doing anything dangerous. I also find it odd that people care about what players do in their personal time.](http://nbatitlechase.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/PHOTO-Kevin-Durant-Texting-While-He-Waits-For-Steph-Curry-To-Show-Up-To-Podium.jpg)
"I'll make some categories. In the 20PPG+ range, I would say Kawhi and Kevin Durant. Yes, Durant sometimes holds the ball too much, but it most of the time he gets high-quality shots in most situations.  In the 10-20 PPG+ range, I would say Jokic (If he isn't forced to carry the offense), Steven Adams, Clint Capela, Deandre Jordan, Chris Paul, Otto Porter.  Below the 10 PPG+ range I would say, Shaun Livingston, Andre Iguodala.  I think it's not fair to judge everyone equally when they carry different offensive burdens. "
Is Kevin Durant me?

"Can't speak for everyone but I say that occasionally too, it's convenient. What I really mean though is fuck Kevin Durant. Had no issue with the warriors before the snake era.   edit: those people saying steph ruined it because of 3s are dumb. The people saying KD ruined it are correct. "
Warriors were 7-1 in playoff series in 2015 and 2016.   The only loss came because Harrison Barnes went 5/3/0.7/0.7/0.7 on .153/.200/.500 shooting splits over the last 3 games of the series.   The only thing Kevin Durant has proven in the past two years is that he's better than Harrison Barnes was in games 5-7 of the 2016 Finals. 
"I don’t think any reasonable person blames the warriors. They blame KD for being a bitch, and joining the 73 win team that he choked on in the WCF.   That 73 win team was fantastic. The result of homegrown talent and just the right amount of luck. It was a fun team to root for, they were my west team. Steph Curry was playing like a god amongst men, winning his second MVP in a row, first unanimous MVP ever. Draymond’s antics were a little bit much sometimes, but everyone admired his passion for the game. Klay Thompson was (and still is) the most lovable player in the NBA. It was just a really fun team.   But KD ruined that. You can’t cheer for that team anymore if you’re not an actual fan of them. It’s like rooting for the monstars. It’s not fun.   That Warriors team was everything the NBA needed. Homegrown talent and lovable, marketable guys that brought unbridled success to a franchise that hadn’t seen any in decades. But then some insecure manchild with an insane level talent joins them. Kevin Durant, the guy that forgets to switch to his burner account when he shits on his old teammates. The grown man who’s out there on Instagram having flame wars with kids. The guy who called it “the hardest road.”   That team isn’t lovable anymore. It’s the team to root against. And they’re not even cool about it. KD isn’t, at least. He tries to act like he is, but he is glaringly insecure about all the shit he gets for being a pussy and joining the team that kicked his ass. It’s like a shitty rehashing of the Heatle’s villainy. At least with them, it was genuine. They didn’t give a fuck. LeBron never got on Twitter to clap back at kids talking shit. He just did his thing, and didn’t let anyone get to him. Except for JJ Barea.. that smooth motherfucker rented a suite in his head. "
Damn r/nba salty AF - p.s. I'm definitely not Kevin Durant
I don't think the Warriors were ever ruining the NBA. They played it correctly up until the snek joined them. You can't really blame the team if they're able to sign Boogie for $5 million. The player still has to agree to it.  People needs to be more specific and say that Kevin Durant and the likes ruined the NBA.
The Warriors didn't ruin the NBA. Kevin Durant did.
"Warriors used the cap spike to sign Kevin Durant.  Everyone else used it to give max contracts to players like Chandler Parsons, Joakim Noah, Luol Deng, and Mozgov."
"Durant did this to himself which is why I believe he will seriously consider leaving GSW. Guy is insecure AF and he can’t stand how he doesn’t get any credit.  Hey Kevin, what did you really think would happen when you joined a 73 win team? "
"I can't stand the ""why do people hate the Warriors for building their team the right way"" takes. Repeatedly people say that Kevin Durant was the one that really fucked over the league for joining the stacked team that he choked against. It's nearly impossible to construct a team under the cap that can compete with them (this is usually the part where Warriors fans say they almost lost to Houston so they can't be that unbeatable... but if you bring that series up they say it was only close because Iggy was hurt).   People hate the Warriors because KD is a little bitch and has made the outcome predictable for 2 going on 3 straight years. This past season was still overall an entertaining season, but I can't enjoy basketball quite as much when I know the team that is gonna win it all... and I enjoy basketball more than the vast majority of people."

"should be ""Kevin Durant getting verbally destroyed and outwitted by a highschooler on Instagram"""
I wouldn't say never.  You remember Kevin Durant?
"I want to see how lethal defensively a team with Lebron, PG, and Kawhi would be.  You'd need Kevin Durant to even have a shot against that.  I say this knowing full well that Lebron doesn't play much defense, but he has the ability to.  "
It's bad when random teacher ladies who you don't really know start talking about how they love Kevin Durant lol. 
"I am extremely late to this so the story will only be for you OP. I obviously can’t prove it’s true but I’ve heard it from an extremely reliable source.  When Kevin Durant was about ready to sign his new shoe contract a couple of years ago, the favorite towards the end was Under Armour. During that time Kevin Durant asked to borrow the CEO of Under Armours private jet so he can fly down to some island or another. The CEO said no because apparently, the last time KD did this with an executives plane, he downloaded a shit ton of pornography using the planes wi-fi.  Denying KD the plane probably wasn’t the reason he signed with Nike, but if I were the CEO I would have no problem letting KD use my plane to download the latest Ass Parade video if it made the man happy."

Kevin Durant went to Golden State because Nike wanted to put mad pressure on Steph Curry's under armour shoes.   Too bad they didn't realize under armour did that to themselves by hiring a kid as a shoe designer
"If there were awards for Regular Season MVP, Playoff MVP, and Finals MVP, I think it wouldn't be controversial to say it was James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, respectively.  If Harden goes to the Hawks, no one would be shocked if they got the fourth seed in the East. At the same time, he probably isn't enough on his own to get them to the Finals.  Regular season MVP isn't about what you had the potential to do for your team but what you actually did, and LeBron rightfully waited to expend that energy till the playoffs. "

LeBron didn't intend to take the easy way out like KD did.  He totally absolutely intended to take the easy way out. Just because his game doesn't mesh as well with other superstars' and Wade got old doesn't mean LeBron didn't plan to break competitive parity. Kevin Durant was just more successful at it.
"Uh, or AD just swept the 3rd seed in the West and has never, publicly or behind closed doors, indicated anything but being happy and satisfied playing in New Orleans? And that they have never stated even the smallest thought of ever trading him for anything themselves?  Boston has the best set of assets on paper for most players, so why not make incredulous trade scenarios involving them and someone like Kevin Durant or James Harden for a change? Instead of relentlessly denigrating the smallest market in the league week after week with nonsense like this?"
if you combine Supersonics and Thunder  F - Shawn Kemp   F - Kevin Durant   F - Scottie Pippen   G  - James Harden   G - Gary Payton   6th - Russell Westbrook 
"Really? I think he's a pretty poor fit. Westbrook hasn't changed his stripes at all despite playing with James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Paul George. He is a direct line player that drives and kicks and lacks creativity, misdirection, and finesse in his game.   If he had those things Paul catching the ball and having options would be way more ideal. Right now he's catching the ball and either having to drive straight at a big or catch and shoot. That's a huge waste of his talents.   Then again, I think PG would be excellent in the Triangle and should average 25-5-5 at the very least. "

"In a powerpoint or flow chart? The ""pitch"" if we take it as true is probably just an opener the meetings are probably 2 hours or longer not something you can read in 15 minutes.    Pelinka at one point had James Harden, Kobe Bryant, and Kevin Durant as clients.  The dude knows how to pitch to athletes.  He probably was the most powerful agent in the NBA and top 10 all sports at one point when I compared him to other agents.   I can't even entertain that he is a legacy/history pitch guy because of his resume.  It's like a total opposite of who he is outside of presser quotes.  I think in meetings he is probably a different dude and analytical.  Magic seems like the history legacy guy. "
"Hell I'll take a shot at it. But this is done within 2-3 minutes off the top of my head so I'm sure there will be plenty to pick apart...  TIER A:  (1) LeBron James  (2) Kevin Durant  (3) Steph Curry  (4) James Harden  (5) Anthony Davis  TIER B:  (6) Kawhi (injury question marks keep him off A tier)  (7) Russ Westbrook  (8) Giannis  (9) Damian Lillard  (10) Chris Paul (durability is important)  TIER C:  (11) Jimmy Butler  (12) Paul George  (13) Nikola Jokic  (14) Kyrie   (15) John Wall  (16) Victor Oladipo  (17) Joel Embiid  (18) KAT  (19) Klay Thompson  (20) LaMarcus Aldridge  (21) DeMar DeRozan  (22) Gordon Hayward  (23) Rudy Gobert  (24) Kyle Lowry  (25) Andre Drummond  (26) Blake Griffin  TIER D:  (27) Kevin Love  (28) Al Horford  (29) Kemba Walker  (30) Draymond Green  (31) Bradley Beal  (32) Jrue Holiday  (33) Khris Middleton  (34) C.J. McCollum  (35) Kristaps Porzingis (health concerns)  (36) DeMarcus Cousins (same)  And then after that, you can get into the Ben Simmons / Donovan Mitchell / Jayson Tatum. So for Simmons, I'd say he's around the 30-40 range.  Among the names I forgot/excluded include: Conley and Marc Gasol, Goran Dragic, Gary Harris... Tobias Harris... Steven Adams... Capela... a lot of candidates!"
TIL Shane Battier and Tony Kukoc are on the same level as Kevin Durant.
That would be the coolest story ever. LeBron joining up with Russ and PG to dick Kevin Durant. But in this case I'd rather have melo stay just because it would be cool to see LeBron and melo team up but there's probably no realistic way for that to happen. 
[KD himself said he wouldn’t have gone if they won.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/its-official-warriors-loss-in-nba-finals-gained-them-kevin-durant/)
"Here are my personal thoughts on the questions  -The Bucks would be a legitimate title contender. Giannis would still be the best scorer/player on our team.  -I think that Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, or DeMar DeRozan would lead the league in scoring  -The Pistons would be a team that would be very positively impacted by this change in my opinion  -The Warriors would be a team that would be negatively impacted by this change, they'd still be very good with 4 all-stars but I'm not sure they'd be the favorite anymore without a legitimate big and less value from deep shots  -I think the best team would change. I could see a team like Utah becoming the best team in the league because Rudy Gobert would become even more valuable as a rim protector  -Ben Simmons would be even more valuable because long range shots would have less value  -Stephen Curry would be less valuable. He'd still be a star due to his gravity and other abilities, but he'd no longer be a generally consensus top 3 player in the world  -Greg Monroe, Lonzo Ball, Enes Kanter, and Jonas Valanciunas would have their values shoot through the roof"
"OKC 2013-2016.  Dealt Harden after going to the Finals in 2012 because Kendrick Perkins was too valuable.  Beverley takes out Westbrook in the 2013 playoffs, and the Thunder lose to Memphis in the second round.  Ibaka goes down in Game 1 or 2 of the 2014 WCF and the Thunder lose to SAS in 6. This was likely the best shot for the Thunder, as they were close to the Finals, and the Heat did not play well in the finals.  Kevin Durant goes down and misses the 2015 playoffs. Enough said.  2016- near perfect health for the Thunder, and they even got a 3-1 lead against the 73-9 Warriors, only for Golden State to go ""lol nah"" and beat them three straight times and get to the finals.   July 2016- Kevin Durant signs with the Warriors. Good night."
"I actually do know following for a fact. All of these statements are true as of 2013 or prior   * Dwight Howard does not tip and expects strangers to lie for him regularly  * Kevin Durant is one of the most genuine and generous athletes in sports. ~~His posse~~ People leaching off of him are bunch of self entitled, demanding assholes.   * Jamal Crawford continuously helps fellow players in private life even when they have a solid contract and they don't play on his team  * Nate Robinson is one of nicest athletes even if you unintentionally screw him over while he is injured (Sorry Nate I still feel bad about it)  * Dennis Rodman will try to get free service here and there, but at least he will tell you in advance  * Reggie Miller is cool as fuck   **Bonus - Other Sports**   * Darrelle Revis is a Prima Donna who does not pay his bills to small business owners  * Serena Williams is not a nice lady   * Chuck Liddell is really pleasant normal dude who does not expect special treatment and spotlight in private life (Same goes for number of UFC fighters and Ownership)   * Entire Snyder family is absolute nightmare to deal with "
"""An MVP trophy isn't everything...so here are some playoff clips of the former OKC  players who went on to win MVPs elsewhere. See that? That's former OKC player James Harden eliminating the Thunder the year after OKC lost Kevin Durant. And here is Durant kissing the championship trophies he won back-to-back right after leaving OKC."""
"LeBron would never, ever, ever recruit Kevin Durant. Even in 2014. He's not a bitch."
"Lakers also beat 5 MVPs in 2010.  Harden, Durant, Westbrook in round 1, Steve Nash in the conference finals, and Kevin Garnett in the finals. "
"The scoring title use to be huge, then people realized it didn't matter.  I think the ""Jordan Rules"" stated that there was huge competition between a few folks to get the scoring title, as that was, in some ways, another default MVP.  It was later determined that it wasn't that relevant....So much so that Kobe needed something like 40 points in the last game of the season to beat Kevin Durant for the scoring title, but decided to just sit it out as the Lakers seed was set.  When two of the biggest competitors in the league differ so much on it, it is clear that times have changed."
"Depends on what my team needs.   But in terms of modern skills needed, I would take AD. Dude is a monster on both Defense and Offense. Kevin Durant might make buckets, but we saw he is a liability on defense unless he is only help defense (not primary defender)"

"As a Heat fan, I'm taking this offer even if it may prove to be stupid just because Championships are so rare.  I'm bringing back the exact same core we have this year so no surprises. 37-year old D-Wade is able to have a surprisingly impressive season averaging like 15PPG as Dragic gets another All-Star Appearance and a variety of our young guys grow. We finish the regular season with a reasonable 46-36 record but end up as the #6 seed.   In the 1st Round, we play the #3 seeded Boston Celtics who finished behind the Cavaliers/76ers. In another classic Miami/Boston playoff series it goes 7 games but in Game 7 Hassan Whiteside goes OFF on Al Horford and gets 28 points with 21 rebounds, clinching the Heat a nail victory on the road shocking one of the most stacked teams in the East.   In the 2nd Round, we play the #2 seeded Philadelphia 76ers. Stacked and having finished us off in 5 the year prior, nobody expects anything from us. Dion Waiters has the series of his life against his old team aveaging 34PPG as Miami pull off a shock upset in 6 games with D-Wade hitting a dagger stepback mid range jumper over Ben Simmons to break the hearts of Kevin Hart and all Philly faithful.   In the Conference Finals, it's the #1 seeded Cleveland Cavaliers with a 66-16 record, LeBron coming off a 5th MVP and insane season with his new pairing with Kemba Walker. Stunningly, Kelly Olynyk unveils his playoff perform, James Johnson performs like a poor mans LBJ, and Bam Adebayo emerges as this rag tag Heat squad goes up 3-2 in the series after falling behind 0-2 as LeBron has still never won in Miami since leaving. In Game 6, down 94-95, D-Wade gets the ball and drives to the rim hard landing an acrobatic layup as time expires. LeBron's reign in the East has ended with the team that he started it with, and now he has to explore new pastures in the offseason.  Finally in the NBA Finals, the 76-6 Warriors just finished 12-0'ing the Western Conference. All of /r/nba is bitching about how KD ruined the NBA and everyone thinks the Warriors are going to stomp each game by 40 points. Through 3 games, that looks to be the case as there 0 signs of life from the Heat and the Warriors go up 3-0. Suddenly though, Dwayne Wade summons his 2006 Finals form and goes off for 45 in Game 4 in what many thought would be his last game in the NBA, Heat steal in Game 5, push it back to 6 where the Heat win by 3, and in Game 7 Kevin Durant goes 0/18 from the field and only scores 2 points as D-Wade wins his 2nd Finals MVP and 4th Ring overall with a 39-point performance clinching Pat Riley a Championship as they both ride off into the sunset together.

"I mean...I won't argue that Presti isn't a wiz in general, but Durant was a generational talent who fell to 2 after Oden was picked by Portland, Westbrook was arguably the consensus BPA unless you wanna make an argument for all-pro Kevin Love or maybe Eric Gordon, Harden was the consensus BPA except for maybe Ricky Rubio, who the Thunder didn't need, and while Bledsoe was probably a steal at 18 (I will acknowledge, he was a good pick if you are looking at it simply from the standpoint of ""Sam Presti is great at drafting""), Presti didn't keep the guy"
Kevin Durant eats mice and sleeps under a heat lamp 
Kevin Durant reading this and thinking this for himself...
Oh yes. Trade for melo and one of the worst contacts in the league. Lose Kevin Durant. Trade away James harden because you wanted to keep serge ibaka. Trade for pg13 only for the person you traded for him to be his near equal that season
GOD DAMNIT Ive been waiting on this news for four years. The Brazilian Kevin Durant they said.
"Heres a complete list, as far as I can remember:  1. 1985-86 Philadelphia 76ers: Bob McAdoo, Moses Malone, Julius Erving, Charles Barkley\* 2. 1981-85 Los Angeles Lakers: Bob McAdoo, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson 3. 2003-04 Los Angeles Lakers: Karl Malone, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant 4. 2009-12 Oklahoma City Thunder: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden\*  \*Malone, Erving, and Barkley also played together during 1984-85.  \*That OKC squad is the first team to have 3 players who eventually become MVP. All the other teams had at least one who had already won the award and was nearing the end of their career."
"It's absolutely incompetence. Harden was 22 and Westbrook/Durant were 23. How do you go the freaking NBA Finals, then immediately trade away the guy that averaged 19-4-4 on 66 TS&amp;#37;?!! Do you know what they turned James Harden into: Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, Mitch McGary, and Steven Adams. That's it.  Instead of a dynasty OKC progressively got worse as they squeezed every penny they could hold on to. And why? So they could saved a measly [$4.5 M](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/8562868/oklahoma-city-thunder-trade-james-harden-houston-rockets) over 4 years.  &gt;The Thunder offered Harden $55.5 million over four years -- $4.5 million less than the max deal Harden coveted and will get from the Rockets, sources told ESPN The Magazine's Chris Broussard.  People here keep talking about how they couldn't afford Westbrook, Durant, Ibaka, and Harden but that's not true. Durant, Westbrook, and Ibaka had all already signed their rookie extensions; they were all already under contract. And to save $1.125 M/year they traded Harden. That's grossly incompetent."
"Kevin Durant and his group, led by spokesman Kawhi Leonard, have set up camp outside twiter hq. "
Why are you having an imaginary argument with Kevin Durant with a random redditor 
"Alot of what Draymond does well defensively is away from the basketball. You ask someone what makes him special defensively and they probably won't be able to detail what he does a team defender, because your instinct is to focus on the ball when watching games. All the stuff about him being versatile enough to switch 1-5, aggressiveness, hustle - on ball. What about his pre rotations, communication, ability to cover ground and protect the paint. There is much more nuance to his defense than Kawhi, and it's harder to understand why he's so good defensively compared to Kawhi because the archetype for Draymond is extremely rare. Kawhi not so much.  The point I'm making here is that Kawhi is a very overrated defender. Some people call him the 2nd best player in the NBA because of two way performance, as if his defense is so good to catapult him over Kevin Durant. I don't even think it's good enough to put him over Curry."
Kevin Durant might not be the worst human being to exist.
Kevin Durant saved the NBA
Kevin Durant joining [your team here] confirmed!
"He can say that as much as he wants, but I don't think the chemistry between Scott Brooks, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden is really comparable to Popovich, The Big Fundamental, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobli. It takes a lot more than saying you admire Manu Ginobli to think they had a likely chance of emulating one of the most fundamentally-sound, unselfish basketball systems in the history of the NBA."
"Unfortunately for OKC they jumped the gun on trading Harden no matter what, they traded him 16 months before his contract would count against the luxury tax and other problems with salary cap. Essentially the OKC front office not recognizing the financial changes coming for the league led them to breaking up their dynasty unnecessarily.  The following except from this article, https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/section-nba/news/kevin-durant-thunder-vs-warriors-russell-westbrook-james/1tt026yq1lmjj1vh97biyotfwf  -In those 16 months, the average team valuation jumped 30 percent, the president of ESPN said the NBA was a “critical product” for the network and the Kings sold for a then-record $534 million, an 18.6 percent increase on the prior record Warriors sale three years earlier despite being in a small market. Additionally, the league increased its cap estimate for 2014-15 twice during the prior season, from the original $62.5 million that July to $62.9 before the trade deadline to $63.2 in April.  In February 2014, the Thunder and every other team possessed more than enough information to see where the league was headed financially.  While the league’s gigantic national TV contract was not announced until October 2014, the expectation was that the national television contract would double its per-year amount from about $930 million under the prior deal. It ended up almost tripling to a whopping $2.6 billion per season, but even doubling would have meant a massive uptick in the salary cap and luxury tax.  All of this is to say that by the latest that the Thunder could have traded Harden without financial hardship, they would have known about the expanding finances of the league combined with the still-limited contracts of that time. They even could have signed Harden for his maximum without any real fear of long-term implications. With a little maneuvering, they also could have kept Serge Ibaka, the player whose commitment often is used as an explanation for why the Thunder could not afford to keep Harden, without facing down the NBA’s dreaded “repeater tax” for high-spending franchises."
"[He did,] (http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-kevin-durant-malibu-house-20180424-story.html) that being said I can't imagine having the money he has and not getting a house here in LA"
"How dare you put?? For Craig Brackins! I played high school with him and he was legit the next Kevin Durant, Until he wasn’t :( "
"lmao way to completely skirt around my question.   You know damn well GS got better by replacing Harrison Barnes with Kevin fucking Durant. but again, you're a troll and you got me on this. so congrats?"
Yeah but KD's was better  - Kevin Durant
"Damm why people caring where LeBron leaving, they hatin on KD tho cuz he didn't stay in OKC, hypocrites   - Kevin Durant"
"They'd do just [fine together.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXKpBUI8vYo) They'd stagger. And, when they all were on the court, Harden would handle the ball. Westbrook could go early career Tony Parker on them while Harden played the Manu and Kevin Durant could just be Kevin Durant."
"Why would that be relevant? The question was whether or not they could *continue* to exist as they were, not whether or not Harden fits the bill as a super sixth man for the time he was there. As for what his usage is now, it's been over 30 for the past 3 years, since he's been in the MVP conversation.  EDIT: To answer your question, though, Harden's usage rate in OKC was around 20%. Compared to his move to Houston when it jumped up by about 8 points, making his lowest year in usage rate about one point lower than Manu's highest ever recorded usage rate.  EDIT: Some other stats worthy of note here:  Russel Westbrook: Highest ever recorded usage - 41.7%, lowest - 25.8  Kevin Durant: Highest - 33%, lowest - 28.1%  James Harden: Highest - 36.1%, lowest - 19.5%  Tim Duncan: Highest - 29.7%, lowest - 17.6%  Tony Parker: Highest - 31.7%, lowest - 17.7%  Manu Ginobli: Highest - 28.7%, lowest - 18.5%  Also should be noted that Tim Duncan's lowest is in his last year and that he has a remarkably consistent usage rate throughout his career, and that Harden is the only player that has his highest and lowest on two separate teams."
"It does, generally people's 3P% and overall shooting ability can increase when they get older which makes sense since being a good shooter is largely a skill about repetition.    But if you're not a 3 point shooter as in you take zero 3 point shots in games I'm really not sure how much time plays a factor in terms of improvement.    Kevin Durant and LeBron James had a poor 3P% they're rookie year, but they took them at a decent clip (high-clip for Durant) and improved the season after.  Jason Kidd was one of the worst 3 point shooters of all time entering the NBA, but he took them and he improved later on his career.  Kawhi was a horrible shooter in College, but he took them.    There's been very little evidence of anyone developing a jumper completely out of the blue.  The only one I can think of is Blake Griffin and his form makes me cringe and think he's going to lose his shooting ability just about every time I see him play.  I think it's difficult to become a shooter if you're a non-shooter.    "
"Harden was already an elite player. He just didn't get the ball as much, but when he did he showed what he was capable of. Harden + KD had better net ratings than Westbrook + KD in 2012.   - Harden had 37/6/12/4/1 5 days after being traded.    - Harden had 45/7/2 3 days later, in his 2nd game with the Rockets.  He already was great. In the season he was traded, Durant ends 1st team All NBA, Westbrook 2nd team All NBA, and Harden 3rd team All NBA. It was obvious they had made a huge mistake even back then. It's why Bill Simmons can't ever let go of it. You don't trade a dynasty away for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb and 2 1st rounders.   Even if you go to the Woj tweet of when it happened, most tweets (that aren't new, the ones from 2012) are saying ""why on earth would you trade Harden after being 3 games away from winning the title?"""
Also according to CARMELO:   Otto Porter - $260 million   Kevin Durant - $200 million 
"Kevin Martin had a good regular season that one year in OKC, and then no-showed in the playoffs. Martin was a decent player but needed set plays for him to run off screens to get open looks. Really not the ideal player to match with guys like Westbrook &amp; Durant."
"Nope, she was pretty annoyed that I scared the shit out of her just because of Kevin Durant.   She did give me a “fuck the Warriors” though so that was special. "

"Think about it, LeBron fucking James, PG13, and Kevin Durant...that team is stacked as hell, they wouldn't need depth to win. That'd be no different from the Warriors in terms of dominance. They might even be MORE dominant. "
What species of snake is Kevin Durant?
"im from the Dominican Republic and that is my dream as well. I want to be a season ticket holder for any team, i do not care if it is the kings or the nets, i just want to go to every single game.  I have been to the states and have watched 4 NBA Games in total:  1st Game - 12/14/2004 - Indiana Pacers Vs Boston Celtics. I had an amazing experience for my first NBA game. i was watching Jermaine O´neal and Stephen Jackson practicing and when Stephen went to the tunnel we spoke for about 5 minutes and he was so nice to me. He played in the Dominican Republic for a brief time and he averaged 40+ points per game over here. The celtics won that game and Fred Jones did an amazing dunk that night on Raef Lafrentz.  2nd Game - 05/12/2011 - Chicago Bulls vs Atlanta Hawks. Game 6 of the Eastern conference Semi Finals. Josh Smith had a Crazy Alley oop, Boozer destroyed Horford and i saw MVP D-Rose. it was a Blowout but i saw 2 great teams for the first time. Fun Fact: that same day i was walking in downtown Atlanta and saw David Aldridge crossing the street, we shook hands and we spoke for a brief moment.  3rd Game - 11/25/2015 - New York Knicks vs Orlando Magic. 2 really bad teams, but i was happy to see Carmelo and Porzingis. Porzingis block on Oladipo was amazing and the Magic won that game from the start.  4th Game - 01/15/2018 - Golden State Warriors vs Cleveland Cavaliers. We drove 5+ hours in a snow storm just to see this game from rochester NYC to Cleveland, i was so hyped for this game. I saw many Hall of Famers in D-wade, Lebron, Curry, Durant, etc. Lebron had a great game but they GSW has way to much firepower. My favorite NBA player is Kevin Durant and he had a monster dunk on Lebron James, i almost left the building when i saw this. Curry even dunked on that game. it was an amazing experience that i cannot describe with words. This is one of the best memories of my life.   All of this were gifts from my family that live in the united states, and i am really thankful to all of them for this amazing gifts. i have so many memories i can share just because of this."
"That decision didn't come from the 76ers FO.. it would have been initiated by Simmons camp , who are acting in Simmons best interest (especially Klutch Sports &amp; Nike who had financial incentives for Simmons winning ROY).

"One last comment and then I’ll leave this topic alone.  Two years ago Kevin Durant had already earned MVP, had been to an NBA finals and four Western Conference finals, and was widely considered the second best player behind LeBron. He was already considered one of the greatest scorers in NBA history and scored an efficient 31 ppg on 55% shooting in the 2012 finals.  As soon as he left OKC two years ago, did anyone think Golden State wasn’t going to win the next couple titles barring injuries?   So these last two years have shown me nothing that I didn’t already know. That is, if you put a generational type player on the team that’s been to back-to-back finals and just won 73 games, then they’re gonna be pretty damn good and win some championships.  Duh, most obvious outcome ever.  It was and remains an epically weak move by KD. If he wants respect, follow the Kobe Bryant path sans Shaq by winning multiple titles on his own team."
"&gt; Kevin Durant to opt out of his $26.3 million player option and likely sign a new deal with the Golden State Warriors early in free agency. (Marc Stein, New York Times)"
"http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23109223/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-plans-decline-player-option-restructure-deal  35 million first year for KD in all of the options. 35 million roughly is 35% of the cap, i.e. what you get paid when you qualify for the supermax. If you are a 10 year vet you can get paid up to 35% of the cap.  I'm pretty sure you don't know what the supermax is. The Supermax is when you have stayed on the same team/traded on rookie contract and you fit all the qualifiers, so that you can be paid 35% of the cap instead of 30% in the first year of your contract. The qualifiers are that you have to be a 7-9 year vet, and all-nba/mvp/dpoy for previous year or 2 of the previous 3 years.  http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q24  Read this."

"is it not the most valuable player award? is there any player on any franchise more valuable to their franchise than lebron is to the cleveland cavaliers? is lebron james not the best player on earth and has he not held that title for almost a decade?   to me, it sounds like you’re just simplifying it to “who was the best player on the team with the best record”, without any regard to who the actual best player in the league was or who has the highest value to their respective team, and if we use the mind-numbingly flawed method of “best player - best record” then kevin durant should have won the mvp last year, kawhi should have an mvp, lebron should have like 6, duncan should have a few, dirk should have one, and so on.

"A lot of the players think that Ben had a big advantage being around an NBA team for a year since they've had the same experience of transitioning from college to the pros.

[Draymond said](http://www.slamonline.com/nba/draymond-green-picks-donovan-mitchell-for-rookie-of-the-year/)  &gt;For me, I would go with Donovan just for the simple fact: I think he’s a true rookie.  &gt;With Ben, I think just having NBA training, eating like a pro, watching film like a pro, I think all that makes a difference.  &gt;Not taking away anything that he’s doing because he’s having a fantastic year, and I think he’ll be one of the faces of this league for years to come.  &gt;But for me, what Donovan has done, just coming straight out of college and doing what he’s doing, would give him the nod for me.

Lebron James vs Kevin Durant in a fist fight is what would do it for me
The NBA is a job at the end of the day and you want to get paid. Paul George probably cares about rings but he also sees that he’s only made 60 mill on his career so far and he’s getting old. So he cashed out. Kevin Durant has plenty of money same with Lebron so rings are your next goal. I’m sure Robert Harry would trade those 5 rings for a 100 million dollar contract 
"It's absolutely a slippery slope. Especially with the amount of money super max players are getting now. If they invest and allocate their money correctly, all the supermax players are in position to be billionaires.  &gt; For example, Joe Lacob is a very successful venture capitalist who has invested in some the valley's greatest startups. The Warriors have also been notorious recently for players taking paycuts. Is it possible that Joe Lacob could be giving his players the right of first refusal in investments that he has a good hunch on? Or Lacob iron fisting one of his players onto the board of one of his portfolio companies?  I joked in the past that this was cap circumvention, but the more I looked into it the more I'm convinced the NBA must prohibit members of the Warriors from participating in VC deals.   From CBA FAQ regarding [cap circumvention](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q106):  &gt; Examples of conduct considered to be circumvention include: A team owner allowing a player to invest in a business or investment fund controlled by the owner or a friend of the owner.  It doesn't take much digging to see Kevin Durant is getting preferential access and millions in free resources &amp; institutional knowledge to invest in VC deals. Many of his investments are the direct result of VCs attending Warriors events in town. It should be noted that Warriors games are a big part of doing business in SF and developing deal flow and favors between investors, execs, and entrepreneurs. The NBA clearly prohibits players from co-investing in Lacob deals, but allowing other deals reflects how poorly the NBA understands how deals are done in VC. "
Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to Knicks in 2019 might be legit.
"Kevin Durant. Idc how good he is, hes clearly not going to win us a ring because he had to climb on Curry's shoulders, hes got this annoying pussy ass playing the victim mentality and hes such a fake tough guy fuck this pussy "
"Homie, I can name quite a few players that deserve the GOAT title more than Steph. Even his own teammate Kevin Durant probably has a bigger argument. Steph is definitely going to go down as the greatest shooter of all time, but he’s never been the best player in the league, being eclipsed by LeBron and KD every year. There’s at least 10 players standing in front of him in that line."
"He thought he broke parity and although it'd be tough to win with 3 superstars and bunch of ring chasers, they still won 2! This dude really thought he was gonna win shit tons of rings lmao. All about his intentions! Nothing wrong with ring chasing but just don't deny it or come out with revisionist bs.   I have no idea what you mean by ""incomplete"" tho I think it was probably just you making up random stuff while being upset about the ""parity.""   As for moments that make NBA history, check these two out!!!  1) [Kevin Durant super clutch 3 in game 3 of 2017 NBA Finals down 2 with 46s to go in the 4th!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO5vDFxDBYk&amp;t=0m6s)  2) [Kevin Durant dagger 3 to put away the Cavs at Quicken Loan in game 3 of the 2018 NBA Finals!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dek9OSrjHLg&amp;t=3m39s)  These were clutch moments in the NBA Finals in which KD thrived in! KD carried game 3 this year and was very clutch. This is A+ effort here by KD (A+ for Steph too cuz gravity and he stepped up too even when he had a bad game). Sadly, I think your entire post is just a roundabout way to say you wished Bron would have gotten more rings but sorry man, Warriors got in the way.   PS: Steph did ""bounce back"" in 2017 and 2018 Finals"
"yes.  this is a league built on competition.  always has been.  more than anything that's what fans like.  kevin durant told those fans they weren't going to get that for several seasons.  fans don't watch sports to hear how happy a player is with his professional decision.  durant did what he considered best for him, and in so doing did what was worst for the set of the nba fan base that enjoys competitive games and finals.  if parity isn't his responsibility, making positive comments towards kevin durant about how many venture capital deals he gets in silicon valley while occasionally paying attention to his basketball side project isn't my responsibility.  why must kevin durant be respected for doing what is best for him if it's worse for other people.  no retailer thanks amazon for putting them out of business."
"This is dumb. So fucking dumb. It's like blaming the guy who invented diamond rings for jewelry theft. Winning a ring is awesome it's great it's huge it's a feat to be accomplished and celebrated. Short cutting and cheating the game and the fans to get there isn't. It's fucking dumb and you can and should blame the people that do it for doing it. That's Kevin Durant, Demarcus Cousins and the Golden State Warriors. Stop trying to blame everybody else. "
"Kevin ""the ~~servant~~ serpent"" Durant"
"When it's all said and done, Kevin Durant will be the second best SF ever, and go down as greater than Larry Bird. KD is a better scorer than Bird, is going to be a top 3 scorer ever when it's all said and done, and something that I really push when it comes to basketball, is the reality that scoring is way more important than any other statistic. I'm sick of us saying things like ""2 way player"" which imply that defense is just as important. It's not. In the office where a CEO works, somebody has to do the work that the janitor does. If they don't then the environment will fall into disarray, and nothing can get done, but just because the work being done by the janitor is crucial, would you call the janitor himself crucial? No, because he's extremely replaceable and the variance in quality between different people who could be janitor, is not very great. Likewise, defense is important, but the work done by defenders is not that distinct or varied, when compared to offense.    People say that KD has destroyed his own legacy based on the team that he decided to go to. Everyone forgets that if you say that Magic, and Kareem are both top 5 basketball players of all time, nobody is going to think that you're crazy, but never mind the fact that they had each other for support when they were winning their rings. KD has Steph, Klay, and Draymond for help, and you could argue that those 3 put together are more effective than Kareem, but individually none of them is even close to being on Kareem's level in the all time ranks, so it's actually closer than it seems, whether or not Kareem, or those 3 together, are better support. The quality of KD's team should not disqualify him, when looking at the all time list.    "
Nothing wrong with the 2016 &amp; previous warriors. Splash Bros were very fun to watch and that 73-9 run was amazing (even tho Kobe's last game was more important than that 73rd win). I went into that 2016 finals neutral but by the end I fell in love with Lebron. But both played with a lot of heart.  It's this Kevin Durant shit I don't like. I never did like KD but that snake move &amp; the fact that he makes them less interesting to watch is enough to root against them until he is off that damn team.
"That's an interesting match up  Prime Magic vs Steph Curry: Prime Magic wins because he's bigger with a  more well rounded game, Curry would out score him.  Prime Kobe vs Klay Thompson: Kobe wins everytime  Prime Lebron vs Draymond Green: Lebron stomps  Prime Kareem vs Kevin Durant: Kareem wins easy  Prime Shaq vs Demarcus Cousins: Diesel bulldozers  Warriors beat Lakers in three point shooting but All time Lakers stomp them in everything else.  "
"Okay, but reality is that guys like Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins have already spoiled their own legacies by looking like insecure ring chasers. They are not going to be remembered fondly by many of us. Almost everyone is aware Durant is hitching rides to titles instead of leading his own team to one -- and it is clear to everyone that the Warriors aren't Durant's team. I honestly believe he turned his own career into a bit of a joke. I don't respect the guy, and you're lying to yourself if you do."
"Kevin ""the servant"" Durant"
"&gt; So basically after reading this essay you were mad and in your feelings because your team got clowned for losing after being up 3-1 even though that would have happened to any team in that situation.  No, absolutely not.  The memes didn't bother me, what bothered me was what the memes represented.    Regular season accomplishments don't matter.  Winning playoff series don't matter.  Rings are all that matter.  That's what the 3-1 memes proclaimed loud and clear.  I don't care about jokes at my team's expense, remember, my team was the team that had choke-gate, the warriors were a NATIONAL joke.  I didn't give up on my team after choke-gate.  Oh, and one other thing, before you ask, choke-gate didn't involve the warriors collapsing and losing badly, it involved a player physically choking the head coach....because he had a family to feed, or something.   What bothered me about the 3-1 memes were what they represented; they clearly communicated that rings only mattered.  That the greatest regular season of all-time didn't matter, that the greatest regular season of all-time would not be remembered.  That losing that 3-1 lead in the finals would be the only thing about that season that was remembered.  Even the post-free agency meme was self-contradictory.  Consider this:   ""the league is fucked because Kevin Durant joined a 73 win warrior team.""    Stop and think about that for a second, the ""KD joined a 73 win team"" meme is odd because it highlights the 73 wins.  What doesn't it highlight?  Its not:   ""KD ruined the league because he joined a team that went to 2 straight NBA finals, already won a championship and was on the verge of a second title in two years.""    In other words, the 73 wins are used to attack KD, but the warriors, as an organization, don't get any POSITIVE credit for having created a team that KD would want to join.  Its all 100% SALT.  20 years from now, the salt will flow away, the context of the situation will be lost to history and none of the details will be remembered.  At that point, only the simplest points will remain, an entire existence boiled down to an needlessly reductionist statistic so that arguments can be easily won and players easily ranked: how many rings you got?  Knowing that future, its hard to blame KD or Boogie.     Let me give you an example of how time will destroy all the context from the situation.  Do you remember how many seasons Michael Jordan played?  Do you remember how he faired in the post-season in each of those seasons?  I remember Lebron, because the memory is fresh.     Consider the following thought experiment, suppose I allocated points for post-season progression.  Instead of rings, lets say you get 1 point for a first round elimination, 2 points for the second round, 3 points for the third, 4 points for losing in the finals and 5 points for winning a title.  Jordan lost in the first round his first three NBA seasons, winning a total of 1 playoff game in those first 3 years.  He lost in the second round his fourth year, and lost in the conference finals to Detroit twice in years five and six.  He then won six of the next 8 titles.  By my scoring system, Jordan's career total is: won finals 6 times x 5 points + lost ECF 2 times x 3 points + lost second round 1 time x 2 points + lost first round 3 times x 1 point = 44 total postseason points.    (edit: forgot to add the playoff loss to Orlando between the 6 titles, so 44 points)   Lebron is won finals 3 times x 5 points + lost finals 6 times x 4 points = 39 points already, without counting his loss to the pistons, his 2 post-season losses to the Celtics and his loss to the Magic.  By this measure of post-season ""Success"" that isn't all or nothing, and that penalizes MJ for losing in the first round THREE times, and gives Lebron a bonus for NEVER having lost in round 1, and also, by the way, gives a guy a bonus for advancing and gets rid of the silly ""is it better for Lebron's legacy to lose in the first round rather then get to the finals and lose?"" question.  This is a metric that doesn't make it ""all or nothing"", that allows us to examine the GOAT argument without resorting to ""hurr durr, 6 &gt; 3"" that allows us to acknowledge how great Lebron is for winning the 2016 finals while ALSO giving the warriors 4 points of credit for winning the west that year.

"The problem is that despite how insane the Warriors were without KD, they still weren’t impossible to replicate or beat.  They had a superstar in Curry, a star in Klay, and an elite defender in Draymond. Add in the veterans and it was an impressive collection, but not something all that out of the ordinary.   The Spurs had had something similar in Duncan, Parker, Manu, and their role players. Boston had done the same. Miami. Even the Cavs.  If Steph had a bad game, Klay could still carry them. If Steph and Klay had a bad game, the role players could still death squad it up. That’s why the team won 73 games. But as we saw against the Cavs, things could still go wrong. It didn’t happen often, but it could.   KD removed that liability. He’s the ultimate insurance policy. This is why Him being on the Warriors is broken and why it upsets people.  It’s hard enough for teams to acquire 2 stars and someone who is truly elite in some other capacity. Few teams can do it. Fewer have a legit superstar, HOF caliber guy.   It’s 99% impossible for teams to build what the Warriors have. 2 HOF players in their prime, another star in his prime, and then someone who is elite and in their prime, then a strong collection of role players.  If Curry has an off night, they have hall of famer and former MVP Kevin Durant to pick up the slack. In the off chance Curry and Durant have a bad game...all-star Klay Thompson is there to drop 20-40 points. And in the event all 3 aren’t shooting well, they have a lockdown defender in Draymond who helps keep games closer than they should be.   There were games in 2017 finals where if the Warriors didn’t have KD they would have been toast. The quarters where the game would typically get competitive, which is what we saw in 2015 and 2016, never happened. That’s because KD would come in and just pick up the slack.  That’s why KD being on the Warriors is garbage. Because it makes the competitive balance completely lopsided. And it isn’t something other teams can easily just go out and do. It’s a freak scenario caused by a HOF player sacrificing all ego and shame.     "

"NBA players make too much money.   They aren't taking the 5 year supermaxes, because they don't want to be locked somewhere for 5 years unless it's a destination city or if they drastically aren't worth their contract.   You see this with Kevin Durant. He makes so much in endorsements that he can laugh away the difference in a max contract and his contract. He'd rather be in a situation he'd want to be in where he can leave relatively when he wants if it's no longer a situation he wants to be in.   Some players take the supermaxes, but they're loyal to cities who have made efforts to make them happy. I'm not so sure they wouldn't have left if supermaxes didn't exist. Would  Westbrook want to leave OKC if the supermax didn't exist?   I think the best way to parity is to get rid of max contracts. Reward good franchises with the current tax and birds rights system that allows for good teams to stay good if they are willing to pay for that right.   Good role players are making 20 million a year now as max guys when a decade ago only the top stars could make such money. That's so much money for anyone in a lifetime let alone for one year.   If we want parity we need to realize that the stars need to make money hands over fist and the role players need to be paid like role players with whatever is left. "
"Scenario A : Kevin Durant stays with OKC, continues to be the 2nd best player in the league for 4 more seasons. Making it about a decade of being the 2nd best player in the league, an incredible run. Has a couple great postseasons but doesn't win a ring. You think it's a shame he has been on OKC his whole career and never had a team quite good enough to win. You think ""man imagine if he went to the Warriors in 2016 that team would have won 4 years in a row easily"".    Scenario B: KD goes to the warriors and wins 4 rings in a row easily.    If in these two scenarios your ranking for KD is substancially better in scenario B then the way you rank players is seriously flawed. Thats my opinion.    I think KD will finish top 15, maybe top 10 but it's not because of these rings that any all-star small forward could win. "
"That's not completely true. Paul George declined the supermax and wanted to be traded, CP3 opted to be traded to the Rockets instead of staying with the Clippers to get the supermax, this Kawhi situation is more or less the same. At some point situations change and stars want something different because they're people. Hell, Kevin Durant left OKC and went to the 73-win Warriors.    A hard cap cannot control this and if you're talking about stars being paid, then a hard cap would be somewhat counter productive. Since teams would be less willing to give out money easily because they don't want to waste precious cap room. The current system is fine in terms of paying a player. A no salary cap league would be even better but like the hardcap, the players union will probably shoot them down.  All this still won't solve the parity issue btw so it's all pointless.   "
 I can't help but think all of this snake comments towards DeMarcus Cousins alleviates Kevin Durant. Cousins could give a rats ass about what random nephews.  KD must be smiling right now for the heat taken off of him

"Curry has a 60.6 career TS% in the playoffs. It's lower than his regular season one, which is expected since you only play against good teams in the playoffs, but it's still elite as hell and the highest in NBA history of 20 PPG scorers.   He also has the 2nd highest finals TS% of 20 PPG scorers that have played in 3 or more finals, behind only Kevin Durant, and has the highest finals TS% of 20 PPG scorers for guys that have played in 4 or more finals.  Curry has been great in the playoffs. "

"This isn't 2K. It's a league built on relationships. If you promise a player a buyout and then renege on that promise once he waives his no-trade clause, you'll destroy your franchise's credibility. That has ripple effects: prospective draft picks won't work out for you, free agents won't consider signing with you, your current players won't trust you and will try to force their way out, etc.   Equally important: what would the team gain? An extremely disgruntled, washed Melo? It makes no sense. If you're trying to reach the salary floor (which no team will need to do this season), a buyout would accomplish the same thing as keeping Melo on the books.   You're getting caught up in what could *technically* happen and failing to recognize that it's about as likely as Kevin Durant opting out next summer and signing with the Lakers for the minimum. "

"My favorite part about that series was the end, where the Warriors didn't win. Quite the contrary, the Warriors lost that series and didn't win it. Specifically, Steph Curry, the unanimous MVP did not win the series. Nor did Draymond Green. Nor did Klay Thompson. Nor did Kevin Durant, who wasn't on the team yet, but fuck him anyway.  In fact, none of the Warriors won that series, because the Warriors lost. At the end of the series, it was not the Warriors who won, but rather the Cleveland Cavaliers, led by Lebron James, who won the series due in no small part to the fact that he was not a member of the Warriors, but rather the leader of the victorious Cleveland Cavaliers.  Who did the Cavs beat to win that series, you might ask? The Golden State Warriors, who blew a 3-1 series lead and ended their season without winning the title.  (copypastaing my own post)"
"but plenty of people are just ""ringz"" people.  so for us, seeing someone get a largely hollow collection of rings is just making the sport boring and doing nothing for the narrative of the player himself.  just like i don't automatically hate on players for having no rings, i'm certainly not going to praise rings won by joining a 73 win team.  i was pretty sure kevin durant could join a 73 win team and win a title.  i wanted to see if he could win with a thunder-level team and conquer other great teams (not that he had to stay with the thunder).  i admit in a league of 30 teams there may not be a perfect ""good enough to win but not too good that it's automatic"" team out there, but i know joining the 73 win team is certainly not the only fallback solution."
"but this is sports.  technically they exist to sell boner pills in between video of people playing basketball, but theoretically they exist for fan entertainment.  why would fans not react to something ruining our entertainment?  he made a completely anti-competitive move.  as fans, since we get nothing out of kevin durant easily accumulating rings without increasing his legacy but we would get something out of watching his competitive greatness on display, then why wouldn't we criticize it?  he basically just said F U to the fans of the competition of the league.  isn't it expected that fans would have the same reply?"
"""but they cannot add a marquee free agent without massively disrupting the core of a team that is still inside a championship-winning window.""  shut the fuck up, confirmed.  the article was basically ""the warriors are winning, which is great for the nba, because they are winning.""  the whole ""it will raise everyone else up"" angle makes no sense.  the nba is a zero sum game.  everyone signing with the warriors for 25% of market value isn't like making a better iPhone and telling samsung to step their game up with new features.  you can't replicate that.  the rest of the league hasn't been languishing because they forgot to recruit kevin durant and then the warriors showed them that that's what they should have been doing.  and even if people could replicate it, so what?  then  we would literally have 2 teams with 10 all-stars and nothing else.  i guess if that's what you are going for, then they are great.  otherwise, watching a sports league, presumably driven by competition, turned into people teaming up for below market value so they won't have competition is going to ruin it for some fans.  i suppose maybe not casual fans, but certainly anyone with more than a passing interest in watching the nba for 20+ years.  edit:  was myers even the gm who drafted steph or klay?  and signing durant wasn't exactly next-level genius.

"It’d maybe be different if people were simply criticizing KD’s decision; there are other people who are using it as an opportunity to be bullies and say as shitty things they can think of because they can and because KD has money, like that gives them an excuse to be emotionally immature and insulting as hell. I think people implicitly do think that they control athletes lives, otherwise they likely wouldn’t get mad at Kevin Durant. If they are unsatisfied with the product of the NBA, I suggest they take more mature and conducive outlets rather than complaining on the internet. Any one should be able to take criticism, but personal abuse? Why should anyone stand idle to that kind of abuse? Why is anyone saying, “yeah, bullying is okay, because it’s on the internet and the people really don’t know each other, so that form of flaming rhetoric is okay?” You werent standing up in the beginning for criticism of KD’s actions, you’re standing up for your right to call him a pussy ass bitch because (I believe that you’re salty as hell) and are privileging your own entertainment over his well being.

Ok so what you're saying is the team that didn't have Kevin Durant is better than the same exact team with Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant is just better. He averages more points on a much higher efficiency. People will say defense, but Durant and Kobe had the same defensive rating (despite Durant playing more years in a higher scoring league) and Durant has a better DBPM.  People will say...but that's unfair, because of Kobe's achilles injury. Fine, then just look at the playoff stats, which don't include the post-achilles injury years for Kobe. Durant averaged more points on a higher scoring efficiency (59.1 TS% vs. 54.1 TS%). Again, in regards to defense, they have the same defensive rating, but Durant has the higher DBPM.  Where Durant really separates himself is in the finals. Durant is one of the best finals performers of all time, while Kobe was one of the greatest finals chokers of all time. "
Kobe was more gooder at the sport of basketball than Kevin Durant has been
"Choose 6 or more of the following that you'd take AI over (and I'm definitely leaving names off of players that I couldnt immediately think of).   Magic, Stockton, Steph Curry, Isiah Thomas, MJ, Kobe, Dwyane Wade, Jerry West, Clyde Drexler, LeBron, Larry Bird, Dr. J, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Durant, Tim Duncan, Karl Malone, KG, Dirk, Charles Barkley, KAJ, Shaq, Wilt, Hakeem, Bill Russell, David Robinson. "
"You guys make it seem playing like ""you're giving it your all every night with passion and energy"" comes in only 1 flavor. You can give it your all without being a chucker. There are plenty of people who have the same passion. How does one even measure passion? By the amount of shots you take or how much you dominate the ball? Jason kidd, John Stockton, Gary Payton all gave it their all everytime they stepped on the court (just to name a few) . I don't dislike Westbrook, but I'm also not blind to the idea people disliking a point guard that is a blatant ball hog, who felt that he somehow needed to shoot more than Kevin Durant. If he doesn't have the ball, then he's waiting for it 5 feet behind the 3 point line. This connection people make about westbrook and his love for the game as if it separates him from everyone else needs to end. Its like a cover up for all his other flaws when the truth of the matter is that statements like that are kinda like an insult to other great players who love the game just as much and play the game differently. "
"Well everyone wants to win. But look at Kevin Durant, he just won back to back championships and it's basically tarnished due to the lack of competition. Had the thunder not blowne the 3-1 lead back in 2016 and went on to possibly beat the Cavs. I think the whole league would have benefited from that but nope now we have a team that has a top 2 player in each position and warrior fans they we being delusional for being salty. "
Nephew- when someone says something really stupid they get called this.   LeBron is the best player in the world and has been for a while. People debate if he’s better than Jordan but most people agree it’s still Jordan at this point.   Warriors are the best roster in nba history and the reason a lot of people feel like there’s no hope for the next few years for their team to have a chance to win.   Kevin Durant is a snake.   Sonics used to be a team but now they no longer are.   Wherever LeBron goes the coach doesn’t matter because he becomes the head coach which is why ty lie got shit on all the time  This sub hates inefficient players and James Harden.   Rockets were 1 game away from beating the warriors this year but Chris Paul got hurt and they shit the bed missing 27 straight 3’s or something like that. 
"Kevin Durant ruined the NBA, all you really need to know."
Kevin “The Minion” Durant
"My issue comes from a labor relations perspective. When a top 5 NBA player is taking significant annual pay cuts to make the league anti-competitive, an expectation arises for non-top-5 players. You can say what you want about LeBron, Wade, and Bosh, but Durant’s pay cut last year alone was almost larger than the pay cut any of them made over the course of their tenure with the Heat.  I’m not saying players should not be allowed to value winning or take pay cuts or anything like that, but at a certain point there needs to be a line that can’t be crossed for the sake of parity and players that aren’t All-Stars.  It shouldn’t be a race to the bottom and we shouldn’t have discussions about All-Star caliber players taking low/minimum salaries just to win. It’s bad for players, competition, and the other 29 teams in the league. Kevin Durant elevated these conversations to a new level and Cousins took them even further. That’s my issue with Durant."

There’s times I don’t like what he’s doing out on the court, there’s times where he hates what I’m doing out on the court. There’s times where it’s Russ, you gotta control your attitude or KD, you gotta stop, you gotta speak up, whatever. There’s times we cuss each other out, but that’s a part of being brothers. Because I know if I need something, he’ll be there and if I need to talk to someone outside of basketball, he’ll be there. It’s a real brotherhood type relationship. We're like family.""

THEY ADDED KEVIN FUCKING DURANT. How are you not getting this. 
The fact this is even a post where all you people care about is rings is why Demarcus Cousins and Kevin Durant went to the Warriors
"I dont think Kevin Durant is jumping for joy now that Cousins signed with the warriors. If anything, he may reevaluate staying in GS past next year and may be more open to going to the Celtics.  See, I can make shit up to."
"they shouldn't. steph klay and draymond were each drafted by the warriors and they had no problem welcoming in a player much better than them and sacrificing their own stats and legacy to be successful in the league. attracting a player like kevin durant is itself an achievement, but doing it with the grace in which the warriors have speaks volumes about them as players."
Kevin Durant was never vindicated.
"1. Kevin Durant is not the best player in the league  2. Yes. Height and Wingspan Matter. Isaac and Bamba will not be shot over, Durant will actually see a contest. They are quick and athletic enough to keep up with him to.  3. You “cut it the fuck out”"
You mean to tell me a rookie who hasn't played a single game in the NBA can guard kevin durant arguably the best player in the NBA for the better part of 10 years?? Cut it the fuck out! 
the cupcake Kevin Durant would disagree...
Kevin Durant leaves and they use KD money to keep Boogie?
"Imagine this:  Russell Westbrook has his hand in Kevin Durant’s face. KD is looking to pass to Curry. He looks around and then looks forward again. Suddenly Westbrook steps to the side and waves Adams to step to the side, and clear the lane. Then he sarcastically motions KD to go for the lay up.  Rinse and repeat with Harden, and every other All-Star for that matter.  That type of shit destroys a man.  We don’t need to drop games to do this. Just doing that would break him, and all of the other players on the team if they did the same to them.  Imagine the Lakers doing it to Klay all night long.  Anthony Davis and Rajon to Boogie.  Lebron to Green and Igoudala.  Kyrie to Steph Curry.  He’ll, if Michael Jordan came out and said that Kevin Durant and the Warriors are low-power uncompetitive and chose the easiest path, it would probably break the Warriors.  Edit: a few things."

'players generally want to compete' can you please send this to Kevin Durant and cousins like fuck man.  
"This is a variation on a strategy I've pitched several times to my friends. The league won't let you rest like this, but here's the wrinkle:  Play whoever, but still throw the game by triple teaming either Kevin Durant or Steph Curry every single possession. They get a no-effort layup line and the embarrassment every night, plus you warp their stars' stats."
"i like the warriors  when they win i think ""yes""  when they they lose i think ""no""  they have star player kevin durant"
Those teams didn’t add Kevin Durant and Boogie after winning a title
uh no kevin durant is the problem 
"They drafted 3 of their all stars, and they have dibs on resigning them whatever amount, no matter how much over cap they go (bird right).  KD joins for cheap, and resigned for under market value again.  Boogie went in with exception (Mid Level Exception, put in place to obtain a player of some value without pushing towards cap).  Preventing: Thunder could have broke bank to keep Kevin Durant, but they didn't.  Pelican could have been stupid and gave into Demarcus Cousins long term max deal.  And then GSW could have been dumb in drafting during their lottery years."

But if great players somehow miss the notion that riding coat tails to win rings is the same as winning it by developing your team and not forming superteams and taking an easy path, thats on them, not the fans. Kevin Durant still has 0 rings, he doesnt belong anywhere near in the same sentence as the other GOATs. Even if Lebron formed superteams and broke parity in the east, he didnt break parity in the entire league."
"An objectively weird thing to assume about 2 men's emotions, especially when neither of them know you exist. I think insulting Kevin Durant has become this ""cute"" thing to the boys on this sub. Should get a new thing tho. That bad energy comes back every time."
Deep down you know Kevin Durant is a bitch and ruined your team's legacy. 
"Kevin Durant signed a two year max, not a discount. His last contract was 5 million less than a max. Your math sucks.  Klay is rumored to be taking everything from a vet min to a max, no one has any fucking clue.  Boogie ruptured his Achilles and wasn't getting much offered from anywhere. We don't know details, but I'd be amazed if the Pelicans offered more than 10. So I figure he took a slightly less than 5 million discount.  The Heatles signed six year long contracts, sacrificing earnings for over half a decade to chase rings. KD and Boogie sacrificed a few million for one year. So yeah, I'd day it's pretty similar. KD and Boogie each gave the Warriors a cheaper year, the Heatles gave the Heat a cheaper 6 years"
"No other league is as heavily star-centric as the NBA. There have been no nba championships in the modern era where the winning team did not have at least one all-star. Obviously the owners have to spend and the GMs have to satisfy fans, players, and ownership, but I’m sure most fans and owners will understand if their GM explained that it’s better to hold off spending on middle-level talent in a weak pool in favor of securing a huge talent in a better pool for roughly the same price. Take the warriors for an example, they managed their finances extremely well by refusing to dish out massive contracts to talent that wouldn’t put them over the edge (Kevin Love/Dwight Howard). Their only major expenses have been retaining existing players and and picking up Andre and Shaun (who was only 12M/3 when he signed). The patience of the ownership and the intelligence of the GM put them in a position to build a dynasty and then add Durant. You can’t really say that the league won’t be patient with money when the dominant team has done exactly that."
"[Woj] Kevin Durant is officially 7""3 with his new haircut, league sources tell ESPN."
"The Warriors are overrated in terms of legacy given how absurdly close they were to being one of the most underachieving teams of all time given their talent.   Their historical 73 win season was initially almost thwarted by the Thunder, who should have absolutely taken them out, but then dropped the ball when up 3-1.  They then lost in the finals after being up 3-1 to a significantly less talented team.    They had their asses saved by KD joining them, and then had crucial injuries in their favor to have easier victories.  While it was still early in the series and way too hard to tell how things would work out, the Warriors were getting obliterated by the Spurs until Kawhi was injured and out for the series.  They then nearly lost to a Rockets team with Cp3 out and a near unprecedented dry streak from the Rockets and some questionable calls.   This is a team with 4 All Stars (2 of whom are MVPs).  Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, the best 3 &amp; D player in the league, and arguably the best defender in the entire league.  Sure, you can argue that Iggy was injured, but a team as star studded as them should not be on the brink of getting knocked out by Harden, a 33 year old CP3, Capela, and a group of solid role players.   People have claimed that they are one of the best, if not the best team of all time, but the teams they have almost lost to or lost to are nowhere near that conversation.  The 2016 Thunder, 2016 Cavaliers, 2017 Spurs, and 2018 Rockets would never be mentioned in the same breath as the other elite teams (early 2000s Lakers and Spurs, Jordan Bulls, etc).  "
Kevin Durant for Offense. Kawhi Leonard for Defense. 
"Just a few of the many examples  LeBron James: 15.8 points, 7.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists on 36.9 percent shooting  Kevin Durant: 24.0 points and 2.0 rebounds on 33 percent shooting  Steph Curry: 17.4 points, 4.6 rebounds and 4.2 assists on 32.5 percent   Derrick Rose: 9.5 points, 5.5 assists and 2.0 rebounds on 29.4 percent "
"Which is still better than what Steph Curry shot in summer league (32.5%), the exact same as Kevin Durant (33%), and not much worse than LeBron (37%)"
"Kevin Durant, Delly, Lance"
"i dont think one comment with 500 upvotes represents the entire sub.  most of the sub was pissed when they signed demarcus cousins and kevin durant, yes. but that's no devean george"
"* Jerry West is a SG not a PG, put Isiah Thomas at 4 and Stockton at #3.  * Kevin Durant should be ahead of Hondo for SFs * Garnett is higher than Barkley. Higher peak and a championship * Kareem is #1 for Centers, then Wilt and Shaq are 2a/2b. "
"""I've had it with these motherfucking Kevin Durant on this motherfucking plane!"""
"Personally, I’d have an MVP clause, where MVP winners from the last 5 years give a cap hit no matter how cheap they try to sign, so Kevin Durant type team discounts don’t happen. The same with All-Star game appearances and All-NBA players but obviously on a smaller scale. There’s probably something in the CBA nuking my idea but that’s where I’d start. "
Kevin Durant. 
"Just gonna spam here again that he had his career-best season from mid-range his last year as a Knick, just a season removed from today. He'd also been 94th percentile on spot-ups, ranking above Klay Thompson and virtually tied with Kevin Durant. Last year was a crazy outlier that more than likely came down to the inconsistency of his role."
I like Kevin durant and defend his move to golden state

I like Kevin Durant
"&gt; Now when I say “isn’t great”, I mean more along the lines that he’ll never be a Lebron James, a Kevin Durant, a Curry or Harden.  That's a pretty high cutoff for ""great"". I happen to think he will get there (and pretty soon too) but I don't think it's an unpopular opinion to think he won't win an MVP.  Imo, he was already a borderline All-Star and borderline All-Defensive team player as a rookie/""rookie"". I think most people are too down on him by recency effect overblowing how bad his playoffs were (can't be bothered to look them up again but his averages are actually very respectable) because Mitchell was a beast and that one-point game is very memorable. I would bet against him ever becoming an average shooter, but I happen to think he can be an MVP-caliber player regardless; he's historically good either in his position or for any position in almost every other facet of the game. To me, he blows Ingram out of the water in almost everything but shooting (which, to be clear, I don't mean to discount; it's an extremely important skill)."
Kevin Durant 
"this is why i always laugh about the ""the warriors front office is just better, everyone else needs to step their game up"" comments.  i can imagine an interview of bob myers:  Q:  so tell me bob, your front office is known for being ahead, some would say light years, of the competition.  for example, the kevin durant signing.  tell us again, how you identified such a talent?  Bob:  well, he was the 2nd best player in the league and a free agent, so we signed him.  Q:  but certainly, the cap machinations must have been unreal.  Bob:  no, the league just told us one day we have like 24 extra million to sign guys with.  Q:  but even so, you couldn't have just spent crazily beforehand.  for example, andre iguodala, i imagine you got him on a great deal?  Bob:  nah, we gave him $12M a year.  Q:  to come off the bench?  Bob:  yeah, why not?  Q:  but andrew bogut.  the aussie.  tell me what sweetheart deal he took just to be on a winner?  Bob:  14 million a year.  Q:  14 mi...14 million?  but he didn't even play the ends of games.  barely even played against certain matchups.  Bob:  yeah, i know, crazy stuff.  Q:  but klay and dray, you had lined their contract extensions up perfectly ?  Bob:  nah, had already signed them to basically max deals.  Q:  but certainly, harrison barnes.  you had expertly anticipated kevin durant and kept your powder dry by not signing him the season before.  Bob:  oh no, i mean we tried.  offered him 16 million a year.  Q:  16!  million!  for harrison barnes?  Bob:  yeah, couldn't give it away.  Q:  okay, moving on, tell us about this boogie signing.  how did you clear the cap space for this one and convince joe lacob to taken on such an expensive player.  Bob:  funny story, he signed for only 5 million.  Q:  5 million?  wow.  so you had expertly scanned the free agent landscape and seen he was getting no other offers and made your move?  Bob:  scanned the free agent landscape?  huh?  what do you think gm's do all day.  Q:  well i mean i thought that was exactly what th...  Bob:  amateurs like danny ainge and daryl morey scan the free agent landscape!  we were trying to talk to someone else, he just called us.  Q:  called you, to take below market value?  Bob:  yeah, in real hysterics, too.  ""mr. myers, mr. kerr, please let me on the team.  please give me a roster spot.  i suck yo dick for a roster spot.""  his agent came on the line and told us that wouldn't do and he actually needed the MLE, but still, pretty crazy stuff.  Q:  but certainly Bob, you've made other great moves.  ian clark?  Bob:  standard role player, let him go.  Q:  patrick mccaw.  Bob:  meh  Q:  javale mcgee certainly.  Bob:  played 3 total minutes in our biggest series.  Q:  come on, help me out here Bob!  drafting steph curry!  Bob:  wasn't the gm.  Q:  klay thompson.  Bob:  also the other guy.  Q:  draymond green?  Bob:  hey, we found one!"
"There's tons of 1 and done players these days that come in 6 months after graduating high school and dominate division 1.   Look at Trae Youg this past year.  Then look at Kevin Durant, John Wall, Derrick Rose, Anthony Davis, Michael Beasley, Blake Griffin, etc.  The better high school teams with Division 1 talent would beat the best WNBA teams in my opinion."
Kevin Wayne Durant 
"Just too much talent in the West though for Ingram to make it, even with a big jump in talent  **BACKCOURT:**  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  James Harden  Klay Thompson  Damian Lillard  CJ McCollum  Russell Westbrook  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Mike Conley Jr  **FRONTCOURT:**  Kevin Durant  LeBron James  Draymond Green  Jimmy Butler  Karl-Anthony Towns  Nikola Jokic  Anthony Davis  Rudy Gobert  DeAndre Jordan  Paul George  Kawhi Leonard, maybe  ..  And those are just some names that are absolutely above Ingram in the pecking order for an All Star appearance. Hell, there's 21 names there... almost half of this list won't make it either."
You forgot 2019:  Klay Thompson  Kevin Durant  Steph Curry  Draymond Green  Demarcus Nephews
It’s acceptable if the sentence is “Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant played in the NBA”
"And then we have Harrison Barnes, the rich man's Kevin Durant "
"Nah we gave them a hard time mostly because they’re a bunch of little dudes and their bigs were by far their worst players. Bogut, Zaza, Javale, Ezeli. None of those guys had the talent to stop Z-Bo and Gasol. Draymond’s too little, Gasol just scored over him, Warriors rolled out dudes like Barnes or Looney on Z-Bo for a few possessions and he’d immediately score back to back buckets in the paint. The way to beat the Warriors for us was skilled size mixed with our gritty defense. I don’t know if that’s still the case for any team with or without DMC, guess we’ll see how Embiid and AD do vs them this year. The worst part is we still have a losing record vs the Warriors, we just lost a little bit less than other teams. Fuckin’ Kevin Durant."
That Kevin Durant guy. Turns out he can’t even bench 185
"Bruno Caboclo.. ""Brazilian Kevin Durant"" my ass"
" East   * Kyrie Irving   * Demar Derozan   * Joel Embiid   * Giannis Antetokounmpo   * Bradley Beal   * Kevin Love   * Al Horford   * Kyle Lowry   * Victor Oladipo   * John Wall   * Ben Simmons   * Jayson Tatum   Contenders/Fringe: Kris Middleton, Andre Drummond, Goran Dragic, Kemba Walker  West   * Stephen Curry   * James Harden   * Lebron James   * Kevin Durant   * Anthony Davis   * Russell Westbrook   * Damian Lillard   * Draymond Green   * Karl-Anthony Towns   * Klay Thompson   * Jimmy Butler   * Paul George   Contenders/Fringe: Donovan Mitchell, Demarcus Cousins, Lamarcus Aldridge, Nikola Jokic, Devin Booker, Kawhi Leonard?   This is what I've come up with so far. I want to put Donovan Mitchell in, but I'm not sure who to take out. Maybe one or two of Green/Towns/Thompson/Butler/George"
"The polarizing part is that 20 mil a year is Steph Curry money. It's Lebron James money. Kevin Durant money. It's what you pay perennial All NBA players and MVP candidates. Not dunk contest champs.  Zach Lavine was once part of a Wolves squad everyone called ""spooky,"" but after an ACL tear and being moved to a terrible Bulls squad, I don't think we will ever see anything great out of him."
Am I wrong to think that if Ingram reaches his potential he's basically Kevin Durant?
KEVIN DURANT
Kevin Durant. Fucking no good Snek. 
Which team would Kevin Durant join in the East?
"Tough, cuz last two years the best two players on a championship team were Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. How many down the list till we get to Zach Lavine?"
Does OKC have a Kevin Durant day? 
"Top 10: MJ, LBJ, KAJ, Bird, Magic, Shaq, Duncan, Hakeem, Wilt, Russell  Top 10-15: Kobe, Oscar, Jerry West, Malone, Dirk or KG  Top 15-20: KG or Dirk, Kevin Durant, Dr. J, Dwayne Wade, Charles Barkley  Top 20-25: Steph Curry, David Robinson, Scottie Pippen, John Stockton, Isiah Thomas  I have a hard time putting anyone in the 20-25 range above Wade, maybe Steph or David Robinson"
Bruv. You called him cp loser 3. You’re refusing to see life decisions and basketball decisions. Chris Paul and Kevin Durant are not at the same place in life. Chris Paul did t have the opportunity to sign with a Warriors type team in his prime. His trade to LA was vetoed through no decision of his own... like life is what it is. There’s no reason to hate on him. We all know the Warriors are the better team. 
Lebron is best when he is on the basketball court. Steph is best. James Harden is best in isolation. Kevin Durant is best when shooting a jumper over a smaller defender. Westbrook is best when he has been abandoned by his friend. Chris Paul is best in the regular season. Anthony Davis is best idk when
"The league will threaten Kevin Durant behind the scenes to get him to leave Golden State. After an entire summer of hearing that they only won because of KD, the Warriors will come out with a massive chip on their shoulder and win 74 games. A lockout will follow."
Kevin Durant won 2 titles and FMVP after leaving so there's a strong example /s
"What day is Kevin Durant, Steven Adams, and Serge Ibaka day? We know October 27 is James Harden Day but those other guys deserve a day too."
"Durant has a guaranteed ring for doing that. He’s also much younger than CP. Also everyone isn’t Durant. Also lmao! You can’t possibly tell me Durant has more fun in life than CP3. You don’t know them. Steph had a cheap contract because of his ankles, not cause he took a cut out of kindness. Draymond and Klay aren’t up for renewal, let’s see what happens now. And no cp3 did not take that money, the Rockets could’ve offered that 15 mill, but chose not to, they had Bird rights.   But just for fun, let’s examine the claim that’s Durant has more fun in life than Chris Paul.  -Durant: Admitted to being extremely lonely and scared nobody will love him. He’s scared of dying alone and makes a bunch of alt twitter accounts to defend himself. He’s still an amazing successful person and all don’t get me wrong. Kevin Durant is a stand up human. Kevin Durant may also have cheated on his fiancé or something, but he never sealed the deal, and he sometimes regrets it, his words.   Chris Paul- Has a wife and kids. Very loyal family. Does as much work for the community as Durant. Yes he doesn’t have a ring, but he’s not making fake Twitter and shit. "

"I've watched Melo for most of his career. He's always been one of the best offensive talents, but that's all he does. To simplify things, he was basically a less efficient version of OKC Kevin Durant. FWIW, he never made All-NBA 1st team"
"Payroll doesn't equate to talent, or team strength, especially when you're dealing with a corrupt franchise in Cleveland, and an aging one in Miami.  2012: Vegas favored the Thunder in the series. I think it's really close and would say a draw. Also using bballref's team rating system (SRS), Thunder's SRS=6.44, Heat's SRS=5.72  2013: Wade and Bosh both fall off significantly. Bosh was averaging 12/7/1 while Wade was averaging 16/4/5. Russ meanwhile is putting up 24/7/7 and Serge had 13/8/1 with 3 blocks per game. Also had Kevin Martin coming off the bench in the running for 6MOY. Thunder SRS rating= 9.15, Heat=7.03  2014: Wade and Bosh continue to fall off. Westbrook arguably outperformed KD during the playoffs. Serge Ibacka is notably better than Bosh on defense and now slightly outmatches him on offense. Thunder SRS=6.66, Heat=4.15  2015: Durant is injured for most of the season. Team still puts up 45-37 record. Not sure how to evaluate the thunder's side seeing as how Durant didn't play, but I guess I'll count this as a tie. Cavs would've prob won if Love and Kyrie didn't get injured. Also not sure why Durant would benefit in this comparison for getting injured.  2016: Thunder SRS= 7.09, Cavs=5.45. I see this as pretty close match. Still favor the Thunder since they were handing it to the Warriors with a full health roster. Love was also horrible during this run. KD posted a 0.8 Assist/TO ratio in the series against the Warriors, while Westbrook was at 2.6 Assist/TO  2017: 11.35 vs 2.87  2018: 5.79 vs 0.59  Other than 2012, Durant has had the superior team. Russ being injured in 2013 counteracts the Love/Kyrie injuries. The reason why the ""teammates excuse"" has started to kick into action for Lebron is because Durant never faced this degree of lopsided competition. Even if you think the Thunder were worse in 2012, there was nowhere near the disparity there has been the last 2 years between Cavs and Heat. Inb4 you compare the teams by counting all-stars, there's more to it than that."
"They predicted Kevin Durant staying in okc too. They did predict correctly that it was draymond trying to recruit KD, but incorrectly that KD would kick him in the balls instead. "
"KD has taken ownership of who he is and the decision he made. Whatever is going on with Kawhi, and I truly believe hs is being manipulated and given terrible advice, he is a grown ass man. He has been complicit with a series of deceitful manipulating bitch moves, and refuses to directly address concerns and criticism or answer questions. And again, all of that would be fine and dandy if it were his time to make an open decision and he were a free agent, but he is not.   KD's move was a grown ass man move. He made his decision, went with it, and is living with the consequences of it. He has also won two Finals and Finals MVP's since, so he definitely made the most of it. At the time he made his decision he didn't owe anything to anyone. I also have listened to countless interviews with him and have never heard him say he feels like he should be personally respected for his decision, but that people should have respected that it was his decision to make and he had the right to choose to go wherever he wanted for whatever reason. It's not like he wanted the people in OKC to still root for him, but the way people have reacted has been completely fucking over the top. If you paid attention to the things he said you would hear the same thing. Something tells me you don't follow the whole story though since you didn't know that the NBA and PA have already adressed The Durant situation with the CBA they negotiated after he signed with The Warriors. There is going to be a lockout, and it will either end with a hard cap or abolishing the cap and luxury tax altogether, but it will have very little to do with Kevin Durant."
Warriors have gone to 4 straight finals and won 3 for a reason.  Yes Kevin Durant is a bitch and joined the Warriors but if they ran an anemic isolation offense they would not be anywhere near as dominant.
"&gt;Getting Kevin Durant would make this all worth it  uhh, why even mention this unless its a guarantee. ""Dude, keeping Kuzma and him making all NBA 1st team makes this all worth it!!""  OK?  &gt;Cap is projected at $109M?  All three years?  &gt;That is a terrible way to evaluate stretching a player    oh the irony.  Your entire trade is terrible analysis.  And again, Id rather pay the extra $6m to keep a Kuzma in the fold for those three years and beyond.  Not to mention, there are other ways to unload his contract.  You can complain all you want and poo poo anything that pokes large holes in your horrible trade scenario...doesnt make it ""terrible.""  Your hanging onto your argument at all costs is what's ""terrible"" here.  People massively downvoted this and are telling you how much this doesnt work yet you got it right. lol "
"No, i am defending Melo who gets too much hate from his performance in OKC.  No, westbrook can not get his team anywhere without Kevin Durant. Hes no different than Melo in that regard.  Melo is not a superstar, never was one or was never on par as a great player like kobe or Lebron, but it is ridiculous to say that this guy is a bench player or is washed up when he can definitely succeed in the right circumstances as his game is not predicated on athleticism and has put up hefty scoring numbers in the past.

A heel to surpass Kevin Durant.
Literally the top google search result   https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/early-lead/wp/2016/07/07/kevin-durant-says-joining-warriors-super-team-is-the-hardest-road/
Kevin Durant alt account ^
"Not sure if you’re being serious or just didn’t read the article, but KD literally said his measurements were recorded at 6’10.75 and 7’0 with shoes. He’s referring to the recorded measurements at the combine. It’s not that he was “still growing”. It’s common NBA knowledge that KD was NOT 6’9 when he entered the league.  If you still don’t believe me, here is a picture of young KD next to 7 footer greg oden. There’s an inch tops between them.  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2016/11/14/13622854/kevin-durant-greg-oden-nonsense-biggest-bust-nba-history-2007-draft?source=images"
&gt; This guarantees Kevin Durant? What?  Never said that?  &gt;cap is north of $110m  Cap is projected at $109M?  &gt;Look at it this way: just add that $6m to whomever's salary we get to keep  That is a terrible way to evaluate stretching a player 
"You mean the same nba combine that measured KD at 6’9 without shoes and 6’10 with shoes?  https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/nba-predraft-camp-durant-far-from-finished-product/  But he was later quoted as saying he was actually measured at 6’10.75 without shoes and 7’0 with shoes. So his measurements were misreported. We have no idea how often players are incorrectly listed as taller/shorter than they are, but we know it happens. Here’s the article he is quoted in:  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/amp/   "
They absolutely would.   1.) The lack of floor spacing would be cancerous.    2.) A pair of 6-3 Russell Westbrooks guarding Kevin Durant on a ball screen?   3.) Barely 200 lb Russell Westbrook defending Boogie Cousins on the post up?
"Youre making a lot of assumptions there in order to push your argument. This guarantees Kevin Durant? What?  And $6m a season for three years when the cap is north of $110m, with two max contracts as well as keeping Kuzma or Lonzo or Ingram is a very small price to pay.  Look at it this way: just add that $6m to whomever's salary we get to keep. Im Ok with that"
CP3 and Harden are the best  People forget curry and Klay have two other all stars on their team and that includes Kevin F-ing Durant.
"&gt;Here's your problem...because we can still have room for a max contract simply by stretching Deng (hell, we'll be close even without stretching him) there's no desperate need to trade Deng away so why would we trade a huge asset to do it?  But no team **wants** to stretch a contract. Look at the PR nightmare of Detroit stretching Josh Smith's contract! They are **STILL** paying it off.  Getting Kevin Durant would make this *all* worth it"
"&gt;  Lakers basically trade away the chance to get Kawhi   So you didn't read OP or you didn't understand the finances. If the latter, let me know and I can explain how the Lakers *created* more cap space. The Lakers can offer Kawhi (or Kevin Durant/Jimmy Butler) the max next year  &gt;You're also expecting us to be a bottom 5 team to get reddish, and that's not happening  Well *IF* this trade went through and you lost the vet presence of Lopez and Holiday, I think you'd agree the Bulls would be bad.  Regardless of the trade, the Bulls will have a *similar* pick to this year.   &gt;we trade away a great bench piece   but what is his future in Chicago? Would you be willing to keep Portis if he demands $10-15M a year? What if that effects getting Davis in 2020?     "
"Kawhi sure, but as I mentioned in the post, you go into 2019 with almost $40M in cap space  Kevin Durant's max next year is projected at $39M  Durant and James ~~made sweet love~~ filmed a commercial in LAL and could team up on the court!"
Kevin Durant? He was pretty well liked and not that loud before the golden state move.

"Kevin ""snake ass coward"" Durant"
"Kevin ""cupcake"" Durant."
"IMO there is a difference between following a player and bandwagonning. Bandwagonning is when you just support the best team in the league continuously. If you are just a fan of Steph Curry, or even a follower of Kevin Durant, and that's why you support the Warriors, I think that's fine, as long as you continue to support that player. But if you for instance not care about the Cavs during LeBron's first stint and then jump on the Miami Big 3 bandwagon, I think that's lame."
"everyone outside the bay area does not hate kevin durant, that is an insane thing to think  there's a wide world of people who don't circulate nba memes out there folks"
Because it's LeBron fucking James.   If Kawhi Leonard wants to play for the Lakers then he's going to play for the fucking Lakers.   If the Lakers want to sign Kevin Durant to a Max then they're going to sign KD to a fucking Max.   SUPER TEAM
"But look at the context of that situation. Lebron had never won anything in Cleveland, and left to go win with his superteam.   Can you imagine if Kevin Durant told like Steven Adams ""Hey sport, maybe someday if you play your card right, I'll grace you with my presence and you'll get to see a *real* winner in action""? /r/NBA would literally melt down."

PG: Shaun Livingston SG: Grayson Allen SF: Kevin Durant PF: Draymond Green C: DeMarcus Cousins  Really is the all T team lol
"&gt; the kind of player you THINK  It's a feeling. You move Kobe, Harden, LeBron, Durant, etc to lottery teams and there's a general feeling that that team would make the playoffs and possibly go to the second round or further without an additional superstar.  Kyrie is in another tier with players like Bosh and Kevin Love (prime Klove).  I guess to put it in other words it's the separation from All-star to Superstar. It's what Kyrie craves and still has to attain."
Steph Curry. Kevin Durant.
"I’ve worked around celebrities can share a story that makes a lot more sense to me reading this.  At the fine dining restaurant I worked at athletes were very common. Almost a daily occurrence between our local guys and out of town players. We were right across the street from the hotel that away teams stayed and our place was pretty swanky. One time I waited on Lowry and DeRozan in the lounge. They were watching whatever game was on, I believe it was a game Curry hit an insane 3 to take it to OT versus Durant and the Thunder. They were going WILD watching it and enjoying. I could definitely see the camaraderie, it was like they were best friends. Lots of guys come in alone or with a friend and it’s rare to see so clearly “oh these guys like each other.”  Anyways, one day I hear LeBron and crew is coming. We get CEOs and random team dinners frequently but this one was different, I could tell my boss felt the pressure more. We curtained a room off, let LeBrons personal security check out what was up, and then the Cavs came in the back. This was during the playoffs so i wasn’t sure what to expect. I didn’t get to wait on them or go in the room. One manager and two head servers were allowed in; his security was very serious about this although they were pretty chill dudes otherwise. I even gave one of them shit for wearing Under Armor shoes, asking if he was a big Steph fan. The night didn’t have much to it -they drank but not much, they watched another game in the room, they had their own speakers they brought in but made sure not to disturb the dining room, they tipped a standard amount. Tristan Thompson got stuck with the bill, “his turn,” which disappointed us because we wanted to see how heavy LeBrons credit card was. I made a joke that TT owed LeBron dinner for life for getting him paid but no one who worked there understood it.  The thing that stuck out to me was this - I watched the guys leave and while I recognized most of them I noticed Kyrie and Kevin weren’t there. Now at the time I questioned it. There was all this laughing and camaraderie. It was the playoffs, why weren’t the other two big names there? Maybe they’re usually there but something came up, I thought.  These are busy guys, agents, managers, sometimes dudes have family dinners, who knows.  Still, part of me thought it didn’t bode well.  When Cleveland beat Golden State a month later I laughed at myself for questioning their team unity. Now a couple years later it makes me wonder again. What was really going on behind that literal curtain? I doubt we’ll ever get the full story but it’s interesting to think about."

LeBron's FG% in summer league: 37%  Kevin Durant: 33%  Drose: 29%  Curry: 32.5%  Summer League don't mean shit. http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/list/summer-league-kobe-duncan-lebron-carmelo-wade-harden-durant/m92okbs4wif41b76qzo3zsy2m/slide/11 
"I don't think people paid like crazy because of Mozgov.  It was purely the result of the available cap space and the belief the cap would continue to rise considerably.  It's not like there were a ton of centers who got Mozgov like contracts, sort of the opposite.  Mozgov signed a huge contract early one in the offseason, but as the offseason went it, it became really clear that the center market didn't justify the salary.  If Kevin Durant decided to take a 1 year minimum contract that year, it's not like all of a sudden everyone would have gotten lower salaries.  It just would've meant the Warriors had another max slot available and gotten another player at or around that amount."
"pop telling aldridge ""get me a talent like kevin durant and i'll drive you to the airport"" really sums up our FO's attitude toward this kind of thing"
"You're seeing it with Kevin Durant. They just focused on different aspects of the game because of their time. Fresh out of high school, these two had basically the same raw potential. "
How did ingram look this year tho? I actually didn’t watch much lakers at all. I had a lot of friends who were sworn in on wanting Ingram over Simmons that year cause ben couldn’t #1 shoot and #2 wasn’t in the March madness.  His rookie year made the sixers look a genius (idk if it was ever really a discussion for the staff ) but Ingram does look like he has all the tools to be a poor mans 🐍 (Kevin Durant )
"Kobe, LeBron, Sir Charles, Boogie, and Kevin Durant."
"EDD is the Kevin Durant of the WNBA.  Tall, can shoot from every spot on the floor both face up and posting up, famous for having a record high FT% (career 94% or something).  Solid defensive player as well.  She doesn't check all the boxes as far as accolades and achievements, and she forced a move to the Washington franchise so she could be closer to her family (there's some health issues and stuff she wanted to be closer to) which kinda threw the arc of her career off a bit(the Chicago Sky are now bad and the Mystics are now a contender so it ended up aight).  She doesn't have a title to claim, or really a great post-season reputation to stake her name on yet (partly because the W has a lot of 1-game knockouts and shorter series) - only one finals trip that ended in a 0-3 sweep for the other team.  But she's one of the Women's players you could absolutely see having a role in the NBA.  She's exceptionally good.  And if she continues to  put it together, and WAS continues it's solid build, she may have a legit shot at eventually having her name in GOAT conversation.  The WNBA is still very big centric though, most of the best players are PF/Cs, which is one of the reasons Dianna is so impressive.  She's been a KILLER for like 20 years playing the SG position."
"I really hope he leaves the Warriors some day, it was so fun to watch him on a good playoff team and not a legendary stacked team that's expected to win with or without him. Also Draymond Green has Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and Klay Thompson around him, how in the world has he not asked them for help improve his 3 point shot yet? Even today it still looks like he's shooting with a backpack on, his form is just hideous"
"Spurs powerhouse, Injured Love/Kyrie, Warriors+Durant powerhouse.....vs aging stockton and malone and scrubs and kemp/payton and scrubs, barkley and 2nd best player kevin johnson lolll"
"Team Kevin - Johnson, Martin, Durant, McHale, Garnett (sorry, Love). Team Chris - Paul, Duhon, Mullin, Webber, Bosh.  I also like Team Tim - Hardaway, Legler, Hardaway Jr., Thomas, Duncan.  Team Larry - Brown, Hughes, Nancy, Bird, Johnson  Team Jason would be fun just to watch Kidd, Williams and Terry on the court together.  Team Bob would certainly dominate the pre-merger era - Cousy, Dandridge, McAdoo, Pettit and Lanier.  Surprisingly, Team Rudy would do quite well - Fernandez, Tomjanovich, Gay, LaRusso and Gobert.  Alright, now I'm just wasting my own time."
"Skip: ""I only use facts here on this show.""  Also Skip: ""LeBron played harder than Kevin Durant four straight games."" ""LeBron had more pressure than any other player in history."""

You're just happy because Kevin Durant is no longer the ultimate snek.
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com/amphtml/sports/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/kevin-durant-sometimes-doesn-t-want-chuck-low-220357263--nba.html  &gt;Durant: It depends on what I’m shooting from the field. First quarter if I’m 4-for-4, I let it go. Third quarter if I’m like 10-for-16, or 10-for-17, I might let it go. But if I’m like 8-for-19, I’m going to go ahead and dribble one more second and let that buzzer go off and then throw it up there. So it depends on how the game’s going.”  &gt;First, the “selfish” tag.  &gt;When Durant says “it depends on how the game’s going,” he truly and technically is referring to his individual game on that night. To some this reeks of stat-padding, and needlessly obsessive stat-padding: NBA fans typically don’t freak out over shooting percentages on shots that players tend to take possibly once or twice a week; especially for someone like Durant who averages 19 shots per game on his career.  But yeah, it’s Russ that does this "
Kevin Durant is a bitch
Kevin Durant is a huuuuuge vagina
How dare you speak that way about the Brazilian Kevin Durant !
"Kevin Durant, he's a better player"
Kevin Durant was MVP in 2014
Kevin Durant game 3.
"Kevin Durant, I am positive that you're a bitch"
"Kevin Durant is a great......nope, I can't do it. Kevin's the worst."
"Nothing is going on friend, we are just discussing the many talents of Kevin Durant."
"Okay, you lost 3 out of 5 games against them in the playoffs and that's WITH KEVIN DURANT."
Just the finals. He only has the 2nd best TS% of 20 point scorers in the finals behind Kevin Durant.
""" While Kevin Durant may be the greatest scorer of all time ""     What? He's not even close to Jordan when it comes to scoring."
"Even moreso considering they had Kevin Durant as well.  The way I look at it they bet on Ibalka as the third (and arguably more complimentary) star.  They obviously lost that bet, but the situations are particularly overlapping."
Kevin Durant has burner accounts so he can defend himself online. All of these comments are probably him.
"He goes the Raptors, get the 3rd seed after struggling intially and having a late season run, beat the Celtics in 7 in the ECF on an Ibaka 3pter to seal the game in the final minute, lose the Warriors in 7 after choking away a 77-52 3rd quater lead in game 4 to go up 3-1, and then he joins the Warriors after KD goes to the Nets now that the Knicks have Kevin Knox who scares Durant away."
That agent's name?  Kevin Durant.
"Okay buddy. In your technical view no, a physical asterisk will never appear, but to say that KD's legacy isn't tainted or that he will ever be given any real credit for his *team* accolades is absurd naïveté and revisionist history. All people will remember is the debate about how he ruined the league - and whether or not you think he did that conversation and dialogue will persist for the remainder of time. History will not look fondly on Kevin Durant, a tremendous talent who had to ride the coat tails of a 73 win team to a championship. Who only got to be a Finals MVP because he surrounded himself with three All Stars and future Hall of Famers, two of whom are the best 3pt shooting tandem the league has ever seen.   KD will not be remembered kindly. "
"&gt; who couldn’t hit 3s when we needed him to  Ariza was a little busy guarding that Kevin Durant fellow, he's the last person I would blame for shooting considering it was 27 in a row at one point."
"But CP3 Harden and roleplayers were givin the Dick to Steph, Klay, Draymond and Kevin fuckin Durant until cp3 went down..   CP3 and Steph are close but Harden is on a whole other level of Klay.. Harden can carry a team to 60wins man"
"I hate to say it, but I wouldn't take a center first due to the current 3 point era we have now in the NBA. I would much rather take a pass first player or a high level scorer out the bat. So for this, my three options are Magic Johnson, Kevin Durant or as OP said Kobe, assuming they are all rookies when drafted and I can only take one.  Magic could be an immediate offensive beast in terms of being able to do everything outside of shoot consistently, as well as a solid defender. I believe his rookie season now would look like Ben Simmons' season except with a higher assist average. I'd let him run the ball as much as possible.  KD would fit into my high level scoring group. We've seen him slither into becoming a solid playmaker with the Warriors, so I would definitely develop that early on. KD is a career 20ppg scorer- I'd give him control of the ball from the start as a pseudo point forward.  Kobe starting out as a rookie would be a great place to build off and potentially put him with a dominant big man similar to Kobe/Shaq. Kobe developed into a 20ppg scorer his third season- giving the team a good couple of seasons to see how they can use him. Kobe averaged 8 points on 15 minutes his rookie season, I'd give him more minutes and start him more. "
An asset traded for by Scott Perry... the assistant general manager of the Seattle SuperSonics the year that Kevin Durant was drafted.
ok but so long as lebron james or kevin durant even EXIST he isnt even close to a REAL mvp 
"I’d take Kobe somewhere around 10th   Mj, Lebron, mj, bird, Kareem, Duncan, Shaq, Kevin Durant, curry"
"I am not Kevin Durant and am actually many beautiful women and it is true about my giant dick.  I had this conversation with my other beautiful friend about Kevin  “He got me,” My beautiful friend said of Kevin’s spooge over him. ""That f***ing Kevin boomed me.""  My beautiful friend added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times.  My beautiful friend then said he wanted to add Kevin to the list of players he “works out” with this summer."
Just putting some respect on the most benevolent and gifted basketball player to ever grace the court (Kevin Durant)
"I saw Kevin Durant at a pet store in the Bay Area yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “hiss? hiss? hiss?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen mice in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be asleep since it wasn't 8:30 yet, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the mice and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any competitive infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each mouse and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by saying Yo Google really loudly."
Kevin Durant is the greatest Hooper he also has tons of hot babes. Kevin Durant is the coolest and I have really nice clothes too.
"Let me tell you about the time I met KD.  I saw Kevin Durant at a grocery store in San Francisco yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.  He said, “I'm not Kevin Durant.”  I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and waiving his championship ring in front of my face.  I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Ring Pops in his hands without paying.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Mr. Durant, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be someone else, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each Ring Pop and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by saying ""gorillas don't do that."""
Kyrie - Kevin Durant - Jimmy Butler - Kevin Knox - Kristaps Porzingis is the dream
I wish I was as cool as KD.  I've met Kevin Durant a bunch of times and he's the chillest dude ever and he really hoops.
&gt; Don't worry about what a bunch of teenagers and Kevin Durant accounts think of you.  ....and possibly your teams GM trying to get to you through his sock puppet accounts.   To which every head coach in the league probably responded by ordering one of his assistants to go to the store and buy a couple of cases of sock puppets and a reddit so he can send messages too. Really. 
"Listen, Kevin Durant does not suck at Fortnite.  Kevin Durant's great at everything and he's got a giant dick.  "
"Kevin Durant is a great NBA player and was very brave to leave the Thunder and go to the Warriors, find a new slant. "
"Well the reason indy can't be too mad, is because they got something back for him.  Do you think okc would've been even close to as mad if we got to trade Kevin Durant? Even if we traded him to the warriors we wouldve gotten something great back and been chill with it.   But he left us for nothing and fucked us hard.   PG was straight up with the organization and both teams got something valuable, the definition of win-win. "
"And get off reddit, it's not good for you. Don't worry about what a bunch of teenagers and Kevin Durant accounts think of you.       Except for you Robert Williams, get your shit together"
Kevin Durant was actually selected before Kevin Garnett even got in the candidates list? OK.
And Kevin Durant is a good role model for all the sneks who need to learn how to use burner accounts and get into fights in instagram dms
"Kevin Durant left in free agency, like hundreds of other players have done. Where he went was lame, but you guys didn’t get burned any worse than Cleveland did when LeBron left, Hayward left Utah, etc.  PG, while publicly telling people he wanted to play in Indiana, had his camp leak that he wanted to play for the Lakers and that he wanted the Pacers to trade him. By insisting he would end up in LA, and going so far as to get Magic fined for tampering, he yanked his trade value. Just because we ended up winning the trade in the long run, and that he ended up staying with you guys, doesn’t change the fact that the way he forced his way out was pretty terrible."
"🙄🙄  Kevin Durant left his team with nothing then had burner accounts shitting on said team. Kyrie threatened to get a season ending surgery and stopped talking to teammates. Kawhi is refusing to play his last year and literally hid from the Spurs people. But Paul asking for a trade that eventually got leaked is snake behavior.  I'll take that kind of ""snake"" any day. "
One Kevin Durant at a time*  Sorry that was petty.
What about kevin durant? 
Warriors resigning Kevin Durant.
"I get what you saying but if you ask people in 2013, who would be the first unanimous MVP how many people would say Steph Curry? His team was in the six seed twice and he was having ankle problems. If Kevin Durant, Lebron James, CP3 and etc. would of done it, it would be less of a surprise. "
&gt; Probably shouldn’t refer to Kris Dunn as KD  Thanks you....I was thinking - why is everyone just letting OP assume they'll get Kevin Durant and not calling him out on that?  
"He's like 16, how did you expect he would react to fucking Kevin Durant dming him"
I glanced into the store at the mall one time and saw Kevin Durant shopping at Hot Topic
Don't let Golden State Warriors blowing a 3-1 lead make you forget Kevin Durant blew a 3-1 lead to the Warriors who blew the 3-1 lead in the NBA finals 
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there. Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy."" My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."
"&gt; Embiid probably goes #1 without injuries, #2 ahead of Parker at worst It's not all ""bad luck"" if his career ends up being short and injury plagued.  Sure. But if Embiid goes #1, and they draft Wiggins instead, they probably do a little better in 2014-15, and maybe they slip a spot in the draft...and take Porzingis. We can play that game all day. The point of the Process was to maximize the number of *opportunities* to land a potential superstar, based on the understanding that the chances of any given player developing into a superstar are low. That's what sets it apart from teams that just got lucky with picks.   &gt; Too early to tell on ""realistic championship upside"", they got demolished by Boston who didn't have its complete team. Without improvements, they don't really have a Championship Upside. They realistically need to add a big free agent.  You really think a team whose two best players were a rookie and a guy playing his first full season isn't going to improve? Anyone thinking the Boston series loss in any way reflected Philly's ceiling is fooling themselves. Simmons and Embiid are the best rookie-sophomore combo since Westbrook and Durant.   &gt; No, Golden State rebuilt better than everyone else and they did it with two 7ths and an 11th pick as well as the steal of the decade in the second round  Golden State also got *incredibly* lucky at practically every turn. Curry's early ankle injuries had no impact on the team's longterm success (in fact, it kept them in the cellar long enough to nab Klay Thompson and Harrison Barnes) and led him to sign a hilariously cheap extension that made their subsequent cap gymnastics possible. They had to be talked out of trading Klay for Kevin Love. They lucked into Draymond (remember, they passed on him in the first round just like everybody else) and didn't realize what they had until David Lee's training camp injury forced Steve Kerr to start him. Klay and Draymond both gave discounts on their extensions. It just so happened that the cap spike coincided with KD's free agency, and this summer the cap crunch handed them DeMarcus Cousins on a silver platter.   *That* method of team-building is not replicable. ""Hey, just draft the two best shooters of all time with mid-lottery picks and stumble into one of the best defensive players of his generation in the second round, then hope for a historic cap spike to coincide with the second best player in the world's free agency."" Sure.   &gt; And it seems a bit inconsistent of you to cite Boston (who rebuilt better than the 76ers and only missed the Playoffs once, without needing to lose 72 games) as not counting because of a lopsided trade but upthread talk about fleecing teams in trades as part of the ""Process"".  Because the trades were not comparable. Boston took advantage of Billy King losing his mind in order to jump-start their own rebuild. Philly rented out its cap space for assets because they didn't care about building a winning team at that point in time. The ""rent your cap space for assets"" strategy is commonplace today and will remain commonplace for the foreseeable future. The Boston-Nets trade was a once-in-a-generation fuckup.   &gt; When the 76ers are winning rings we can say they ""rebuilt better than everyone."" Right now of the teams that were rebuilding at the same team, Boston on the fly looks way ahead and I'd take the Lakers ahead of them as well. Philadelphia is a bit closer to Milwaukee who took Boston to 7 and has a real coach now than they are Boston.  There's so much wrong in there I don't even know what to say. The Lakers, really? The guys who have to go through murderer's row just to make it out of the first round? The guys with one, 33-year-old superstar? They bumbled around for four years until LeBron fell into their laps. That's not a sustainable rebuilding strategy; that's dumb luck and the allure of Los Angeles. And Milwaukee? They have one superstar and they've already pissed him off, plus they're capped out with no realistic avenues for substantial roster improvement. Philly, in contrast, has what looks to be two superstars, plus whatever Fultz becomes, a host of talented young role players on rookie contracts, and max cap space next summer.   &gt; The Spurs have never in their history missed the Playoffs in consecutive seasons and won 5 rings from 1999-2014.  Yes, and that's what Philly can hope for over the next 15 years because of the foundation Hinkie built. "
"Kevin Durant makes it look too easy, he may be a snake, but, he's a snake God"
Kevin Durant. He's destroyed LeBron the last couple years.

"Because people don't watch the NCAA for the player. They watch for the school. No one gives a fuck about some freshman phenom no one has ever heard of until the first game of the season. They care about the program that has decades of success and rivalries. Having players leave after one year inhibits those programs' ability to continue making rivalries and long periods of sustained success. The NCAA was more popular before the one-and-done rule because of that. Players like Tim Duncan, MJ, Patrick Ewing, The Man of Steal, Christian Laetnner, etc. all left prolonged and eternal impacts on the NCAA. No one remembers or cares about Anthony Davis or Kevin Durant or Ben Simmons' college careers because they were there for a year and left before anyone could even form an opinion."
"He either played with him or he didnt.  Its impossible to ""nearly"" play with someone lol.  Thats like saying Kevin Durant, Lebron , Paul George, Chris Paul , Carmelo, and Boogie Cousins NEARLY played together in LA this year."
Kevin Durant 
"I’m a big fan of player mobility and I think players should be able to go just about wherever they want, I don’t like the idea of players being forced to play with teams just because they offer more. Kevin Durant could have signed with anyone other than GS or Cleveland or San Antonio and the last couple years would have been fine. Even now let’s say GSW never signed Kevin Durant but now they sign DeMarcus Cousins, there would have been people upset, but with his injury and attitude problems we still would be far from the preordained season we’re looking at now. Kevin Durant fucked up everything for everyone and the sports world is letting him off the hook by not calling him out at every opportunity."
In a 7 game series it’s gonna be hard for OKC to win given that as soon as the go down a game Kevin Durant is gonna switch teams.
"That’s the only way things will change. The ratings tank and people blame Kevin Durant and Demarcus cousins for sacrificing everyone else’s money so that they can win.  It’s blatant selfishness and I hope they pay for it. Remember it’s less money to the players but the superstars won’t be impacted as severely because of max contracts, role players will and hopefully they come out strongly against this ring chasing. "
The Cavaliers win a championship before Kevin Durant does.
Kevin Durant plays on the Warriors. *Hissss*
Kevin Durant.  I love his game but I miss the ball movement and verve of the Warriors team that predates him.  
"You can't compare 2003-2004 Lakers and the 2018-2019 Warriors. Lakers where older, less talented and had Malone injured in the finals. Pretty much everyone in the Warriors is in their prime.  2018-2019  Warriors:  - Steph Curry - 30 - Klay Thompson - 28 - Kevin Durant - 29 - Draymond Green - 27 - Demarcus Cousins  - 27  2003-2004 Lakers  - Gary Payton - 35 - Kobe Bryant - 25 - Devean George - 26 - Karl Malone (injured) - 40  - Shaquille O'Neal - 31 "
"Obligatory reminder that Brandon Roy, LaMarcus Aldridge and Kevin Durant could have been a 70 win team. "
Here's PER's top 20 list for this season:  1.	James Harden • HOU	29.8 2.	Anthony Davis • NOP	28.9 3.	LeBron James • CLE	28.6 4.	Stephen Curry • GSW	28.2 5.	Giannis Antetokounmpo • MIL	27.3 6.

Or Brandon Roy with Kevin Durant.
Darn it.  I *knew* we only had to win 73 games in order to sign Kevin Durant.  Doc out.
"I don’t think he is going to get worse, but I also don’t think he’s going to magically turn into Kevin Durant "
Disagree. Durant was a [defensive force](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/05/23/kevin-durant-defense-warriors-thunder-nba-playoffs) at the 4 and 5 against the Warriors in that 2016 playoff series.
"I mean, Michael Jordan at best would make the all-star team in this era  MJ hasn’t faced any of these ballers in his era: •LeBron James •Kevin Durant •Steph Curry •Kawhi Leonard •Giannis Antetokounmpo •Kyrie Irving •Anthony Davis •Kristaps Porzingis •James Harden •Russell Westbrook •Chris Paul •Paul George •Damian Lillard •Klay Thompson *etc.  Also, Steve Kerr told a reporter during the finals that he himself wouldn’t stand a chance in today’s basketball ~&gt; that says a lot because Steve Kerr was a key piece to the 95-96 Bulls who were known as the best team in history before the Warriors took the NBA by storm  That’s my 2 cents, this 1’s for free "
I present you one Kevin Durant! 
The line between genius and incompetence is a lot thinner than most people think.  If the Bucks had taken Curry instead of Ellis we're not talking about any of this and the genius Warriors would have traded the future best player in their franchise history for broken down Andrew Bogut.  It also doesn't really take a basketball mastermind to realize that signing Kevin Durant is a good idea.
If only every other team had the bright idea to sign Kevin Durant and Demarcus Cousins. Warriors are truly light years ahead.
"I'm not sure it's quite that simple:  [There was a great article back in May by Marc Stein about Jerry West - ""Jerry West Just Wants to Feel Wanted](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/sports/basketball/jerry-west-just-wants-to-feel-wanted.html)  &gt;Before the Clippers called, West’s six seasons in a similar advisory role with the Warriors were undeniably fruitful, featuring two championships, a record 73-win season and the successful free-agent recruitment of Kevin Durant. But for all of his achievements and longevity, West still needs to feel needed, say those who know him best.  &gt;And he couldn’t help but wonder: Did the Warriors, whose then-new ownership group so badly needed the credibility boost West provided upon arrival in May 2011, still need him after the team’s president of basketball operations, Bob Myers, had become so adept in assembling a starry, and successful, roster?  .  &gt;The longtime Sports Illustrated writer Jack McCallum reported in his 2017 book “Golden Days” that West, partly because of Myers’ rise in stature, was asked to take a reduction in compensation to stay.  &gt;But money was only one factor in West’s exit. No matter how hard Warriors officials tried to convince him, publicly and privately, that his input remained vital to their collaborative approach to decision-making, West felt his influence was fading.  &gt;“You have to be wanted,” West said  .  &gt;“His mood is so determined by work,” said his son Jonnie West, an executive with the Warriors who, along with his older brother Ryan West of the Lakers, followed his father into front-office life. “I think he really enjoys the situation he’s in. It gives him a puzzle that needs figuring out.”  .  &gt;Said West: “Leaving the Warriors was probably the most difficult thing for me in my whole life. I didn’t want to leave. You get to the point where maybe you don’t feel as valued, but it’s just something that happened. I hold no malice toward anyone over there.  &gt;“It did not end the way I wanted it to, that’s for sure. But this is a perfect role for me. People ask me my opinion, and I’m going to give it to them.”  From that perspective, it's not hard to see that he wanted to come back to the Lakers given that they could be a challenge for him to work on again and are THE team that he is most known for (besides maybe Jack Cooke or Jerry Buss, Jerry West is the all-time greatest Laker when you look at his influence in basically every post-Mikan Lakers era barring the 08-10 championships). Yet despite those ties, he was rejected, and if that idea of ""wanting to feel wanted"" is as important as he discusses, where he wants to be somewhere where he can actually work and have some voice and, again, feel wanted, then yeah, I can totally imagine that hurting to some extent.  But I'm not sure if Jerry West's comments about the Lakers since joining the Clippers are really out of saltiness or because of that sting. The dude is competitive as hell, as is the owner he works with, and the Clippers are in the same town as the Lakers. Any competitive person in the Clippers FO would be sorta like this.    "

"Because Kevin Durant is literally unguardable, James Harden/Kyrie are fucking insane, and Steph Curry has limitless range w/ one of the quickest, most effective shots ever.   Edit: Also, not everyone guards the same players.   Edit 2: Alright, fine.   Because of physical differences between players (height/strength/lateral quickness, etc.) different people struggle more against different players. The players I chose above are all extremely difficult to guard but different in their what makes them effective, so players that ""struggle"" more against Kyrie's best attributes (Handling, quickness) but are taller and stronger, might think Kyrie is more tough on a one to one basis than other elite scorers.   This is entirely subjective to the player answering the question because their experiences are different. Jalen Rose might have given you a different answer than Kobe, but after Kobe dropped 81 with Jalen as the primary defender, and he gets reminded of that  occasionally, he might remember that one particular moment has the worst he ever performed defensively, or at least the most helpless he's been and how futile his efforts were.   Isaiah Thomas dropped almost 30 ppg two years ago and I don't remember anyone talking about how he was the toughest player to guard. It's just a matter of perspective from the individual defender's viewpoint. "

"Kevin Durant, because of my two finals MVPs."
"Agreed, Westbrook was never holding KD back but how many times has Westbrick made it out of the first round of the playoffs without KD? People love to hate KD and deny that he was the best player on the warriors during the playoffs full stop. He didn't get handed shit he earned every bit of that trophy and carried us through a lot of games they would not have won without Kevin Durant. At least respect the guy for being good at basketball regardless of your thoughts on his personality dog"
I watched that game because ESPN was hyping the hell out of it.  JamesOn Curry versus DJ Augestine!  Future NBA guards battling here now!  All I came away from that game was that Kevin Durant was a stud and both of those guards were overrated lol.  (JamesOn I thought was too much of a gunner and Augestin just got overshadowed so hard by Durant that game that I don't remember a thing he did)
"Just googled it, you mean this?  &gt; Asked what rookies have caught his attention this year, he didn't mince words.  &gt; ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  &gt; ""I don't really listen to comparisons,"" Simmons said. ""You can compare players and whatever it is, but at the same time, everybody is their own player.""  &gt; ""Coming off a broken foot is definitely not an edge, but people are always going to say what they want to say,"" Simmons said. ""But at the end of the day, this is my first year in the league. If you're a guy coming from overseas, you're still a rookie and you can be 30 years old. So there's a rule in there.""  &gt; ""Who would I pick? Me, 100 percent,"" Simmons told ESPN at the Ritz-Carlton in downtown Philadelphia on Saturday.  &gt; ""I think I have been playing solid all year,"" he continued. ""If you look at the numbers, you will see. People who know the game know.""  &gt; ""He put me in position as the point guard, and I don't think he thought it would work out this well as it has,"" Simmons said. ""I think it is a lot of credit to Coach for sticking me in that position and trusting me.""  &gt; And although the Rookie of the Year award may be the first personal goal he would like to obtain, he has loftier goals in sight.  &gt; ""Championships,"" Simmons said. ""I want to be the Defensive Player of the Year ... MVP. There's a lot of accolades I want to get, but I ultimately want to win a ring.""  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23089422/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-says-100-percent-rookie-year  Doesn't sound cocky, sounds like every athlete ever. Faith in himself, competitive, lofty goals, but credit your coach, object to direct comparisons, just say you're chasing the greats. ""No other rookie impressed me"" is twisting his words."
Yes. Kevin Durant is a better player but his ring is pretty meaningless. 
"Yup. I'm get downvoted because GSW can't handle the truth. Nothing wrong with GSW GM getting the best player possible, but KD move is weak and he is a hyprocite.   &gt; Now everybody wanna play for the heat and the Lakers? Let's go back to being competitive and going at these peoples!  - Kevin Durant.  Can you imagine KD outside looking in the Warriors if LBJ joined the GSW &amp; Boogie also joined them too. "
"KD gets a bad rap from a lot of people who've actually never heard him actually talk before. He's fun and he's real. There are so many think pieces on ""Who is Kevin Durant"" but like if you listen for a sec, he'll tell you. He's not that complex. "
"The Warriors never beat the Cavs with all of LeBron, Kyrie and Love so that is not a given... they also lost a ton of depth. If you replace Harrison Barnes, Andrew Bogut, Leandro Barbosa, Mareese Speights and Festus Ezeli with nothing then they are a noticeably weaker team to the one that got beat by the Cavs. Even replacing them with CJ is questionable if they are actually better. It's only a no brainer when it is Kevin Durant who is one of the best players ever. "
"Ok, since you are so insistent on Kobe's supporting cast being so shit, here is a comparison using Kobe's 2003 season instead    |Rk|Player|Season|Age|FG|FGA|FG%|3P%|2P%|FT%|PTS|ORtg|TS%| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kobe Bryant|2002-03|24|13.2|29.4|.451|.383|.465|.843|37.6|111|55.0%| |2|Kevin Durant|2013-14|25|13.7|27.2|.503|.391|.549|.873|41.8|123|63.5%|   What's your argument now?"
"Magic played on a team with 3 other All Stars in 1985.  Bird played with 4 other Hall of Famers in 1986.  Stop making excuses.  And KD was in the DPOY conversation in the first half of the year.   https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/2/13/17005976/kevin-durant-defense-dpoy  They injuries piled up and he and his teammates missed a ton of games.  Also he was saving himself for the Playoffs.  He still finished top 5 in blocks and had the 13th most votes for All Defense, so basically 3rd team All defense.  "
Ok   |Rk|Player|Season|Age|FG|FGA|FG%|3P%|2P%|FT%|PTS|ORtg|TS%| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kobe Bryant|2002-03|24|13.2|29.4|.451|.383|.465|.843|37.6|111|55.0%| |2|Kevin Durant|2013-14|25|13.7|27.2|.503|.391|.549|.873|41.8|123|63.5%|  Here is a comparison using Kobe's 2003 season instead. When he played with a much better supporting cast. The stats become even more in favor of KD. Kobe's efficiency is actually *better* in 2006

"1. LeBron: If a league wide draft is going on, that means super stars won’t be able to team up (Warriors), and for the next 2-3 years if I could have one star on my team, why not take the greatest star this league has to offer, as it will give the best chance at championships in both short and long term.  2. Anthony Davis: This is mainly for long term reasons, and ADs short term window won’t look as good with LeBron and KD in the league, so in 4-6 years AD will be looking at his chance of a championship  3. Giannis: Really the same reason as AD. In 4-6 years we don’t know who will be the best player in the NBA, but we do know of some candidates in Giannis, AD, Embiid, Simmons, etc. Among these players Giannis and AD have the best bet at taking LeBron’s throne, and that’s why he’s here.  4. Kevin Durant: KD is currently the second best player in the NBA, and in the short term he gives you the second best odds at winning a championship, so you take your chances for KD and see where he can take you in the next 6 years.  5. Simmons/Embiid: I don’t see anything going wrong selecting Simmons or Embiid. Imo Embiid is the better player, but injury concerns doesn’t make him the guarantee I believe Ben Simmons is, but Simmons game needs more development before he enters the category of Giannis and AD as a top 3 player in the NBA.  Whereas we just need more exposure of Embiid, and see just how incredibly talented he can be playing at the highest level."
"&gt; if you can't dismiss criticism from random strangers on the internet in his position you have a big problem.  Let's assume that you're very good at your job.  You make good money, everyone in your field recognizes you as one of the best, and you're generally happy in your life.  You also like using Reddit.  But there's one or two idiots who follow you around Reddit, responding to most of your comments and pinging you into threads to shit-talk you all the time.  You might block them, but they just pop up with different accounts to do the same thing all over again.  You would obviously know that your life is better than those people, because you're a successful, happy person....... and they're trolls who spend an inordinate amount of their time stalking a stranger on Reddit.  Even knowing all that, would you seriously be able to say you wouldn't have the strong urge, every once in a while, to put them in their place, and tell them to shut the fuck up and stop bothering you?  ----------  Kevin Durant likes using social media, and he has *thousands* of people obsessed with shit-talking him like the people I described in the hypothetical above.  Is it really that crazy that he would occasionally get into it with some of those people?    Just because other famous people/athletes listen to their PR teams and don't engage with internet assholes, doesn't mean that many/most of them don't have the same ""insecurity"" and desire to respond.  They just care enough about the possible PR consequences enough to ignore that urge.  Kevin Durant just doesn't seem to care as much about that.     I don't see how that's a ""big problem"" for anyone other than his PR team."

Almost __no one__ he replies to on social media is going to be seen as someone he should be replying to.  But that's not how any of the rest of us use social media. We reply when something resonates with us in some way - either with our agreement or disagreement.  The extremely vast majority of redditors don't look into who they're replying to, why does Durant need to?  Seriously."

Draft position and number of All-Star seasons noted in the parentheses next to the player's name.    **2000** Kenyon Martin (Pick #1, 1x All-Star)   **2001** Tyson Chandler (Pick #2, 1x All-Star) Pau Gasol (Pick #3, 6x All-Star) Joe Johnson (Pick #10, 7x All-Star)  **2002** Yao Ming (Pick #1, 8x All-Star) Amar’e Stoudemire (Pick #9, 6x All-Star) Caron Butler (Pick #10, 2x All-Star)  **2003** LeBron James (Pick #1, 14x All-Star) Carmelo Anthony (Pick #3, 10x All-Star) Chris Bosh (Pick #4, 11x All-Star) Dwyane Wade (Pick #5, 12x All-Star) Chris Kaman (Pick #6, 1x All-Star)  **2004** Dwight Howard (Pick #1, 8x All-Star) Devin Harris (Pick #5, 1x All-Star) Luol Deng (Pick #7, 2x All-Star) Andre Iguodala (Pick #9, 1x All-Star)  **2005** Deron Williams (Pick #3, 3x All-Star) Chris Paul (Pick #4, 9x All-Star) Andrew Bynum (Pick #10, 1x All-Star)  **2006** LaMarcus Aldridge (Pick #2, 6x All-Star) Brandon Roy (Pick #6, 3x All-Star)  **2007** Kevin Durant (Pick #2, 9x All-Star) Al Horford (Pick #3, 5x All-Star)  Joakim Noah (Pick #9, 2x All-Star)  **2008** Derrick Rose (Pick #1, 3x All-Star)  Russell Westbrook (Pick #4, 7x All-Star) Kevin Love (Pick #5, 5x All-Star)  Brook Lopez (Pick #10, 1x All-Star)  **2009** Blake Griffin (Pick #1, 5x All-Star) James Harden (Pick #3, 6x All-Star) Stephen Curry (Pick #7, 5x All-Star)  DeMar DeRozan (Pick #9, 4x All-Star)  **2010** John Wall (Pick #1, 5x All-Star) DeMarcus Cousins (Pick #5, 4x All-Star) Gordon Hayward (Pick #9, 1x All-Star) Paul George (Pick #10, 5x All-Star)  **2011** Kyrie Irving (Pick #1, 5x All-Star) Kemba Walker (Pick #9, 2x All-Star)  **2012** Anthony Davis (Pick #1, 5x All-Star) Bradley Beal (Pick #3, 1x All-Star) Damian Lillard (Pick #6, 3x All-Star) Andre Drummond (Pick #8, 2x All-Star)  **2013** Victor Oladipo (Pick #2, 1x All-Star)  **2014** Joel Embiid (Pick #3, 1x All-Star)  **2015** Karl-Anthony Towns (Pick #1, 1x All-Star) Kristaps Porzingis (Pick #4, 1x All-Star)  So over a 15-year period, 46 All-Stars were drafted in the top-10 of an NBA draft. This gives a 30.7% chance of drafting an All-Star with a top-10 pick (46/150). If you only look at top-5 picks, the percentage creeps up slightly to 37.3% (28/75). Most of these players have made multiple All-Star games, and there is still time for younger players drafted in the top-10 after 2012 or 2013 to develop into All-Stars, so these percentages might be an underestimate. It's obvious that the top of the draft will give you the best chance at drafting an All-Star caliber player, and the results back that assumption.   When looking at the number of All-Star games each player played in, the data show that 41.3% (19/46) of the All-Stars drafted in the top-10 only made 1 or 2 times. These types of players (Harris, Deng, Iguodala, Noah, etc.) aren't necessarily players an average fan would consider ""All-Star caliber"" but were good enough during their peaks to be selected once or twice. This percentage may be skewed a little higher than it should be as a few of the younger players taken in the 2012-2015 drafts are just entering their primes and will undoubtedly be selected to more All-Star games in the future, but this effect may also be canceled out by new players who have not yet made an ASG and are selected only once or twice in their careers.     A lot of people assume that the moniker of All-Star means that a player is a top-10 or top-15 player in the league, but the fact of the matter is that 24 players are selected as All-Stars each year, and sometimes that number is inflated due to injury replacements. In fact, out of the 46 players who were drafted in the top-10 and have been selected to the All-Star team, 47.8% (22/46) have been selected 5 or more times. I chose the cut-off of 5 ASG selections arbitrarily, but the idea behind it was that a player must be an All-Star for the better part of a decade to be considered a ""perennial All-Star."" To the average fan, these are the players people typically classify as ""All-Stars"" because they make it to the ASG year after year. This percentage might be a little low as a few players drafted between 2009-2015 still haven't made 5 All-Star games, but I would bet they do by the end of their careers (DeRozan, Lillard, Embiid, etc.). However, the total number of players drafted in the top-10 who are selected as an All-Star could increase, which would also impact this percentage.     **TL;DR**  A lot more top-10 picks become All-Stars than people think (30.7%). A good amount (41.3%) only make it to the ASG once or twice in their careers, but more (47.8%%) end up becoming ""perennial All-Star"" players that we typically think of when we talk about All-Star players."

That Kevin Durant ISN'T the GOAT
Where did I say he wasnt lmao. When you compare any of these guys to Kevin fucking Durant they look like Trevor Ariza.
"LeBron comes to LA, suddenly Brandon Ingram is Kevin Durant"
&gt; TL;DR Brandon Ingram and Kevin Durant are same same but different.  I think this sums up all the important points you are quibbling with. 
&gt; TL;DR Brandon Ingram and Kevin Durant are same same but different.  When the TLDR is so confusing you have to read the entire post. 
at least Kevin Durant took the hard road.
"EDIT: An eagle-eyed commenter pointed out my brain fart of no Dirk on my Top 10. Corrected.    I'd probably go something like this:  1. LeBron James 2. Tim Duncan 3. Kobe Bryant 4. Kevin Garnett 5. Shaquille O'Neal 6. Dwyane Wade 7. Dirk Nowitzki 8. Kevin Durant 9. Stephen Curry 10. Jason Kidd  Honorable Mentions (in no order): Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, Tracy McGrady, Ben Wallace, Shawn Marion, Tony Parker, Ray Allen, Chris Paul, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, Manu Ginobili."
"Back when I used to call Kevin Durant K-Drizzle and he was almost surpassing Kobe as my favorite player.   I now somewhat dislike him, he’s bitch made."
"It's fun to wonder, I think if you could do Kyrie + Durant which is easy cap wise. Then the line-up would be very fun for 19-20.         G Kyrie Irving        G Frank Nitikina        F Kevin Durant        F Kristaps Porzingis        C Enes Kanter         G Luke Kornet        G Damyean Dotson        F Kevin Knox      F/C Mitchell Robinson      G/F Tim Hardaway Jr."
"You lack understanding of what they would factor in as a resume for he HoF.  Certainly those things count...does the 3 point contest put him over the top?  Not at all, but it’s a period at the end of the sentence when talking about his monster 2012 year in which he averaged 26 and 13, was an All-Star, selected as All-NBA 2nd team, and represented the United States in the 2012 Olympics and won the Gold Medal, and won the three point contest over Kevin Durant.    Oh, and the high school player of the year receives the NAISMITH Award. "
"Not even close only superstars in the league today are Lebron , Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and Anthony Davis ( who doesn't get as much coverage )"
"Have you not watched him in every playoff series he's ever lost since he came into the league?  His painful lack of awareness is legendary at this point.  It was even worse when he had Kevin Fucking Durant to work with and still couldn't manage to get past ""let me drive at 3 defenders and hoist a prayer"" or ""awkward 3pt shot with 12 on the shot clock, sure!"" mode. "
So did Kevin Durant for years and years and look how that ended
Kevin Durant. I loved seeing the rest of the NBA eat shit when he won’t back to back finals MVPs on historic numbers.
Kevin Durant is imo good enough to be a top 5 player of all time but idk if he will achieve that status after his move to the warriors. He did what was right for him but winning elsewhere would've been better for his legacy
"8-time NBA champion Kerr has the Gauntlet, not LeBron.  Mind: Andre Iguodala. He studies opponents rigorously, he finds advantages in unexpected match-up's and exploits weaknesses with his craft.  Soul: Kevin Durant. His individual legacy had to be sacrificed so that the Ultimate Team could be formed.  Power: DeMarcus Cousins. He fills the Warriors' lone weak spot - rebounding and posting up - with his brute-ish mass and power. He makes them seem physically more imposing than ever.  Time: Draymond Green. He anticipates almost every movement of opponents, stops 2 vs 1 attacks with ease. As long as he can guard multiple positions at an All-Defensive level, the Warriors have time to contend.  Reality: Klay Thompson. Klay can warp reality to whatever it needs to be, in his mind. Nothing is unreal when Klay has the hot hand.  Space: Steph Curry bends gravity and spacing to the extreme."
"Was playing highlights last night with a friend of mine I haven't seen in almost a year. Used the Russell Westbrook highlights, my boy used the current Kevin Durant highlights. Was meant to post this last night but forgot to because I got so high and had one of the most intense highlight watching sessions I've ever had in my life (lots of shit talk, emotions ran high, good times)."
"yeah, but, have you heard of Kevin Durant?"
"They would! Which is why NYK should [go all in](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y85ycjbr) They could sign Kyrie **and** Kevin Durant and then sign Butler going over the cap with his BR  &gt;Kyrie, Butler, Knox, Durant, Zinger  "
"Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kobe, Klay, Boogie, and of course Dwade are going to team up for big moneys."
Did you forget Kevin Durant existed?
"I'm not going to hit you with a sarcastic remark, but I will ask;  Do you think either of those guys are as good as the prospects I named above? Both were multi-year college players and Barrett/Reddish would have been a lotto pick *this* year.  The Promise still needs to get on the court, but I think it's safe to say Denzel is not on the court in the last five minutes of a game let alone in the playoffs. At best he's a 7th or 8th man off the bench. Again....at best.   Drafting the next Kevin Durant, LeBron, Melo, Ingram, Brown, Tatum, *any wing* should be priority number one for ALL teams in the league.  Golden State and Boston are showing everyone the blue print, and this year's class is ALL wings (like big men last year and guards the year before.) If Chicago tanks for *one* more year they will be set for a Philly/GSW/Utah explosion in two years.  If they get the 10th seed and miss out on one of the top prospects they could set a ceiling on the team of Lauri and Carter Jr.  What happened with PHX and Devin Booker *trying* to make the playoffs with Bledsoe and Dragic. It ended up costing almost two years to reset the tank.   I love the Bulls, I live in Chicago and go to about 10 games a year. I won't them to be **GREAT** not just good. After following the 2019 draft class and thinking of pairing RJ Barrett with Anthony Davis and Lauri and Dunn (a younger Jrue with just as much upside) plus Wendell, LaVine and Parker could be *filthy* in two or three years. "
"&gt; Also in the 2016-2017 season, KD had a better PER, WS/48, and BPM than Leonard. He was also a far more efficient scorer.

"""Kevin Durant isn't Kevin Durant. It's a lie. Kevin Durant is not Kevin Durant. I'll explain it to you later. Coaches have said that for years, but Kevin Durant is not Kevin Durant"""
"Kevin Durant &gt; Kevin Durant, amrite?"
"The better evaluation system is that proven talent &gt;&gt;&gt; unproven talent. I would be absolutely astounded if lonzo is better than Dame within the next 3 years. Maybe after that he ends up being better, but you and I both know the most likely outcome of the projection is on the lower end of that.   These Carmelo projections suck. They're trash. Like every year it keeps saying Dame will be significantly worse than the year before, even though he's just entering his prime, and shockingly he actually has improved each of the last two years instead. Don't put so much faith in them   Lonzo is not more valuable than Kevin Durant over the next 5 years by a large margin like they're saying. Come on. "
"assists really do not mean he is unselfish, especially if they only really pass when its for an assist opportunity   his 2017 season for example, his teammates were not bad enough to necessitate that astronomical usage rate which he took  e: also he has been rightfully criticised about his playstyle forever now, the years when he was taking a similar number of shots to KD and making far less of them were very valid criticisms of his game  &gt; That was the worst point guard, in a Championship Finals, I’ve ever seen. He was too wild. He was taking off-balance shots. You have to come out and set the tone with Kevin Durant … Russell Westbrook has gotta set the tone with Kevin Durant.  Magic Johnson after one of his 2012 finals games, he simply lacked the floor general ability"

"&gt;Why can’t he get even closer to Roberson level defence next season and in the future  Because no other wing is close to Roberson's level, the player with the DRPM closest to Roberson is .1 behind him but played double the games he played. Roberson's defense is absolutely miles ahead of any other wings aside from Kawhi. OG has less of a chance as being Roberson good on defense as Jayson Tatum does of being as good as Kevin Durant on offense."
"This is revisionist history. Kevin Durant fell off a cliff in the 2016 post-season. He averaged 28-7-3 but that's where the good news abruptly stops. He had 43/28/89 shooting splits and a horrendous 54 TS%. I mean 20.3 PER, .130 WS.48, .9 OBPM, 1.8 BPM, and .7 VORP.  Add in the 3-1 choke job and KD was a f\*cking mess in the 2016 post-season. This is part of the reason why people have come down on him so hard for his move to GSW. To do that in the 2016 post-season, and then join the team you choked to?!"

Kevin Durant?
"I don't see how Westbrook passes any of the following without a title (all of these players led teams to titles):   1) Michael Jordan  2) LeBron James  3) Magic Johnson  4) KAJ  5) Kobe Bryant  6) Shaq  7) Bill Russell  8) Wilt  9) Tim Duncan  10) Larry Bird  11) Oscar Robertson  12) Hakeem  13) Durant  14) Moses Malone  15) Dr. J  16) Jerry West  17) Isiah Thomas  18) Steph Curry  I think that's very fair to say, there's no way a title-less Westbrook is going down in history above any of those guys.  So Westbrook is in a pool with a bunch of other guys, some champions, some not, for those last two slots.  Here's a sampling of ones without rings in that conversation:   Elgin Baylor, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, John Stockton.  Here are some with rings:  Scottie Pippen, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, David Robinson  I love Russ as much as anyone, but there's no way he's jumping past most of those names on stats and strong playoff performances alone. He needs to lead a team to a title to do that. The top 20 players of all time are the very very very best to ever do this.  While it's absolutely a team game, the very best players ever have found a way to lead a team to a title, or they've come damn close multiple times.   "
"&gt; are the superstars or anyone else with ball-handling as a part of their game.  ...say Paul George, Kevin Durant, and Oladipo (ball-handling)?"
Or like tons of other guys around the league (other than your Kevin Durant) he actually gets along really well with Russ 
"Draymond Green on the Herd: ""I wanted to say hi to the other team. I said ""fucking bitch"" to the general manager of the other team, it was the cavaliers, and Kevin(Durant) started screaming and cussing at him"". Later goes on to confirm that the general manager was   Koby Altman, who proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Cedi Osman and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative dick suck on Sunday afternoon.   Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “Fuck Bron Bron! Fuck Bron Bron.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Cedi hit the locker room door, former NBA great LeBron James hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”   Overheard in Lakers locker room after Game 7: “He got me,” LeBron said of Cedi's dunk over him. ""That f***ing Cedi boomed me."" LeBron added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times. LeBron then said he wanted to add Cedi to the list of players he works out with this summer.   “At the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to lose and make money,” James said. “I know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of my films, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another Oscar. And that’s my mindset.”"
Kevin Durant would be on this list if he didn't leave the way he did to the Warriors
&gt; Thunder: Russell Westbrook*  Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant (with the Celtics)
1. Kevin Durant 2. KD 3. The hardest road 4. The next chapter 5. The snake 🐍 
I think the biggest tell [was this play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-IofEN7ots) where he just bullied Kevin Durant the fuck away the and threw it down.    KD was known as a guy who overcome supreme snekness to get to an acceptable weight but Giannis looks physically superior him in everyway.    That's what is so scary.  Giannis is a STRONG 7 footer that can play guard and he'll eventually be able to hold his own at the 5 for stretches. 
"If Kevin Durant died, like 5 billion people would giggle, 15 would be like damn, and 2 would be sad lol"
"This sub hates Kevin Durant but he is the second best player right now, the best pure scorer in the league, a good help defender, and he will likely go down as a top 7-10 player in NBA history."
Kevin Durant is good at basketball.

Kevin Durant reacting to literally anything anyone says on Twitter
"@imlebronjames tweeted  Kevin Durant is honestly the best player in the league, even better than me. He also has the biggest dick on the USA basketball team."
Kevin Durant looks like he just read a mean tweet and is thinking of what to say

"You're missing the point. I intentionally used players with different initials to demonstrate how tweets like these are written. If you want a better example imagine a tweet talking about Kevin Durant and then starts using the initials KD, but it's actually Kris Dunn that they are referring to. My point is that you'd never bring up a player's name like Lowry and then proceed to use *his* initials while actually referring to another player without mentioning that you're now quoting a KL that isn't Lowry."
"&gt;Do you really not see how it is confusing when they have the same initials...?  Which is why they don't refer to him as KL the first time. You call him Lowry first and then refer to him as KL. Idk why people would think they would start talking about Lowry and then start talking about a different KL with just an abbreviation.   ""Kevin Durant is preparing for the new season.

"He's still shitting on you. Social media, reddit, same shit really.  And your argument is your inferior to Kevin Durant so why should he care what an inferior loser thinks of him? Just because he's an nba player doesn't mean he should talk shit or he's superior to you. "
"&gt; Ratings for the 2017-2018 season were great too.  The 1998 NBA Finals are the highest rated in history (despite no game 7), while the 2018 NBA Finals were the lowest rated since Spurs vs. Heat.  The Bulls were a bona fide Beatlemania phenomenon. The Warriors were on that road til they blew 73-9 and then decided to sign Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant is a crackhead

Kevin Durant and the Grass
"&gt; why is arguing with 19 yr olds not normal, when it is normal for so many?  https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/warriors/2018/07/11/kevin-durant-spars-17-year-old-instagram/776216002/  That isn't normal, I'm in my mid 20s, it would never even cross my mind to argue with someone whos probably in high school over social media. But then again, I guess thats pretty subjective depending on what your age group and define as personal maturity level is.  &gt; Being a celebrity is not some personality trait. In terms of personality or even moral standing. there is no qualitative difference between KD and a regular person. As adults, we should stop putting celebrities on pedestals.  Being a celebrity certainly doesn't make it right for someone to have higher moral standing and  I don't think I've ever made that claim. I'm merely extending that we should be more **sympathetic** to the fact that people changes when there is constant scrutiny on you. I'm going to assume that 99% of the /r/nba will never get close to understand what is it like to be hearing criticism directed at you 24/7 and when we see people breaking down, 07 Brittney spears, or turning towards drugs like lamar odom, there is a good reason for that. And I'm going make a fair assumption that being in constant spotlight only exacerbates the problem you may already have.  "
"How so?  Dirk says people on social media are full of shit.  But so do we.  Everyone with any maturity at all knows that r/NBA is completely full of shit.  We fuck around, shitpost, and have a good time.  But we don’t take it seriously.  What’s amazing to us, is that Kevin Durant _does_."
Kevin Claudius Durant
Kevin Durant will be a top 7-10 player in NBA history.
"Kevin Durant a more skilled defender? Really? He has only taken defense seriously the last two years, lebron has been first team all defense 6 times. Stop it."
So Draymond Green is a better player than Kevin Durant by that logic.
"""tank, get lucky, draft a kevin durant. it's that easy""   jesus christ "
"It's like they haven't ever been naturally good at something.  You ever picked up a video game or a board game or a school subject and everything kinda just naturally clicked? Some things just make sense for people.  Obviously and NBA player worked to get into the league.  However, like Steph Curry had to worker way harder to get to where he is than Kevin Durant.  "
"1) Because the Lakers felt that they needed a point guard more than a forward.  2) Because of the off-court hype surrounding Lonzo, much of it generated by his own family.  3) Because of the on-court hype surrounding Lonzo. Lots of people talked about him as the number 1 prospect, with incredible vision and shooting problems (analysts thought) that could be easily corrected.  4) Because Magic saw himself in Lonzo.  5) Because hindsight is 20/20? Why did Portland draft Greg Oden instead of Kevin Durant? Why did Minnesota draft O.J. Mayo instead of Westbrook? Why did Memphis draft Hasheem Thabeet instead of Harden? Teams get it wrong sometimes."
"Kevin Durant doesn't need to be quiet. No one is asking him to be quiet. But he also needs to recognize that by speaking out, famous athlete or not, his opinions are open to our opinions, especially when he insults teenagers who have no platform to respond unless he gives them attention (and therefore attracts other people's attention to them) rather than going on air and being open. Except he then openly insulted CJ McCollum on his podcast, then tried to laugh at him through Twitter anyways. Kevin Durant isn't crazy or a loser, but he clearly is insecure"
"This is the story about the time Kevin Durant kicked my cat.  I liked to take my cat, Simba, out to some of the local parks so that he could explore the outside world. On this particular walk, my roommate Russell decided to join us. We were passing by the basketball court when we saw this really tall shirtless dude just laying down at center court. My interest piqued, I went up to him and asked him what he was doing. ""Warming up my blood,"" the man said. *Weird* I thought as the man rose to his feet. ""Hey, I bet you we can beat you 2 on 2"" he suddenly said. Looking around, I realize that me, Russell, and this man are the only people at the court. ""How are we going to play 2 on 2,"" Russell asked. ""Me and the cat vs you two,"" the strange man said. Me and Russell were confused at first, but Russell decided that it might be fun. We start playing, and the strange man takes the ball first. Russell decides to guard him leaving me to defend my pet. The strange man holds the ball above his head and rockets a pass to my kitty. Simba is unfazed by the pass and simply begins to lick his paw. ""Hey man, c'mon, that pass was right to you!"" Russell takes the ball up top and feeds me the ball. I easily drive past my cat and lay the ball in. The strange man decides to have my cat inbound the ball. He brushes up against the ball, causing it to slowly roll towards me. I snatch it up and pass to Russell who was catting back door, he gets an easy layup. The strange man is furious, and he runs up to my kitty, cocking his leg back to deliver a powerful kick. ""How am I supposed to win with this!?"" he yelled before launching Simba into the air. Crying, the man ran off the court, sobbing something about validation and difficult roads. Luckily, Simba was okay and we continued our walk. It wasn't until later that I saw the man again while flipping through channels on the TV. Apparently he was some big NBA star. I turned to Russell and asked if he wanted to speak on this. ""You already know my answer,"" he said shaking his head, the traffic cone he was wearing shifting slightly as he did so."

"It’s pretty wild!

In comparison...  Players that are now widely considered to be in (or on the fringe of) the Top 10 and their ranking in 2013:  • James Harden (11)  • Steph Curry (15)  • Kyrie Irving (20)  • Kawhi Leonard (37)  • Anthony Davis (41)  • Giannis Antetokounmpo (Not in NBA)  • Joel Embiid (Not in NBA)"

"The third time I ran into Kevin Durant I was working at the old arcade off route 67 back home. Man I loved that place - mostly locals with their families or groups of kids coming in to check out the old Atari machines or play Snake. Felt like a real community, you know? One day, must have been in the summer because I remember it being so hot the pizza delivery actually got hotter just sitting outside, this rusty truck pulls up and a 7-foot-tall string bean gets out and claims he's here from ""corporate.""  So I tell him that I didn't hear anything from corporate saying that I should be expecting someone to swing by. He just shrugs and laughs at me and pops open his trunk. I ask him what he's here to do and he takes off his sunglasses and turns to me and says ""tech support"" and pulls a huge toolbox out of his trunk and starts walking towards the arcade. His hands are full so I offer to help carry stuff, but he insists on taking it all inside alone. About 5 feet from the entrance his wallet falls out of his pocket and lands on the ground in front of me. A card had fallen out of the wallet so I pick it up and look at it, and it's just a bunch of random usernames and logins, possibly up to 50 of them, with passwords next to them. Flustered, KD snatches the card out of my hand and storms into the arcade.  I follow him inside but he turns to me and tells me ""don't worry about this I got it."" Suspicious, I walk out and resume eating my scalding pizza in the dusty parking lot, but I keep an eye on him. I notice that he's going to every single machine and unscrewing the control board and typing something in. At one point, a bunch of kids show up and try to head inside to play some games, and KD shrieks at them and locks the door, flipping the OPEN sign to CLOSED and snarling.  About two hours later, KD finally emerges and says ""all set, thanks boss"" and walks towards his truck. I quickly shuffle inside and take a look at a few of the machines. Horrified, I immediately notice that every single one of the top scores on every single machine has been edited to say ""&amp; KD"" at the end. Billy &amp; KD, Pauly &amp; KD, Deb &amp; KD...every single one..some of those scores had been there for 20 years!  I run out to KD and scream at him ""YOU DIDN'T GET THOSE SCORES, YOU PIGGYBACKED ON SOMEONE ELSE'S SUCCESS!!""  He rolls down the window of his truck and looks me dead in the eyes and says ""in 20 years nobody will remember how I got those scores, they'll just count the wins"" and drives off into the distance. That was the third time I ran into KD."

Did you just compare Tatum to Kevin Durant 
"&gt;I just can’t wrap my head around why everyone loves Wiggins so much.  It's not that everyone that loves him so much, it's that people like you chronically underrate him, so he gets way more criticism than he deserves leading to a huge circle jerk on this sub, which causes a reaction pushing back.  He had a bad year last year, but he also had a bad year because he was playing behind Jimmy, at the beginning of the year when he was playing as the 1 option, and when Jimmy was hurt he did a lot better. They basically play the same role offensively and Wiggins was put in a bad situation to have success.   He is had a pace to put him among some of the best scorers ever (along with Booker). Wiggins is the sixth-youngest player to hit 6000 points. Those quicker than him were LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady. And Wiggins played a lot better defense last year, but no one on this sub actually cares. He will almost assuredly be a better defender than Booker in his career, and while maybe not as good of a shooter, people treat him like a bigger bust than Anthony Bennett. If you look at Oladipo, who should have been the number one pick in 2013, he didn't really show much in his first 4 years.  Basically people like to unduely hate on Wiggins so I'm not sure where you're seeing this outsized love for Wiggins on this sub."

Ladies and gentlemen... Kevin Durant
Kevin durant looks like he's about to cry 
"Kevin Durant is actually really smart and you're just jealous he's in the NBA and you're not you hater, you don't understand how hard his road has been  -Definitely not a KD alt "
The albatross comes from players who are supermax eligible and are not top 5 in the league players. Zach Lowe mentioned how this rule was to prevent a player of Kevin Durant from bolting the team that drafted him but it has also forced the GM’s into uncomfortable decisions like shipping out Boogie and Jimmy Butler before they were supermax eligible. It’s an interesting discussion and one that could shape the next CBA. 
"https://sports.yahoo.com/draymond-green-says-took-less-warriors-sign-kevin-durant-reportedly-wont-happen-191252660.html  So is this quote coming from draymond's mouth a lie?  “I think my max was $96 million,” Green told ESPN during these Finals. “That money is not changing my neighborhood. It’s probably $6 million after taxes and fees. It’s not changing my neighborhood, but championships can. Championships can change my life."
"Well look at the situation, he is soft for what he said, be a man and say it to the guys face. And to be honest the whole ""gang"" related thing is such bullshit. KEVIN DURANT only cares about one thing and that's winning. The media and shitty fans are blowing everything out of proportion. It's been 2 years now 2 championship, 2 Finals mvp. Kevin ain't leaving golden State so just live with it, he'll be a 3 time champion soon "
"This Kevin Durant guy is not insecure, he is so good at basketball, even better than that LeBron guy. I am not Kevin Durant. Absolutely not! Anyways KD is the best."
The record he did with meek mill and the record Kevin Durant did with tsu surf are probably my favorite songs from an athlete not named shaq 
Kevin Durant and CJ McCollum
Kevin Durant actually personally urinated on me when I asked for his autograph
If they cut him though who do they have to replace him? They have no wing depth and their main goal is to get past a team with Kevin Durant on it.
"That's one hell of a false equivalency my guy. Admitting you suffer from depression, making it public to try and remove the stigma for other people who suffer from the same issue, as well as seeking help, isn't even comparable to talking shit to 12 year old's on IG and twitter.   Kevin Love is addressing his issues and using his platform in a healthy and responsible way. Kevin Durant is just lashing out and being childish. And that's fine, he can do that... but he can also get criticized for that and he shouldn't be surprised. "
"Kevin ""The ~~Servant~~ Serpent"" Durant "

"Because Kevin fucking Durant can win 5 or more chips. Please read a book, we got a lot to work with child. "
"The Klosterman one was hilarious because he started needling Bill about his special friendship with Kevin Durant, and Bill panicked and said he does multiple podcasts with lots of NBA players, and then made up that he was going to be recording a podcast with Jimmy Butler that suspiciously has never materialized.

I literally just gave you a quote of Kevin Durant saying he's 6'10. This was a quote after the controversy about his height. 
"The top 5 in 2023 will be the following, in no particular order.    - Ben Simmons (G - GSW) - Luka Doncic (G - GSW) - Kevin Durant (F - GSW) - Anthony Davis (F - GSW) - Joel Embiid (C - GSW)  I'm from the future, I am.  "
"For real Durant is a sick last name, but Kevin doesn't fit with it"
PG - Kevin Durant  SG - Kevin Durant  SF - Kevin Durant  PF - Kevin Durant  C - Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
ACPM (Advanced Charities Per Minute) will actually tell you that Kevin Durant was more valuable to the community in the Oklahoma City area than Paul George.
"Ok, seriously, why do people on here seem to feel like a College title and hanging out with the best players in the game while they beat up on Euroleague teams means something?  Robert Horry has 7 rings and isn't getting into the HOF. Why? Because he was a good role player, but not the main reason his teams won. Do you feel like Melo is the reason that a team featuring LeBron, Durant, Chris Paul, Westbrook, Kobe, Kevin Love, Anthiny Davis, James Harden, etc was able to win a tournament where most teams couldn't put together a starting lineup of current NBA players?  GTFOH"
"Kevin Durant is not gonna leave the Warriors to go join LeBron. Stop watching first take and that other Skip Bayless show. I highly doubt he even considers leaving the Warriors at all, he's gonna stay there with Steph."
When has Kevin Durant *ever* held shit in?  He has probably been using burner accounts arguing with people since he was in college.
"“I wasn’t hiding me from the world, I was hiding the world from me”  - Kevin “Snake” Durant"
That’s exactly what Kevin Durant would say
It's funny because he didn't even act like he wanted MVP in the last game.  Back to back.  This guy is a fucking legend.   I'm not Kevin Durant. 
"Does Kevin Durant have a girlfriend? He needs to have more sex or something. Like wow. I get his point, but Jesus. He’s better than this...."
Interview featuring the GOAT number 2 pick of all time and Kevin Durant. Upvote.
Jamal Crawford - grocery clerk  Kawhi Leonard - accountant/professional assassin  Josh hart - male stripper  Kevin Durant - 8th grade tutor      
"Kyrie Irving - Sociology professor  Giannis Antetokounmpo - Tour guide  Ben Simmons - Instagram Model, stay-at-home Kardashian  LeBron James - Youth coach  Kevin Durant - work at a zoo  Brad Stevens - prosecutor  Boban Marjanovic - Garbage man  Chris Paul - State Farm agent  Jeremy Lin - E-Leaguer    "
Its definitely not JUST between those two :  Simmons Embiid Tatum Mitchell Doncic.  Maybe RJ Barrett or someone we dont even know yet.  Maybe Jokic improves his defense.  Booker started playing point last season and is just 21.  Also 34yr old Durant can still be very good.  Guys like Miles Bridges Kevin Knox Ayton SGA all have upside to turn into Superstars.  5 years is a long ass time. 
Is Kevin Durant legit high on coke all the time?
They won before Kevin Durant too.  And only lost in 2016 because the stars aligned for Cleveland.  Otherwise that never happens.  The only one Durant stopped from being an all time great is Steph.  You are just a fake Skip Bayless.
So Kevin Durant doesn’t go on twitter and argue with teenagers? Try again. 
They lost before Kevin Durant. Durant had 2 all time great finals performances those years. You’re just a bron stan mad KD stomp the shit out of any chance lebron ever has to be the GOAT 
"Kevin ""joined a 73-win team for the easiest road to the Finals"" Durant"
"Kevin ""literally a fucking MVP and first ballot HoF-lock"" Durant"
1) LeBron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Steph Curry  4) Kawhi Leonard  5) Anthony Davis  6) James Harden  7) Giannis Antetokounmpo   8) Russell Westbrook  9) Chris Paul  10) Joel Embiid
What the fuck does that even mean Kevin Durant?
&gt; Kevin Durant: 'I don’t really care what people think about me ... I feel like I have all the power now'  lol
Yeah but that's LeBron. This is Kevin Durant we're talking about here. 
"Dude was a free agent.  That means he gets to play whereever he wants to play.  I know, reddit doesn't agree (it's my most downvoted comment on this site in 10 years... love it!) [but at least JJ's got my back] (https://sports.yahoo.com/jj-redick-why-love-kevin-181830137.html)  &gt; ""This is why I love what Kevin Durant did in going to Golden State. You should look at your career as sort of squeezing out every ounce of money, joy, winning, team -- whatever it is you prioritize -- squeeze that out."""
"Stephen Curry - in terms of talent/skill set now Damian Lillard but in terms of play style Trae Young  Klay Thompson - less versatile Paul George. Both are essentially elite 3 and D players that can get buckets in a pinch (Paul George more so than Klay, he’s also a better distributor)  Kevin Durant - A smaller/slightly less athletically gifted Anthony Davis with a near automatic jumper (both essentially big men bodies with a guard skill set)  Draymond Green - Ben Simmons. Both serve as primary facilitators for the team. Ben Simmons is a better passer and much more athletic but Draymond is a much better defender (although Simmons has the potential to serve the Draymond role on defense)   DeMarcus Cousins - Deandre Ayton. Obviously Cousins is better and more established right now but both are freaks of nature with an enormous amount of strength and a surprising amount of quickness. Both aren’t the most natural defenders but have the athleticism to. DeMarcus is also a better facilitator and is comfortable orchestrating the break  Sorry if these weren’t that great. Most stars have their own unique skill set and body type and it’s rare to find someone of the same pedigree and skill set with the same body type"
"But...what? A superstar joined them in free agency and a lot of fans didn't like it?  There's no cheating involved, no unfair advantages, it was good drafting, good culture, and luck. Kevin Durant had the #4 selling jersey in the 2018 season and Curry had #1, so when you're saying his legacy, or this team's, is somehow permanently tainted, well, I'm skeptical. The younger generation coming up likes the Warriors just fine, and they'll write history.  "
Because Kevin Durant was on his team.
"Having been the only team interested in him for 6-9 months prior to the draft, Portland management attended and supervised many of Lillard's workouts and stated that they were the best performances since Kevin Durant.  With that comparison in mind, it's no surprise that they picked him."
"Yeah, I was skeptical of Lillard at first, thinking he was just going to be a better Ty Lawson/Devin Harris hybrid.  But seeing this workout and hearing the staff say he had the best workout since Kevin Durant assured me that Lillard was the right pick."
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant cared enough what people thought to make a bunch of burner accounts and fight with Randoms on twitter.  Never underestimate the power of vanity.
"The perfect all time starting 5 needs every player to be able to shoot decently at the very least, everyone is mobile, a good defender that can guard many positions, and some absolute star power. I present my starting 5:  PG - LeBron James  SG - Klay Thompson  SF - Kevin Durant  PF - Larry Bird  C - Anthony Davis  This is assuming were playing in the modern era of spacing, switch all defense, and P&amp;R is king. If were playing in the 90's you'll need a bigger C than Davis.  Some may say there's no one to guard quick guards, but remember Klay takes on the best guard assignments from Steph all the time and LeBron could stay on any quick guard in his prime."
Mine would be  PG: 2008-09 Chris Paul  SG: 2015-16 Kawhi Leonard  SF: 2008-09 LeBron James  PF: 2017-18 Kevin Durant  C: 2003-04 Kevin Garnett 112 Orating 92 Drating at Minesotta 
Chris Paul  Kevin Durant (played the 2 when he entered the league)  Kawhi Leonard  Draymond Green  Kevin Garnett
"PG: MJ SG: Kobe SF: Lebron PF: Kevin Durant  C: Tim Duncan  All of these guys are players who can Play off ball, Make the right pass, and defend at a high level. It also provides great spacing as all these guys can hit the open 3.  "
LeBron James. Derrick Rose. Kevin Durant. Kyrie Irving. All had shit teams around them when drafted.   Checkmate. 
PG: Magic Johnson  SG: Michael Jordan  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Lebron James  C: Shaq 
Covington and Ariza def fit the bill. I should’ve just said Kevin Durant lol but I wasn’t trying to take the hardest road.
"&gt; The Heat then reached the same feat by a quarter of an inch from the baseline, which has not been repeated again, unless you give credit to Kevin Durant and the Warriors, who had to cheat to achieve their back-to-back.  lol OP comes through with the shit takes"
"&gt;They're not competing with Kevin Durant or Lebron James in the summer time.  NBA Summer League is a higher level of play than the WNBA. Kevin Knox and Josh Hart are more exciting to watch than Candace Parker and Maya Moore.  The marketing is terrible and sure doesn't help the WNBA, that is something I can agree on. But I don't think marketing is ever going to elevate it to the point where it is popular."
steph curry - kyrie irving  klay thompson - devin booker  kevin durant - brandon ingram  draymond green - al horford  demarcus cousins - joel embiid
"No it doesn't.   It has to do with skill level and athleticism. The NBA's skill level far exceeds that of the WNBA, and the NBA's athleticism is in another galaxy compared to the WNBA. TJ McConnell would probably be the best dunker in the WNBA.  **Who is more exciting to watch:**  Diana Taurasi OR Stephen Curry?  Maya Moore OR Lebron James?  Candace Parker OR Kevin Durant?  Sylvia Fowles OR Joel Embiid?  Brittney Griner OR Anthony Davis?"
Kevin Durant isn’t the worst human being in existence for going to the Warriors. 
Players should always take the money over loyalty to a team. This goes for if they want to chose a winning team over money as well. Why shouldn't a player make decisions in their own self interest? (See Kevin Durant)
"-Kris Dunn  -Kevin Durant  -Kevin Duncan (Me)  -Kevin Duckworth   -Keyon Dooling   We're not the best, us KD's, but we're a scrappy bunch. We're all first one in, last one one out types, with good motors and high basketball iq's. Minus Durant and myself we're all high character and great locker room presenses too."
"Celtics:  Damian Lillard - 3 point shooter and scorer, under average defeneder (Kyrie Irving)  Trevor Ariza - 3 and D athletic Wing who can create a bit but will be more used as a shooter and versatile defender (Jaylen Brown)  Brandon Ingram - Ok defenders because of lengh who are pretty good drivers. Ingram isn't quite there in terms of shooting volume though. (Jayson Tatum)  Jimmy Butler - Close in terms of assist and turnover rate, forwards who are good playmakers, Butler has the edge in defending, but maybe with the Celtics and Stevens Hayward can step up here. (Gordon Hayward)  Draymond Green - excellent defenders, good rebounders, playmaking bigs, trust more position than athleticism. (Al Horford)  Other Version:  CJ McCollum  Khris Middleton (purely as a player this is closer than most people would think when you get the numbers)  Regular season Kevin Durant (Jayson Tatum)  Bradley Beal (a guard version similar to Gordon Hayward, couldn't really get another comp for him)  Derrick Favors"
I can't replicate our lineup but I can replicate our GM with Kevin Durant
"not really as of now but there is definitely some resemblance of the current warriors in the upcoming Hawks   **Point Guard** - Trae Young / Steph Curry (3pt range, many 3s in general, good playmaking, undersized, relying on their skills and not their physics)  **Shooting Guard** - Kevin Huerter / Klay Thompson (big for a 2, 3pt specialist, ""3&amp;D"", mostly catch &amp; shoot)  **Small Forward** - Taurean Prince / Kevin Durant (combo forward, athletic, good and variable scorer)  **Power Forward** (ok this one is coincidence and pretty far-fetched) - John Collins / Jordan Bell (athletic 4/5, not really polished as scorers besides a bit mid range game, high energy guy) "
"I'd compare PG to Durant, I guess. KD is a good defender and both have that size. Not really anyone compares to Durant. I think Jonathan Isaac has a build kind of like Kevin Durant, but with literally none of the skills. "
"They were favored because Bosh was supposed to be injured, missed 5 games in ECF, and OKC was supposed to have a big advantage in depth with Harden coming off the bench and Ibaka protecting the rim against LeBron/Wade.    The actuality was Bosh was 100% healthy and Ibaka was forced to guard him on the perimeter, leaving the rim unchecked. Outside of G2, Ibaka had a total of 5 blocks for the entire series after having one of the best shotblocking seasons ever with 3.7 BPG in the regular season and 3.5 in the playoffs prior to the finals.    Also Westbrook, Harden, Ibaka, and Sefalosha somehow managed to get outplayed by Wade, 34 year old Battier, Mario freaking Chalmers, and Mike Miller who could barely run up the court with a broken back     ||MPG|PTS|TS%|3PM|3PA|3P%|TRB|AST|TOV|STL|BLK| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|   |Wade|40.6|22.6|.516|2|5|.400|6.0|5.2|2.8|1.4|1.2|    |Battier|37.5|11.6|.851|15|26|.577|3.4|0.4|0.2|0.8|0.0| |Chalmers|36.5|10.4|.564|8|23|.348|2.6|4.0|2.0|1.8|0.4| |Miller|8.9|6.2|.832|7|11|.636|1.8|0.4|0.0|0.2|0.2| |TOTALS|123.5|50.8|.609|32|65|.492|13.8|10.0|5.0|4.2|1.8|   ||MPG|PTS|TS%|3PM|3PA|3P%|TRB|AST|TOV|STL|BLK| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|   |Westbrook|42.6|27.0|.500|3|22|.136|6.4|6.6|2.2|1.0|0.4|    |Harden|32.8|12.4|.529|7|22|.318|4.8|3.6|2.2|1.2|0.0| |Ibaka|26.3|7.0|.462|-|-|-|5.2|0.8|0.2|0.4|2.0| |Sefolosha|25.9|4.6|.388|2|11|.182|2.0|1.0|0.8|1.4|0.8| |TOTALS|127.6|51.0|.489|12|55|.218|18.4|12.0|5.6|4.0|3.2|      FYI only 3.8 of those 18.4 RPG were offensive, Bosh nearly averaged that by himself with 3.0.

Oh and OKC played Perkins 25 MPG despite Miami playing almost exclusively small ball, leading to him guarding Shane Battier, Bosh or LeBron.      And despite the narrative surrounding Dirk carrying the Mavs past the Miami superteam in 2011, Durant played much better than Dirk did in the prior Finals     ||AGE|MPG|PTS|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Kevin Durant|23|42.6|30.6|.650|6.0|2.2|1.4|1.0|   |Dirk Nowitzki|32|40.4|26.0|.537|9.7|2.0|0.7|0.7|  "
"By taking Thunder, they forced us to retire our beloved mascot, Thunder.  Many years later, after almost a decade of plotting, we got our revenge by taking Kevin Durant away from them.  For all you that complain about parity, this never would have happened if they had just chosen Wind."
"So like, we for real gonna pretend like Kevin Durant isn’t an alien"
A 4'3 Kevin Durant
"It's actually insane how much talent Presti acquired in his time with that organization.  * Kevin Durant drafted 2nd in 2007: All-Star, All-NBA, 2014 MVP * Russell Westbrook drafted 4th in 2008: All-Star, All-NBA, 2017 MVP * James Harden drafted 3rd in 2009: All-Star, All-NBA, 2018 MVP * Victor Oladipo acquired in trade in 2016: All-Star, All-NBA, 2018 MIP * Paul George acquired in trade in 2017: All-Star, All-NBA, 2013 MIP  Five guys who are or were on the Thunder who became All-Stars and made All-NBA teams. Thunder draftees became MVPs as well."
Kevin Durant
"Get rid of max contracts, but keep the salary cap.  If someone else would have offered Kevin durant $80 mil/year, he wouldn’t have gone to the Warriors. "
Frye’s height and shooting would make that player really good actually. Similar to Kevin Durant.
"Why? Why not get Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond green, and add them to their already really solid roster?"
Imagine Kevin Durant being in this situation instead of Lebron. His reaction would be priceless. 
Gone in the wind: The Kevin Durant story
"Kevin Durant is a lanky 7'er and one of the best players in the game. He's not imposing aside from his height. The kid can ball, he'll be tall enough and I'm sure will gain weight. LeBron was not a big guy when he entered until he got his man body and put on some pounds but was still a good baller. "
Where is Kevin Durant?
Write longform pasta/memes and try to find boring posts about Kevin Durant where I can comment them
LeBron James  Kevin Durant   Steph Curry   Chris Paul   James Harden 
The kid's name? Kevin Durant Jr
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/early-lead/wp/2016/02/02/could-kevin-durant-join-steph-curry-on-the-warriors/  It's been 3 weeks but I just remembered this conversation.   Woj said it. 
"Let’s just consider for a moment that if Lebron didn’t exist, Kevin Durant would be the face of basketball right now."
"&gt; He's a solid player but I don't see him making an all-star team in that time span, and maybe not at all during his career. It's hard to see when you have players like Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, and DeMarcus Cousins in the West who are all studs at the age of 25 or less.  I've just returned from the future. What if I told you KD and DMC both joined Dray's team and even that wouldn't stop him from being an all-star? In fact, Dray was the major recruiter of those guys!"
"When comparing him to a role player sure, but he's pretty inefficient when compared to almost every other first and second option and  on top teams.   The top 5 teams in each conference this year were TOR, BOS, PHI, CLE, IND, HOU, GSW, POR, OKC, and UTA.  Here's the TS% for first and second options on each team.   Kevin Durant 64% (Steph Curry was easily the most efficient player this year at 67.5%)  LeBron James 62.1% //// Kevin Love was at 61.4%  James Harden 61.9% //// Chris Paul was at 60.4%  Anthony Davis 61.2% //// DeMarcus Cousins was at 58.3%  Kyrie Irving 61% //// Jaylen Brown was at 56.2%  Giannis Antetokounmpo 59.8% //// Kris Middleton was at  57.7%  Damian Lillard 59.4% //// CJ was only at 53.6%  Jimmy Butler 59% //// Karl-Anthony Towns was at 64.6%  Victor Oladipo 57.7% //// Bogdanovic was at 60.5%  Joel Embiid 57.3% //// Redick was at 61.4%  LaMarcus Aldridge 57% //// Rudy Gay was at 54.5%  DeMar DeRozan 55.5% //// Kyle Lowry was at 59.8%  Donovan Mitchell 54.1% //// Ricky Rubio was at 53.7%  Russell Westbrook 52.4% //// Paul George was at 57%  The only first options on those teams that were less efficient were Westbrook and Mitchell.  Westbrook gets shit for his efficiency as well, but a lot of people ignore it because of his boxscore stats. Mitchell was a rookie.  **Keep in mind as well that even with DeRozan being this inefficient it was still the most efficient year of his entire career!**  For Westbrook it was his least efficient season since 09-10.

"Going by matchup data there were only a few guys in the NBA who truly could guard high level opponents 1-5 as the primary defender(note not switching onto them but as the primary defender there's a key difference).   Justise Winlsow was one of them. Note time spent on anybody from KAT to Kemba Walker https://on.nba.com/2K1CBdh  Jeff Green(yes that Jeff Green) was another. Note time spent on anybody from Jusuf Nurkic to Kemba as the primary defender   https://on.nba.com/2OtqhVJ  And then there was Ben Simmons. Anybody from Russell Westbrook to Al Horford when needed.   https://on.nba.com/2Ou2apU  Those were the 3 most versatile defenders in the reg season probably. Come postseason time the Warriors let Kevin Durant and Draymond Green spend more time on guards so they can enter the convo as well. LeBron James same thing probably as well.   There a number of guys in the NBA who can guard 1-3 and even depending on matchup 1-4(when the 4's are like Giannis, Harrison Barnes etc). Wes Matthews, Josh Richardson, Robert Covington, Jonathan Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leoanrd, Andre Roberson, Jimmy Butler, Marcus Smart, Andre Iguodala, Trevor Ariza, Luc Mbah Moute and others Im not listing off the top of my head. But in terms of guarding 1-5 truly, Simmons is up there with probably only like a half dozen players.     "
Whichever team wins four years from now. Because they’ll be adding Kevin Durant 
Haha get it? Because Kevin Durant is like a woman and women are weak!
kevin durant also has a vagina so that wouldnt have helped
"Kudos to u/hotpants69 for getting it mostly right:  &gt;Kevin Durant + Steph Curry + Kevin Love  Two out of three ain't bad.  Also,  it was obviously an unpopular prediction at the time, at 0 votes."
He pulled a Kevin Durant

Weren't there reports that people hurled racial abuse at Kevin Durant?

"Wanna highlight a few that made me laugh for one reason or another.  ""Raptors cause Wiggins"" (I guess they thought Toronto was gonna suck so hard they got Wiggins in 2014? They just drafted 8th. They got better the next two years and drafted 20th in 2014.)  ""OKC. Durant and Westbrook will be 29, Ibaka 28. JLamb, PJ III, multiple draft picks."" (In full disclosure, I also thought PJ3 was gonna be a beast. Gotta be able to laugh at yourself.)  ""That Bobcats pick might be middle first round . Might not be in the lottery."" (That pick was #4)  ""The Rockets (I predict) will have Kevin Love in 5 years, so they'll be nasty."" (...IDK, this one was just random af and made me laugh.)  ""It also would not surprise me if the Lakers manage to get another star or two to pair with Dwight Howard after a lot of their current contracts expire."" (Dwight Howard being the future of the Lakers. That was an interesting year to say the least.)  ""Kings"" (Had absolutely no justification for it, just... Kings.)"
Kevin Durant is a better scorer.  
"I think when Kevin Durant called Kristaps Porzingis a unicorn, he was simply saying his size and skill set is something we've never seen before.  Note: KP has ball handling as well. "
Stephen Curry can impact a basketball game more then Kevin Durant. I don't understand how people still argue/can't believe this. 
Russell Westbrook James Harden Kevin Durant Lebron James Anthony Davis
"Was that whole burner stuff a bad look on him? Sure.  But I consider it even worse that people continue to harp on it, bring it up at every opportunity even on occasions that have nothing to do with it, and act as though that defines who he is, as though it's something he continues to do. That's a textbook example of having low EQ.  Name me a person who hasn't done stupid shit in life.  I also think it's incredibly narrow minded to think that a man who plays night in, night out at the highest level, under the spotlight of tens of thousands of hecklers and haters doing their utmost best to hurl insults and throw him off his game, knows something about composure handling pressure. Maturity wise, I think that's more than you can say for a majority of anonymous randos sitting behind a computer holding some holier than thou attitude, throwing around cheap insults.  Oh and that's not mention the work that he continually does for the community, how he has reconciled with a bunch of negative things that stretch back to his days as a kid, and how he has successfully diversified his financial portfolio in an era where plenty of NBA players and other athletes have fallen in the pitfalls of wealth management. Not to mention how coaches and ex-teammates have almost universally lauded him as being a humble guy, and a good teammate with a strong work ethic and a love for basketball.  But sure, all that could be managed by a 10 year old kid, right? Easy to conclude just by overemphasizing on a couple of his flaws and vices and ignoring just about anything else.   &gt; To be honest, I wouldn’t even be surprised if you were Kevin Durant himself 😂  Statements like these are generally not a good look on someone trying to chastise another man for maturity issues.  Or delivering cheap and immature personal insults. You don't have to like anyone and everyone, but at least have some grasp of basic concepts like basic decency and respect for others.  Get off your high horse and stop with the hypocrisy."
"“KD is so good at drawing fouls man. Maybe he can win gold with this team cuz he definitely couldn’t win with those other cats, even though he was up 3-1 in the WCF and had multiple mvp teammates at one point” -Kevin Durant "
"A grown ass man that has alt social media accounts is not all their in his head, maturity wise. Thus, he had a brain of a 10 year old. The fact that he can never admit a wrong without justification or playing the he said/she said games is just very childish like that interaction he had with the reporter where he kept trying to rebuttal with the same ol repeated question. It’s like come on dude this is what kids do not grown ass adults.   To be honest, I wouldn’t even be surprised if you were Kevin Durant himself 😂"
"Dude, Kevin Durant is not a source more credible than facts. Kobe is less efficient than all these guys it would hurt him in a game of 2 v 2 against such efficient scorers. "

"1 on 1, You think, Kobe Bryant, is a worse scorer, in his prime, than Lebron James? You think, Kevin Durant, would fare better on defense, vs Kobe and Jordan, rather than they would on offense?  I can’t wait till u recency bias nephs get a taste of your own medicine in 10 years"
"I assume you didn’t watch them. This is 2v2. Lebron would not clamp Kobe, the greatest tough shot maker ever, and neither would Durant. Neither would be able to stop Jordan either, a better athlete than both. You always have a mismatch: Kobe(wide range of offensive moves) or Jordan(equally as wide, slightly less talented beyond the arc but more athletic and creative inside) would be guarded by BBQ chicken Kevin Durant. That’s a blow by all day if I’ve ever seen one."
Kevin Durant alone can beat them 1v5  E: I'm totally not Kevin Durant 
Aaaaand they select Greg Oden over Kevin Durant.
And then they drafted greg oden over Kevin Durant 
Wait but I thought that you are not Kevin Durant 🤔

"Gobert most certainly can, and does play against the Warriors death lineup. He usually does very well, but has had some struggles against the best team ever, sure.   The warriors centers are draymond green and Kevin Durant. Before kd, defensive savant big man bogut was their centre.  How many teams throughout history and currently that have elite defenses can you attribute to a non ""big"" man? Not many I bet. But anybody can name 10 - 20 elite defensive teams led by guys 6-10 and bigger"
"Forget retrospect it wasn't even clear at the time they would be the best with their mediocre support.  Lebron and Wade had redundant skill sets, but people figured they'd make it work as they were both top 5 players in the league in the relative primes of their careers. But what about Bosh? He had only ever been the guy in Toronto. How was he gonna adjust to fewer touches as a 3rd star? He was a top 15 player, but this whole team was guesswork. Remember how hyped the Dwight Nash Kobe Gasol lineup was before they sucked? 2009-2011 was also when the Celtics  were becoming more of a ""big 4"" rather than a big 3. Late 2000s Spurs? The young Thunder who proved they could slay anyone in the west? No one was head and shoulders above anyone.    The Warriors were not guesswork.  They were a proven championship team who just came off 67- and 73-win regular seasons and were 1 game away from being back to back (credit to their management; they built this team with good drafting and scouting coupled with player development and smart trades and signings that weren't looked upon favorably at the time).  They had the reigning 2xMVP and a soon to be DPOY on their team with a 3rd all-star who will probably be the 2nd greatest shooter in history and a 6th man that won FMVP 2 years ago.    Then Kevin Durant, the 2nd best player in the world, joined them.  I'm so tired of seeing people compare literally any other move to KD joining the warriors.  There was nothing even kind of similar in recent memory and probably won't be anything like it for a decent amount of time.  "

"I don't necessarily hate KD. I just think it was a weak move. That said, JJ's analysis was spot on. Here's the full context:  &gt;On the most recent episode of The JJ Redick Podcast, the 76ers shooting guard was answering a mailbag question about DeMar DeRozan being traded to the Spurs against his will.  &gt;&gt;""This is why I love what Kevin Durant did in going to Golden State. You should look at your career as sort of squeezing out every ounce of money, joy, winning, team -- whatever it is you prioritize -- squeeze that out,"" Redick explained.  &gt;&gt;""There is so much you can't control. When you have an opportunity to do what you actually want to do, you have to take it.""  &gt;Redick also explained why he believes there is a racial component when it comes to players leaving in free agency.  &gt;&gt;""When a player, and a lot of professional athletes are African-American in football and basketball, tries to sort of enact control on his career -- Kevin Durant goes to the Warriors -- there's a lot of backlash,"" Redick said. ""When white owners and white GMs, primarily, when they make a trade that they deem in the best interest of their organization, they don't receive that same backlash. Why is that?""  &gt;Redick laughed after he asked the question, implying that the reasoning is obvious.  &gt;He then continued:  &gt;&gt;""Every time there's a work stoppage in any sport, the overwhelming majority of fans are upset at the African-American athletes and not the rich, white owners who are squeezing every last dollar they can -- who are already profitable and are already rich.  &gt;&gt;""Again, there's a racial component to this.""  JJ's talking about players taking advantage of situations because there's only so much that you can do as a worker. You don't have control as the worker, despite what the entire bullshit narrative is that Prager ""University"" peddles."
"&gt; &gt;Lebron Is The Most Overrated Player In The League  &gt;  &gt;Kevin Durant is a million times better than him    LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO yo Kevin.. Chill out on them burners boy. Stop embarrassing yourself already, for fuck's sake. This is getting more and more pathetic"
"From the article:  &gt; Redick also explained why he believes there is a racial component when it comes to players leaving in free agency.

sooooo Kevin Durant on reddit too? damn 
"Curry had the best defensive rating of any of the Warriors' starters in the finals this past season.  Pretty sure it was like that in the WCF too.  That's a group that includes Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant.  People harp on his defensive game because it never looks like he affects the shot, but he's doing a lot more than people think on defense."
" For one Kevin Durant took a lot of heat because he went to the team that won 73 games and had them up 3-1. Where is the racial component in that. Secondly, the NBA is pretty much a free marker and the players can dictatare their careers. I'm starting to think JJ is a moron."

Imagine  dropping 40/8/5 on 18 shots in a WCF and nobody noticing nor you not at all being the best player on the court that game.   That's what happened to Kevin Durant. Incredible game and Dirk literally just scoffed and one uped him like it was nothing

"I was actually gonna make a post like this as well. The Based God's curse is, in my opinion, one of the most important pieces in modern basketball history.   Let's also not forget he cursed Kevin Durant for about 5 years and I fully believe it is why that OKC core always failed and had injuries. Lil B even made a god damn song about KD! It was a real hit honestly.    https://youtu.be/HBQ2mjkvYY8    I'm just saying the year KD joined the warriors the curse was lifted and KD went on to win Finals MVP.    The Based God Curse is real"
"Yea people here revising history already. Westbrook led the thunder to 47 wins after losing Kevin fucking Durant. Any other team loses a player like that, they drop by more than 20+ wins and out the playoffs  Averaging a triple double and all that gave him the hype but don't act like he wasn't carrying a team that just lost a top 2 player FOR NOTHING. "
You can still be called 2nd and be underrated.   People act like LeBron is in an entirely different tier. Kevin Durant is RIGHT there with him if you consider all aspects of basketball.   People pretend as if theres still an oceans difference between LeBron and KD. Thats where the underrated part comes to. Its like the people who act like Kobe wasnt near Shaw during their 3peat. In the 2nd and 3rd years Shaw was better but he definitely wasnt carrying Kobe. 
"On crossovers and post ups too!  https://youtu.be/n34p7-wThcs  Kevin Durant isn't the only one who does it, but he does it so blatantly and never gets called for it it's amazing."
"Kevin Durant.     Guy outplayed the so called best player in the world back to back years and won FMVP back to back.  He has zero weakness in his offensive game and is an elite defender.  In contrast Lebron is below average on defense and is average or below average scorer everywhere on the floor except in the restricted area.  Outside the restricted area Lebron is shooting 36% FG and 52% TS.  KD is literally the perfect modern scorer and perfect stretch big on defense (elite rim protector plus ability to switch 1-5 on pick and roll)  He clearly is the best today.  His defense is several tiers higher than Leborn.  He's a much better shooter, more efficient scorer, and easier to fit Star players with."
"I got one for you:  Kevin Durant  UBR  Legendary Creature - Snake  Flying, Menace, Haste  When Kevin Durant dies, return it to the battlefield under target opponent's control.  3/1"
Kevin Durant.  Heard he's a pretty good player.
"Back in my day, MJ was beat by a hammer for 48 minutes. An actual hammer! If Curry played in my era he would have had to transition into a woman and play in the WNBA. Ha! Lebron James would have cried to David Stern and tell em ""You're fired"" in that Trump voice. Kevin Durant? Another Luke Longely. James Harden? MJ would have chewed on his beard for strength. Now that was a man's game."

"Colin Sexton wins ROY, averages 19/4/5 on 43% FG. Porzingis declines sharply, Knox takes over the Knicks.  Suns are 9-10th seed in the West. Win 40+games. Giannis ends up 2nd in MVP race, averaging 28/10/6. Develops a solid jumper. Melo comes back somewhat, averaging a solid 16 points on career high splits. Lebron (surprisingly) takes a slightly lesser role, averaging 23/7/9 on far less minutes. Still finishes top 5 MVP voting. Fultz comes back as the Most Improved Player, playing 80 games and averaging 17/3/6 off the bench with 38% 3pt percentage.  And finally, probably my most absurd yet plausible prediction, but Kevin Durant goes off, averages 28/10/7 with 2 blocks and 1 steal on 51/43/92 splits playing 40 minutes a game. Wins DPOY and MVP."

"Cristiano Ronaldo has more Instagram followers than the NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, PGA Tour, Nascar, Lebron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Tom Brady, and the Golden State Warriors *combined*. "
"Well Kevin Durant is 40 stories tall, it makes sense"
Paul George is not Kevin Durant or LeBron.  You’re really missing all the shades of grey.
Ok let me draw this for you   Best players in the league on the past 5 years :  LeBron James   *6km road*  Kevin Durant  *Literally a black hole here*  Stephen Curry  *ANOTHER BLACK HOLE EVEN BIGGER THAN THE ONE BEFORE*  Maybe the guy that hasn't played for one season.  
&gt;1. Kevin Durant 2. LeBron James  [Why you gotta do this man] (https://media.giphy.com/media/HwmB7t7krGnao/giphy.gif)
"My ranking is controversial and I get that, but here it is anyway:  1) LeBron James  2) Kawhi Leonard  3) Kevin Durant  4) Stephen Curry  5) James Harden  6) Anthony Davis  7) Russell Westbrook  8) Giannis Antetokounmpo  9) Jimmy Butler  10) Paul George   "
"""Plus he keeps it real and could not care less what people think of him"" Are we thinking of the same Kevin Durant? He has burner accounts and argues with NBA fans about himself."
Yeah but did Kevin Durant join the Cavs after 2016? 
"There is this principle in econ called Goodhart’s law ""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."" A basketball example that proves this would be a guy like david west or even Kevin Durant to a degree. When players make these decisions to prioritize a ring above all else, it really does change how that ring should be compared vs other rings. The example I see on this sub a lot is dirks ring &gt; kds rings. The ultimate target is a ring, thus making it an unreliable measure."
"Ah, Lance Thomas! Our ticket for signing Kevin Durant."
"I think Giannis is higher than Westbrook, and I'd put Damian Lillard at #9 or 10. I don't quite think Oladipo is top 10 yet. IMO  1. LeBron  2. Kevin Durant  3. Harden  4. Steph Curry  5. AD  6. Giannis  7. Kawhi Leonard  8. Westbrook  9. Damian Lillard  10. Joel Embiid "
Should've taken lessons from Kevin Durant.
"KD wasn't a great defender when he came into the league, and yes Larry was a better defender than young KD (which is what you're thinking), but Larry is definitely not a better defender than the KD of today.  &gt;It’s been a long time since Durant was a net negative on defense but he seemed to emerge as a real defensive force in the Oklahoma City Thunder’s near-upset of the Golden State Warriors in the 2016 Western Conference Finals. **Durant’s switchiness and defensive versatility were incredibly disruptive** in that series and he’s taken things to another level since joining the Warriors.  &gt;We can use the NBA’s new matchup box scores to **illustrate Durant’s versatility** this season. Take for example, Golden State’s Jan. 20 matchup with the Houston Rockets. You can **see below just how many different players and positions Durant spent time guarding during that game** (defensive matchups are assigned based on which offensive player the defender was assigned to for the majority of the possession).  &gt;We can see his defensive impact across multiple areas with other metrics as well. **He’s a very capable perimeter defender -- ranking in the 80th percentile as an isolation defender** and averaging 1.1 steals per 100 possessions. With the Warriors, Durant is often playing up a position in small ball lineups (particularly defensively) and his development as a big defender has been crucial.  &gt;So far this season, **Durant ranks in the 71st percentile as a post-up defender and he’s one of just 24 players in the league to be averaging at least 2.5 blocks and one steal per 100 possessions.** It is this development as a rim protector and interior defender that seems to have made the biggest difference in Durant’s defensive impact and reputation.  Larry had to be hidden on defense because he was too slow. And he obviously wasn't a rim protector. He did well as a free safety, but you can't call that better defense than the abnormally quick 7 foot super-athlete defending the rim and switching on to anyone you ask him to. That's ridiculous.

And Mr. Dirk Nowitzi. And Kevin Durant recently as well.   Tbh the fadeaway jumpshot is nowhere near dead. 
"Kevin Durant is one of the most underrated post defenders in the Association are you sure about that? To be fair it really only became true in WCF vs GS in 2016 when he Kanter and Adams would all be on the floor at once. Still don't get how they gave up that 3-1 lead :(   edit: Obviously you're right about the passing, and Bird was easily the superior rebounder too."
"My brother thinks the Warriors championships literally should not be counted. They should be voided because Kevin Durant ruined the league blah blah cry cry blah       (It enrages him that I don't hate the Durant or the Warriors, so he goes on very long angry tirades when we get together)"
Baron Davis  Chris Mullins  Rick Barry  Kevin Durant   Wilt Chamberlain 
Kevin Durant is a Golden State Warrior. 
"I agree. And Larry Bird would be like Kevin Durant, but a better defender and much, much better passer. "
"you guys are ridiculous. a little too emotional.  the dust has settled and he has conveyed his thanks. this was a rough situation all around. it was not exactly amicable, he demanded a trade.  i do think he's conveyed his genuine sincere thanks here though. dude is not lebron james or kevin durant to make a big deal and write a players tribune article each time he makes a decision."
So you have Kevin Durant higher than Bill Russell on your all-time rankings I presume? 
"PG County in Maryland Markelle Fultz Victor Oladipo Kevin Durant Jeff Green Jerami Grant  Ty Lawson, Quinn Cook, Rodney McGruder"
"Almost everybody acknowledges that.  Where people differ is in their criteria for GOAT rankings. Some say you should judge players relative to their era and with respect to the limits on things like travel accommodations, equipment, nutrition, knowledge of the human body, etc. Others say you should judge purely on on-the-court skills.  All of this ignores rule changes/changes in enforcement as well. Kevin Durant would be called for a carry every time he dribbled if it were 1950. "
"&gt; at least he fought and got the rebound over Kevin Durant  Idk what Durant was doing, he just checked out. Guess he assumed Hill would make it. If it led to a game winner then Durant would've gotten roasted."

You are completely delusional if you think the criticism LeBron got was even close to this. No one except Celtics fans still hated Kevin LeBron after year two in Miami. No NBA player has ever faced the ongoing criticism that KD has. Your other examples are just stupid. They had nothing close to Durant.
Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me.  -Kevin Durant
He donated [1 million dollars](https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/21/oklahoma-city-thunder-star-kevin-durant-pledges-1-million-for-tornado-relief/amp/) .  
"What a pointless response. We’re here discussing the NBA and it’s players. It’s a discussion about Kevin Durant and why he’s gets hate on the internet. You’re here, too. We all are. "
"Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Jordan Bell, Nikola Jokic, Gary Harris "
"Idk I’m a married adult and I argue with people online about basketball more often than I should, difference is it doesn’t blow up in my face because I’m not a celebrity. Don’t get me wrong, I will make fun of Kevin Durant until he’s in blue and orange again or until one of us dies but I’m what you’d call salty over his move. At the end of the day we’re not so different, Kevin and I."
"Plenty of other bigs box out for other, quicker players to get the rebound (for example, Brook Lopez does it a lot). I don't see how its a problem when it helps the team get into their offense quicker. If Russ' triple doubles didn't lead to wins, then sure, I'd get it. But they do so I don't have a problem with it. Adams does the exact same thing when Russ is off court too. That's just how he plays.  I also don't get the criticism that he tried to get triple doubles. If any of us could do something historic like that, we would. I don't see how going for one of these goals is an issue if it doesn't hurt the team (which it didn't. It actually helped).   How did it get exposed? Russ averaged 12 rebounds a game in that series and Adams averaged 7.5. Utah averaged 2.8 rebounds more than the Thunder per game and that was pretty expected because they play two traditional bigs at the 4 and 5 spots. OKC had Grant and Patterson playing the 5 + neither of them have the size to match up against bigger bodies like Gobert or Favors.    People assume that they are gimmicked up because as players, they aren't that good. Jacking up a bunch of 3s isn't necessarily helpful to the team, otherwise we'd see Steph launch 30 of them a game. Also, literally no one turns a blind eye to Russ. He's defintely the most criticised superstar on this sub.   The 2017 Thunder squad went up against a great Houston team where Andre Roberson was the 2nd leading scorer. The team was very young (the youngest in the playoffs, that year) and that often leads to players not showing up when they're needed. We saw that again this year in Cleveland, where Clarkson + Hood were both poor. This year, Utah targeted Melo relentlessly and Melo was a poor offensive player too. I can't remember the exact stat (you can find it on the Lowe Post episode with Royce Young iirc) but on possessions that Melo was switched onto the offensive player, they scored at a rate that was better than how Kevin Durant scores on any possession. PG also struggled and was playing hurt (he then had surgery as soon as the season finished). The team had no depth at all and it showed. Those two losses were definitely not on Russ."
I just wonder how this would fare pre-Kevin Durant move. And then minus GSW completely.

"Come on, why involve Kevin Durant in this"
"&gt;Kevin Durant is a great player and a great kid  Problem is, KD is 29. He's a full grown man who's acting like a kid."
"""Kevin Durant has been admitted to the hospital""    But seriously, Barkley must be incredibly tough to play against "
Kevin Durant spat in my mouth once. He didn't apologized.
Kevin Durant attacked and burned down my village.
Now I want to see Charles Barkley in his MVP season after a summer worth of conditioning with today's technologies against Kevin Durant.
"&gt; Durant argued that it was McCollum, and not Durant himself, who was “upset” by the exchange. The two-time Finals MVP also said that the media has inaccurately labeled him as sensitive.  &gt; Barkley wasn’t buying that interpretation of events in the slightest.  &gt; “Who’s got thinner skin: Shaquille O’Neal or Kevin Durant? They’ve both got thin skin like Flat Stanley,” he quipped, referencing author Jeff Brown’s children’s book series whose title character was flattened by a bulletin board. “They need to just chill out.”   Lmaoo"
'Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.'  -Kevin Durant  --Michael Scott
I actually cry myself to sleep every night because Kevin Durant has disappointed me so much.
I'm not sure how such an incredibly simple point has apparently confused at least two people. Let me try again.  Kevin Durant is good at basketball. People respect him as a basketball player.  Kevin Durant seems like kind of a wiener. People generally don't respect him as a person.  Was that easier?
"&gt;He’s so worried about what other people say. Kevin Durant is a great player and a great kid. I was one of those guys who criticized him for going to Golden State, but he doesn’t have to respond every time someone says something about it.  I loved this take from Barkley.   Verbally accosting everyone who accuses him of being soft doesn’t make them any more amenable to his point of view. Granted, I don’t know if there’s much he can do at this point other than leaving GSW outright to salve some of the hurt he’s caused fans, but perhaps engaging them in verbal warfare isn’t the best solution "
"For all the people who think it's clearly KD &gt; Kawhi, [here's a side by side comparison of their age 25 seasons](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id1_select=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id1=leonaka01&amp;y1=2017&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;y2=2014). Extremely close IMO, especially knowing that the area where Kawhi shines the most (defense) is terribly represented in stats. Also note Kawhi's absolutely bonkers ORTG in the playoffs until Zaza.  edit: [Here's age 24](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id1_select=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id1=leonaka01&amp;y1=2016&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;y2=2013). Kawhi is a god in the playoffs. "
I implied that Kevin Durant won’t get it. He got 54 as the main option.  
"Cousins is out.  I believe Draymond stays, but Klay departs. The Warriors will attempt to fill the hole by signing an elite shooter.  Kevin Durant seriously considers other teams, but ends up staying.  Andre Iguodala retires, Shaun Livingston ponders retirement.  Warriors lose some power, but are still top of West. "
"*checks username and flair*  You too, Kevin Durant "
Kevin Durant on the pelicans very interesting 
"I read this and expected it to say Kevin Durant, but nope, just more trump trash"
Kevin Durant 
"Kawhi was 1st team all-nba and 1st team all-defense in 2017. Kevin Durant and Steph Curry were both 2nd team, and neither made an all-defense team."
"I guess you hate him because he’s excellent then? In a vacuum, I don’t think you would. I hate Kevin Durant because he prevented LeBron from winning a few titles but I think Durant is amazing. I don’t like to hate on players just because they’re good players against my team (at least after the series is over)."
"LeBron was literally born and raised in Ohio, and spent the first 7 years of his insane career there. As emotionally attached as Kevin Durant might've become to Oklahoma in his 8 years there, it really isn't the same as LeBron's situation. He was born and raised in the DC area."
I don’t support any team I’m a player fan. My favorite players are kyrie irving Kevin durant and kawhi Leonard. And again I don’t hate lebron i think he’s a great person I just don’t like his playstyle or his stans 
"This is actually kind of fun, sort of fanduelish.  Not sure about 82-0 but my first instinct is something like this:  **PG** - Kyrie Irving ($2)  **SG** - Bradley Beal ($1)  **SF** - Kevin Durant ($5)  **PF** - Lebron James ($5)  **C** - Rudy Gobert ($2)"
"The mighty Kevin Durant and Russel Westbrook couldn't even beat the pre-KD Warriors, please stop."
1 - Kyrie Iriving (2)  2 - Victor Oladipo (2)  3 - LeBron James (5)  4 - Kevin Durant (5)  5 - Al Horford (1)
"I mean luc was arguably our best defender, even if he isn't as good individually as Andre it's probably a more impactful loss. Plus the fact that even without Andre you have Steph curry, klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, draymond green, etc, you can afford to lose a player. The rockets can't really afford to lose any rotational players against you guys, so again it's a much more significant loss for us. "
I loved Donovan Mitchell's response. I loved all their responses honestly. I think we need a LIL B remix of fuck Kevin Durant. 🎶FUCKKKK DONALD TRUMPPPP🎶FUCKKKK DONALD TRUMPPPP🎶
"I mean we took a team with Kevin Durant, a player better than WB, and two other all stars to 7. It’s not as simple as you’re making it sound"
"OKC in 6   Seriously who would pick 34 year old Cp3 and Harden over Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook? Plus people forget we had a lot of good role players at that time including Andre Roberson, Steven Adams, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter, Dion Waiters"
73 win team + Kevin Durant? Without a doubt. 
"It's because most people here only started watching basketball recently when the Warriors got good.   Kevin Durant was 21 years old when he finished 2nd in MVP voting to Lebron, back in 2010. He's been widely regarded as the second best player in the NBA for the better part of a decade. It's nothing against Steph who is obviously one of the greatest guards of all time, but KD has a much longer track record as an overall dominant player. "
"Basketball is a sport inherently biased towards bigger players.   Look at any list of the top 10 basketball players. Outside of Jordan and maybe Kobe (who are 6'6) every other player is going to be 6'9 and above. LBJ, Magic, Kareem, Wilt, Russell, Bird, etc etc  Kevin Durant is 7' tall , long and extremely agile and athletic. This makes him harder to stop in playoff type situations where teams are more physical and smaller players like Steph can be roughed up. In addition Durant is several orders of magnitude more impactful on defense than Steph.   All-around, KD is just a greater threat on the court . I bet if you asked 99% of NBA players they'd tell you that Durant is the tougher matchup for them.  "
"First of all, let me say this: I hate when ranking are universally accepted. I think people having different opinions is totally normal, and you shouldn’t be shamed for thinking for example Kobe is better than LeBron or LeBron is better than MJ. Lets get into why KD is always ranked as a top 2 player right now when Curry sometimes does not crack the top 3.  TRANSCENDENT SCORER: Kevin Durant is a 4 time NBA scoring leader, despite playing his whole career with one or more ball dominant players. I have never, in my years of watching the NBA, seen a smoother scorer. He averages 27.1 ppg for his career on incredible 49/38/88 shooting FOR HIS CAREER. Including down years and being a young player, he has shown to be completely dominant from basically everywhere inside half court.  NOT JUST A SCORER: KD is in most people opinions, including mine, the best scorer in the league. He is somehow much more than a scorer. He has career averages of 7 rebounds and 4 assists per night. He has improved his passing throughout his career, going from not averaging 3 assists until his 5th year to consistently putting up 4.5-5.5 a night. He has averaged 8 or more rebounds a night three times. He averages over 1 steal and one block per game for his career, including a videogame-esque 1.8 bpg last year.  UNREAL PHYSICALS: Kevin Durant came into the league listed as 6’9, which is a little above average for a small forward. He has admitted this was a lie to avoid playing the power forward spot. He is actually a near 7 footer at least, with the handling and passing of a point guard. He is so athletic and smooth for his size. Like Curry, he was mocked for his strength (or lack thereof), but has shown he is so physically gifted everywhere else that it legitimately does not matter.  Stephen Curry is hands-down the best shooter in the history of our sport. He is an underrated passer and defender. He is NOT as good of a scorer as Kevin Durant. He is NOT as good of a team defender as Kevin Durant. Curry is by no means one dimensional, but Kevin Durants is a much more complex scorer, and with his unbelievable size, he is basically un-guardable. It is not ridiculous to say Curry is better than Durant, but Durant is clearly a player that we may never see again. He has basically everything you could ever want (on the court) to make him a superstar."
because Kevin Durant is better at the game of basketball overall than Steph Curry   Edit: this being downvoted means the curry stans are out in full force. KD is the best total scorer in the NBA and he's a better defender than Curry. These are not hard to figure out.

"I remember reading some in-retrospect analysis that went basically like this: Kevin Durant was expected to be nearly or exactly what he is today; at Texas, he was a transcendent player and scorer with massive length who could completely change the trajectory of a franchise. And Greg Oden was the better prospect.  "
"&gt;Kevin Durant Exposes LeBron's Overrated Defense   LMFAO y'all kids are so delusional, and also lack self awareness. Context is key. LeBron had to carry the entire offensive load, basically just carry that whole team throughout the entire playoffs, playing 40+ minutes each game, at age 33.. Put Durant in that trash Cavs team, and put LeBron in the 73 win GSW team, filled with Curry, Klay, Draymond and other insanely great role players. What happens?  &gt;   Cavs don't even make it to the finals. And GSW? They would have been this same exact dynasty, winning every championships regardless, and LeBron winning Finals MVPs as usual. Hell, GSW would have actually been better with LeBron instead of Durant, because Bron would have capitalized Curry's shooting on a whole different level.  Oh, and no teams could have bullied Curry defense anymore as well, because LeBron would have been bullying everyone the whole time  &gt;  Now that i think of it, damn.. That would have been fun to watch"

"&gt; All his teammates say otherwise. And surely you don't think he's the most immature player in the league. What's the most immature thing he's done, compared to what Kevin Durant has done? Lol...  Please provide me examples of players talking shit about another player.  It doesn't happen.  Of course his teammates are going to say they support him -- if they say otherwise they further erode team chemistry.  You don't go after the leader -- especially not an egomaniac like Westbrook.  You'd get kicked off the team faster than you can blink.  &gt;e has a bone to pick with a few reporters, namely Barry Tramel due to how he reported on KD (""Mr. Unreliable""). I firmly believe that you're basing your opinion off of very few clips of him being rude over a decade. Seriously watch his other media highlights where he answers questions respectively and sometimes make some funny jokes with the media  So it's just one reporter?  That's funny, because I've seen him sarcastically and angrily respond to an entire troupe of reporters at pressers.  &gt;That is an objectively false and sensational statement.  Yeah?  Do you know a lot of other players who take 28 foot 3s with 10+ seconds left on the shot clock?  By all means provide me with those players.  Do you know a lot of players that shoot worse than 3-17 in a quarter?  By all means, show me.  I'm open to being wrong here -- but you have to say more than ""it's objectively false"".  Westbrook takes -- quite literally -- some of the worst shots I've ever seen a player take in the NBA.  They're baffling.  Even the announcers who usually have a bullshit excuse when a player does something often are left speechless when he gets it in his head to shoot.  &gt;Can someone get me stats on how many times he's done that? And while you're at it, can you compare it to other players in the league. Not denying that Westbrook takes some pretty bad shots, but you're pretending like he takes them every other possesion. Again, selectively looking at and amplifying the worst of him.  I am?  Please tell me where I said this instead of strawmanning my position.  That does nothing but strengthen my argument.  3/17 in a single playoff quarter is something you're really going to have to prove isn't damning in this case though, because we're talking about playoff success and that is absolutely an anathema to winning playoff series.  &gt;Again, that is an objectively false statement considering the fact that he's consistently the highest energy player in the game. He's a hardworker when it comes to winning, and if you've watched all the times OKC beat the Spurs in the playoffs, you would agree.  Lol, trying to make a dig at my team to make it an emotional argument instead of objectively addressing the issue?  That's a cornerstone of a terrible argument.  Also tends to fall flat when the ring count is 5 to 0, 4 if you're counting active Spurs.  lol  https://www.sbnation.com/2017/11/22/16693192/russell-westbrook-defense-thunder-controller-nba-2k  lol  https://thebiglead.com/2017/03/24/is-russell-westbrook-padding-his-rebounding-stats-by-leaving-his-defender-stats-say-he-is/  lol  **Westbrook ranks dead last in the NBA in contested shots among players averaging 30 or more MPG by a considerable margin. Hilariously, the only two players who have contested less 3P FGA’s are Rudy Gobert and Whiteside, who have contested 53 and 64 respectively. Russell Westbrook is at 69 while having playing [sic] close to the same amount of minutes…Yes, DeAndre Jordan has contested more 3P FGA’s this season than Russell Westbrook.**  HIGH ENERGY  &gt;And so you have an opinion, but it's very clearly based on you selectively picking out the worst parts of Westbrook and amplifying them. Nevermind the fact that all players in the NBA have their shitty moments.  What's funny is that you claim I'm so biased and that you're much more objective, yet you've offered exactly 0 statistical evidence to argue the point.  You're just gainsaying my comments and pretending like you're winning the argument.  Again, that's objectively terrible especially when you're mixing it in with strawmen and emotional appeals.  &gt;All of Westbrook's teammates and former teammates have commented at just how selfless and great of a teammate he is. And I'm willing to bet that anyone who actually watches Westbrook play, not just going through post game threads, streamable highlights, and twitter opinions, will disagree with you.  So now you're ad homineming me by claiming I don't watch the games, okay, well, we'll throw that onto the logical fallacy pile.  In the meantime, you're making your first point yet again -- and as we all know, NBA players are SUPREME judges of talent -- as evidenced by how terribly players who become coaches are at scouting and evaluating talent.  You managed to fit an appeal to authority fallacy in as well, and in this case it's frankly a terrible one.  &gt;Nevermind the fact that all players in the NBA have their shitty moments.  Most of them, especially MVPs, actually learn and adapt their game.  If anything, Westbrook has become worse over time with his shot selection and tunnel vision."
Kevin Durant needs more
"I think you have a very skewed view of what Westbrook is. I'm not gonna break down all of your statements because that's gonna take too much time, but        &gt; He is insanely selfish, attention-seeking, possibly the most immature player in the league  All his teammates say otherwise. And surely you don't think he's the *most immature* player in the league. What's the most immature thing he's done, compared to what Kevin Durant has done? Lol...       &gt; is generally rude and abrasive to media who are just trying to do their jobs.      He's definitely done some rude shit to the media, but if you've watched his regular antics around pressers, you see he's a pretty happy and fun guy with the media. He has a bone to pick with a few reporters, namely Barry Tramel due to how he reported on KD (""Mr. Unreliable""). I firmly believe that you're basing your opinion off of very few clips of him being rude over a decade. Seriously watch his other media highlights where he answers questions respectively and sometimes make some funny jokes with the media       &gt;he has the worst shot selection this side of Antoine Walker      That is an objectively false and sensational statement.       &gt;he never seems to truly take responsibility for the losses the team inevitably accumulates when he goes 5-17, 6-23, or goes 3-17 in a single QUARTER of a playoff game.      He *always* takes responsibilities of his bad performance. Again, watch him speak after games for once and you'll see that. You're nitpicking out Westbrook's worst performances and painting his entire game with brush, and that's ridiculous       &gt;And can we talk about a guy who shoots from 30 feet with 14 seconds left on the shot clock? Sure he makes them occasionally...       Can someone get me stats on how many times he's done that? And while you're at it, can you compare it to other players in the league. Not denying that Westbrook takes some pretty bad shots, but you're pretending like he takes them every other possesion. Again, selectively looking at and amplifying the worst of him.       &gt; If there's not a box score change in it for him, he essentially dozes off on the court for long stretches of time, even if it means leaving Steph Curry wide open.      Again, that is an objectively false statement considering the fact that he's consistently the highest energy player in the game. He's a hardworker when it comes to winning, and if you've watched all the times OKC beat the Spurs in the playoffs, you would agree.      &gt;So yeah. I hate Westbrook. I think he is an impossibly selfish star who cares more about individual...better shot than a teammate who's wide open.      And so you have an opinion, but it's very clearly based on you selectively picking out the worst parts of Westbrook and amplifying them. Nevermind the fact that all players in the NBA have their shitty moments.       All of Westbrook's teammates and former teammates have commented at just how selfless and great of a teammate he is. And I'm willing to bet that anyone who *actually* watches Westbrook play, not just going through post game threads, streamable highlights, and twitter opinions, will disagree with you."
"I’m sorry but name a current player has said a negative thing about an above average player? Maybe there’s current players who have said DeMar has bad defense? Maybe?  Players will only compliment other players because they know their words are going to get taken out of context. And as for superstars, reporters aren’t going to talk about off-ball offense. Especially players turned reporters. They refuse to talk bad.  Russ is a phenomenal player. Phenomenal. But he also has some areas he can vastly improve in. I am someone who has defended Westbrook’s MVP season over and over, but saying “well Shaq hasn’t said anything” means nothing because players don’t critique other players. Especially over the air.  Westbrook’s playstyle is great for regular season, but does not work well in the post-season unless you have literally Kevin Durant with you. Having a hero-baller who doesn’t always take the best shot doesn’t work when a team plays harder defense and is specifically planning for you. See: Toronto Raptors playoff performances.   Hopefully PG without Melo and a healthy Roberson is a different story, but we’ll have to wait and see."
I drunkenly proclaimed that once his career was over Kevin Durant would be rated better than Michael Jordan and become the new GOAT. This was during the 2012-2013 regular season. KD is an amazing player but I got way too ahead of myself.
More like Dwight Howard becomes Anthony Davis or Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
"&gt; u basically said he's a good defender and that he scores 20 ppg. None of that makes him  &gt; not &gt;  an exceptionally good 3&amp;D player.  Having great players who are able to fit in with other great players is how you assemble a great team. I think you are *vastly* underrating Klay Thompson. The ability to dominate, to have a huge impact *without* needing the ball is actually a much more rare and valuable skill in the NBA today. In my life time, the only player who compares to him is Ray Allen, but Klay is a better shooter and he accepts the role of guarding the other teams best player on one end, and runs around like mad off the ball on the other. [The guy scored 37 points in a quarter for goodness sakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nyBpt9tRsg).

Kevin Durant
"Steph Curry had the best season that year, he was not the most talented player by any means. That has undoubtedly been LeBron non-stop from 2008.  Kevin Durant has had better seasons, Curry has had better seasons, Harden and Westbrook have had better seasons.  None of them come close to being the most important and talented player on any team in the NBA, which is LeBron.     Even in hindsight, given what we knew about 2015, not a single GM would start their team with Curry over LeBron."
"Thats just a personal criticism because you don’t like him. Karl Malone did far worse acts than arguing with kids on Twitter. Doesn’t change the fact that he’s gone down in history as an undisputed top 5 PF  If you are ranking the greatest players of all time based on total career, Kevin Durant is already more relevant and higher on that list than Dirk."
"&gt; while frequently doubled and certainly drawing a ton of attention, is not magically facing half-court doubles every single play.  I said 3pt line lol.  &gt; Most players are not cheating off Kevin Durant to give extra attention to off-ball Curry.  You understand we have other players on the court?  "
"That's the thing, Dirk doesn't have a better legacy.. Durant has already passed him in 1st-Team All-NBA selections, championships, Finals MVPs, and is clearly statistically superior when you look at raw numbers.   Kevin Durant is objectively higher all time than Nowitzki if he retired right now.. people just hate him and they love Dirk so they won't admit it to themselves. "
"Curry didn't even play in 6 games and Steph, while frequently doubled and certainly drawing a ton of attention, is not magically facing half-court doubles every single play. Most players are not cheating off Kevin Durant to give extra attention to off-ball Curry.  ""Curry's gravity"" is honestly the most overblown phenomenon I've ever seen in basketball. I feel like it has to just be a young generation of fans coming in and embracing the meme."
"Dude. Klay is dropping 20ppg on excellent efficiency while on the same team as Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. He's an excellent defender, and (so far) a three time champion, and he's only 28 going on 29 this upcoming season.   I think it's hugely disrespectful to call him a very good 3&amp;D player, anymore than saying Manu was basically a very good sixth man.   "
Obligatory fuck Kevin Durant.
"No, Kawhi isn't underrated.  Kawhi hasn't played NBA basketball at the same level he was playing at since Zaza assassinated him.   It is fair for him to not be considered Top 5 due to this.  Kevin Durant being overrated... It's pretty difficult to overrate him, even if he is unlikable. He was the best player for the champs in the playoffs and a repeat finals MVP."

"Text just in case you're behind a paywall  &gt; okyo &gt;  &gt; Nanae Yamano, a 43-year-old stay-at-home mother in the Tokyo suburbs, was bored doing laundry one morning a few years ago when she turned on her television and found herself oddly transfixed by the NBA. &gt;  &gt; It was by pure serendipity that she tuned into this 2012 playoff game between the San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder. She was not an NBA fan. In fact she knew pretty much nothing about the NBA. Which is why her attention gravitated toward the one player who was unlike anyone else on the court in such an obvious way that even she could see it. Yamano was captivated by Russell Westbrook. &gt;  &gt; “I saw Westbrook play for the first time and thought: What a weird guy,” she said through a translator recently before adding in English: “Isn’t he weird? So weird!” &gt;  &gt; He was so weird that she hasn’t been able to stop thinking about him since. Westbrook and the Thunder have become Nanae Yamano’s obsession. &gt;  &gt; Nanae Yamono is a 43-year-old stay-at-home mother in the Tokyo suburbs. &gt; Nanae Yamono is a 43-year-old stay-at-home mother in the Tokyo suburbs.

She has never been to Oklahoma City. Or the United States. Or anywhere outside Japan. “I don’t even have a passport,” Yamano said. &gt;  &gt; Fans gather to watch NBA games at Ball Tongue in Tokyo. &gt; Fans gather to watch NBA games at Ball Tongue in Tokyo. PHOTO: BEN COHEN / THE WALL STREET JOURNAL &gt; But she has NBA League Pass, Twitter and Instagram accounts and so much time for basketball that she doesn’t have to bother clearing her schedule. “Actually,” Yamano said, “I have no schedule.” She sends her son to school, and then she watches the Thunder. &gt;  &gt; She went from not knowing anything about the NBA to knowing everything there was to know about the Thunder. By the 2016 season, she was beginning to suffer the miserable anxiety of caring way too much about sports. Like other fans, she worried about the possibility of Kevin Durant leaving Oklahoma City. Unlike other fans, she coped by inventing a universe in which Durant and Westbrook could peacefully coexist. &gt;  &gt; “I couldn’t write, because I’m not a writer,” she said, “so I started drawing.” &gt;  &gt; Her depictions of Durant and Westbrook were delightfully absurd. Each one was a tiny burst of unexpected and sometimes inexplicable joy. &gt;  &gt; But things didn’t work out the way she hoped. The Thunder lost to the Warriors in the playoffs that season and lost Durant to the Warriors that summer. &gt;  &gt; Yamano was always going to take Westbrook’s side in the breakup. He is her muse. His manic style of play inspires her for the same reason it once intrigued her. “He seems really unstable,” Yamano said, “but that’s actually his stable state.” That is what she adores about him and why she can’t help but feel protective of him. &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; PHOTOS: COURTESY OF NANAE YAMONO(2) &gt; He matured into the NBA’s Most Valuable Player, and she expressed herself through her art. Yamano chronicled Oklahoma City’s season by releasing a sketch after every game—color for wins, black and white for losses—and what happened next is the kind of thing that happens when artists create something unlike anything else that already exists. &gt;  &gt; She was discovered. People started paying attention to her work. Some of those people happened to play for the Thunder. &gt;  &gt; Oklahoma City center Steven Adams thought her sketches were funny enough that he made sure they spread around the locker room. “Sent them over to the lads,” Adams said. “It’s quite unique what she’s doing.” &gt;  &gt; Adams isn’t the only player who feels that way. Domantas Sabonis once tweeted a Yamano—he’s holding Westbrook’s hand—which is one of the reasons she was bummed when he was traded not long afterward. “I really miss Sabonis,” Yamano said. But the basketball fan in her understood that Oklahoma City’s roster needed an upgrade. She was so proud of Thunder general manager Sam Presti’s ninja efforts in the off-season that she honored him with his own illustration. &gt;  &gt; Her fans ask Yamano how they can buy her work and where she lives in Oklahoma. She responds by saying it’s not for sale. And she lives in Japan. &gt;  &gt; Adams had no idea. He was extremely pleased. &gt;  &gt; “Oh, amaaaaaaazing,” he said. &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Yamano says she actually prefers watching the Thunder from the other side of the world. She doesn’t think she can handle the NBA in person. “Too much,” she said through a translator, Reo Onishi, who runs a website called Bulls Fan in Japan. “I’m already crazy as is just by watching them through League Pass. If I go to a game, I don’t know what would happen to myself.” &gt;  &gt; There was one recent Saturday night game—or Sunday morning game—that was bound to stir those emotions in Yamano. She organized a small party in Tokyo anyway. Which is how she found herself inside a basketball cafe here called Ball Tongue to watch the Thunder play the Warriors. &gt;  &gt; The bar was like an NBA fever dream come to life. There were posters of Rasheed Wallace and Latrell Sprewell on the ceiling, a Westbrook jersey in the window, a pennant of Rocky the Denver Nuggets’ mascot on the wall, a life-size cutout of Penny Hardaway in the corner and a Dream Team windbreaker on the exposed pipes. The menu of mixed drinks included “The Greek Freak” (ouzo) and “Trust the Process” (vodka). &gt;  &gt; Nanae Yamano recently organized a small watch party at Ball Tongue in Tokyo. &gt; Nanae Yamano recently organized a small watch party at Ball Tongue in Tokyo. PHOTO: BEN COHEN / THE WALL STREET JOURNAL &gt; Yamano had advertised the event on Twitter, and she was surrounded by NBA die-hards eating their brunch of soup, potatoes and curry. She talked to herself and others throughout the game. (Her normal conversations about Westbrook and the Thunder are “usually her doing the talking and me listening,” said her husband, Ken, in an email.) She cackled when Draymond Green missed a shot. She howled during a frantic Oklahoma City possession. “Arigato gozaimasu!” she cheered for an offensive rebound leading to an open Adams jumper. &gt;  &gt; When the game was finally, mercifully over—the Warriors beat the Thunder by 32 points, Oklahoma City’s worst loss of the season—it was time for Yamano to become Picasso. &gt;  &gt; She turned her iPad into a sketchpad and only realized what she was drawing as she began to doodle with her Apple Pencil. Her take on the blowout: Paul George burying his head next to a brooding Westbrook. She applied the meticulous finishing touches, right down to confirming the style of their sneakers, and it was soon ready for display on social media. The whole process took precisely 20 minutes. &gt;  &gt; The ensuing avalanche of likes from her fans was still a little surreal to Yamano. She’s astonished that anyone—let alone the Thunder players themselves—knows who she is. &gt;  &gt; “I grew up in the countryside,” she said. “I’ve never really had a community that I belonged in. I was just a weird person—always, always.” And then she found other NBA fans online. She no longer felt alone. “It’s just a bunch of weird people like myself,” Yamano said."
Shh Kevin Durant doesn't have any rings  /s

Kevin Durant is beside himself. Slithering thru downtown Oakland begging (thru hisses) Bob Myers for address to Draymonds loyalty 
"Kevin Durant wore those terrible purple and pink shoes all through the finals, this rule was already dead "
The US is just so deep nowadays and players are well suited for the international game because of the NBAs emphasis on shooting and spacing. Unlike their predecessors who are 1on1 penetrating type of guys.  2016 team Carmelo Anthony Harrison Barnes				 Jimmy Butler				 DeMarcus Cousins				 DeMar DeRozan				 Kevin Durant Paul George				 Draymond Green				 Kyrie Irving				 DeAndre Jordan				 Kyle Lowry				 Klay Thompson

how the fuck do I hide Kevin Durant
"Sure, but that doesn't ensure future production.  Look at what his contemporaries are reduced to, he's already been elite ~5 years after everyone else fallen away.  At one end start with Kevin Durant in the 2007 draft and look back to LeBron James in 2003 and tell me who else between them is capable of being the best player on a championship team.    I don't say that to take away anything from him or not to marvel at what he did last season or will probably do this year, but to expect multiple years of this LeBron?   I feel like I'm taking crazy pills or being framed as a hot take artist for  advocating a player in his fifteenth year (plus playoff deep runs) maybe doesn't play as well in his sixteenth.  Last season took every ounce of LeBron to drag the Cavs to the finals.  Now every night in the West is going to be as tough as his road was to the finals. "
Kevin Durant is Benedict Arnold
"Currently Horace is not. It wouldn't surprise me if Horace Grant was in the next 10 years however.  I do think Manu has a better resume than Horace howeer.

It's possible guys keep cycling ahead of Manu in this hypothetical but I doubt it would ever go past 20 years. "
Ahahahahah with you until Scott Brooks.   All he does is stand there looking concerned. Kevin Durant was gonna be Durant with anyone there. That's like giving credit to Ty Lue for LeBron James

Draymond gets suspended for one of his multiple nut shots against OKC and they win and close out the series. OKC goes to the finals and beats the Cavs. Kevin Durant stays in OKC and LeBron doesn't win a ring in Cleveland that year. The 73 win GSW team doesn't add Kevin Durant to become the ridiculously stacked team it is today. The league isn't fucked and there is actual parity 
James Harden has not even surpassed Kevin Durant  
"Ah yes, 2007 after Clay Bennett dismantled the team and it was a foregone conclusion they were leaving (goodbye Ray Allen/Rashard Lewis) but we still had the powerhouse of Earl Watson, Chris Wilcox, Nick Collison, Luke Ridnour, Chris Wilcox, Donyell Marshall, Brent Barry with rookie Kevin Durant starting at point guard along side rookie Jeff Green and I wonder why attendance sucked compared to a city who just got their own franchise ... not a great comparison"
His shot is never going to come from the “correct” side of his body but it doesn’t really have to. He’s pretty obviously left-eye dominant as is Kevin Durant
6 ft White Kevin Durant
&gt;What type of point guard is more important to you: Lonzo Ball/Joakim Noah or Kevin Durant/Mr. Snuffleupagus?
I have to agree and say I didn’t think it was him he was going in. Good for Durant   *If you see this Kevin Durant not sure if you still searching your name KD but you done did good kid

"Here, I’ll go through your comment line by line and hopefully we can see eye to eye.  &gt;Oh really? Cause he literally hit a dagger 3 last year in game 3, and hit the exact same shot this year from the same spot on the same guy, LeBron.   Very true, great shots by KD. LeBron has had is great moments in the Finals too like the block (A defensive play), scoring 51 against a great defense, etc.  &gt;He dragged the 2014 Thunder to the playoffs, averaged 32PPG and won MVP, averaged that same 30PPG in those playoffs and was torching the Spurs scoring 30 in all but one game where he had 15.  Another great run by KD while Russ had an injury plagued season. Of course LeBron has had his fair share of excellent seasons as well.  &gt;I guess you must not watch basketball either, because this playoffs, he had games of 32, 2 34 games, 37, 38, including the ***43 point game 3***. Forgot about that didn't you?   Basketball is my favorite sport, and when my favorite player plays for my favorite team, you’ll bet I watched! ^^pls ^^come ^^back ^^LeBron  Also KD had a great playoffs but if you think his playoffs were better than LeBron’s, then I would have to ask you if you watched!  &gt;Kevin Durant is also 29 so that's a stupid point to even bring up. If LeBron is aging and declining, then by default that makes him not the best player in the world anymore, so if you're admitting that fine, but it's the reason you all got worked up to begin with so nice hypocrisy there.  Good point, I was just stating that LeBron played a lot of games for his age. Not too worked up about it, I won’t lose any sleep over it. (Actually I’ve been having trouble falling asleep recently, if you have any tips, please let me know!)  &gt;I also saw KD buying into playing as a team player on a cohesive team. LeBron hand selected his team, had them all extended, and is solely responsible for the type of one dimensional offense the Cavs ran. He did not play help defense almost all season aside from the one notable block on Butler at the end of their game. So again, this is all KDs fault?  I’m kinda tired, and I’m at work right now so I should get back to work. You get the point. If you think KD is better, that’s fine. I like LeBron though."

"This is dumb. Kevin Durant is staying with the Thunder, no question. - Many people"
"Kevin Durant [*was* 6'9.](https://stats.nba.com/draft/combine-anthro/#!?SeasonYear=2007-08) He just used his barefoot height. The deception comes from him, not the combine.  They use stadiometers. Not sure how you think that's unreliable."
"Hmmmm...  * Lebron James  * Kevin Durant  * Kyrie Irving  * Paul George  * Russell Westbrook  * Carmelo Anthony  * Giannis Antetokounmpo  * Ben Simmons  * Dirk Nowitzki  * Tristan Thompson  * Al Horford  * Rudy Gobert  * Marc + Pau Gasol  * Bradley Beal   * Devin Booker   * Demarcus Cousins  * Anthony Davis  * Draymond Green  * Andre Igoudala  * Tobias Harris  * DeAndre Jordan  * Paul Milsap  * J. J. Redick  * D'Angelo Russell  Oh, and let's not forget...  * Michael Jordan  * Kobe Bryant  * Paul Pierce  * Manu Ginobli  * Amar'e Stoudemire  * Vince Carter  * Tayshaun Prince  There are about 50 other NBA players that are endorsed by Nike but I think you probably get the picture.   Nike is in the NBA's DNA. It shouldn't surprise you we're talking about them."
aaahhhh the trustworthy combine measurements. Where Kevin Durant is 6'9 and Ben Simmons is 6'8.
"So what you're saying is, if he improved his shooting, he becomes a bigger, stronger and more athletic Kevin Durant?"
" yea cousins is going to walk in and try to take over the offense from fricken steph curry and kevin durant after admitting himself he would be taking a lesser role this year and this season would be a rehab type year.   yea ill put my faith in an all star just off injury and joining the best collection of talent the league has ever seen, to take a back seat and find a way to be a very productive player in probably the easiest offenses any center in nba history could play in. "
"What if Mark Zuckerberg was a huge warriors fan. Let's say he has zero affiliations with the warriors, not even season tickets, but he gives Kevin Durant 10 percent of the Facebook company and in exchange, Durant signs with the warriors for the minimum."
"Outside of 2011-12 &amp; 2016-17, Durant curiously regresses from 3 in the postseason. I'm just making a (mostly baseless) prediction 2018-19 will be the first time it carries over into the regular season. I personally hope it doesn't come true (and it likely won't), Kevin Durant's 3 ball is a thing of beauty."
"If we're talking about the US, that number is a lot smaller than 75% my friend.   ESPN receives about ~75 million unique viewers per month (to any of their digital platforms, so including tv, web, mobile apps etc) . There's no way the vast majority of those people wouldn't have seen or heard about Kevin Durant at some point .. he is ubiquitous in ESPNs coverage.   "
Lol what? Anyone who has ever watched ESPN Sportscenter would know what KD looks like.   Kevin Durant is synonymous with the NBA landscape.. any person who even knows what the NBA is will know of him  
Kevin Durant looks a lot like him. Doppelgänger. 
"Currently he is, but during his peak, he was going up against old Dirk, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, LeBron and KD. I doubt he still has 5 all NBA awards if he was drafted in 2002. LMA has had some talent to go up against, but I think that is significantly less talented than what Stoudemire faced in Tim Duncan, LeBron, Dirk, KG and Kevin Durant. Thats 5 top 20 players and 2 top 10 players, all but KD were in their primes during STAT's run and even KD averaged 28/7/3 during the last three years of Stoudemire's prime (2008-11)."
"Day 1500 of NoFap: I have grown a Kevin Durant-type body, my defensive awareness has gained top 10 draft pick interest, and I now am paid more than 5 million dollars a year"
"When Kobe or LeBron get hot the other team can actively try to focus their energies on them.  With the Warriors, you can't start sagging off of Steph Curry or Kevin Durant to try to contain Klay.  Not to mention Klay is living a blessed NBA life having those guys create so many scoring opportunities for him."
"There is no need for the /s.  Right now Booker is definitely NOT an elite scorer.  Let’s look at what elite scorers look like.    Lebron James - 36 points/100p, 62% TS, 118 offensive rating.    James Harden - 42 points/100p, 62% TS, 120 offensive rating.    Steph Curry - 40 points/100p, 67.5% TS, 125 offensive rating.  Kevin Durant - 37 points/100p, 64% TS, 119 offensive rating  ...  Devin Booker - 34.5 points/100p, 56% TS, 105 offensive rating.     Now I happen to like Devin Booker and think he has a bright future, but in no conceivable definition is he an elite scorer in the NBA.  "
"Literally all you post on here is KD, these are all arbitrary numbers, If I say unicorn is only:  25+ ppg  7+ reb  7+ asts  0.5+ blocks  56%+ TS   then now Kevin Durant is not and the stats are still so unique only one player has them, can you guess?"
Kevin Durant and a Snake is the only accurate one you have on your list 
I know he's probably your favorite player and you think he's one of the greatest players of all time.  But Kevin Durant is in the top 30-50 greatest players ever
Because Kevin Durant sure can't
"Kevin Durant is a better efficient scorer, but is worse than Magic at every other aspect of the game.  There's a reason someone like Magic has that legacy, it's not just there because he has a cute smile dawg."
"You seriously think Magic was a better basketball player than Kevin Durant? I'm talking basketball, not legacy."
"i'm a rockets fan with a few olajuwon jerseys, so clearly it's kevin durant."
He’s meming about that Kevin Durant DM the other day
I don't even know what the heck that is.  Here is where Kevin Durant ranks on the list of all time great players:   * -
Kevin Durant  Steph Curry  Draymond Green  Klay Thompson  Demarcus Cousins 
Here is a list of players who are top 10 all time in PPG and TS%  1. Kevin Durant   
"I would personally take MVP Shaq over MVP Kevin Durant, for much of the same reason that I'd take MVP Steph over MVP KD. He warps the defense and forces the opposing coach to play a totally different game. His sheer presence opens up worlds of opportunities for his teammates.  Obviously this also depends on which rules we're playing by. Shaq takes a huge hit if we're playing in 2018, but I think I'd still take him. I just can't see how modern big men would stop him. He was great at passing out of doubles."
Hakeem Olajuwon is among the top 5-10 best players ever.   Kevin Durant is in the 20-40 range.  Really good.  But not All-Time Great
"In that thread a few days ago everyone was picking Kevin Durant over Kobe... absolutely dumbfounded by that opinion.    It's possible KD breaks into the top 10/15 when his career is done, he's only 29... but to say that right now is foolish."
nobody is taking *Kevin Durant* over **Hakeem Olajuwon**
"There are plenty of people that don't put Kobe in top 10, plenty that do.  You think Kevin Durant is going to be a no brainer top 10?  Do you think Durant is better than Kobe was?"
Jesus what don’t you get. You really are gonna backup him saying Kevin Durant is the GoAT? That’s my point. He’s wrong. Clearly wrong. So that means just because he plays doesn’t mean he knows everything. I dunno wtf is so hard to understand about that
"What makes an argument significant? It's just subjective man /s  The point is the guy made a bold prediction and the response was basically ""you can't really know that!"" Ya man that's the point of a prediction. ""Kevin Durant is not good enough at basketball"" is a more compelling argument than ""lists are subjective"" "
"Here is their 2018 projections from 2015:  1. Anthony Davis 12.55227 2. James Harden 12.546148 3. Stephen Curry 12.411883 4. LeBron James 11.447153 5. Russell Westbrook 10.576062 6. Kawhi Leonard 9.506362 7. Kevin Durant 8.0618868 8. Chris Paul 7.9910564 9. DeMarcus Cousins 7.7126541 10. Kyrie Irving 7.4775829  Not an awful list all things considered. Seems like if a statistical model consistently beats expert analysts, Vegas, and other statistical models, it's worth paying attention to. "
Kevin Durant is not the best basketball player ever. Facts
"If you read the article he actually says Kevin Knox is the greatest player of all time, and Kevin Durant is still second."
Throwback to when everyone who said Kevin Durant is not a DPOY candidate got downvoted to hell. 
"An engaged Iguodala is the 2nd best defender on that team still. Although that's also somewhat matchup dependent at his age now he has some vulnerabilities hanging with quicker players on the perimeter.   Klay Thompson vs Kevin Durant is more of a convo. And honestly &gt;50% of the time its Klay.   Klay is a very good consistent on the ball defender. Not the most active off the ball but incredibly reliable you know what youll get each night. KD there's a lot more variance: when he's on he can guard any position, protect the rim, be a menace switching, swam everything etc. But when he's not there are stretches where he's really nothing more than average defensively. Like that WCF vs Houston I still have no idea what the hell he was doing on some plays.  "
not when DPOY-deserving Kevin Durant is in the league you're not
"Correct.  See LeBron, Draymond, Giannis, Jokic, Harden, pre-PG Westbrook, Wade, Oladipo, Simmons, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jimmy Butler, Ginobli, Lance Stephenson, Kobe, non- PG Marcus Smart, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, and even Andre Drummond is developing that skill as we saw this past season.  Among older players that come to mind are Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, non-PG Magic, and Wilt (when he developed it and tried to)."
'The guy you see now is the real me; guy in Oklahoma City was the phony' - Kevin Durant 
"I think he is. He's top 3 at shooting guard right now. You really think there are 10 better players in the league than him right now? My top 10 in no particular order: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Giannis, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler. That's current form. Some players were injured or haven't played for awhile like Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving."
Have you ever seen a wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube man and Kevin Durant in the same room?
Kyle Lowry  Klay Thompson  Kevin Durant  Lamarcus Aldridge   KAT
"I know this is off topic, but PER does *not* favor guys who put up a lot of shots. PER gets a bad rap because it adjusts for minutes so you get scrubs mixed with stars near the top. But if you multiply PER * minutes per game, you get a seriously good list of the best players. Below is last year's top 20. You can argue some of the minutia but honestly this is a very good list of the top 20 players in the league. The average TS% on this list is 59.6% - that's hardly a stat that doesn't care about efficiency (and 23, 24 and 25 are Adams, Capela and Gobert who each have TS%&gt;63%).

“Defense is what we value most”  Who is we?   The team? Have they officially said that? So would they take Gobert over Kevin Durant ?  Is jimmy butler bad on D?
"[He was considered a good defender in 2016.](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/05/23/kevin-durant-defense-warriors-thunder-nba-playoffs)  &gt; No player of his height can lock in and guard on the perimeter like he can or cover the same ground when defending in space. His defensive capability is exceptional, which is almost a prerequisite of attempting to guard an opponent with the collective speed, playmaking, and shooting of the Warriors.   He was never considered elite, but he was definitely good."
"so you think we'd rather have kevin durant shooting? really? are you familiar with his work?  bold strategy, cotton"
Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Kevin Durant  Draymond Green  DeMarcus Cousins  &amp;#x200B;
"i don't care if cousins is shooting when the other options are kevin durant, steph curry, and klay thompson. cousins is welcome to take our guys in the post every possession for 7 games."
"they had no iggy who's arguably more important in the playoffs.  I thought it was ridiculous that so many people brought up iggy as a response to Paul but it certainly isnt when it comes to luc.  You have to assume more likely or not iggy is playing the whole series next year.  Honestly, I think you guys are absolutely fine during the RS.  A top 3 offense and top 10 ish defense(which is wat gs was last year) will get 55+ comfortably.  However if Cousins is anywhere near good, I think that matchup is trouble.  The Rockets could switch everything because kevin durant couldnt abuse isolations vs even paul.  Cousins absolutely will however no matter how good Paul is as a defender.

These comparisons are a disservice to the player, how can Ingram be expected to live up to expectations if KD/Kobe/TMac/LeBron (lol) is the bar?  "

"Andrew Bogut travels from the Bucks to the Warriors (2012): The Warriors sent out Monta Ellis, Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh, and then officially handed the team over to Stephen Curry. Bogut provided the Warriors with much-needed interior defence, winning their first championship in recent years in 2015. In 2016, he was traded, giving Kevin Durant a salary space.  Dickenbe Mutombo went from the Hawks to the 76ers (2001): Although the 76ers had the best record in the league, they recently lost a defensive center So the 76 man team is looking for a replacement - the substitute is called Mutombo.

I'm not saying they will max out all 4. Klay could take less than the max based on his rhetoric in interviews.   Draymond is easier to replace then Kevin Durant.

"He has put fans through something. That is fact.  He also didn’t choose to be here. That is fact.  Both sentences are correct. They aren’t mutually exclusive.

I came here to say Kevin Durant but you and multiple others beat me to it. I think a big component is most of his plays aren't highlight worthy and look extremely easy for him. 
"&gt;Kevin Durant essentially saved Steph Curry’s legacy       Saved his legacy? Curry was already the GOAT shooter, and won 2x MVPs and a ring. Who's to say he doesn't win another (ring and/or MVP) without KD? Your argument is dumb asf.   "
"Y'know, I'm more a detractor than a fan of Lonzo's, but Jayson Tatum's mold of being a skilled two-way small forward isn't something we haven't seen before, i.e. LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Paul George; whereas Lonzo's skillset of being a non-scoring, defensive playmaking, rebounding PG is something for which I can think of few comparisons."
You realize Kevin Durant made the warriors near unstoppable right? Before that they were an all time team but beatable shown by the 2016 finals loss and OKC outclassing them before choking themselves. 
"Kevin Durant doesn't join GS unless Steph Curry is there.  Curry created his own luck by being fucking good at basketball and being the best off-ball player in the league, making it an ideal place for another superstar to sign with GS"
Kevin Durant is the biggest example of this. You'd think he would have like 12 pts or something watching the game in real time then you look at the box score and he has 28 on 12-18 shooting or something
Kevin Durant with the sneaky efficiency
That the warriors wouldn't have won a championship before Kevin Durant joined. And he joined a season after his own team got them to a game 7; and the warriors had won 73 games.  Basically that your GM didn't do anything. The lack of competitiveness and courage in KD led you guys to a few chips.  
KD is the best player to ever play the game.  ^^-Not ^^Kevin ^^Durant
So kawhi's gonna destroy half the league with a snap of his fingers? And the Warriors will try to stop him but ultimately fail because Kevin Durant didn't go for the head?
You can't. That's why Kevin Durant is the most beloved player on this sub. 
Kevin Durant is a phony. 
"“Back in my heyday, I would kill Kevin Durant one-on-one,” said Kyle Singler.  He continued:  “I would just back Durant in and lift him off the ground and call a foul every time he fouls me when I do a jump hook to the right or the left,’’ Singler said. “He cannot stop me one-on-one. He better make every shot ’cause he can’t go around me. He’s not fast enough. And he can only make so many shots outside before I make every bucket under the rim.”"

"I *know* how good Curry is. I remember those pre-KD seasons so vividly. The guy literally changed the way modern basketball is played on *both* ends of the floor.

r/NBA: Kevin Durant loves to blow 
KEVIN DURANT WOULD BLOW A 12 YEAR OLD TO PROVE HE DOESN'T SUCK
"Kevin Knox + another incoming lotto pick might sway that.  If Kristaps looks like he can be an All NBA player that coming season and Knox finishes ~top 3 in ROY voting and the Knicks pick up say Romeo Langford, i think Durant would view that as an optimal alternative to the Warriors. He would have assumedly had his taste of championships and look for a new “challenge” of trying to haul pieces around him to a ring and fight off the naysayers of his legacy.  Just enough to work with, plus youth to bank on improving and helping him as he ages and wants to conserve more energy."
Starting at small forward for the nets: Kevin Durant. 
"If this trash talk thread were Kevin Durant - it would hire Chris Rock, Dave Chapelle, Jerrod Carmichael, Jeff Ross, and the ghost of George Carlin to jump in here."
Oh man he’s got so many... “CP3 isn’t a top 10 PG of all time” “Kevin Durant could easily stop Hakeem in the post” “Lonzo Ball could kick up Micheal Jordan” ... those are all I can remember at the moment

"&gt; Him being on the same team as Kevin doesn't make him an intrinsically worse player  I agree, but I do think it's a little more complicated than that. The context in which a player plays, and what they actually produce should be considered. If Steph will never be as good as he was before Durant joined, as long as Durant is on the team and playing, shouldn't we consider that when ranking him? Because KD ultimately limits Steph's output I think it's ok to rank Steph a little lower than you might otherwise.   Steph is incredible, and I do think he kind of gets underrated a little now. So I wouldn't argue with your assessment.  But I also see why people might rate him slightly lower."

He also has a big impact on how his teammates shoot. KD, Klay, and Draymond all shoot better with Steph on the floor and they all have an offensive rating drop of at least 12 without Steph.  &gt;- Klay benefits the most from Steph.

You got Klay Thompson *and* Kevin Durant on a team and they’re both ***still*** getting open looks because of the attention the D has to put on Steph. He’s the biggest offensive threat in the league. And I hate the “Curry can’t play D” narrative. He’s consistently clogging up passing lanes and often contesting shots.   AD, Giannis and KD are monsters on both ends of the floor but Steph is on another level."
Kevin Durant blew a 6-2 lead in 2016
and kevin durant blew a 3-1 lead to the 2016 golden state warriors
"Lol, way to confirm exactly how much you actually watched the playoffs by citing Kevin Love as a substantial offensive weapon, plus referring to a player who has not been with the team for over a year. Not to mention the fact both those players are far worse defenders.  The Cavaliers as a whole were terrible on defence (yes, during the regular season in part because of Lebron’s coasting), which always affect defensive statistics. And some others marked him as a mediocre regular season defender. So that is hardly a strong narrative.  The comparison of Kawhi and Durant is easy because they play rather similarly on offence. The comparison with Lebron is far more difficult because he matches their scoring output while serving as the offensive engine. Maybe you should stop just listening to talking heads and start thinking through a few of these comparisons for yourself."
"Yeah, but imagine having Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook all on the same team.  That'd be crazy if that ever happened in real life."
"Kevin Durant and ""fuck"""
"""Silver has blocked Durants transfer to the Lakers.""  ""Kevin Durant has signed with the LA Clippers."""
"Kobe loved the competitiveness that’s why he never settled.  Then why did Kevin Durant team up Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green to earn a free ring? Competitiveness is dying out IMO. "
"He’s 6’6, listed as a SG/SF. In terms of SF he definitely didnt have a chance af SF. Paul George, covington, kevin durant, danny green, iguodala, mbah a moute, and millsap are all better. Not to mention kawhi when hes healthy.  Please tell me how he got snubbed.   And for a sf hes an awful rebounder then"
"lmao lets be real doesnt matter what year he's having. he's kevin durant, he deserves it"
"I would argue not that Durant is a ""better"" scorer, but that he is the most versatile scorer in the history of basketball (which may be even more important as a basketball skill).  Kevin Durant would be an ultra-elite scorer on any team during any era.  He is just something we have never seen before: a 7-foot guard who can shoot from 30 feet, drive, knock down face-ups/turnarounds/fadeaways in his sleep, and who has a completely unguardable hesi pull-up jimbo.  KD fit in seemlessly with the Warriors because his skills will fit in seemlessly anywhere.  Even MJ, whose prowess and versatility were truly marvels, would have somewhat more difficulty fitting in with a ball-dominant guard like Westbrook than KD did.  "
"Kevin ""Donald Trump"" Durant "
Kevin “Mario “Sarah Huckabee-Sanders” Chalmers” Durant
What teams would like to see Kevin Durant sign with them?  Find out next only on ESPN.
"This is ESPN trying to create a narrative. The Lakers are 2-5, LeBron needs a second-star, so every time Klay or Jimmy Butler or Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard or Anthony Davis or anyone who might remotely be associated with joining the Lakers next season has a good game, they're going to devote airtime to it and see if it floats.  [This is what they do now.](https://deadspin.com/5929361/how-espn-ditched-journalism-and-followed-skip-bayless-to-the-bottom-a-tim-tebow-story) They create their own news and talk about a thing, even if there's nothing to talk about."
Kevin “Mario Chalmers” Durant 
"&gt;I believe the final plan hatched by LeBron and Magic to defeat golden state looks like this: Tank this year, get a top draft pick. Sign Kevin Durant in summer. Team will be LeBron, KD, Top draft pick, Lonzo, Kuzma, Ingram, Hart, and whatever players round out the roster. That team could defeat Golden State.  Hot takes Vol 4"
And idk Kevin Durant
"It's a lot of fun to read the headline if you give them all Jimmy Butler middle names.  Klay ""you need me"" Thompson was encouraged by Steph ""you need me"" Curry to break the NBA record held by Steph ""you need me"" Curry without any concern to the scoring needs of Kevin ""you need me"" Durant who was being shopped around by Andre ""you need me"" Iguodala just a game ago. Will this team ever learn to play together?"
Kevin Durant was like Hulk Hogan joining the NWO.
Kevin Durant to the World Series winning Red Sox confirmed.   Surprised he didn’t transfer in between games 4 and 5. 
Kevin durant
"there is a salary cap, the warriors just got extremely lucky. the only healthy superstar they got in his prime is kevin durant. being able to sign one player in free agency probably isn't a problem."
Im responding to you. Lol what Durant and lebron did are way different. Lebron joined Dwayne Wayde who had already hit the peak of his prime and declined every season after and added bosh who is a great player but his stats were inflated due to playing on a mediocre Toronto team who correct me if I’m wrong only made the playoffs once. Cleveland hadn’t even made the playoffs season he left and Kyrie was still finding an identity as a player around them and Kevin love was essentially in the same situation as bosh was when he joined lebron only love was not as good of a player. There was no guarantee that team was going to win a title as they were a work in progress. Kevin Durant joined a team with a two time mvp who was removed from back to back finals appearances with one ship to show for it and on-top of that just put the league on blast with a 73 win season and there is a legit argument that they should have won the title. Durant knew that he was going to dominate with this team because the league has never seen a team this good ever. Lebron also had to leave Cleveland to ever win a ring  because Cleveland could never attract free agents to play with lebron. Durant had talent on his team since day 1 with Westbrook and they looked like they getting over that hump in 2016 when they almost beat the warriors. You can say what they did was similar but when you look deeper into it you can see its not at all. I love Durant as a player and i think hes going to be a top 10 player when its all said and done. But he prolly didnt need golden state to win and golden state sure didnt need him to win either. 
"Preach dude, preach. In my opinion his strength as a teammate is severely underrated! As controversial as it is, I believe how good of a teammate he is puts him above Kevin Durant at 2nd best player in the NBA"

Kevin Durant ruined the competitive balance in the NBA by going there. 
"ESPN: Kevin Durant calls teammate Klay Thompson ""weak"" ""doesn't belong in the NBA"" Is there tension in Golden State?"
Since when did Kevin Durant played while Luke coached the Warriors? 
"[Wojnarowski] In an unprecedented move, the Golden State Warriors have traded Kevin Durant to the surface of the Sun, per the league's new crowd-sourced trading policy."
"Kevin Durant +45 in 28 minutes with 14 points.  Can we just, I don't know, fast-forward to 2022?"
"He's outscored Kevin Durant, he should tell everyone he knows for ever for real"
It isn't even fair for someone to be this good of a shooter.  It's a little ridiculous when you have Kevin Durant and he's only the third best shooter on the team. This team is loaded.
"Fine, a 73-win team was able to replace their mediocre starting small forward with Kevin Durant. Wow, what a difference."
Why tf do we even have regular season. Just go straight into playoffs and get this over with. Fuck kevin durant
Kevin Durant is +45 through 3 quarters 
"Underrated stat: Kevin Durant with a quiet 14 points, with a plus minus of +45.  This team..."
"MJ choked that series and lost vs Magic... except LeBron was 26, and Jordan was 31 and should've been more experienced than that.    Imagine thinking I said KD is a better defender historically than Gary Payton. I didn't. Do you not understand how matchups work in Basketball? Gary Payton, is shorter, and less athletic than MJ and LeBron. Under the man to man rules Jordan played under, that is a huge disadvantage. Every one of the player I listed is an elite defender, with size and athleticism in the same neighborhood as LeBron. Imagine picking 6-4 Payton and man to man defense to stop MJ or LeBron over a platoon of Kevin Durant, Andre Igoudala, Klay Thompson, and Draymond green as primary defender, and a help-heavy defensive scheme.    Yes, LeBron choked vs Mavs, they had a great team that swept defending champ Kobe, and beat the Thunder. With a future DPOY in Chandler down low, and a heavily condensed zone defense that they admit ALLOWED THEM TO STOP LEBRON.   MJ wasn't allowed to be guarded like that.    ""Lebron gets one pick set on him by Tyson Chandler and goes rolling down half the court in pain. He would much rather play in today's era with all the space on offense and the soft foul calls.""     Lol.... You're the delusional one. You seem insecure about Jordan's inadequacies and failures. and resort to meaningless hyperbole.    Should I assume every time you don't respond to something I say, you're giving up? Do you admit your bullshit about adding Jordan and making a 72 win, 3-peat team was just that, bullshit?  "
"The next fill season he added the best rebounder of all time, and a 2-time DPOY in Dennis Rodman you dunce. Didn't address that because it was inconvenient to your narrative?   He was winning the game, with the ball, with the shot clock off, and got the ball stripped like a HS point guard and the other team got a fast break layup off him for the lead. Then the next possession with a chance at a game winner and redemption, he turned it over AGAIN. He choked against the baby Orlando Magic.   Yeah it was only shortened for a few seasons, and in those few seasons where they rules were changed to his benefit, his team had its most success. He went from shooting 30% on 1.4 3pt attempts a game for his career, to shooting 40% on 3.4 3pt attempts a game during the line-shortened seasons. Stop lying to yourself.  Hand-checking is less influential than illegal defense rules. LeBron would pick to play in Jordan's rules every day of the week.   LeBron's primary defender in every finals: Bruce Bowen, Shawn Marion, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Kawhi Leonard, Andre Igoudala, Andre Igoudala, Kevin Durant, Kevin Durant.   Name a single defender MJ played in the finals you would pick above any of them if you had to stop MJ or LeBron, I'll wait..."
"Klay's shoe deal isn't that large when compared to 'big all stars'. It seems about right given his high-profile status as a Warrior (and a Splash Brother) but in a Chinese market.  Reportedly 10 year, 80Million with incentives (although I'm always suspect of reported numbers without guarantees mentioned): https://www.sbnation.com/2017/6/30/15905574/klay-thompson-anta-extension-golden-state-warriors-10-years-80-million  Durant's deal with nike is 10 years, up to 300M on incentives (again, wary of no guaranteed numbers). http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11443079/kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-stays-nike-shoe-company-matches-armour-offer  Curry's deal is hard to quantify. No concrete numbers and apparently there's an equity stake. Same with Hayward's deal with Anta.  Lebron's Nike deal is famously assumed to exceed a Billion: https://www.si.com/nba/2016/05/17/lebron-james-nike-deal-contract-one-billion  "
Stephen Curry  Kobe Bryant  Kevin Durant  Dirk Nowitzki  Hakeem Olajuwon
"Kevin Durant: I’ve seen the ‘Snake’ nickname, but I don’t know where that (expletive) came from"
That doesn't excuse how bad the Cavs are. Some people argued Lebron's team was stacked and a superteam last year because he had Kevin Love. Durant leaves OKC and OKC is not this bad. CP3 leaves the Clippers and the Clippers are not this bad. Kawhi leaves the Spurs and they are not this bad. The only comparison is MJ leaving the Bulls 20 years ago from which the Bulls have never recovered.
These firsts could be anything! Even another kevin durant!  Your brain is tiny
BREAKING NEWS: Kevin Durant is not leaving GW anytime soon
Kevin Durant doesn't care what the haters say. He's never done anything to suggest otherwise. 
"I mean, its not like you're Kevin Durant and went to Golden State, you just happen to be a fan of one of the most dominant teams of all team in their peak.  "
"2017 NBA GM Survey:  If you were starting a franchise today and could sign any player in the NBA, who would it be?  1. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota – 29%  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee – 21%  3. LeBron James, Cleveland – 18%  4. Kawhi Leonard, San Antonio – 14%  5. Kevin Durant, Golden State – 11%"
an r/nba thread about Kevin Durant filled with salt and uninformed comments that overreact gratuitously? I never would have expected it
"Steph Curry made 11 threes against the Wizards on 10/24. As of today, only 50 players have made more than 11 threes *on the season*. Not making the cut (in descending order of 3P made): Kevin Durant, Karl-Anthony Towns, Kawhi Leonard, Mike Conley, Eric Gordon, Gordon Hayward, Joel Embiid, Kyrie Irving, LeBron James, Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson. (Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons.)  But on the list? Carmelo Anthony, with 12!"
"Correct.  When the other players are doing their jobs, Wall finds them and ends up being among league leaders in assists like a few years back.  The roster needs to get blown up.  You don't do Ernie Grunfield moves like sign Otto Porter to a max deal matching offer sheet because you struck out on Kevin Durant - who *never considered the Wizards in the first place.*"
"Kerr to Lowe about how Kerr said Durant is the second best player in the league.  &gt;[Lowe] Do you think Steph cares about that? Steph is the two-time reigning MVP and I feel like everyone has sort of collectively forgotten how good he is. He was amazing in the Finals, he was really good in the Finals two years ago for which he gets no credit. When you say something like that publicly, are you worried that Steph is gonna be, 'Hey, what about me?' Or just doesn't matter to him?""  &gt;""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr told Lowe. ""That's the beauty of Steph -- he doesn't take that stuff personally. He understands it. Steph is one of the great players in the world. Two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of the way he impacts the game.  &gt;""But you're talking about Kevin Durant at 6'11"" protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do.""  &gt;""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD,"" Kerr explained. ""Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill.  &gt;""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league.  &gt;""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi (Leonard) is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force.""  I'd suggest listening to that podcast. It was a pretty definitive statement by Kerr.  "
Kevin Durant makes one of the highest amounts of cash for off court deals (third most according to this [site](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2018/02/17/the-2018-nba-all-stars-players-who-earn-the-most-from-endorsements/#351808f91755)) and two rings and finals MVPs...I don't think people are that scared.
"Kevin Durant is a year older and has scored almost 6,000 more points. I doubt Harden passes MJ due to health concerns and playing at such a high clip is rare."
"""As far as talent-wise, I match up with Kevin [Durant], LeBron [James], I match up with the best guys in the world"" Michael Beasley"
Kevin Durant is not going to move to Dallas 
is it me or is Kevin Durant a bit of a boring player. like u see it at the end of the game   “oh wow KD has 34 points”  but u can never remember them.    can u remember a single Durant FG?  but try lebron...u can see the dunk   i remember a lebron dunk.
"Kobe fans that rank him over LeBron are widely regarded as morons. Not sure how that's supposed to help your argument.  Awards are completely circumstance dependent, that's why it makes absolutely 0 sense to rank players by them. MVPs, DPOYs, championships, all-NBA appearances, all of it. If Hakeem, Barkley, Reggie Miller, and Mutombo decided after 93 to say ""fuck it, we're tired of the Bulls, let's team up and farm rings together"", and 5-peated would they be better players for it? Don't think so.   Tim Duncan is widely regarded as a top 5 defender to ever play the game. He's never won a DPOY. Were Michael Cooper and Alvin Robertson actually better defenders than he was? Hell no they were not.  If the Warriors core is to stick together and they end up with 5+ rings, are Curry and Durant greater players than LeBron James despite clearly never being better than him in their careers? No—they wouldn't be, that's completely fucking moronic.  Why put so much emphasis on these awards when we can't even trust the guys voting for them to get them right? Harden averaged something like 29/6/8 in 2016 and he couldn't even make all-NBA third team because of some stupid narratives built up about him by Shaqtin a Fool.  Ring count tells you more about how good a player's GM was than how good they were as a player. Kevin Garnett is a top 15, arguable top 10 talent of all time but he was cursed with the burden of getting drafted by one of the worst organizations in pro sports. He spent the majority of his prime missing the playoffs. Not because he wasn't good enough, but because his teammates were dogshit and the Timberwolves' incompetent front office was caught signing illegal deals under the table and had to give up 4 straight years of first round picks as punishment. If he were drafted to LA, he wouldn't necessarily be a better player, but he'd have a lot more rings and probably another MVP or two.  It's just a stupid, lazy mindset and cuts out all of the hard work required to rank guys accurately."

"Can we just take another moment to recognize how insane it is that the Warriors have not just the best shooter of all-time, but the *2nd* best shooter of all-time on their team?  AND Kevin Durant?  It's hard to fathom them ever losing a game.  I mean ffs."
"Why use Korver when he is also great off-ball?  He's just older now.  He used to top these all the time.  http://www.nba.com/gmsurvey/2016#misc  *Which player is best at moving without the ball? 1. Klay Thompson, Golden State – 40.0% 2. Kyle Korver, Atlanta – 30.0% 3. J.J. Redick, L.A. Clippers – 16.7% 4. Stephen Curry, Golden State – 6.7% Also receiving votes: Kevin Durant, Golden State; Dwyane Wade, Chicago Last year: Kyle Korver – 69.0%*"
"There was already tons of guys coming through who were 6'10"" and over who were supposed to be shooters by 2008.   In the 2007-08 season, 6'10"" Peja Stojakovic lead the league in 3s per game and 6'10"" Rashard Lewis was 3rd. You had Dirk Nowitzki and Kevin Durant in the league, as mentioned, and around that time you also Andrea Bargnani, Matt Bonner, Troy Murphy, Steve Novak, Mehmet Okur, Vladimir Radmanovic, Tim Thomas, Hedo Turkoglu and Rasheed Wallace all 6'10"" or taller and making at least 100 3s in a season.   And that's just 3 point shooting, not long range 2s.   They weren't Dirk but there's never gonna be another Dirk - He's a first ballot hall of famer and a freak of a player. But to suggest that in 2008 we didn't expect big guys to be able to shoot from the top of the key is plainly inaccurate. "
Minnesota are worrying about making the playoffs this year and you're talking about a championship. This is why I hate Warriors fans. They're always the ones that don't know shit about how the league works. Not everybody has the luxury of signing Kevin Durant. To most teams being able to sign someone like Beal is a luxury. 
He's 7 foot and he's not Kevin Durant.  He's a PF.

KeViN dUrAnT mAdE cUrRy BoRiNg.
Future Net Kevin Durant 
&gt; Stephen Curry has his fifth 30-point game of the season with 32 points. Curry and Kevin Durant have both scored 30 points in the same game for the third time this season
&gt; Kevin Durant has his fourth 30-point game of the season with 30 points on 10-of-17 from the field
"&gt; Name another player that could do anything remotely close to what Steph is doing on the warriors right now.  How about Kevin Durant?! That's the point. These two are virtually interchangeable. Yes Curry has started off to a scorching hot start but it's not like KD has had to be carried. That's why neither of them can be MVP.   &gt;If he sustains it, that's the greatest offensive season ever.  Bruh, this season is less than 10 games in. A performance like the one against Washington obviously skews the numbers. It's entirely unreasonable to expect one of those games every few weeks to keep those averages. "
"I feel like this is how people felt watching Larry Bird or Michael Jordan in their hay day, somebody who is so good at shooting the basketball that they get bored and find new ways to challenge themselves. Like when Larry Bird shot all left handed jump shots for a game or when Michael would count down from 40. I never wanted to admit it but Steph Curry is gonna have a chance to go down as a top 3 point guard of all time (I still take Magic Johnson and Stockton over him but he should pass Stockton). If Kevin Durant wasn't on his team he probably could have won another MVP in the last three years."
"I thought Durant was shit in I think it was the first game.. just making bad decisions on shots, shooting long 3s early in the shot clock, not involving his team, etc, and it should have cost the Warriors the game if JR didn’t bail them out. Curry’s bad game was worse though.  Even Durant admitted how bad he was: https://www.si.com/nba/2018/06/12/kevin-durant-game-1-nba-finals-disrespected-cleveland-warriors"
"Well then, I guess Durant Kevin was tired of being 2nd, so he went to golden state and became Kevin Durant. "
"Overrated: Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant  Underrated: Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant. Next year.
"That detroit team was nasty. they were just short lived. they lost a bunch of players to free agency and then they were under scrutiny for the worst brawl in nba history:  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdyqIh4nJ3Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdyqIh4nJ3Y)  &amp;#x200B;  and then they started trading players away for youth and it became terrible.  &amp;#x200B;  as far as golden state is concerned. steph curry(dell currys son) is by far the greatest shooter in nba history. for context Larry Bird made 649 3pt shots in his career while shooting 37%. Steph Curry made 402 3's in 1 year and averaged 45%. and the 3s steph curry takes are 5 feet away from the 3pt line or highly contested. literally as soon as he passes the half court line you need pressure on him or he will rain. he takes the craziest 3's i've ever seen.  &amp;#x200B;  watch this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5\_Of0iDAE3g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_Of0iDAE3g)   &amp;#x200B;  combine that with a team stacked with 3 other allstars who all can shoot. Klay Thompson(warriors), just broke the nba record for the most 3s in 1 game. 14.  they literally broke the bulls 72-10 record. then the next year they sign the guy who came in 2nd in the NBA MVP Voting(Kevin Durant. a 7footer who can hit 3's), while keeping all of their starters. and then after winning another championship they signed Demarcus Cousins who last year was considered one of the top 2-3 centers in the nba.  pretty much its a running joke that the warriors looked ridiculously talented and they just keep getting top talent.  &amp;#x200B;  pretty much in the past older players at the end of their careers would join stacked teams and try to win championships. but now the trend is everyone wants to play on championship teams.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;"
Too much hype on social media is a big factor on this. Players usually take a leap on year 3-5.  Oladipo - Year 5  Westbrook - Year 3  Curry - Year 4  AD - Year 3  Kawhi - Year 5  Beal - Year 5  Cousins - Year 5  Giannis - Year 4  Rose - Year 3  CP3 - Year 3  Harden - Year 4  Melo - Year 3  Wade - Year 2 (I believe Wade took the next step on his sophomore year but again he came in the NBA at age 22)  Kobe - Year 4-5  Dirk - Year 4  Not everyone can be Kevin Durant or Lebron James that is elite at their Rookie or Sophomore season. We expect too much from the young players.  Edit: Adding NBA Stars/Superstar today that took a leap at some point. Year i mentioned can be subjective.
"That is hardly the same thing when you have 4 All stars on the team.  Warriors are good because they have DPoY, 2 of the best shooters in the league, and Kevin Durant. Nothing against Iggy, but come on those are no where near the same thing."
"&gt;It's hard to remember now, amid the melodrama and backbiting, but the past half-decade has been a boom time for one of the league's saddest franchises.  &gt;Between 1982 and 2014, the Bullets/Wizards won one playoff series. In 2014, they bullied the Tom Thibodeau Chicago Bulls in the first round before falling to the Indiana Pacers in a spirited six games.  &gt;That playoff run served as a coming-out party for Bradley Beal. He looked comfortable running the pick-and-roll and siphoned much of the crunch-time offense from Wall. The young guards seemed to welcome postseason pressure -- to thrive under it. It was exciting.  &gt;Trevor Ariza smothered Chicago in that first-round series. Seven weeks later, the Wizards signed-and-traded Ariza to the Houston Rockets on a four-year, $32 million deal. Washington could have outbid Houston; Ariza had emerged as an indispensable 3-and-D player. But it had Otto Porter Jr. waiting as a cheaper replacement. It was hoarding cap space for a run at Kevin Durant. #KDtoDC was a thing, and it didn't seem that ridiculous.  &gt;Washington signed Paul Pierce as a stopgap. After a desultory 2014-15 regular season, everything came together in the playoffs. The Eastern Conference has a way of facilitating well-timed cohesion.  &gt;Washington swept the dinged-up Toronto Raptors, nearly costing Dwane Casey his job and kicking off four years of debate within the team about busting up its core.  &gt;Washington split the first two games against the 60-win Atlanta Hawks in the second round, even though Wall broke five bones in his left wrist at the end of Game 1. Pierce later ""called game,"" and the Wizards led Atlanta 2-1 before sputtering without a healthy Wall.  &gt;They might have advanced to the conference finals if not for Wall's injury. The Hawks absolutely feared, or at least respected, the Beal-Wall duo. Those playoffs served as Porter's coming-out party. He enveloped DeMar DeRozan and scavenged open 3-pointers and baseline garbage buckets -- the perfect third banana.  &gt;Washington missed the playoffs the next season, before rebounding in 2016-17 with 49 wins -- its most since 1979. When the Wizards clinched the Southeast Division title -- the franchise's first division crown in 38 years -- with a win over the Los Angeles Lakers, the players dumped bottles of water on each other in the Staples Center locker room.  &gt;They took Boston the distance in the conference semifinals, but by then, the sheen of 2014 and 2015 had worn off some. Durant had signed in Golden State without granting Washington a meeting. The Wall/Beal/Porter core was about to get expensive, leaving the Wizards few methods of improving their roster.  God this hurt to read. Washington was such a fun up-and-coming team during this period, and it's gone down the drain and they've become a team you just don't want to even watch or root for."
"Warriors win 73+ games, Curry wins MVP, and they sweep the playoffs 16-0 and then Kevin Durant re-signs to piss everyone off further. "
"I hate Kevin Durant for going to the Warriors but if he ever has like 58 or 68 points and the ball with 10 seconds left in a blowout, I'd hope he takes the shot tbh"
He could have hit an elderly veteran in the face like Kevin Durant

Did you ever hear about Kevin Durant being a snake?
"I don't think Durant will leave the Warriors. I think some of the reasons people speculate he would go to the Knicks are:  Lance Thomas and Royal Ivey are by KD's own words, two of his favorite people in the league.  Scott Perry was one of the executives on the Supersonics that drafted him.  Kevin Knox (close to KD's brother and mother) and Allonzo Trier (from Seattle) both look up to KD and have been mentored by him.  KD's agent Rich Kleiman is a lifelong Knicks fan and posted on Twitter: ""Imma run the Knicks one day""."
"I love the obsession this sub has with trying to tell itself basketball is the most popular sport.  Y’all remind me of a certain Kevin Durant...if basketball is actually so popular, no need to tell people about it."
"Yea having Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green can get anyone on the receiving end of highlight reel opportunities on a regular basis"
Kevin Durant + Russell Westbrook.

Oh shit Kevin ~~Durant~~ Knox is back
u/toronto416ix then added Lebron James and Kevin Durant to the list of players he wouldn't talk with while dribbling.
"It’s not that he’s not a great player or good person. My personal gripe with him IS his rags to riches story ON THE BASKETBALL COURT.   He wasn’t successful with Cleveland the first time around and when he faced adversity (couldn’t get past Boston) he ran and teamed up with Wade and Bosh.  No other superstar on his level (the MJ’s the Kobe’s, the Magic Johnson’s, the Larry Bird’s, etc) has ever done something like that before.   Then, on arrival in Miami, to guarantee “not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5” championships before stepping onto the court, he was doomed. We (the haters) all wanted to see him fail.   He eventually won but a lot of people (the MJ/Kobe fans) didn’t feel he EARNED that championship.   I’m a Lebron hater myself but the championship he won when he returned to Cleveland, I respect it. The adversity of playing a 73-9 team, being down 3-1 (despite the controversial ejection of Draymond Green in game 5 if my memory serves me right) cleaned up his image from the haters.   Then the issue with Lebron fans is they had a HUGE problem with Kevin Durant running to the Warriors after losing to them on the verge of victory. As bad as that move by KD was...its like, the NERVE of a Lebron fan to have ANYTHING to say about KD’s move after Lebron has notoriously teamed up in the past.   (Let’s not forget on his return to Cleveland, he practically forced Kevin Love to Cleveland, let’s not forget the trades he practically managed himself last season when CLE was playing TERRIBLE basketball before the allstar break)  So, it’s not that we (the Lebron haters) think he’s a bad basketball player or terrible person, I think we just don’t respect HOW he won the rings in Miami and running away from adversity when he couldn’t get past the Celtics.   Expecting posts about Kobe demanding a trade in LA, MJ almost leaving Chicago, and the dreaded “no championship team wins with one superstar” conversations to follow...  Despite those narratives, Kobe didn’t leave, as close as he was about to and MJ didn’t leave either.   Now about the “No team wins with one superstar” debate....that’s factual, but prior to Lebron, no player had assembled a team together thru free agency the way he did when he went to Miami.   I think this might answer your question OP. "

"Yeah I'm not naïve, I understand that this is unlikely, and that the players would still need guaranteed money.   But some teams are already crippled by bad contracts, that's the reality of doing business in the NBA.   But a hard cap should help curb some of those bad contracts, and if nothing else, prevent teams from being able to sign Kevin Durant and then just going into their bird rights to re-sign Steph.   And look, I'm not mad about it lol good for Gstate they deserve their success, but for the rest of the fan bases it would proliferate movement of some stars to other markets.  "
We will get our team back and Kevin Durant is coming to retire with us. 
The 73-9 Warriors are better than the same team with Kevin Durant? TIL.
"It’s foolish to evaluate the 4 guys you listed as one entity. Much better to unpack them individually and evaluate what they are now, what they could be in the future, and what they could realistically fetch in a trade.  Ingram is a good place to start. He has major potential in the long run. Athletically gifted, can’t teach a guy to have his measurements. People heard the Durant comparisons when he came out of college and have kind of naturally assigned that to be his ceiling. What we have seen of him this far in the NBA doesn’t really lend itself to that comparison, but the potential is still undeniably there. A more realistic projection of his career probably sees him as a second option for a contender. More of a Lamar Odom than a Kevin Durant. Lamar was a great player, and any NBA team should want to invest in a 22 year old Lamar Odom. But if the Lakers wanted to push their chips in and contend immediately to capitalize on the rest of LeBron’s prime, Ingram is the guy they’d have to look to deal. For the Lakers to deal Ingram, they would need to be targeting an established high-level veteran who could put them over the top.  Lonzo is another interesting trade candidate. He’s a very high-floor prospect, with a crazy high ceiling that is extraordinarily unlikely to be reached. He’s got great size, handles, BBIQ, and passing ability. He’s almost certain to be part of many winning NBA teams in his career. The problem with Lonzo is that he has a deadly combination of pedestrian athleticism (Relative to his NBA peers of course) and a jumper that is going to need a ton of improvement. So, while he’s almost certain to be a valuable NBA player for many years to come, he’s never going to be a guy to singlehandedly carry a team. The only way I see a Lonzo trade working out for the Lakers is if they found another team with a young nucleus that has its scorers in place but needs a long-term court general. Honestly, it seems like the team that fits that description the best is the LAKERS themselves. LeBron and his limited window being around complicates that, but all in all, I can’t see the Lakers moving Lonzo unless they also moved Ingram and/or signed another bigtime star this offseason.  Kuzma definitely best fits the description of a fanbase overrating their young talent. Kuzma is what he is: tall, athletic, bouncy, aggressive on the court. He could certainly develop into an above-average shooter, he could certainly learn to become a better defensive piece. But nobody is going to pony up very much to acquire Kyle Kuzma right now. For a contending team, he’s best served as an energy guy off the bench, with the unfortunate caveat that he mostly needs the ball in his hands to be effective. He is also an effective cutter, and putting him on the floor with great passers is going to lead to some easy buckets on the offensive end. But a young team is unlikely to have interest in trading for him, and a contending team is likely to view him as a bench piece. Very hard to see how he could fit into a trade that makes sense for the Lakers unless it’s a 3-4 team deal or unless he’s a throw-in sweetener.  Hart is the easiest to evaluate. He’s an above-average 3pt shooter who is still learning to play NBA defense. He can either be used to trade for a veteran role player, or held onto to further develop as a young role player himself. He fits on the court with LeBron as well as any of the other current Lakers really, so there should be no rush to dangle him in a trade. He’s an awkward fit with some of the other LeBron-X-X-X lineups the Lakers currently can feature, since they don’t have many other shooters defenders are forced to respect. But if the Lakers are able to scheme and force Hart’s man to offer help defense, Hart will be able to get his shots. If the Lakers decide to rebuild this roster to a more conventional LeBron “surround him with shooters” roster, Hart is absolutely a keeper. If they decide to double down on a different style of basketball, it’s possible that Hart is a square peg in a round hole. But again, as a trade asset, Hart is only ever going to fetch another veteran who fills a niche.  So, after typing all of this out, I guess my conclusion is that these players are more intertwined than I thought originally. Magic needs to figure out his short and long term visions. The options aren’t pretty. Stay the course with the young guys and risk wasting the rest of LeBron’s prime, or sacrifice a ton of future value in order to put a contending team around LeBron right now. So much depends on the results of next summer’s free agency, so the most likely play for the Lakers is to ride this season out and wait til after FA to make big moves. There’s no moves to make this season that give them a great chance against GS anyway."
Instead of just looking at the advanced stats you can actually watch him and see that he is unlike any other player to ever play. He did all this with only one other major offensive weapon - Klay - on his team before KD got there. His numbers got a little less impressive when KD arrived and now they’re going back up to what they were his unanimous MVP year. So why would having the team he has affect how prolific and great he is. Players are leaving KEVIN DURANT open to come guard him from 30 feet out. He’s clearly the front runner for MVP idc if MJ is coming off the bench.  
Kevin Durant won MVP with Westbrook.   Sabonis played with Westbrook in his ROOKIE year so ofcourse his numbers are going to jump year 2 even if he stayed in OKC.   Kanter had his best year on OKC.   When Harden was on OKC he was still a young player and after he left he did indeed play ALOT better so you can have that one.   Oladipo also played on the Magic and played just as bad as he did on OKC and put up pretty similar stats despite playing a few minutes less.   Just looking off stats alone Ibaka played WAY better on OKC then he has since he left. One season even avg more points then he is this season but had 3 blocks a game more rebounds and more steals per game.   Reggie Jackson as you mentioned shouldn't even be on here as it was clearly injuries............   So stop spreading false info the only ones on this list that did better was Harden and Oladipo but you can't really say Oladipo since he did not play worse after joined OKC from the magic he was just a average player before joining Pacers.
Kevin Durant is on the Warriors.......
I don't mind people wanting to see other teams win. I don't mind if people want Kevin Durant to go elsewhere. I mind people wanting us to lose *Klay*.

"Draymond Green is a great  teammate!  It was after the 2016 Finals ended where the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead to the Cleveland Cavaliers , Draymond Green was on his way to another Finals appearance after blowing a 3-1 lead and he called Kevin Durant from the Warriors parking lot.  ""Do you..."" Draymond tried saying before being interrupted by K.D....  ""Yes i'll play for the Warriors"" Durant responded. ""I'm already in Oracle  taping my name over Harrison Barnes name on his  jersey"". ""He needs to stop moving so i can write my name"".  When Green retold the story Sunday, he couldn't remember what he wanted to ask K.D. Whether it was if K.D wanted Dray to hang out with K.D's alt account online or go catch a movie is yet to be determined.   "
definitely not  who is lebron better than this season?  DEFINITELY NOT  1. stephen curry  2. kevin durant  3. kawhi leonard  4. anthony davis  5. honestly you can put giannis or lebron here.   so really lebron aint even top 5 this season. but again ill give him the benefit of the doubt because of who he is.   yall swear lebron like 29 or something. dude looks old af out there
Most players they could sign are not as good as Kevin Durant. Durant was their leading scorer in 4 games that series just as an example. It could make a big difference.
"How are we getting content this quality at 4AM lmao this is great   ""Ring Chaser Kevin Durant"""

Draymond’s major mistake here is assuming for god knows what reason that he is more valuable to the franchise than Kevin Durant.  They would ship his ass to Lithuania if it meant just keeping KD open to staying.
"I mean listen to what you're saying... Steph curry the reigning two time mvp was playing like shit... AND THEY STILL HAD A 3-1 LEAD OVER A TEAM STARRING LEBRON JAMES AND TWO OTHER SUPERSTARS.  ...WITHOUT KEVIN DURANT...   And yet, despite having their core completely intact, you still somehow think they wouldn't even be a top-3 team?   That shit just makes no kind of sense."
What the fuck kinda revisionist shit? They were up 3-1 blowing the goddamn doors off the Cavs.  They didn't need Durant to beat that Cavs team. They needed steph to play slightly better.    Their option was Harrison barnes max vs. Kevin Durant max.  They would've been dumb to not pursue KD no matter what
"At one point in the middle of a game, sources said, Green turned to All-Star teammate Kevin Durant and screamed, ""We don't (bleeping) need you. We can win without you."" Green left teammates and coaches largely speechless."
yeah they totally ran it back in 2017 by signing KEVIN DURANT lmao  guess the cavs should've casually added a top 3 player in the league too
"They are adding a top 3 player. You really don't think Kevin Durant could single handedly get them into the playoffs especially in the eastern conference. Even if they don't make the playoffs, the pick is going to be in the 10-14 range which doesn't seem worth for the Warriors."
Kevin Durant is a handsome young man.
No but 0 points 5 turnovers and he thinks he should have the ball in the final seconds in the game over Kevin Durant.  He's an idiot.
0 points 5 turnovers and he thinks he should have the ball in the final seconds in the game over Kevin Durant.  He's an idiot.
"Nobody is saying he will be shut down, my point is he will be good but not outrageously good and won’t cause as much chaos which is a huge deal.  Modern Defenses have adapted to how Steph is playing and switching with length, athleticism is the way to go. That’s not to stop Steph but to slow him down enough individually and more importantly so that he doesn’t cause chaos for the opposing defence and then the warriors are so much tougher to deal with. It started with the Rockets last year and you can bet your bottom dollar that Celtics and Raptors will have a better playoff small ball defence.   You have to remember that the Cleveland team that the warriors went against had Kevin Love as a weak link and even then he couldn’t really go off. Even Houston had a james Harden who was good in the post but would make mistakes on off ball D and even on ball D on the perimeter.  It’s the changes that are happening now that makes Durant even more important cos they still haven’t found an answer to him."
"To support him, Warriors will sign star forward Kevin Durant in 2019 free agency. "
"Why are you sleeping on the Clippers. They are stacked. Adding him would make them instant contenders. Just think about it. Chris Paul, JJ Reddick, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, and Deandre Jordan. "
KEVIN DURANT CANNOT CARRY A TEAM. HE NEVER HAS AND NEVER WILL.
"""Late in a loss to the Houston Rockets, Golden State's Kevin Durant hit Clint Capella with a right elbow. He has been suspended indefinitely and banned from campus"""
So Kevin Durant wouldn’t be an all-star if it wasn’t for Steph? Hot take
Kevin Pachulia Durant
Sorry people had the nerve to discuss draymond calling Kevin Durant a bitch repeatedly on national television because he was embarrassed he turned the ball over.   That narrative isn’t going anywhere. 
"Fuck outta here. If you have a chance to sign Kevin fucking Durant, you're telling me you should pass on it cuz of ""muh pride"" reasons? LOL. They got 3 rings out of this; I think they care more about that than beating Lebron ""for vengeance""."
Why is Lakers star Kevin Durant on that list?
Kevin Durant is your best player

"Fuck the warriors, fuck their announcers, fuck kevin durant, and most importantly, fuck /r/nba"
"The best part of whole video was when Chuck said ""The reason Warriors are dynasty because of Kevin Durant"" and Shaq Groaned in dissapointment."
"[Chris Webber during a game where Golden State is playing poorly]: Kevin Durant is the greatest player to ever step foot on the court, congrats to LeBron on passing Wilt btw"
"Warriors won the most regular season games in history, added Kevin Durant, and then didn't meet that mark again. Clearly, Kerr was the problem /s"
Kevin Durant has the greenest of green lights right now lol 
FRIENDSHIP WITH KEVIN DURANT ENDED  KEVIN DURANT IS NOW MY NEW BEST FRIEND
"They bout to baby Durant. Everyone on that team talks about Kevin like he is the only player that really matters, but really it just signals that he is the least mature and the only really selfish player among them. "
Adding Kevin Durant to their roster pushed them from being regular title contenders to a dynastic team. There's no real question about it. They were 1-1 beforehand and a lot has changed around the league in the years since their first championship.  Overlooked in all of this is that **they had the space to add Kevin Durant** thanks to great management. That similarly positioned them to sign other free agent wings at the time. 
But they were beatable in the playoffs. How many other teams do you know that could rest Steph Curry in the first round of the playoffs and be fine because they have a talent like Kevin Durant chilling on their team
"If you recall, [Jarrett Jack was the first person Durant contacted when he was considering joining the Warriors](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/kevin-durant-asked-jarrett-jack-about-stephen-curry-before-joining-warriors/). Called him and asked about what it's like to play with Curry."
Kevin Durant is a fucking bitch. I'm glad Draymond feels the same way.
"&gt; FMVP is voted on by a very small and very knowledgeable group (Zach Lowe is like one of 9 people who votes on that, just FYI)  Lmfao. Okay let's look at this list for 2018:       Steve Aschburner, NBA.com: Stephen Curry     Jon Barry, ESPN Radio: Stephen Curry     Howard Beck, Bleacher Report: Kevin Durant     Lisa Hsu, Tencent: Kevin Durant     Mark Medina, Bay Area News Group: Kevin Durant     Rachel Nichols, ESPN: Kevin Durant     Tim Reynolds, Associated Press: Stephen Curry     Ramona Shelburne, ESPN.com: Stephen Curry     Jeff Van Gundy, ABC: Kevin Durant     Joe Vardon, Cleveland.com: Kevin Durant     Jeff Zillgitt, USA Today: Kevin Durant  You could argue at least half of them are mediocre analysts of the game.  And no Zach Lowe isn't on here, FYI.   FMVP is a popularity vote. I have yet to see any decent rational arguments for why finals 2015 fmvp went to Iguodala instead of Steph. That's what you call a narrative popularity vote. Last time I checked, you got people like Rachel Nichols on the panel. "
"No it didn't lol  You guys literally had the greatest regular season of all time and were one game/some unfortunate circumstances away from back-to-back titles. Yall added an MVP in his prime (from a direct competitor to boot) after this because of some fortunate circumstances regarding the cap jump and Steph's contract.  Miami went 47-35 and lost in the first round, then added Lebron and Bosh and had to *become* a championship-level squad, which obviously they didn't right away. You guys had a pre-made all-time team and added Kevin Durant lmao"
"Lebron doesn't have games where he gets most of his points from the free throw line to absolve his bad shooting. He just doesn't shoot bad same with MJ and if he does he loses. Harden, Durant, Lillard are guys who rely on the free throw line a lot during their bad shooting games.  Kevin Durant when he doesn't have a full superteam like in recent games without Curry, struggles from field like in OKC. Against Atlanta last game Kd was 9-23 (39%) from the field but 11-11 from the free throw line. Kd relies on the free throw line more than MJ and Lebron to get his efficiency up that 100% bump from the free throw line is what does it to push him over MJ and Lebron. The game before that Kd was 10-24 (41%) 11-13 FT which isn't as bad but most of his misses came in the 4th quarter and overtime as he got tired from carrying the load.  I'm not punishing Kd for making his free throws I'm just pointing out it it's his free throw shooting that on the box score makes him more efficient than Lebron. But if you watch the games, Lebron is actually making more shots and missing less, and in that way being more efficient."
Snakes and ladders!  *Kevin Durant traded to the Boston Celtics*
"Remember when KD came out and said it was complete bullshit?  &gt;“Hell no. That was all false. All false. 100 percent false,” Durant said. “He didn’t talk about none of that stuff.""  [source](https://957thegame.radio.com/articles/kevin-durant-says-lebron-james-didn-t-try-recruit-him-los-angeles-lakers-hell-no-was-all)"
this is why we get LeBron joining two all stars in Miami or two other all stars again in Cleveland or kevin durant joining the warriors.
Traded to GSW for Kevin Durant straight up
Are you actually dumb enough to think the warriors would trade Kevin fucking Durant for Gordon Hayward? You serious? 
"Thing is, KD was kinda wrong on his in-game behavior. Yes, Draymond turned the ball over, which is bad. But this excerpt from a Kevin O'Connor piece sums things up nicely:     &gt;*Green secures the rebound with only 5.6 seconds left. Maybe he should've immediately given the ball to Durant. But instead, he does what he’s been conditioned to do his entire career: push it. It isn’t just Green. Andre Iguodala sprints to the left. Thompson fills the gap on the right. Kevon Looney gallops toward the rim. Coach Steve Kerr even signals from the sideline to push the ball. This is who the Warriors are. They’ve logged the quickest time of possession following rebounds in each of the past four seasons, according to Inpredictable.*   &gt;   &gt;*Meanwhile, Durant did what he was conditioned to do: He claps, shouts, skips, and waves his arms looking to slow it down like he used to in Oklahoma City. He doesn't cross half court until 1.5 seconds remain. Sure, Green turns it over in a crucial situation, but the odds are he was looking for an open man. Durant could’ve been that option if he had simply played Warriors basketball.*   &amp;#x200B;  So, while Draymond fucked up with the turn over, his mindset was correct. If KD runs down the floor and gets in hsi spot, he likely gets the shot, but as great as KD is, the Warriors are more of a push the ball and find the right shot for the team, not for our top guy. I think Draymond's plan was to dump to Klay who was right next to him ready, but thought he saw an opening for the game winning dunk, which isn't about Draymond getting to take ''the shot'' as much as it being the easiest shot for the win.  I think Draymond was pissed KD came down on him for trying to make the right play, obviously his reaction was inappropriate but this isnt KD's team and we havnt done what we've done by changing our identity when we got him."
"""Draymond Green had granola this morning, which my sources have told me is unusual. Seems like he suddenly hates bacon and/or cereal. This could be the cause of his lack of enthusiasm for Kevin Durant lately. More on this report at 4pm Eastern."""
"&gt;That's like saying Kevin Durant is better than LeBron James, because KD has 2 FMVPs and back to back titles  But LeBron also has back to back titles and 3 FMVPs..."
Kevin “Richard Nixon” Durant 
"Take out 4 missed mid range jumpers he shouldn’t have taken, and he’s 9/18 from the field. He played well he just needs to realize it’s not a shot he should take. He isn’t very good at it. He’s not Kevin Durant. It’s just something they need to drill into him. Only person who should be shooting a midrange on the team is Gorgui when it’s him and shooters on the floor and he’s got space. Or Rose off a screen. "
"What is my perfect crime? I break into The Warriors at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No. I go for the championship; it's priceless. As I'm taking it down, Klay catches me. He tells me to stop. It's his father's business. He's Golden State. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell him to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust him. Besides, I love the cold. Thirty years later I get a postcard. I have a son. And he's Kevin Durant. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Klay to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. He's been waiting for me all these years. He's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the championship."
"2016 we agree on so I won't comment on it here, other than to say he played great. Not well; great.  &amp;nbsp;  I remember watching the 2015 Finals, and I have to say I didn't remember Igoudala ""torching"" LeBron. But maybe my memory was a little hazy, so I went back and checked the game logs on basketball reference. Iggy's averages were 16, 6, and 4. Granted, he shot efficiently, but that's hardly ""torching"" someone, given that they were harolded for their defense on LeBron who averaged 36, 12, and 8. And if you watched those games, with no Kevin Love and no Kyrie after regulation of game 1, you'd know there's a reason he had to take so many inefficient shots and why his assists weren't higher: he had 0 help. When Matthew Delevadova and Timofey Mozgov are crucial parts of your offense in the Finals, chances are you're fighting an uphill battle.  &amp;nbsp;  As for 2017, he did get beat by Durant pretty consistently - he's one of the greatest scorers of all time for a reason. But if you'll recall, LeBron was one vote away from winning Finals MVP on the losing team that year for putting up averages of 34, 12, and 10 on ridiculous efficiency (64% eFG). I don't exactly call that ""torched."" In 2018, LeBron had 34, 9, and 10 on 53/33/84 and Durant had 29, 11, and 8 on 53/41/96 - pretty damn elite on both sides; again no ""torching.""   &amp;nbsp;  Now I get that maybe I'm taking you a little out of context here and you meant strictly on defense. But, other than Durant, no individual on any team seeks out to ""attack"" LeBron on defense the way other teams have learned to attack Curry; Finals, playoffs, or regular season. "
"That's like saying Kevin Durant is better than LeBron James, because KD has 2 FMVPs and back to back titles (over LeBron at that), and will likely get his 3rd this year.   Or hell, even worse, if you tried to claim Draymond Green was better because he has 3 rings and has beaten LeBron 3 out of 4 times, and the only time GSW lost was because Dray got suspended for the end of a series. "

"It depends on who he does it with. If Kevin Durant goes there, it kind of cheapens it. If he does it with someone like Boogie or Middleton, then it looks a lot better for his legacy. "
"I mean if he tells you he's leaving then I'd probably trade him. I'm sure whatever the return is, it will be enough to win the championship. You are trading Kevin Durant so someone will have to give something of value    If there's no offer that guarantees you the championship, then I'd keep him"
"&gt; He acts like he's the reason why Gsw has won two chips when he joined a 73 win team  Do you have any quotes or anything or are you just going to continue to pull things out of your ass and throw emojis at me?

He literally just hasn't said anything of substance and people like you get upset he won't keep you up to date on every one of his personal decisions.

"Is Mark Jackson always this stupid? Lillard takes tough shots because he has no one else to pass to? LOL?? ""not like kevin durant who has klay thompson"" ?? ??"
"OK, I did a dive into every draft since 2003 and compiled the 10 of the best rated prospects since Lebron, in roughly decreasing order, from my memory. This doesn't mean who I believed would be good, but my love of the NBA and NCAA and following up with the mock drafts and all of that. These were the players everybody thought were amazing and everybody who loved the game knew to be great. Even if they weren't drafted #1, a large percentage of the fans thought they were a clear #1:  * Dwight Howard * Blake Griffin * Anthony Davis * Greg Oden * Kevin Durant * Derrick Rose * John Wall * Joel Embiid * Michael Beasley * Markelle Fultz  Of these, not all of them generated that much hype. Like Dwight Howard was well known, but he wasn't Lebron. Blake Griffin was especially well known because he was a sophomore, but not the most excitable guy. Greg Oden was extremely polished and accomplished, but it's not even hindsight, plenty of people didn't think he was a surefire #1. Rose came out of nowhere and became a #1 consensus pick, but nobody had thought that for most of the year. John Wall is good, but who thought he was a can't miss? Embiid was truly hype-worthy, but people feared he was another Greg Oden. Fultz was widely considered the best player in a loaded draft, but literally nobody talked about him because everybody talked about Lonzo, instead.  So, what does that leave? I say, Kevin Durant, Michael Beasley, and the Brow. I think all three had amazing seasons to build that hype, and even if they didn't go #1, people were genuinely excited by all of them. But since only the Brow actually went #1 and also won the Championship, I'm going to say he's the gold standard by which every prospect should really be measured in terms of hype.   Speaking of Lonzo, Lonzo generated a ton of hype. But people rarely thought of him as a #1. Luka could have been a #1, but there were just as many naysayers. Zion in his early going seems closer to Lonzo than Luka, but it's easy to forget that amid all the Lonzo hype, nobody was actually that excited by Lonzo's personality. It was Lavar doing all of it. Zion is truly box office. He seems like he can sell tickets, too. So I think he's somewhere between a Luka and a Lonzo in terms of hype."
Kevin Durant is head and shoulders above Kawhi as a scorer. It’s not close. But Kawhi is a very capable scorer himself. As seen in the 16-17 season and post season. And kawhi is a much better perimeter defender. They are both top 3 players to me
Rather have AD. Fuck Kevin Durant 
"""KEVIN DURANT, WE COMIN' FOR YOU -"""
I haven’t seen people call him a better *pure scorer* then kd and actually get support for it but I’ve seen people ranking him ahead of Kevin Durant as a player which I find absurd lol
a pitiful excuse for a man who has gotten laid more than Kevin Durant has. George was a manwhore. 
Kevin Durant and being a bitch 
"If you're talking about Pels fans mentioning it's because we specifically don't have good wings. It's not like saying ""Oh we could really use Lebron James or Kevin Durant"". Just a mid level SF."
"You are right, kevin durant is only 6’9   Again, sticking your arm out isnt hand checking. HC is putting an arm on the players hips and forcing him from going into a similar direction. It is a skill to use your strength, use your arms, to force him into a shot he isnt comfortable taking instead of allowing him to freely waltzes behind 5 screens until he ends up taking a shot hes comfortable with.  With hand checking you could force him to dribble away from a potential screen. For insteance if u see green setting up at te top of the key jordan might hand check curry towards the corner and force curry to play 1v1. Thats a high iq play. Just an example, but it allows the defense to dictate the play just as much as the offense.     The quality big men are good players, but the play backseat support roles. They rebound, set screens, and block shots occasionaly. Most of those guys cant even play in the post lmao. Almost none besides embiid and AD can create shots in the post compared to elite bigs of the 90s. Embiid, Cousins and AD are some of the only true bigs left, bigs that create post offense, that have had offenses created around them, and that other teams are scared of    And wow did u misunderstand my point, or maybe u did it on purpose. I said embiid and cousins have post play in ther arsenal,  not that they primarily play in the post. That also proves my point, that post play has declined, and if we allowed to list opinions no center can be an all time great unless he can create his own shot in the post. Why their teams dont utilize post play that often when they both have elite skillsets is beyond me, especially they both shoot with more efficiency closer to the basket than away from it. Especially goven that the warriors have an essentially open paint with how many elite shooters they have, not that it really males a difference to them lol.     &gt; Teams rarely use zone now  Lmao     &gt; Saying that bigs are more skilled now is general knowledge at that point  Thats an opinion, of course i countered with an opinion. I value centers who are true post up bigs and are good enough to have an offense centered around them. I guess you enjoy seeing centers who are essentially just tall guards like KAT and AD   Centers rebound less today (this is a trend that has been going on since tbe 60s, where majority aberaged 20+ rebounds a game   The only active center on the all time rebound lis tis dwight howard at #14.    A lot of centers like jokic, gobert and steven adams just set screens, play decent perimeter d(which in my opinion shouldnt be required of a center but those are the times we live in so i just gotta suck it up) and and rebound.    The modern big is not essential, but a commodity who supports the guards who are the real core of the team(only exceptions are embiid and AD lmao)   Modern centers at most are equal rebounders, are worse scorers(especially in the post) and worse post defenders.    In a matchup most elite bigs of the past would crush modern bigs. As the majority of centers today with a few exceptions arent good enough at the 3 pt line to make a defense there but are too small amd lack tbe post defense neccesay to guard old school bigs who would dictate the pace of the game. For example i doubt any center today could out rebound hakeem or shaq. Only AD would last against them there.     You keep repeating that modern bigs are versatile, have more skills and are more “mobile” without acknowledging they had to lose other skills to obtain those. Also that they are more mobile is an assumption and nothing you can say to me will statistically prove you are right, your only comeback is “well its general knowledge” which isnt a fact lol.     You wanna call this a truce cuz honestly this is going nowhere and its clear nobody will back down lol "
But what if Tim Duncan IS Kevin Durant?
"I'm just going on what was reported and it sounded like Draymond did not act respectfully at all as evidenced by his suspension.  Maybe in a vacuum the idea of questioning someone's commitment is not inherently disrespectful, but there's a certain way you go about it.    Also as Kevin Durant you must be thinking that you took a $30m paycut+ to help this team win so I can see why he would feel disrespected here."
You're absolutely insane if you believe Kevin Durant is a top 10 all time player. Absolutely delusional 
this is r/nba we’re ALL kevin durant
"I don't think this would have been much of a story if all it was was Draymond calling Durant a bitch.  I think Draymond calls his mailman a bitch.  I think where he crossed the line was when he questioned Kevin Durant's commitment to the franchise and his value to the team, which may impact the team's ability to re-sign KD in the future. "
Right lol. I mean I don't disagree that Kevin Durant can be immature but beyond the initial chew out what did Durant even do
"A Kevin Looney game-winner or A Kevin Durant game-winner,  hmm"
If The advent of Kevin Durant to the lakers next year is high a possibility. There’s no doubt Lebron  will elevate him to the beer player in the league.
Ugh seriously man I loved Kevin Durant because i love an underdog story and then he went and made himself the main villian
I can’t wait to get my Kevin Durant Lakers jersey. I’ve been holding out on a LeBron jersey in hopes for Durant one.
What is with all these highlights being posted lately? I missed the days when it was all shitposts of kevin durant and draymond green arguing
Where are your sources that Kevin Durant was “chastising him like a 5 year old”.  All that’s been reported was that KD said he should’ve got the ball lmao. Stop being so dramatic. 
"U heard of Kevin “pass the ball” Durant.  MVP, 2 x FMVP?  Curry can sit the entire season and come back playoffs."
&gt;Dear diary. Today I got into a tuffle with Draymond today. It hurt my feelings and I think I want to play somewhere else. Ok bye.   &gt;-Kevin Durant  FTFY
This dude really thinks it would take 7 foot Kevin Durant a full 5 seconds to get to the logo on the other side of the court
"Karl Anthony Towns is a star. He's probably a better long-term option compared to everyone in free agency, except for Kevin Durant. Something tells me that Durant and Butler wouldn't get along at all."
that one Warriors' player was Kevin Durant
"Sam Presti is the best GM in the summer. 2016, he got Westbrook to re-sign and brought in Oladipo to soothe temporarily. 2017, he trades for Paul George. 2018, he beats the Lakers in the Paul George sweepstakes.   2019, he clears cap space through trades and re-acquires Kevin Durant. Golden State gets their original team back, and a successful Kevin Durant rejoins Westbrook and George to win OKC's first ring.   Who says no?"
I’ll take one Kevin Durant if Kawhi leaves.
Lebron and Kevin Durant on the same team... would KD dare clap at lebron like he did to draymond?
Kevin Durant to join NASA confirmed
I mean surely the great Kevin Durant should be able to carry the greatest regular season team of all time without their best player right? Steph already proved that he doesn’t need KD 
You just switched from what you were arguing in the other comment. Obviously Curry handles situations like this better. But its still a better play to give the ball the Kevin Durant as opposed to stumble down the court. 
"So on a technical level, yes that is the correct play. But when you have a scorer like Kevin Durant you go against what is technically correct. Half the shots the MJ shot were probably technically the wrong shot to take. But because of who is shooting the ball it is the right play. "
"All I'm saying is when I say my personal opinion, why is someone responding referencing this subs opinion at all relevant, what does that have to do with anything?   &gt; Of course not everybody says the same thing but if I asked you if this subreddit respected KD or not, would you respond ""lol this sub is 1.4 million people not everybody thinks the same?""  Depends, are you asking that after I make a comment just about my own opinion? Then probably. Because how else am I supposed to respond?   Person A: I like Kevin Durant, his future's interesting.   Person B: Didn't this entire sub hate Kevin Durant a year ago?   Person A: Yes. What does that have to do with my opinion though?   Is that the conversation you would've preferred?"
"Wade was battling knee issues in the 2013 Finals that limited his production, Bosh didn’t score a single point in an elimination game and Bron still beat the Spurs. We saw what Harden looks like against the Spurs.   Harden played with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, and has never had less support around him than Bron did last year or in the entirety of his first career in Cleveland.  Hardens team literally won in spite of him against the Clippers in game 6. Imagine the Cavs benching Bron in a 4th quarter and winning without him in the playoffs "
"Nobody stopped holding it against him. Everyone knows he is ""just"" the most talented scorer of all time. Sadly, nothing except that, not a leader, not an energy guy, not a locker room guy, was also never able to translate that talent into pulling of big wins by himself. Very rarely. Kevin Durant will finish as a top 15 player of all time, and he is, besides Shaq, probably the biggest underachiever in basketball history."
Hakeem beat 3 or 4 60 win teams in his championship run as 6th seed. Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team
2018 Finals Lebron James: 34ppg  2018 Finals Kevin Durant: 28ppg
lol these 90s Stan’s are really sensitive. Durant is and always has been miles ahead of Hakeem offensively. Absurd to suggest otherwise. Imo Kevin is one of the most talented ever people are mad he made a decision for himself and reflect that when discussing his all time placement but in20 years that’ll all be different 
"I think history won’t be as kind to Kevin Durant as some suggest. Sure, to Wikipedia basketball fans he will be looked at as a dominant champion. However, anyone that is remotely familiar with the league climate before and after his departure is very much aware of his lack of integrity. He is the most diverse and efficient scorer to ever play, and he was pretty much universally liked until July 4th 2016. He could’ve put himself in a championship position in a multitude of ways without going to the Warriors, with the Thunder arguably being his best option. I think the only thing that will help people forget his move is if OKC can somehow win a ship with Russ and PG in order to put an end to the “what if” arguments. "

Kevin O’Connor is better than Kevin Durant. Don’t @ me
Kevin Durant not making the max is an absolute steal IMO. I predict him to stay with the Warriors on  a 5 year 200 million deal.
Kevin Durant  Kemba Walker  Victor Oladipo  Demarcus Cousins  Josh Richardson  
"Kevin Durant is probably the most versatile scorer in the league, but I feel like he's actually not that versatile in terms of team role.  It's always interesting to compare him to LeBron. LeBron does not have his scoring arsenal but in many ways is a more versatile player - he can run the point or pass out of the post like a center, cut off ball or catch and shoot.   Durant is someone who will always get his points no matter what team he's placed onto, but putting him on the floor doesn't unlock as many novel offensive schemes as LeBron or even Steph does."
Kevin Durant can't control a basketball game like LeBron and can't lead like LeBron and it's always been clear as day but people need to see games like this to understand it. 
I can only imagine if Duncan had a Tmac or Kobe join him in his prime like Steph did with KD.Steph is an amazing player And hell be a top 3 pg when he's all said and done but alot of his success (winning) has been because of just being on ridiculously all time stacked teams.Pop Manu tony don't come close to having dray klay and 2nd best player in the league Kevin Durant.
Im surprised you think that.    https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;player_id1_select=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;player_id1=antetgi01&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players   Kd has no argument statistically and just dropped as many games in a row as the leader as giannis has lost all season.

"Kevin Durant is worse than Curry, Anthony Davis, and Giannis."
kevin durant is a better basketball player than curry  this subs hatred for kd is getting a little weird.. but it's never going to change that fact.  give it up
Do you think Steph gets three rings without two and then three (Kevin freaking Durant) all-stars playing with him??? 
"Ridiculous isn't it? Copying my reply to that guy above.   KD has come out and said multiple times he does NOT want to be the face of the franchise or a team leader. [Here's the GQ article where he talks about it](https://www.gq.com/story/kevin-durant-is-just-heating-up-profile). That's one of the reasons he left OKC for GS (besides rings of course). He literally says:  &gt;""Steph Curry is the face of the franchise, and that helps me out, because I don’t have to""  &gt;""I don’t want to have to be the leader. I’m not a leader. I’m bad at saying, ‘Stand behind me and follow me.""  &gt;""No. I’m one of those guys that’s just like, ‘Let’s do this shit together. Let’s just work everybody together. I don’t mind being on the front line with you, but let’s come and do it together.""   I have no idea what team that guy is watching."
"&gt; Now he wants to take over as the face of the franchise and have all the fans ignore the OG 3.

KEVIN DURANT NEEDS MORE HELP
"I think people often misunderstand RPM in both directions. Some people put too much weight on it. Others put too little.  The underlying concept is kind of hard to convey. I remember haralabos voulgaris once talked about it on a podcast with Bill Simmons where he really described the strengths and weakness of the stat. But essentially the stat is great for things that are static and bad for describing change. For instance, it's a great stat if you want to convey how good a veteran is, whether that person is Kevin Durant or Trevor Ariza. Because they are mostly the same player over years. And that's where there's enough sample to make the math work. I think Shane Battier famously was a guy Morey targeted through the work of the guy who invented adjusted plus-minus.   However, the stat can be misleading for players that you know are changing. For instance, players coming off injuries like Cousins or Heyward. Or players that just broke out like Oladipo or DeAaron Fox. Because RPM will look at their stats from previous years and regress their performance. Now, ESPN probably will say they incorporated other factors to mitigate this issue, but regardless at its core adjusted plus-minus will always have this issue, in the sense that it's not describing the current player, but the player maybe a few months ago.  That said, it's still very good and really help distinguish players who may contribute more or less to winning than traditional box score stats. But just understand when it may have trouble, because there is never a single one-size-fits-all stat. "
"Which resulted in Kevin Durant (who has admitted he would not consider the warriors had they won), cutting the gloating period hilariously short, pissing off every fanbase except for the Warriors."
"[King] After someone told him he's a great teammate, Kevin Durant left the locker room saying he doesn’t celebrate losing. “Fuck Golden State.”"
" Attention all Warriors Fans. Kevin Durant has lost his last 3 games and he NEEDS your help to get that EPIC COMEBACK. All he needs is your credit card number, the expiration date and the 3 numbers on the back. Act fast warriors fans, KD NEEDS to get that EPIC comeback so he can POSTERIZE Russel Wesbrook!!! "

"It is absurd that people do that to Kevin Durant, but at a certain point he needs to accept it as a possible reality and learn to control what he can control, his own emotions, and not yell at immature fans and instead cash his 35 million dollar paycheck and be a positive role model for kids by taking the highest road possible. It's the more challenging option, but it's the right way to handle your life. "

"I can't wait for Kevin Durant to join this western conference contending juggernaut, this brilliantly constructed roster"
"I'm all for taking calculated risks and what not. But it sure seems like this guy is batshit crazy ...  He's the #1 overall pick - it doesn't matter how many teams he gets traded to.  That baggage will always be hanging over him.  It seems like this guy is completely unequipped to handle the pressure of the situation he's under.  IMO it seems like he's got the thin skin of Kevin Durant, the communication skills of Kawhi Leonard, and the potential to be a #1 bust along the lines of Kwame Brown and Kandi Man.  Sorry, it's a hard pass for me.  Impossible Mission."
"The only way he joins GS is if the Warriors give New Orleans Kevin Durant and he agrees to re-sign. This is assuming AD wants out, and I don't think he does."
Damn I expected Lil B - Fuck Kevin Durant (LBJ remix)
"The articles are so embarrassing. &gt;“I saw the ambulance from behind me, and it was kind of slow in front of me, and I moved over. I said, ‘I’m just going to follow the ambulance so I can get through traffic real quick,’” Kevin Durant said. “So I moved over. I can’t take full credit for that.”"
"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/9/19/16335582/kevin-durant-confession-tweets  It's also where the ""Can't win with these cats"" meme came from. If KD's tweets from his alt are to be taken as truth then he didn't have an issue with Russ (cat he couldn't win with) so much as the rest of his teammates."
"I'm not sure the Pacers would have been interested in the trade package you're talking about. Mogzov is and was a *huge* negative trade asset, and Julius Randle at that time didn't represent a huge asset either (keep in mind this was before last season). But even if what you say is true, the Lakers *still* would have had to move a lot of salaries around to try to create the cap space for LeBron, as Russell and Paul George's cap hold would have represented about $40 million in salaries and cap holds that the Lakers did not have to account for last summer, so it's not like LeBron could have just squeezed in there too.  You need to keep in mind the Lakers *still* have a max cap slot next summer and could very possibly add Kevin Durant in free agency without giving up anyone. So in that hypothetical lineup you're comparing D'Angelo Russell to both Lonzo *and* Kuzma and you're comparing KD to PG. Shit, I'll take the one with Lonzo, Kuzma and KD every time. Especially when this time next year Russell could be a wildly overpaid player if some team gets suckered into giving him a big contract this summer.  IMO D'Angelo Russell is a poor prospect. He's unathletic, he's injury prone, he's reputed to have a lazy work ethic, maturity issues and a laughably low basketball IQ. On top of that he's an inefficient scorer and an extremely poor defender. I think Lonzo is a vastly better prospect than Russell is, full stop. So is Josh Hart. So is Kyle Kuzma. For the life of me I'm not sure what exactly Laker fans like yourself continue to see in D'Angelo Russell. He's a bad teammate and a huge liability when it comes to making a commitment to him. I think the Lakers were not only incredibly wise but incredibly lucky to be able to use such a poor prospect as a way to dump one of the worst contracts in the league while simultaneously picking up a 1st round draft pick. You disagree with all of this though, so we'll just have to agree to disagree."
They paid for a ticket and you're getting paid millions. Suck it up. Grown men also shouldn't act like manbabies and take the easiest possible way out of every challenging situation in their lives. The only person not sleeping at night worrying about what people think of them is Kevin Durant.

Kevin Durant - The Servant
"I agree with you, but I remember reading that he got booed in the first preseason game which was in Toronto if I remember right.  Edit: it was vs. Toronto, but in Vancouver because preseason.   https://www.nba.com/article/2016/10/01/kevin-durant-preseason-debut-golden-state-warriors"
"**Warning: This got way longer than I expected**  You forgot he was there because he isn't really there yet haha. Achilles injuries are goddamn rough though, so we have no idea what kind of Boogie we're gonna get. I'm not gonna count on Boogie being Boogie until we see it.  So as of right now, Toronto's playing significantly better defense per 100 possessions than GS. Now that probably takes a bit of a hit when you swap out Lowry for Curry, but you're still looking at a defense with Leonard, Green, Ibaka &amp; Siakam. Golden State's top defenders would still be great, with Dray/Iggy/Klay/Durant/Lowry offering a strong defensive lineup. For me, though, it's pretty hard to overstate the effect Leonard has on a defense.   Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, to pick Golden State here, I think you'd have to drastically underestimate the Steph Curry effect. Those clean looks KD and Klay get now? Those fall off drastically. The wide open shots Iggy and Dray sometimes knock down? Those fall off, too. Dray and Iggy effectively become ball-stoppers, and Dray's playmaking ability becomes almost 100% of his offensive value. Given the current state of his chemistry with Durant, that would scare me if I were GS. I believe Durant will have to win games on his own more often, even with All-Stars all around him.   Meanwhile, Danny Green, Leonard, and Ibaka start to get those looks for Toronto, and their shooting numbers are likely to improve quite significantly, and that's in addition to the straight-up offensive improvement from Lowry to Curry, which is quite a gulf itself.  So with the starting 5, Golden State starts to rely fairly heavily on Kevin Durant. His ability to create for himself and hit contested shots will go a long way in determining what kind of opportunities Lowry and Klay get.. but Durant will have to do that with Kawhi Leonard defending him. Meanwhile, Klay will have Danny Green stuck to him, and Toronto probably hides Steph on D by asking him to commit to preventing Lowry from getting clean looks from three,  leaving Ibaka and Siakam to limit Lowry if he gets past Steph off the dribble. That Ibaka/Siakam combination also works to clog passing lanes and cut off slashes to the basket from Klay and Iggy. Toronto mostly leaves Dray on an island and challenges him to make jump shots if GS wants to win.  On the other side of the ball, question number one becomes, ""Who will guard Steph Curry?"" I would contend that no one *can* guard Steph Curry, but GS would have to decide between Iggy, Lowry, Klay &amp; Dray, and they'd likely have to use another one primarily on Leonard. Iggy and Dray are both extremely capable defenders, and I would trust one of them to limit Leonard to a degree, but I think Steph's too quick and too inventive for either of them. I would guess we see Iggy try to take Steph, but keep in mind that Iggy would probably play about 15 minutes fewer than Steph in Finals games, so Klay and Lowry would likely have their own work to do on Steph.   The next question is what to do with Durant. Do you use his length to protect the paint or to attempt to neutralize Kawhi? My guess is that Durant protects the paint while Dray focuses on Kawhi, with Durant taking Kawhi when the Dubs play big.    Ultimately when you compare the starting 5s, I think Toronto would likely frustrate Golden State more than GS would frustrate the Raps, and that comes down to this hypothetical Raps squad featuring, in my view, the best offensive player AND the best defensive player in the game.   Kawhi can hassle Durant and force Klay, guarded by Danny Green, to create for himself quite a bit, and if Lowry's shot isn't falling, GS would have to rely on his ability to get to the basket against Ibaka and Siakam. I think the Leonard-led Raps defense is stifling and forces KD to lead the team when he's truly frustrated on offense by maybe the only player in the NBA who can guard him.   Steph opens up the Raps offense and presents awkward matchups for the Dubs defense, freeing up clean looks for Raps shooters who see a hand in their face more often than not right now, as well as the occasional wide open dunk for Siakam and Toronto's post players off the bench  In summation, I think it comes down to this:  * Toronto's primary offensive weapon, Curry, affects the game more than Golden State's primary offensive weapon, Durant * Toronto's secondary offensive weapon, Leonard, is a more complete threat than Golden State's secondary offensive weapon, Thompson * Toronto's primary defensive weapon, Leonard, forces Durant to play through frustration and find teammates for high-percentage shots * Danny Green makes it difficult for Klay to find open jumpers and limits his ability to slash to the rim.  * Toronto's primary defensive weakness, Curry, can be masked while either Draymond Green or Iguodala is on the floor, and especially while both are on the floor * Golden State (until Boogie shows he can be Boogie) lacks a post presence to keep Ibaka and Siakam honest, leaving them free to clog up passing lanes and get in front of slashers * Toronto has the superior bench (and if Boogie comes back, it likely leaves Iggy as the 6th man for GS, perhaps still a less effective 6th man than Valanciunas)  **TL;DR** It would take a healthy Boogie and/or Kerr outcoaching Nurse by a wide margin for Golden State to find rotations that could cause enough matchup problems for Toronto for Golden State to win any given game. With neither of those guaranteed, **Steph's Raptors beat Lowry's Warriors in 5 or 6 games**  **TL;DRTL;DR** One team goes from having two MVP candidates to 1. The other goes from 1 MVP candidate to 2. The team that ends up with 2 beats the team that ends up with 1  Fun question, OP!"
Kevin durant would probably quit if he had to play against Jordan and his trash talking.
"To be fair, we'll never know either. KD joins the Warriors, and suddenly the narrative shifts from what Curry can do to what KD can do. Now it's ""Kevin Durant and the Warriors"" which is total bullshit because you will never ever convince me that KD is a more impactful player than Steph Curry. I don't think KD is a better scorer than Steph Curry either. Steph Curry did not need KD to win a championship. Yet somehow, Steph Curry is still talked about in this way that underrates what he does on the court. This guy sets new records every year, and then breaks his own records.  Steph Curry is such a phenomenal player, and is truly the heart and soul of the Warriors. He's the engine and opens up every other thing the Warriors do. No one wants to be the guy that leaves Steph open. He's a threat from everywhere now.. he's such a good finisher at the rim. As crazy as it sounds, people need to put some respek on his name, for real."

Since then, he has seen GS make it clear that KD is the 2nd most important player on their team, and they just added Boogie.  KD is the biggest threat to Draymond staying on the team and getting paid.  He's not hurt or betrayed, he is *trying* to push KD out."
Imagine your team is so good that you want Kevin fucking Durant to go
"Kevin ""Grown Man"" Durant"
"It should be said every time Kevin Durant does something, he is a Fuckboy in every way. All of his actions are the actions I’d expect from a Fuckboy. All his words could just as easily be said by a Fuckboy. He is the truest form of Fuckboy I’ve ever seen. Respect the hell out of his basketball skills and I’m sure he’s probably great to his family and friends. But those skills and greatness are held within a Fuckboy. "
"I want Kevin Durant to be a Knick so bad, but there’s no chance this guy could handle New York media"
"Damn, the way people hate on Kevin Durant, you would think he's a politician. He deserves the backlash but I think some of these comments paint Kevin Durant like he's a...malevolent person"
Kevin Durant must hate money. He joined the Warriors for a pay cut and won't stop asking for fines.
https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2018/07/11/kevin-durant-argues-high-school-kid-instagram  Was it this? I'm guessing maybe on one of his burner accounts he did say that but y'all make it sound like he was going super personal.   https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2018/9/5/17822902/kevin-durant-instagram-argument-warriors-nba  KD owns it all here actually. 
"Kevin Durant is such a tool, I hope he misses the rest of his FG's on his own volition"
"You know, it doesn't even have to be that -- though that's certainly a part of it.  I worked in journalism for a good while and, frankly, people on the internet want journalists to be proxies for their outrage. That's not really the job. The job is to get the subject to open up and document it. Everyone has a different approach but appearing empathetic is certainly the most effective one I tried.   If you're like ""YEAH BUT YOU *ARE* A BITCH, KEVIN! WHAT DO YOU THINK ABT THAT, KEVIN?! WHAT ABT WHEN YOU WERE ON THE INTERNET BEING BAD, KEVIN?!"" then you get to be a big story, but it's a fair bet you don't get anything else out of Kevin Durant. Ever. And that doesn't even have to be in a petty way. It literally sends the message, ""No one is going to see this the way you do, so it's probably not worth trying to explain.""  Empathy, even if it's feigned, often gets people to open up as they feel like they've found a sympathetic audience. To be honest, the quote this thread is based on is interesting content because it is revealing. The journalist who got that quote might even deserve some praise for doing their actual job -- getting us insight.   I have no idea who the journalists in the room here are, and maybe they're crap. But I think it's kind of wild that everyone here believes the job of journalists is to be ""internet commenter in the room."""
Why does Kevin Durant at 30 act less mature than LeBron at 18?  I mean seriously? This why I think sometimes it must SUCK to be Lebron.  You had to act regal your whole life and you never really had a chance to act like school boy. 
Kevin Durant acts like a bitch far too often. He needs to understand that if you’re in the entertainment business (especially sports) you’ll be heckled. It’s part of the entertainment.

"Kevin Durant, the cupcake bitch"
Or the warriors with...Kevin durant...or DeMarcus cousins...
"Choking isn't about who you lose to, it's about the manner in which you lose. The GS stars absolutely had some choke jobs that series. In 3 consecutive games KD shot 9/24, 8/22 and 6/17. Breaking it down further,   In Game 4 (which GS lost), Steph Curry went 1 for 8 in the 4th quarter and Kevin Durant went 1 for 5.   In Game 5 (which GS lost), Kevin Durant went 2 for 9 in the second half overall (and Curry was 4 for 10 which isn't great but not a choke) and he was 0 for 4 in the 4th quarter!   Over these two games, Chris Paul and Eric Gordon each nearly outscored Curry and Durant in the 4th quarter ON THEIR OWN.   In Game 6, Golden State won in a blowout, but Kevin Durant was 6 for 17! He was bailed out by his two teammates combining for 65 points. How many people have the luxury to blowout 60 win teams while going 6 for 17? I know Lebron definitely doesn't.   We should give credit to Houston's defense for sure. However, historically, a star underperforming is choking no matter what the circumstances, so we should be consistent here.  "
Do you think lonzo or Fultz has the confidence to take this shot in the clutch against Kevin Durant? Only a few rookies would actually be willing to take this shot in a designed iso imo.
I will admit that I have said that. I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of basketball but I also swore up and down that Kevin Durant was going to be a bust and I'll never hear the end of it so I think in the future maybe I'll just shut up.
"Steph was unanimous MVP and lead the team to 73 wins. They’re barely .500 without him. Even when they have the same team but replace Curry with Durant, they can’t win. That’s like if Duncan left the Spurs, the replaced him with Kevin Garnett and the Spurs barely went .500"
"Kevin Durant is much more comparable to Kyrie than Lebron. Meaning, if KD's the centerpiece, he's rarely making his teammates better. "
&gt; whereas kevin has elite defense  This is becoming a very faulty narrative. Durant is far from an elite defender.
"The most complete player does not equate to being a better player.   Following that logic, there would be no debate for Lebron and Jordan. Lebron is probably the most complete player to ever play the game(scoring, passing, playmaking, rebounding, defending all positions). But would it be fair to say Jordan is worse because he can't guard centers? Absolutely not. A player can be more dominating in their stronger areas.  You can argue Curry is not a traditional point guard in the role he plays, but pretending CP3 is the same tier of scoring as Steph is delusional af. Heck, he averaged 26 points while being on the same team with Kevin Durant. He also completely transforms his team's offense when he is on the court. CP3 is pretty good defensively, but let's not act like Steph is a scrub.   In essence, you can pick whatever you want, however you want, I just find Curry to be a very dominating player in the role he plays for his team.  &amp;#x200B;"
They'll give you ~~Harrison Barnes~~ Kevin Durant in return though.
"It's not like most people are taller Curry height mogs most people and most fans. And Iverson and Rose are beloved. For me, I had my doubts about Curry because he wasn't very 'Jordanesque' in the finals, and I do question if he can do that. But I do think Curry is clearly by far better than Kevin Durant."
"In terms of FG%, centers should be 60%+ and everyone else should be between 44-50% if they're solid. The more high volume players can be on the lower end of that because of the difficulty of shots they take, but usually they'll have a high TS%, which is an advanced stat that is the best indicator of efficiency. Elite players will generally be at 58% TS &amp; above.  The best way to evaluate the top offensive players is to look at their combination of volume + efficiency. So Kevin Durant, for example, has 27 ppg on 63% TS, which is very elite. Some players have low ppg &amp; high efficiency, which makes them good role players. Some have high ppg &amp; a lower TS, which usually means they're a low-tier star. Assists are an ok indication of playmaking ability, but you really have to watch games to see how their passing/playmaking ability is.  Then you have to factor in defense, which is really only through watching them play. Defensive stats are not very good. In general, defense matters much more for centers than point guards, so if you are a great defensive C, you'll be ranked higher than a good defensive PG. Most SFs &amp; PFs should be good defenders too, but the C anchors the defense so it's most crucial to that position.  Those are the basics I think. Two-way players are usually better than one way, but there are exceptions of course if your offense or defense is transcendent (Steph Curry vs Rudy Gobert)."
"i do think that curry is better, but durant has the argument of being superstar level on both sides of the ball  curry's defense isn't bad, it's just not particularly good either. whereas kevin has elite defense. but i feel like curry's offense is so good that it eclipses that difference"
I said clearly whether or not it's the right BASKETBALL PLAY or not Draymond has earned the right to take the ball up like that because be is has been the captain of the team before and after Kevin Durant
"He hasn’t even played yet. The Nuggets are good enough that he doesn’t need to rush back. If I were a betting man (I am), I’d wager we see him back around February with a significant minutes restriction in the hope he’ll see a full work load.  Even watching his brief stint with Missouri you could tell he was rusty but at the same time he was able to get any shot he wanted due to his length and ability to release off the dribble ala Kevin Durant. It’s too much to hope that he’ll be a Top 3 NBA player but a 6-11 wing with handles who can pull up at will is still very difficult to guard at any level."
They got Kevin Fucking Durant dude. Barnes is absolutely trash compared to him.
If I remember correctly Barnes wanted the MAX when Durant was in free agency. So it was more of a obvious choice to go for proven skill Kevin Durant vs 2016 Cavalier MVP Harrison Barnes
What else do people do that demands respect? It doesn't mean I'm going to flip off kevin durant in public or knock his sandwich out of his hand. It means that i see him as a lesser person because of it: ie: i have no respect for him as a man
"You have respect for Kevin durant for taking an easy non competitive route and answering his haters personally on social media, singing his own praises through an alt account? Would you do what he did? If so, don't answer. If not, then by definition you cannot respect behavior you would not do in the same situation"
"Durant can work in any System better than a two time MVP who is the best at the most important skill in modern basketball and doesn't stand in a corner and is constantly moving? I think you're wrong on that one buddy. Look what Kevin is doing to the warriors' system, he's killing what they stand for, their winning simply because of their talent. On to your last point. Better shooter? Steph. Better playmaker? Steph. Better Basketball IQ? Steph. Better leader? Steph. "

"Kevin Durant is still more clutch, warriors need a closer if KD leaves. "

All I know is the Portland Trailblazers passed on Mochael Jordan for Sam Bowie and Kevin Durant for Greg Oden.
Not sure what your point is here as Kevin Durant is consistently double teamed and the only reason teams double curry more often on the perimeter is because   A. It’s shown to be a decently effective strategy in comparison to teaming KD  B. Double teaming KD has never worked as he still gets his points on ridiculous efficiency and he gets his points from mid range so teams will live with doubling the three point shooter and hoping Durant will miss from mid range 
"No, teams can need certain things rn based on the scheme they run and it makes the team as a whole better  As a player, Kevin Durant is better than Steph Curry  For this team, they need Curry to make the whole system operate at peak capacity  And also the Warriors have won without Curry and only KD but whatever "
"Curry is superior under the rim finisher (#1 among guards for multiple seasons), infinitely better 3-pt shooter as this season has proved (49% on 10 attempts vs 35% on 3 attempts), better from 10-16 feet midrange, superior off the ball whereas Durant refuses to move (this is huge), # 1 pace difference maker on GSW, greatest space creator in the game, superior playmaking, etc. But KD is 7 foot and can post up + dunk. Yeah.   Even in the post season, Curry drawing all the double teams and not getting his due fouls on ball + off ball... yet he's TS% is still higher on similar PPG. He even sets better screens than Kevin Durant, which is just sad. "
Kevin Durant on the 07-08 Sonics
"- Kevin Durant playing hero ball in the 4th quarter and massively failing. Doesn't take buzzer beaters as usual.  - Looney amazing with his offensive rebounds. Gave Warriors multiple opportunities.  - Luka being extra clutch - DeAndre ""Free Throw God"" Jordan needs to teach Smith Jr. how to shoot free throws. This shouldn't have been a close game if Mavericks shot well from the FT line.  - Damion ""Splash Brother-in-Law"" Lee splashes multiple 3s  - Klay Thompson shooting horribly from 3s this season. That 52 point game did little to his confidence.  - This team is complete trash without Stephen Curry "

"There's way too many links to dig up(you have to go through every game CP3 or Dame have played vs Kawhi the past 5 years) to show each one. But you can search it through NBA.com advanced box scores if you want.    I have the data in an excel sheet in my computer from when I have gone back and accumulated the totals in the past. I can just read it out to you.    Kawhi when guarding Chris Paul the past 5 years   217 poss: CP3 has scored 63 points and 14 assists 6 TOs on 60.4% TS. So it translates to 29 points/100 poss   Kawhi when guarding Dame Lillard the past 5 years    115 poss: Dame 35 points scored 6 assists 8 TOs 61% TS. Comes out to scoring 30.4 points/100 poss   Kawhi when guarding Kyrie the past 5 years(note this excludes this year)   47 poss: Kyrie has 17 points 3 assists 2 TOs 67.6% TS and it translates to 38.2 points per 100 poss.    The guys statistically Kawhi has guarded the best are Jimmy Butler(151 poss 14 points/100 poss 51% TS), Kevin Durant(514 poss 54% TS 32 points/100 poss), James Harden(430 poss 28.8 points/100 poss 54% TS) and DeMar DeRozan(241 poss 26.1 points/100 poss 50% TS). Again guys who's game is built more on size to varying degrees.  "
Because they’re not Kevin Durant.
Steph Curry is solidly the second best player in the NBA and is clearly better than Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant, the greatest play Scott Brooks ever drew up"
"Y'all's team has to be top 5 in the ""Most Poetically Disappointing Situations"" category.

KD's move would've ruined anyone's GOAT narrative. You can't act like Kevin Durant joining a team that just went 73-9 didn't upset the competitive balance in the league...c'mon...
I don't know about that. The biggest advantage the warriors have right now isn't having Kevin Durant. It's every other team *not* having Kevin Durant. Losing that makes a difference
"Kevin Durant? Is from Washington, DC which is part of the US. What home country are you referring to?"
"And OKC were the betting favorite for KD to re-sign in OKC. By a wide margin as well.  https://www.oddsshark.com/nba/odds-where-kevin-durant-will-sign-2016-nba-offseason  But ""they know things we don't"", bla bla bla.."
"Thunder need to trade Westbrook for Kevin Durant, Shroder plays better without Westbrick on the floor"
Because Kevin Durant has said he looks at Lebron James as his rival and if you think about it Lebron is the guy stopping him from being the best player in the nba. Kevin Durant did that whole thing about being tired of being second crap so how would it look like if he joined Lebron. How is he supposed to prove he is the best when he joins Lebron's team. On top of that he's joining the fucking Lakers like they haven't been winning championships for the last several decades. I would rather see him go to a different team.
I mean to be fair he didn't lose them the game he got the offensive rebound over Kevin Durant and then dribbled around till regulation expired which led to OT. You could blame George Hill for missing the FT just as much.
&gt; He isn’t the same tier as Curry    Kevin Durant is the best player in the league not named LeBron James.  
Here's a general one:  What team would say no to trading Kevin Durant for their best player?  -OR-  What team would say no to trading Draymond Green for their second best player?
"Long term future vs Immediate Impact  I’m just going to propose this to see what you guys would do. Despite the less than perfect start for the Warriors, I still feel that they will be able pull it together , and do what they do, especially during the playoffs. However, you have the #2 player with a chance of leaving this offseason. Do you keep him if it gives you the likelihood of winning it all this season.   Or  Do you look at a team like the lakers.   Would you take a deal where you receive some young players to fill the future roster with?   Say  Lakers receive - Kevin Durant Warriors receive- Ingram , Hart, maybe a pick? Might even be a better deal than that.  Would that open up some money for the Warriors to retain the original core. Possibly cleans up the locker room.   Lakers would be happy.  Kevin might be appeased.  Someone will have to assist me on the particulars of a deal like this. Bird rights/cap/ would it work? What would you do?"
&gt; Most players they could sign are not as good as Kevin Durant.  The hot takes around here...
"The discussion here is definitely more philosophical than statistical, and it involves things like the Curry effect, which is a fairly well documented phenomenon that gives Curry's teammates much better looks because defenders all instinctively cheat towards Steph because he could pull up anywhere at any time.   It also involves playing for the team and taking advantage of matchups etc. KD is a freak of nature mismatch for practically anyone, and GS would be stupid not to scheme to maximize his touches. Taking advantage of your personnel doesn't mean you *need* everyone who performs well or even that the person with the best metrics is the best team member. On some level, it means the team figured out how to optimize their performance and it benefitted a particular team member.  I love watching KD play basketball, and there was one Finals game this year that he definitely won by his damn self and that was awesome (and it made me really sad that he's winning free rings with 3 other all stars instead of putting a team on his back night-in night-out). But it's not like we haven't seen this Warriors team without KD. We have. They were the best team in the game. They were the best regular season team in the history of the game.   You end up in a philosophical circle when you really try to break it down because KD is only taking those shots because KD is a Warrior. KD is either the second or third best player in the world, and he's a tremendous asset to any team's championship odds, but Golden State was already good enough that adding KD meant that almost every basketball fan would bet on Golden State to win the championship vs. the field. That's insane. That's a league-breaking lack of parity.   If that means he's the single biggest reason they win to you, you can interpret it that way. I see it the other way around, i.e. KD's coaches and teammates are the biggest reason he's won. And just as a thought experiment to kinda demonstrate it, would basketball fans find the Warriors more likely to win the title if Steph was hurt for the entire playoffs or if KD was hurt for the entire playoffs? My sense is that a sizable majority of fans (especially Dubs fans) would be more pessimistic about losing Steph, but maybe I'm wrong there. I just see Golden State as a talented, well-coached team that optimizes its assets, not a team that relies on Kevin Durant. No team has ever had the luxury of playing a 7-foot 50/40/90 shooter next to two of the best shooters of all time and a playmaking DPOY. KD had to take advantage of his opportunities to get those FMVPs, but *especially* in 2017, KD got his numbers in large part because Kerr and the Warriors staff realized that KD could provide the easiest path to victory, and the other star players bought in.   But basically the Warriors are too good for one player to be the single biggest factor in their championships. There are a lot of factors to consider  Sorry for rambling, and I'm not trying to be argumentative, it's just hard to articulate cleanly "
"I know I’m biased as a Blazer fan but based on advanced metrics alone, lillard is having a better year than most of the people on the list. [Some other lists I have seen have him at #2 for mvp](https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/2018-19-nba-mvp-betting-odds-picks-model-kevin-durant-damian-lillard-lebron-james?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=bryanmears)"
"Every team in the league basically geared to beat them.  Aging Bogut.  They then give Harrison Barnes the fucking max.  If you thought Jimmy Butler was pissed when Wiggins got a Max, then watched out for draymond.  Cleveland in 2017 would've definitely been better than GS.  OKC too.  The league figured out how to defend them by the very end of the regular season and into the playoffs.  And with more teams adding switching wings and shooting every season, the warriors off ball passing style would only continue to erode.    That's the irony of Silver extending the 2016 finals, thinking that GS had it in the bag.  GS' reign was already coming to an end. It just led to short finals for the following seasons.  An incredibly shortsighted decision, but that's the league for you.   Kevin Durant will likely leave after this season, so we'll see how this Curry/Thompson/Green core looks alone post 2016.  "
It’s not.   And no. Anyone with a mediocre basketball iq can watch a basketball game and realize who performs better within a team. Melo was one of the most selfish players I’ve ever seen to the detriment of the team. Durant is not that.   Also if you think melo is a better team player than Kevin Durant you’re fucking drunk lmao.   Durant has played within 2 systems now. Melo dribbles the air out of the ball and plays ISO even when his teammates had much better looks.    Literally every category except maybe *maybe* contested shooting goes to Durant.   Handles: Durant (at 7 feet lol) Drive to basket: Durant  Open shooting: Durant  Shot creation: Durant  Range: Durant  Post: Durant  Passing: Durant  Pure scoring: Durant   Rebounding: Durant  Steals: durant  Man/iso defense: Durant  Zone/Team defense: Durant  Blocks: Durant  Height:Durant  Reach: Durant  Defend/ stay w opponent without help: Durant   Longevity: Durant  Endurance: Durant Success:Durant  Championships: Durant   Finals mvps: Durant  All star game mvp: Durant  Reg season MVPs: Durant   All star games: Durant  Rookie of the year      Do I really need to continue. It’s not close. 
He's describing the typical play you'd do in that situation. He's not taking into account the fact that the Kevin Durant is on the court and was about to grab that rebound.
"&gt; I don't think KD was going to stay regardless and there is no way in hell Al Horford signs with the Thunder. But again, there is no way to play out this alternative universe.  [You are wrong.](https://www.sbnation.com/2016/6/28/12043538/kevin-durant-rumors-free-agency-2016-okc-thunder-warriors-spurs-clippers-heat-celtics) He was likely going to re-sign with OKC if he didn’t want to sign with GSW. Also, [Horford was strongly considering OKC](https://www.masslive.com/celtics/index.ssf/2016/12/al_horford_reveals_he_strongly.html), but the reason why he didn’t sign there is because [there wasn’t an assurance that KD and Westbrook would stay.](https://mobile.twitter.com/wojespn/status/749385924233093120?lang=en)  &gt; The point that Draymond made WAS factual. They were an all-time great team without Durant and I did see it with my own eyes. They DID win a title without Durant and DID make a Game 7 in the year after.   I find this amusing because they won against an extremely injured Cavs team in 2015, and when the Cavs actually got healthy, they lost. "
"First of all, did Lebron die? Because Steph Curry is absolutely **not** the best player in the NBA. He’s not even the best player on his *team*.  It’s honestly hilarious how deluded some of you Warriors fans are to think otherwise.  And don’t give me the same old sob story “oh my team was trash all my life and now I finally get to see them succeed” that doesn’t change the fact that you’re the luckiest franchise of all time. It took a once-in-a-lifetime, planets aligning type of scenario for you guys to have 3 All-Stars and still have room to sign Kevin fucking Durant in free agency due to the massive cap spike that offseason. Do I blame the warriors for making the move? Hell no. But that doesn’t change the fact that it was *extremely fucking out-of-this-world lucky*.  If that didn’t happen you guys would still to this day be sitting on your one championship in 2015 that you only got because 2/3 of Cleveland’s big 3 were injured for the Finals. How fucking convenient.  Then, even after you lucked into the second best player in the world (behind Lebron), you face the red hot 65-win Spurs and get blown out in Game 1 and what happens? Their best player gets injured before the first game is even over. GG, easy win, next. Like clockwork.  This is already back-to-back lottery winning type of luck as it is, but then there’s *even more*.   Warriors get to the Conference Finals against the 65-win Rockets whose offense set multiple records in the regular season and breezed its way through the first two rounds, Warriors proceed to go down 2-3 to this team and with their backs against the wall - the Rockets’ second best player and future HOF point guard goes down.   Like. Clockwork.  The only year that your opponents in the Conference Finals and Finals *weren’t* missing one or more of their stars - you lost.  But you’re right. None of those details matter. "
"OK...again we'll never know. But I think the Warriors could easily have been a dynasty without Kevin Durant. I mean they won 73 games without him. I don't think KD was going to stay regardless and there is no way in hell Al Horford signs with the Thunder. But again, there is no way to play out this alternative universe.   The point that Draymond made WAS factual. They were an all-time great team without Durant and I did see it with my own eyes. They DID win a title without Durant and DID make a Game 7 in the year after. For some reason people are arguing something different here (that Kevin Durant is important to the Warriors, which IS also true). This is again is weird to me, because it's the exact same point that analysts, redditors, and random people on the street have been saying for years. How KD ruined the league by jumping on the bandwagon.  Again, this has devolved now into hypothetical debate show banter, when the actual words that Draymond reportedly said are undoubtedly true. "
The most Cleveland thing ever:  The Cavs were playing their best basketball in franchise history....and Kevin Durant kills it all by going to the warriors.  
Kevin Durant ruined the NBA. Prove me wrong. 
"But that exchange wasn't the issue. That happens all the time on every NBA team... Either way, if Kevin Durant asks for the freaking ball with 5 seconds left YOU GIVE KEVIN DURANT THE FREAKING BALL."
What? The [Suns](http://arizonasports.com/story/1736756/bickley-suns-tyson-chandler-buyout-grandiose-terms-kevin-durant/) on Christmas day? /s
Kevin Durant is a bitch but they did need him to beat LeBron. 
"They were a #1 team but that doesn’t guarantee anything. Kevin Durant made them a GUARANTEED winner. That’s a huge difference.   That 2017 series probably goes at least 6 games.  The series last year probably goes atleast 5 but you never really know because LeBron is ridiculous.  Also you have to consider the effect that KD would have had if he went to another contender. He possibly could have went to a team and made them capable of beating the Warriors.   Yes the Warriors were good before him but they were not UNSTOPPABLE. Without KD, I see them losing atleast 1 ring.  By signing KD, they also benefited from not having to play AGAINST KD"
"Bryce Harper: ""I know I'm going to be a free agent but don't ask me a single question about it I'm still under contract and work for the Nationals.""  Kevin Durant: Acts like a high schooler when visiting arenas, taking a campus tour like he's deciding where to accept a scholarship.  Who could imagine Draymond is rubbed the wrong way by a person who is more concerned about his upcoming free agency than this season."
"Even though Green is an original, you do not pass up the opportunity to not have a player like Kevin Durant. That's just ridiculous."
"🤦🏾‍♂️ You don’t understand basketball. KD changed the entire dynamic of how you have to game plan against the Warriors. Before he joined, if you shut down Steph, you had a much better chance of winning because Klay and Draymond aren’t consistent. KD eliminated their only weakness and added basically another Steph Curry type player. That’s fucking HUGE. KD is every bit as good as Steph. Not only that but it was KD who scorched the Cavs in 2017. If not for him, that series is much closer than it was. Hell LeBron almost stole one game from them last year with a WORSE Cavs team, but who stopped it? Kevin Fucking Durant. The 73-9 Warriors was only ONE year. Stop acting like that would have been them every year. They had flaws before KD and people were beginning to figure them out."
"""Ssssssssssss"" replied Kevin Durant."

I mean their beef definitely isn’t over. It’s the warriors plus Kevin Durant. He’s never really fit in there but signed to win. This drama has always and will always be there because he’s not a part of them 
Yeah me too. I just like how this all speculation. I not believing shit til Kevin Durant says this himself
KEVIN DURANT SLITHERIN IN!!
When Kevin Durant got a gender change operation in 2025 and became a cabaret dancer and youtube personality. 
"Well, Warriors overall system would be completely different if Stephen was completely off the team. As in, Kevin Durant and the team would do much better together if they played Stephless all year round and adjusted their play style accordingly. Regardless of who’s the better player, Steph is certainly the system."
"The only team that deserves more than two All-Stars would be Toronto. All other teams have a similar record and have played well to open the season. However, there’s still those players who have had stellar seasons with a poor record (Hardaway, LaVine, Booker), so I decided to award them.   P.S. I wish the NBA would expand the roster size smh    EAST G Kyle Lowry G Kyrie Irving F Kawhi Leonard F Giannis Antetokounmpo F Joel Embiid   Andre Drummond, Blake Griffin, Khris Middleton, Victor Oladipo,  Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic,  Kemba Walker  Next: Tim Hardaway Jr., John Wall, Jimmy Butler   WEST G Stephen Curry G Russell Westbrook F Kevin Durant  F LeBron James  F Anthony Davis  Mike Conley, DeMar DeRozan, Paul George, James Harden, Tobias Harris, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard,  Next: Devin Booker, Klay Thompson, Marc Gasol"
the NBA board of governors actually voted to approve the rule being applied to Durant. OKC protested it to no avail according to what i’ve seen:  https://newsok.com/article/3863784/okc-thunder-nba-reimburses-thunder-for-part-of-kevin-durants-contract-extension
It just goes to.show you how overrated Kevin Durant is.
"&gt; If you were to put LeBron on the Warriors instead of Steph, you'd have a completely different game plan being written out by Kerr. And if you put Steph on a team like the Nets, he's not going to succeed like this unless their game plan is drastically changed to suit his three point rushes.  ""Steph is only this good because the offense is built around him"" makes no sense, because every great player has the offense built around him. LeBron has had every single offense he's ever been on built around him, and yet we're only docking points from Steph because ""real NBA basketball isnt threes"" or something  All that matters: when they build a team around you, how good is that team? By that metric, It's LeBron, Steph, then everyone else  Yes, if Steph was on the nets, they would drastically change their offense. They would also win more games than if they built around Kevin Durant. All these other superstars have had teams built around them too, and none of them are as good as Steph's Warriors"
So Kevin Durant and four bench guys took them from down 3 to up 10 in like 5 minutes at the beginning of the second quarter?  And the starters on Portland couldn’t stop the bleeding.  Really nice graphic. I like seeing the flow of the game and who was on the court.  
"Kevin ""Kevin Durant"" Durant"
"He'll, Kevin fucking Durant shot like 28% his first season from 3"
Kevin Durant. 
Kevin Durant?
Kevin durant is the 3rd best player in the nba. Hell of a talent. 
Kevin Durant 
"Kevin Durant   ""Snake"""
"that's awesome and i hope you enjoy it! I wish i did a data science or analytics bootcamp early on in college or highschool when I had the time. im a huge fan of stats and probability (although most of my practical knowledge is from communication theory, signal processing, and a collection of random books rather than through mainly traditional/pure stats classes)   for things like free throw shooting I would agree with you; the difference between his career numbers and this year's sample size is huge, so it's easy to reason that he must be improving. that being said, there are arguments that the 750 number is STILL even too conservative.  i really cannot stress enough how huge this variance is; i would be shocked if derrick rose shot above 35% from 3 for the remainder of the season. and this sort of thing is not unprecedented. just last year, aaron gordon shot 44% from three on his first 116 attempts! the remaining 60 games, he shot 28% on more than 200 attempts.   keep in mind, i am most certainly NOT saying that derrick rose has definitely not improved. i'm just saying that it's much too early to come to any conclusions yet.   i encourage you to keep track of some of these posts (not just the positive ones like derrick rose, but also the players who are NOT shooting well to start the season like klay thompson and kevin durant) and to revisit them at the end of the year. i will be, too.   like I said, most of my stats experience comes from a different field so all I can do is to defer to the better statisticians like darryl blackport (of the nylon calculus article listed above). and if he says that 750 is the number where the signal to noise ratio becomes 1, then I can't in good conscience conclude that 71 attempts is enough to say that rose has improved (yet)"
"I'd like to see a team with Russell Westbrook, Dejounte Murray, Kevin Durant, Tristan Thompson, and Andre Drummond just to see what the rebounding would look like"
Behind Kevin Durant. 
"Yeah to me here would be the general run down of all the top candidates   And if I personally had to rank it: 1) Embiid 2) Giannis 3) Jrue Holiday 4) Gasol 55) Paul George   1) Marc Gasol   a) Per cleaning the glass opponents take shots at the rim with 6.6% lower freq when he's on the court than off. That on/off differential is 98th percentile   b) His actual stats [protecting the rim are pretty average](https://on.nba.com/2ReJo7j)  c) His man to man defense has been real good. [here is his matchup data](https://on.nba.com/2Rbcdl0) the following are some good offensive oriented bigs he's faced this year: DeAndre Ayton, KAT, Embiid, Brook Lopez, Jokic, LaMarcus Aldridge. Note only Ayton really had significant success vs him. He held ALL of KAT, Lopez, Embiid, Jokic, LMA to WELL below their normal average effectiveness. V impressive   d) Eye test wise I still don't think he's particularly great on the perimeter and someone you really want switching. THey scheme around his limitations on that end very very well in Memp   2) Giannis   a) Per Cleaning the Glass opponents actually shoot more at the rim when he's on the court. Team also defends worse in transition when he's on the court which is surprising   b) He doesn't contest shots at the rim a ton but so far when he has [hes been very effective at it](https://on.nba.com/2R8kkyt)  c) All kinds of versatility can guard any position. Matchup data shows he hasn't had to face the most challenging matchups but [nobody has given him problems](https://on.nba.com/2RaEXtZ). Amongst his harder matchups:   Aaron Gordon 26 poss 4 pts allowed 2/6 shooting. Ben Simmons 65 poss 9 pts 4/12 shooting allowed. Paul Millsap 75 poss 12 pts 4/13 shooting allowed. Gallinari: 43 poss 6 pts 2/7 shooting allowed. Tobias Harris 17 poss 0 pts 0/4 shooting allowed.   d) Eye test shows improved off ball recog and awareness in rotations   3) Joel Embiid   a) Double whammy: Statistically [has top stats protecting the rim](https://on.nba.com/2R8kkyt). And on top of that Cleaning the Glass shows opponents take shots at the rim with 7.8% less freq when he's on the court vs off(that differential is &gt;99th percentile). Super impressive   b) Matchup data [shows him having some issues defending Nikola Vucevic JV and Brook Lopez](https://on.nba.com/2ReLCnb). However his defense on Blake Griifn, Marc Gasol, Anthony Davis and Andre Drummond have all been good.   c) Eye test wise Im of the belief he's considerably better on switches than his reputation. He has issues being over aggressive on the perimeter at times for sure but he's improving here.   4) Paul George   a) No true 3 [contests more shots at the rim](https://on.nba.com/2R7RCOf). And while Steven Adams is a big part of this per cleaning the glass opponents shoot at the rim 7.6% less freq when he's on the court vs off a top figure. He also is 82nd percentile in terms of on/off differential in terms of how his team defends in transition with him on the court vs off.   b) Awesome off the ball defender really stood out all year eye test wise  c) Very versatile [anybody from Jrue Holdiay to Nikola Mirotic he can be a primary defender on](https://on.nba.com/2RfqRYw). Matchup data shows him absolutely destroying Jayson Tatum and Tobias Harris while doing a good job on Luka Doncic and James Harden. Only guys to give him some real issues were Tim Hardaway and Buddy Hield(Jrue Holiday to a lesser extent)   5) Jrue Holiday : I know a guard will never win DPOY but he's just been too impressive for me not to mention   a) Per Cleaning the Glass his on/off differential in terms of how the Pelicans defend in transition and off misses is top 10 percentile   b) No player has [more impressive matchup data](https://on.nba.com/2PPYqDG).   i) EVERY player he has spent at least 25 poss guarding this year scores at a rate below their average   ii) Only two guys to give him any kind of fits are Gary Harris and tim Hardaway   Note how many guys he's held to at least one of: a) &gt;10 pts below their expected pt total given the total no poss of poss b) &lt;35% shooting    DeMar DeRozan, Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, James Harden, Jimmy Butler, Caris LeVert, Jamal Murray, Paul George, Zach LaVine, Lou Williams, Tobias Harris, Russell Westbrook, Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, CJ McCollum   That's absolute insanity  "
There is no basketball situation whatsoever where you choose Marc Gasol over Kevin fucking Durant lol
"Had a long running theory that Kevin Durant has been hiding his sexuality and one of the reasons he was interested and signed with GSW (outside of basketball reasons, which the theory still holds as the #1 reason) was the comfort of living in a community who’s much more open to that life style such as the Bay Area and his college choice in Austin. "
"He's honestly one of the more misunderstood players Ive seen the past few yrs. And btw your statement is correct Im not talking about you here.   1) People say his size causes him to be an overrated defender. Uhhh no...…He actually is able to guard bigger players remarkably well This is an ex of what Im [talking about: Brad Stevens put him on Kevin god damn Durant in a game 2 yrs ago for 38 poss. Bradley held him to 6 shot attempts and 10 pts, again the 6'11 KD](https://stats.nba.com/game/0021600179/matchups/?OFF_PLAYER_ID=&amp;DEF_PLAYER_ID=202340). Same season look at his [defense vs Paul George who's real height is around 6'9: 42 poss 2/10 shooting](https://stats.nba.com/game/0021600440/matchups/?OFF_PLAYER_ID=&amp;DEF_PLAYER_ID=202340)   He guards Jimmy Butler a 6'7 wing about as well as anybody. Here per matchup data the past 3-4 yrs 324 poss vs Butler: Butler has been held to 49.9% TS and 20.4 pts/100 poss. For perspective the past 3-4 yrs Butler on average is at 30 pts/100 poss and 58% TS   2) So what is his issue?   a) Off the ball he's really not a great help defender. He's too focused on his own man he doestn understand help defense and rotations in the context of NBA defense at a 5 man unit level well overall. He has bad habits like gambling or biting on pump fakes too hard.   b) This was a great article [from 2 yrs ago regarding Bradley](https://www.celticsblog.com/2016/12/19/13994518/state-of-the-boston-celtics-is-avery-bradley-an-elite-defender). Note specifically the idea that ever since his shoulder surgery his hesitancy to fight htrough screens in pick and roll.   Again what matter is how good you are defending in the context of NBA defense. Moving your feet fast and being great in ISO defense looks super cool but that's not what most poss in the NBA are. Most poss require you to fight through screens, get over the top of them etc. This is what he struggles with. It does you no good to prevent a guy from driving to the rim if you cant get over a screen and let him pull up for 3.   c) Despite shooting a good % from 3 he's not a helpful offensive player. Doesn't understand his role. Tries to create too much and takes too many stupid long 2s.   "
was it Kevin Durant?
"Kevin ""Voldemort"" Durant about to make that one of his horcruxes"
"“Don’t mention it KD*”  Suddenly, the kid rips his skin open to reveal 7 foot tall Kevin Durant. Kevin quickly slithers away, proud of himself as he has stolen another one of Westbrook’s treasured items"
"The logic is that if you started him, your bench would be very weak and the starting lineup already had elite scorers in Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. "

Kevin Durant
Lebron step back  Harden euro  Kyrie’s throwing the ball into the crowd  Giannis’s euro dunk  Kevin Durant hissing  Curry fuck the sky 3  LeFuckYou3  Fultz free throws   
Being an exception is a way to the true greatness. Or you can be Kevin Durant. 
Nope! Kevin Durant is a malicious human being that wants to be loved so badly that he'll hurt anyone to make it happen don't @ me       /s if the flair makes anyone think I'm serious
"He has plenty of ""asshole-ish"" attitudes, still. Or, at least, not nice. That doesn't eliminate the fact that he's probably a nice enough guy overall.  &amp;#x200B;  Same is true - as much as it may pain some redditors to admit it - of Kevin Durant."
I think we love Westbrook in part just because of how much we hate Kevin Durant 
Well Kevin Durant made a three last game and the game before that. Kevin Durant is also not a rookie and is shooting above .500 FG%. Durant has never been billed an amazing shooter the same way Trae Young was coming out of college.
"Kevin Durant hasn't made a three in ages , he can't handle nba defenses ?   Stop with the small sample sizes "
"Here's a fun fact: Since Stepg Curry's injury, Warriors are 2-5. In that same time, Cavaliers are 1-4. So, in this time with Kevin Durant as a leader, they are literally outpacing the worst team in the league by 1 win.   Yeahhhhhh, I'm gonna continue to question his leadership ability. Which is actually generous, because most have [logically] completely written him off. "
"&gt;I was told Ingram would be a perennial MVP candidate, a KD 2.0, if you will.  Everybody always says this when no one compares him to KD anymore. That was a HS/draft thing thats seeped into his NBA career even tho its very obvious to everyone involved he is not Kevin Durant.  Some similarities in length/style but other than that everybody says this is a shit comparison every time it gets brought up"
"&gt; CP3's efficiency numbers suggest that if he shot at a comparable volume his scoring would be very close to Curry's.  This might be the most stupid thing I've ever seen. Curry's best scoring season is 31.5ppg on 67% TS per 36. CPs best scoring season is 21.8 ppg on 59% TS per 36. Yet you firmly believe that if CP magically upped his shots he would gain 10 ppg and an additional 7% TS????  &gt; For a PG, offense emphasizes assists and scoring.  Correction, offense emphasises scoring and **facilitating**. And http://i.imgur.com/fFYglOd.png that is as conclusive as it gets. If you're a good facilitator your teammates get easy looks and make buckets. You have a high BPM, and Curry's BPM in his peak years are higher than CPs.  &gt;For a PG, defence emphasises steals and your ability to guard the perimeter.  Yeah no arguments there. CP is the better defender.  &gt; This is reflected by the fact that the career advanced metrics favor CP3.  If you're going to mention career metrics again I'm not going to respond. Because that would be the 5th time reminding you this is a prime for prime argument.  &gt; Trying to limit the comparison to Curry's 4 best seasons doesn't change the results. If you take CP3's 4 best seasons, the same pattern would emerge.  The issue with taking their best 4 seasons is that Curry's, being on the same team as Kevin Durant, his advanced metrics, particularly his WS/48 severely diluted. This makes sense adding another all time great player. What happens when we take Curry's best seasons sans Durant is that Curry's numbers are superior by advanced metrics. This is easily reflected in the eye test, Curry has been even better in 2017-18 than in 2014-15, yet his WS/48 is markedly lower. His PER and BPM haven't changed as much though, and that makes sense too.   In the given prime seasons we have of Curry without Durant, Curry's advanced metrics &gt; CP3.  &gt; If you factor in Curry's worst vs. CP3's worst, the distinction becomes even greater, as CP3's ""floor"" is much higher than Curry's.  Hardly a surprising statement given Curry is one of the biggest transformations in league history.  &gt; Literally, the only thing Curry does better than CP3 is shoot the 3P shot.  Wrong. He shoots better from midrange, and finishes better at the rim. if we look at prime years, it's not close.   &gt; better rebounder  That's again demonstrably false. Per 36 they have the same fucking rebounding numbers: 4.6"
"lol. Kd is playing with a guy who can go off for 60, has already gone off for 50, and has gone off for 40 and 35 in two elimination playoff games. If the Lakers get Klay in the summer, they are immediately considered contenders just this rag tag team of memes with Lebron. Kevin Durant can't even win some regular season games with Klay.  &gt;LeBron made the Finals with good benches and two other all-stars.   He's made the finals without two other all-stars and bad benches. He just did it last year."
"I think regret might be too strong, but there are articles that refernece KD calling his agent and asking him ""how could you let me do this to my life"" or something like that   [peep this](http://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-rich-kleiman-agent-stephen-curry-team-usa/wexc7webicqb156w10nt97e1y)"
Hypothetically Kevin Durant might love Denver and sign there next year. That team would instantly become contenders. 
"Absolutely. Durant is the [2nd youngest to reach 20,000 points] (https://www.si.com/nba/2018/01/10/kevin-durant-20000-career-points-warriors). Barring injury or early retirement, he'll be well into the 30,000s by retirement at his current pace."
Ingram isn’t the second coming of Kevin Durant 
Draymond Green seems right in his assessment of Kevin Durant
so what? would you rather the golden state offense run through boogie or kevin durant/steph curry?
"People really act like Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Shaun Livingston, and Andre Iguodala can take on superstars like Luka Doncic and Harrison Barnes."
I'm pretty sure Kevin Durant can't win with those KATs

Kevin Durant
"&gt;Historically amazing team that added a top 2 player in the league to their team vs LeBron and Old Friends.    This is an understatement. Golden State had just won 73 games, was compared to that historic Bulls team. They had a 2 time MVP in Curry, and 2 other All stars. One of those All stars is Klay Thompson, probably the second greatest shooter ever after Curry, also the best 3 and D player in the league. The other all star is Draymond, excellent secondary playmaker and DPOY player.    &gt;&gt;&gt;   Kevin Durant, the 2nd best player in the league was up 3-1 against that team with OKC, and he lost. Then he joined them instead the next season, and formed a super team with 4 all stars, 2 former MVPs.   &gt;&gt;&gt;    Then finally Durant won a series against LeBron and 1-2 regular season games  &gt;&gt;&gt;    **But LeBron is still 14-5 against Durant in head to head matchups throughout their career**. So that's that.   &gt;&gt;&gt;   OP should have known that, or he actually knows but he's either one of those super bias and delusional GSW fan or a hardcore delusional Bron hater. Another example of how r/nba is mostly filled with dumb kids.    It's fucking hilarious"
"Sure, I'll sign up to get roasted in five years. Who knows what teams these guys will all be on, though, so I'll skip the conference alignments.  Steph Curry, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons, Dennis Smith Jr., Jamal Murray, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Luka Doncic.

"LMAO this post is so damn trash and hilarious  &gt;&gt;&gt;   Durant finally won 2 regular season games and a series against LeBron after joining the best team in the league who already had 3 other all stars and had won 73 games the previous season.   &gt;&gt;&gt;    But throughout their whole career, **LeBron James is still 14-5 against Kevin Durant in head to head matchups**  &gt;&gt;&gt;    If you want to troll kid, atleast be smart about it.

no reason to stay in Charlotte other than being the face of the organization.   Kemba Walker isn't Kevin Durant. He isn't going to have half the league looking to schedule a meeting for him and offer him a max. He's closer to Joe Johnson. He'll be 29 and i doubt he gets max offers from more than a couple teams. I can definitely see him leaving Charlotte but to say he has no reason to stay in Charlotte is slly
"Seems so pedantic, but there is a difference between ""better"" and ""more valuable"" in this context, and Warriors fans have discussed it ad nauseum. I'm going to preface what's to come by saying that it is my opinion, based on watching 90% of games since Steph's first game in the league:  ""Kevin Durant is the better overall basketball player, but Stephen Curry is the more valuable basketball player to this Warriors team."" It is a narrative that Warriors fans have created to help cope with Curry sharing the crown, and alas, I am leaning slightly towards agreeing with it, thus far. Kevin missed 19 games last season with an MCL strain, and Steph has missed 12 games so far this season with an ankle injury. In these games, and these games alone, I saw the Warriors playing better basketball while Durant was out, *once they adjusted.*  The difference wasn't much, but from what I saw, the Warriors' defensive strength in Steph's absence was not worth the overall offensive stagnation w/ Durant. Then again, I believe in matchups dictating all of this, that teams don't play the same competition over and over again, and therefore while Curry might be most important against one team, Durant is the better asset against another.   Then, we can argue the value of offense vs the value of defense, the positions/roles they play correlating directly to how well those around them perform, etc. It's an intriguing argument either way, and a fun one to have as a spoiled Warriors fan."
"Come on, son. If you’re gonna post a locked article at least include the major points or just copy the entire article. Then again, you wonder how many people actually read this stuff.   *edit: lol, based on the comments here so far it’s clearly people just reacting to the title. Leroux is basically laying out how difficult it would be.   ——  Anthony Davis is under contract with the New Orleans Pelicans and his current deal runs through 2019-20 with a player option worth $28.8 million for the 2020-21 season. As such, if the Warriors were to actually pursue him, there are three basic paths they could use to acquire him in the next few years:  **Free agency**  The current expectation is that unless the talented big man signs an extension (he will likely qualify for a Designated Veteran one between now and then, which could be its own piece), Davis will opt out and become an unrestricted free agent in July 2020. Realistically, any team looking to bring him aboard would need to be able to offer Davis his maximum.  RealGM’s salary cap resource is using a $113.4 million estimate for that season's cap figure, meaning a 30 percent maximum contract would start at $34,020,000 (maximum total salary for a new team: four years, $146.3 million). Stephen Curry is the only Warrior under contract for 2020-21 at this point, but his $43 million salary makes a pretty significant dent.  To sign Davis as a free agent, the Warriors could only have another $36.4 million in committed salary and holds for the entire rest of the roster, presumably including Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and/or Draymond Green. That looks incredibly unlikely and the unrestricted free agency door may be closed as soon as this summer if Durant re-signs on a long-term deal.  **Sign-and-trade**  One way around clearing cap space is acquiring Davis via a sign-and-trade. That would require the Pelicans being on board, but the Warriors would presumably have significant talent to send back, potentially including one or more of their current All-Stars.  A Davis sign-and-trade would have three big challenges. The first is that the Pelicans would have to agree to any deal. They would wield significant leverage since the previously detailed path to signing Davis with cap space is so difficult. It seems likely the Warriors would have some serious talent that could be included, but remember that both Green and Thompson will be in their 30s in 2020 and New Orleans would presumably be looking to rebuild rather than reload. A three-way trade could reroute quality players to a franchise with more immediate aspirations, but that gets even more complicated.  The second and, in some circumstances, most significant difficulty is that a sign-and-trade would subject the team to the hard cap for that season, meaning they could not go over the “apron” (about $6 million above the luxury tax) for any reason, including unlikely bonuses. The Warriors dealt with this back in 2013-14 when they brought in Andre Iguodala, but that was a much less expensive team. A tentative line there would be about $143 million in total salary for that entire league year without exception. That is certainly more workable than clearing space to sign Davis as a free agent but still challenging.  Finally, under current trade rules, the Warriors would have to send at least $27.2 million if Davis starts at his projected maximum, whether the Pelicans want that kind of money or not. Again, some of that salary could end up with a third team, but they already have Jrue Holiday on the books for $26.1 million that season and could be locking up DeMarcus Cousins for a significant sum as well.  **Trade**  Unlike the first two options, a straight trade does not require waiting until Davis becomes a free agent. The Warriors and Pelicans simply have to agree to terms during any one of the trading windows, as soon as right now or as late as July 2020  should Davis opt-in to streamline a trade like Chris Paul did last offseason.  From the Warriors' perspective, this would be the cleanest way to bring Davis on board since they would not be subject to the hard cap and would possess full Bird rights at the end of Davis’ contract, adding flexibility they have not had with Durant, though that limitation likely fueled Durant’s pay cut this season.  A trade would require at least $20 million in salary going back to New Orleans, but any combination of Warriors players good enough to be worth Davis carries that price tag anyway. I will not speculate on what would be necessary to bring over the currently 24-year-old All-NBA player, but the price tag is astronomical and will stay that way if he can remain remotely healthy.  It's even be possible that the two sides could not come to an agreement because presumably at least Curry and probably Durant would be off the table, and some front offices would not be willing to deal a young franchise cornerstone for a package without a partner’s top asset out of pride or fear of a fanbase revolt. Furthermore, upcoming free agency for Thompson and Green complicates deals because either New Orleans, or a third party if the Pelicans wanted to reroute some of what they receive, may not expect them to re-sign, thus limiting their trade value.  The lack of salary flexibility makes bringing in Anthony Davis substantially less likely than their pursuit of Kevin Durant a year-and-a-half ago. That said, the NBA has been and will be a superstar-driven league with big names taking their talents elsewhere so there is absolutely a chance, especially if the Pelicans are interested in what the Warriors can offer."
"I remember a funny side by side of two tweets from the same day: Kevin Durant (MVP, all-star, NBA champ) mentioning his completed workout and Hasheem Thabeet (former no.2 overall who kept getting sent to the G-league &amp; now plays overseas) proclaiming he just woke up from a nap.   Which Tweet does Bennett himself identify with more? "

"Huh? Golden State had:  \- Steph Curry   \- Kevin Durant   \- All-NBA calibre guard Klay Thompson   \- DPOY Draymond Green, who also happens to perhaps the best big man playmaker in the NBA   Cleveland was obviously outmatched. Golden State is and was miles better.  Curry vs. Kyrie is also not a conversation. As great as Kyrie is, Steph is on another level."
Well no one in the nba is 8 feet ;) And the only 7 footer with guard skills is Kevin durant. 
Easily Kevin Durant 
"&gt;“They’re very tough,” Warriors forward Kevin Durant said. “I really like this team. I really like their coach. They have a good home crowd, and I think the difference between them this year and last year is obviously everyone is going to say C.P. [Paul]. But they’re just playing harder.”  KD to rockets confirmed?"
"Ever since Harden went to the Rockets, they lost to a Thunder team with Kevin Durant, a 54 win Portland team, Golden State twice, and the Spurs. Harden was in good company, now has the best team he's ever had, and he's playing better than ever even though he's been in the running for MVP."
Another time he sought to restore competitive balance in the NBA by going after Kevin Durant in the locker room.
"Because he said  &gt;they added Kevin fucking Durant with three years of growth and experience across the board.  *I'm disputing that point...* surprisingly, I am able to read."

"&gt;lmao so you get a pass for making super teams if you win a ring first?   &gt;&gt;&gt;  It's not about getting a pass, LeBron is not 25 anymore, he's 33 and in his 15th season, dude already has accomplished everything, and still the best player in the world. He doesn't give a shit about *people's* pass lol kids in r/nba is a very small bubble to someone like him, it's nothing. He is also on his way to become a legit billionaire before he turns 35. He has done it all.   &gt;&gt;&gt;   **FYI**, Cleveland never made the finals since Bron left, and Bron came back, promised them a title, and actually delivered them the first title in Cleveland sports history, also did that by beating the best team in the league, coming back from 3-1 that nobody in NBA Finals ever did before.   He's basically Jesus Christ now to the people   &gt;&gt;&gt;   Then what does the 2 time so called MVP Curry and the Warriors do? They don't want a rematch against Bron and healthy Cavs, they say fuck it, best team in the league and 3 all stars ain't enough, let us go cry for help to Kevin Durant and form a superteam.    &gt;&gt;&gt;   Moment they did that, moment KD decided also to say yes to them and join, that's the moment they gave LeBron all the freedom to do anything he wants, he can make the super team of all super teams next year and nobody would blame him, why? He's just trying to beat the Warriors, and most people hate the Warriors now anyways, i can guarantee you that majority people will cheer for Bron to take this GSW Superteam down..     &gt;&gt;&gt;   Actually to be honest, GSW and Durant did LeBron a huge favor. You will see, soon. "
"&gt; What is Kevin Durant accomplishing by complaining in this instance?  By doing this, the ref might not make the same call next time."
"I'm of this opinion as well. I wouldn't fault LeBron with choosing whatever means necessary to beat the Warriors and KD. The Warriors basically took care of their two biggest threats by signing KD; the Thunder and the Cavs. And Kevin Durant took care of his too biggest threats, the Warriors and LeBron James. "
Remove: Kevin Durant so the NBA playoffs would actually be entertaining for more than 1 team in the league 
Referees can't just decide to call games perfectly.  Players can stop bitching so much. Complaining does literally nothing but make everyone mad and raise tensions. What is Kevin Durant accomplishing by complaining in this instance? Regardless of the whether or not the actual play was a foul. He can't go back in time and make the correct call. This isn't a situation where there's a chronic issue like maybe a guy getting to strong of a push on a certain move or something. There's no constructive conversation to be had. It's just needless whining.
"My team:  PG: Steph Curry  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Alonzo Mourning  Reserved: Kyle Lowry, Zach Randolph, Andrew Bynum.   The team has mega spacing, decent perimeter defense, good rim protection (2x DPOY coming in hot). The bigs are strong enough to not be completely wiped out by teams with Shaq, and the wings can run slower defenders out of the floor.. "

Kevin Durant and James Harden
"I attempted to build a team that prioritized defense and length while not being a liability on the offensive end. The Warriors ended up being heavily borrowed from in this team. I had a really tough time deciding between Gary Payton and John Stockton because Stockton was the better passer and shooter while also a serviceable defender while Payton was worse as a shooter and distributor but was one of the greatest if not the greatest defensive PGs of all time. I decided to go with Payton because of his 6'4"" frame and his 7' wingspan (when I looked that up my jaw dropped. That wingspan is insane).   Point Guard: (6'4"") Gary Payton (900)  Shooting Guard: (6'8"") Jimmy Butler (700)  Small Forward: (7'0"") Kevin Durant (1100)  Power Forward: (7'3"") Kristaps Porzingis (700)  Center: ~~(7'1"")~~ (6'11"") ~~Marc Gasol~~ Bill Walton (700)  Bench 1: (6'8"") Grant Hill (800)  Bench 2: (6'7"") Klay Thompson (700)  Bench 3: (6'7"") Draymond Green (800)   Grant Hill played a Point Forward position similar to Lebron in his prime so I figured he could handle the bench unit even though my team does not have a designated backup pg.    The starting lineup has 3 7-footers so I figured they could handle a team going big and KD, Draymond, and Porzingis make for great versatile centers/forwards if the other team decides to go small.   Thoughts?  Edit: saw Bill Walton was the same price as Marc Gasol so I switched them    Edit 2: my dad built a team:   PG: Steve Nash (1000)  SG: Pete Maravich (800) a lot of scoring and passing for that price  SF: George Gervin (800)  PF: Amare Stoudemire (700)  C: Bill Walton (700)  B1: Isiah Thomas (900)  B2: Artis Gilmore (800)  B3: Klay Thompson (700)   No idea why he put Klay on this team but you can see he mostly watched basketball before I was born plus the 7SOL Suns."
"I think it's more that, you guys have luckily not gotten *that* much better with Durant because it's pretty rare that we see Klay, Durant, Curry and Green all playing well on the same nights. Like, you're better, but you're not Kevin Durant better to most teams.  But that doesn't change the fact that KD intended for your team to just be unstoppable when he joined, or the fact that he had just lost to you guys before joining you, in heartbreaking fashion, nonetheless.  I'm honestly just hoping for a healthy series between the 2 because I think we've yet to get that between GS and the second best team that year, other than Cleveland."
hey it's me kevin durant ill give you shoes if you defend me on here 
Kevin Durant is not the MVP. Good lord.

"Except teams never usually try to take advantage of Paul because he’s a amazing defender, he gives Kevin Durant trouble and he’s a whole FOOT taller. And curry isn’t just a mismatch on taller defenders, the cabs won a title by literally having kyrie iso curry and curry is taller then him"
He had zero intention of making that shot before the buzzer. Very frustrating to see old habits die hard https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-durant-sometimes-doesn-t-want-chuck-low-220357263--nba.html?y20=1

"I get that people on here hate Kevin Durant and that's understandable to a certain degree. But in many cases that leads to some completely irrational takes on here.  I've read numerous times that KD can't carry a team as the best player and that he has to ride the coattails of Curry to be successful and stuff like that. It's like his times in OKC never happened.  Another one is that Curry can only shoot threes.  And that he is somehow not as great because he wouldn't be as good if you took away his three point shot. No shit, a player would be worse if you hypothetically took away his biggest strength lol  Also, I find it ridiculous that people on here, especially Celtics fans, act like it was always obvious that Kyrie is a better player than IT while I'm 100% sure they would've furiously argued against that just a year ago."
I don’t think anybody in the history of earf has criticized the warriors organizationally for getting Kevin Durant lol wtf
why is kevin durant on their logo?
"Bro what are you talking about. This was a good team with numerous win streaks that also broke other teams win streaks that year.   Caron Butler was coming back.   We defeated Brandon Roy, kevin Durant, james harden, Russell Westbrook, Kobe Bryant, pau gasol, Phil Jackson, lebron james, Dwayne wade, and chris bosh.   We beat the heat three games in a row.   And to top it off, okc lost 4-1 Against the heat the next year.   And you're gonna sit here and talk about how there's no way we would have beat okc?   This was an elite team with fabulous chemistry, defense, and perfect role players around Dirk.   Twopeat team for sure. With a chance at a Threepeat.   What do you mean lightning in a bottle? You don't beat 7 nba greats with lightning in a bottle. You don't slaughter and sweep an nba great and nba coaching great with lightning in a bottle. You don't beat three future MVP players with lightning in a bottle. You don't beat perhaps the greatest nba player of all time three games in a row wit lightning in a bottle. You don't discount that you have one of the top scorers in nba history as lightning in a bottle.   I'm with you bro because your a mavs fan. But please realize the greatness of what dirk nowitzki accomplished. It was not luck. Do you realize that out of 14 years, dallas was the only other team outside of la and San Antonio to reach the finals in the western conference?   What's pitiful is that espn creates this narative in our head that it was about how the Miami heat let the series get away, instead of it being about how the Mavericks took it by sheet force. Which in my opinion is why there are too many who believe that this was a finals win out of luck.   Nonsense.   Excuse me please for the long tirade. I feel a general frustration towards when I feel Dirk and this accomplishment of that team does not get enough respect.  And I have a good intentions in trying to inform a fellow fan that the narrative out there that the media and other teams try to brainwash us into that the year was luck - is total, completely, utter, unequivocal, BULLSHIT.   Thank you.   "

"&gt;That 73 win team was great but they still weren't built to sweep the greatest teams in the playoffs  i understand your perspective here, but i mean winning 73 games in the regular season, to me, really means they were. and i watched almost every game that season and it wasn't even close.  &gt;Let's not forget it took the greatest three point night in shooting history for them to not have swept a team that 12-1'd the eastern conference  yup yup, i wanted to mention that previously!  &gt;the finals will finally have somebody not named Golden State or Cleveland  yeah, i think i would actually rather see a rematch. like, did you watch any of the finals in the 2000? teams would just get swept and it wasnt fun. like jason kidd and kerry kittles, whoever the mavs beat in the finals, like what the fuck dude. at least, you can make up narratives with cleveland and warriors to keep it fun.

kevin durant hasn’t even averaged a triple double once🤔🤔

What about that Kevin Durant fellow? He's pretty lovable I'd say. 
"Its ok. Kevin Durant can step in as a tutor. ""Python-gorean Theorem""...am I right? Ill show myself out."
"You really should rethink your loss of respect for Kevin Durant...he gave OKC 9 years, he was a free agent, he turned down more lucrative offers from other good teams, and he came to a team where he could improve his game, while knowing his stats were almost sure to decline in several categories, but he liked the team first concept, and he has improved his defensive skills tremendously through hard work. Off the court, he continues to be extremely generous in terms of charitable donations, and lastly, he has become involved in the tech industry, investing in startups. "

He's only 28 so he'll be fine baring a catastrophic injury  Vince Carter is extremely unlikely to get 422 AST. Durant is most likely to finish last among the guys listed (ignoring Vince), even if everything goes well."
OKC's offensive ratings with Durant:   2010-11: 5th  2011-12: 2nd  2012-13: 1st   2013-14: 6th  2014-15 (Durant only played 27 games): 10th  2015-16: 2nd  What are you on about? OKC has always had an elite offense with Kevin Durant
It’s the ‘Join or Die’ snake.  Either that or they’re threatening Kevin Durant with bodily harm
Kevin Durant
Fuck Kevin Durant.  Fuck Iggy  Fuck Mob Deep  Fuck Biggie  Fuck Badboy as a staff record label and as a motherfucking crew. 
"yes if only Kevin Durant have any accomplishments before he joint us to demonstrate how he performs under pressure, like MVPs or scoring champions or final appearances with the team on his back or something"
"I don't think Draymond Green is as hungry to pad his stats anymore. 2-4 years ago he was all about it. Personally, I think Steve Kerr is underutilizing Green and Klay Thompson. Neither one of them have improved since Kevin Durant has joined the team. Kyrie Irving left the Cavs so that he could grow as a player. I think Klay or Green are at risk of doing the same... specifically Klay. If he was on any other team in the NBA, he would be more than just a catch and shoot player on offense."

20 + 15 = 35  Kevin Durant = 35  Replace “rebounds” with “rings”  WB hate KD confirmed
"I mean he's kind of right on paper in that you don't have that offensive star who can go super saiyan and carry you against all odds (Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant/Steph Curry, Damian Lillard). Those types of performances are central to the playoffs and all respect to Mitchell but I'm not willing to give him that yet.   Nonetheless I want absolutely no part of the Jazz."
"Everyone's just jealous because Russell Westbrook is the best player in the game, period. Wrecked shop all over the Warriors, the Rockets, and the Spurs. You can all talk about your jedi mind trick spreedsheets you want, the only real advanced stat is Russell's triple dubs and winning. He's the most ""advanced"" player of all of them. Funny how Kevin Durant is a nobody now that he whined his way out of OKC."
"In MVP shares, James Harden is #30 all time, #6 of active players (behind LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Dirk Nowitzki, and Chris Paul).  Other fun MVP share facts: Jerry West (2.021) has the most MVP shares without an MVP award, and George McGinnis (0.509) has the fewest MVP shares with an MVP award. It looks best in fullscreen.  Update: [I made a graph](https://infogram.com/nba-stats-1hdw2jgmwo3d2l0) of MVP shares vs. MVP awards. "
"&gt; In every year since 2012, one advanced metric has correctly predicted the NBA’s MVP. The player who finished first in Value Over Replacement Player each of the past six years, from Kevin Durant to James to Steph Curry to Russell Westbrook, has also gone on to win the MVP.  Yeah who even cares about history before then. In fact let's retroactively take away Iverson's 2000-2001 MVP and give it to VORP leader Steve Francis."
"&gt; Have you, uh, watched the warriors recently?  have you watched the nba recently? the warriors don't give a shit about these games. they're totally meaningless. do you think they're dropping these games because they're that bad or they're waiting for the playoffs because they've been to the finals 3 years in a row and have no care about the stretch run of the regular season when their seed is secured?   who is going to slow down kevin durant? who is going to slow down klay?  and name me the last team that won a playoff series with a rookie leading their scoring. "
Of course you'll see it.  Your team won a championship and then added Kevin Durant.  We celebrate any chance to see someone new in the finals and if you can't get why you need to work harder at understanding other people's perspective because it isn't hard to understand.
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there.  Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared.  It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy.""  My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."
"If I was that player I would say go sign Kevin Durant then, because they can’t. Like 2 maybe 3 teams had a shot at him. "
"They did it for a limited time and the NBAPA was not happy about that either. The Players Association is about getting players their money. If one of the greatest players in the league takes less for the benefit of re-signing players on the team or free agents, other teams/owners/GMs can use that as ammo. ""Kevin Durant took a paycut. Do you think you're more valuable than Kevin Durant?"" It doesn't help the union further their cause."
"Kevin ""red velvet cupcake"" durant"
Kevin Durant at center court.
If we lose in the first round Kevin Durant will be memed out of existence 
I find this impressive - BUT. Is he working as hard as Kevin Durant and making it to the gym every morning by 8:30?
"&gt; TO% has alot to do with system and risk reward. IMO, TO% should be left out of the scoring equation. KD could easily drop his turnovers but they are running a motion system that means a ton of passes, much more than the triangle Jordan ran.  This is absolutely, absolutely, absolutely false. 100% incorrect.  Passes and to% are not nearly as correlative as ball dominance/fga and to%. So in technicality, KD should have severely less to% than MJ, but.... he doesn't. Kevin Durant is actually incredibly turnover prone compared to MJ.   Leaving out how many possessions a high volume player turns over is absolutely flawed method of looking at efficiency. It's like purposely leaving out context.   &gt; KD is just in his ultimate prime. He still has 4-6 years left of high level play.  I do not think it's realistic that he passes MJ.  &gt; Just look at the last 5 years. KD is averaging 64% TS which absolutely destroys Jordan's best 5 years which averaged about 59% TS.  Once again, give me the scoring volume per possession as well as to% in those five years. Because I can guarantee you, MJ still has a whopping lead.   &gt; Who cares if MJ was stronger, quicker, and better in the post. Post offense means nothing and is inefficient. Who cares if he's stronger. KD's standing reach is 10 inches higher than Jordan.  ........... Because the ability to get to the paint consistently allows more passing opportunities? Are you high?   My god.  "
Durant can stop AD more than other teams can. This also comes at the price of who is actually going to stop Durant? Durant is the unstoppable and to add to that he has Klay and Steph on his side. Pelicans are playing well but they just don't have nearly the talent even with the unstoppable AD they will get run out of town quickly. Durant and Steph are the best players in the league and it's often forgotten because they both play together and it goes against them in the MVP race. The regular season doesn't matter anymore to them and it shouldn't after getting humiliated and losing after 73 wins. They know where the importance of the season is now and people just want to make a bigger deal out of other teams. Let me put it to you this way. Kevin Durant is the best player in the fucking world whether LeBron fans want to admit it or not. Durant can go out for 50 fucking points if he wants to but it's not about that because he doesn't have to carry the team right now but if he did he fucking would. So get on your knees and take some of that hot Durant foam.
"Name one person in the playoffs that can stop Kevin Durant?.....or Curry?...or Klay?  Fully healthy Warriors have not threat really except the Rockets, the 6 other teams are basically in a lesser tier and are interchangeable for this 4-0 beatdown they're gonna receive against Houston or Golden State."
"It's a joke to consider Pierce as LeBron's rival, he was badly outplayed by him in the vast majority of their matchups. The only player that has been able to go blow for blow with LeBron head to head for a sustained period of time has been Durant.   Since 2011 when Durant became a superstar, H2H PO &amp; RS       |Player|G|W-L|MPG|PPG|REB|AST|TOV|TS%|ORTG|DRTG|NET RTG| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Kevin Durant|24|11-13|39.47|31.2|7.1|4.5|3.2|64.7|123.15|109.79|+13.36| |LeBron James|24|13-11|40.36|29.6|9.0|7.3|4.5|59.1|115.23|109.08|+6.15|    "
"I mean, it's not like anyone can just plant and water a Kevin Durant and have him ready for next season.   If they could get better, they would."
"He's got a whole 8% to sacrifice. I think he can do it easily. He's already a better shooter than MJ and has 6 inches on him, so creating easy, high-percentage shots is physically easier for KD.   I don't see teams *figuring out* how to guard Kevin Durant. I do admit, his team won't necessarily benefit from him going out there trying to drop 37 every night, but there's not a lot of reason to doubt that he could do it at 56%TS like MJ (he did 32ppg at 63.5%TS)"
"Remember when Peyton Manning said that thing about Kevin Durant? Man, that was great, right?"
"I get what you are saying, winning changes the peoples perceptions and overlooks flaws, and yes Kyrie he would be thought of in that manner, but he also would be thought of as a scoring machine at the same age Brandon Ingram is now. No one  would ever say he didn't have a dog in him, which is what this whole thread is about, it would be he can't stay healthy. What is Brandon Ingram's perception now? Everything is still based on what he could potentially be, or what he could look like with this around him. Even when Kevin Durant was on losing Supersonic/Thunder teams, you knew he was going to be an elite scorer regardless of his team winning or losing. "
Win the title so they can sign Kevin Durant
"Who is better teammate? Draymond Green, Stephen Curry, Klay Thomson or Kevin Durant?"
"he's had a unique position among players in the nba since he entered the league. the most telling stat is his shoe line. [this](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2017/09/22/what-most-popular-shoes-worn-young-nba-players/687428001/) article from beginning of 17-18 season goes into a little detail on that:  Top named or sponsored shoes worn by NBA players  Kobe Bryant 58;   Michael Jordan 50;   LeBron James 32;   Kyrie Irving 29;   Kevin Durant 25;   Paul George 20;   Damian Lillard 16,   Derrick Rose 14,   Stephen Curry 6,   Dwyane Wade 6.  if superstar is purely talent based and there is a limited number of spots, he probably isn't one. but his uncle drew stuff and flashy handles have made him one of the more recognized and marketable players. he's also pretthy good"
"Not necessarily basing it on stats, but KD is literally just a scoring machine. The way his body is built, the way he can just pull a jump shot in anybody's face at any time. I don't think the NBA has seen anything like Kevin Durant. He is lethal and the only thing that can stop him is if he misses the shot. You can't really defend Kevin Durant, you can just try to affect his shot, but he is going to get the shot off if he wants the shot. And he is capable of shooting it from anywhere."
"“Going hard” is not the defining factor of who is a better player. Russ Westbrook probably goes full throttle more than Kevin Durant night in and night out, but Durant is simply more skilled and more talented. "
"I'm a huge AD dickrider but he's nowhere close to Kevin Durant the second best player in the NBA. They don't even play the same positions and roles so I have no idea how you can compare them... Klay and Draymond in the playoffs significantly better than their Pelican counterparts, they're all stars, all NBA and the DPOY AND they're playing on fire right now. Golden State bench has stepped up too with Andre Igoudala, Javale and our Gatorade Leaguers playing really hard down the stretch.   I also hate saying this because its a meme, but Golden State is not in its final form yet even without Curry "
"&gt; shit on Paul George for not picking the team that you think gives him the best shot to win.  Lol, how am I shitting on Paul George? If he goes to the Lakers, he's definitely not going to the best place to give him a shot to win. That's for sure.  &gt;You lambaste Kevin Durant for going to the team that gives him the best shot to win  I think this has been discussed ad nauseam on this thread, and if you can't figure out why people blasted KD's decision, then you shouldn't be so naive.   &gt;The hypocrisy is astounding.  Once again, I never blasted PG, so this point is moot.  "
"Asked my sister for her top 10, could only name 6:   Steph curry Kevin Durant Lebron James Blake shelton Tristan Thompson Kareem"
Kevin Durant is the greatest scorer of all time.
Made my girlfriend do it.  1. LeBron.  2. Steph Curry.  3. Gasol (no first name) 4. Dwyane Wade.  5. Kevin bosh.    6. Dwight Howard.     That's it. Just realized she's from Florida so that's why she named heat players. we're in the bay area now so that's probably why she was able to name currem Durant  
"To quote one of my roommates, ""I don't know a lot about baseball, but I do know that Kevin Durant is a bitch.""  Everyone in the room made picks for who would win he Finals at the start of the year, he wrote down, ""everybody wins""  God I love that kid 😂"
steph had one of the most efficient seasons of all time without Kevin Durant so
"Just asked my girlfriend who doesnt watch either, from Miami 1. D Wade 2. lebron 3. Blake Griffin 4. Tristan thompson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Steph Curry 7. Ayy, do I have to do this  8. Birdman 9. Kevin durant 10. Antetettokounmpo"
"That was what i was gonna say. Efficiency doesnt mean everything esp when only playing limited games. Idk people try to argue curry's greatness by talking about his ""gravity"". The same can be said about his other all stars durant,thompson, sometimes draymond. Without them, he would simply be double teamed every possesion and wouldnt nearly have the same impact if he didnt have a klay thompson or kevin durant to pass to."
ESPN: Kevin Durant may be out game 4
"""kevin durant cannot lead a team"" r/nba"
"Don't worry man, real basketball fans here know what a snake KD is. When my roommate remembered who Kevin Durant was he said something along the lines of ""he was that guy who signed with the team he shouldn't have right?"""
I was thinking of not watching much this season. Mainly because kevin durant is a coward who takes paycuts and joins a 73 win team.  But the end of the season was awesome.  However the playoffs have been bad other than that bucks game.
"Paul George is probably not solely motivated by a chance to win. He wanted to join a much worse Laker team last offseason. He's told people he wants to be a Laker. Don't be so naive that you think the sole focus of these players is winning. They have tons of different reasons that they might want to play on a team, and winning isn't always the number one priority.  I don't understand the logic of you guys on this sub. You lambaste Kevin Durant for going to the team that gives him the best shot to win and then you turn around and shit on Paul George for not picking the team that you think gives him the best shot to win. The hypocrisy is astounding."
Their last playoff loss to a western conference team was to Kevin Durant on okc 
No one can guard this Kevin Durant guy
It's about time we talk about Anthony Davis being better than Kevin Durant
"Dunno why you're getting down voted. Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Steph Curry-those guys are superstars. Kristaps Porzingis is not a superstar."
"Will: More than anything they need a really good defensive wing tat can shoot. Holiday has done a fantastic job guarding the Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo types, but that's a lot to ask of a player that's 6-4. "
Kevin Durant.  He did win a championship and a FMVP. :D

Kevin Durant named as one of the 1 Most Influential Snakes in the World by Time
"James harden plays in the same conference as Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, etc"
GENERATIONAL SCORERS: Michael Jordan Kevin Durant  (Potential) Donovan Mitchell  GENERATIONAL ALL-AROUND PLAYERS: Magic Johnson Lebron James (Potential) Ben Simmons
"What are your thoughts on Lebron and Kevin Durant being asked about such a sensitive topic (Greg Popovich’ wife) either moments after a game or with a bunch of cameras in their face?   In your experience, are questions like that forced upon reporters?  Edit: Grammar"
"When your team is kevin durant, arguably goat 3 and D player, and the dpoy, yeah, there is room for argument over teams "
"Wesbrook wasn't any more efficient than Melo was early in the season, PG struggled too, no one forced them out of their comfort zone. You still see careless turnovers and forced shots by Westbrook, you still see PG missing shots and making turnovers.   I know he's the 4th most valuable player on the Thunder, but it still doesn't mean that he couldn't be utilized more and better. Billy Donovan is a terrible coach with no offensive creativity whatsoever. Easiest bail out move for himself was to make one of his ""stars"" the role player and let two others try to win as many games as possible, tactic that will ultimately lead to Thunder losing in the first round.   Carmelo, like Kobe, T-Mac, Vince and many more is a streaky shooter, he's not a consistent one a la Kevin Durant, he needs touches/shoots in his sweet spots to get himself going.   Back to my point, he's criminally misused and underutilized in Billy Donovan ""system""  "
"It's not about him or anyone else but the Popovich family. When my mother died there were people posting shit about it on Facebook within a day and it pissed me off. My immediate family hadn't told anyone, the obituary hadn't made the paper yet, I don't know how other people found out but from my experience the respectful thing to do is give the family time before speaking about it on camera or social media or whatever. It's tragic and hard to deal with. Condolences are always implied and in good time can be given in person or on camera. Asking lebron about it immediately after it makes headlines is absolutely nothing more than who gets his reaction on camera first. It's all about money and it's disrespectful to the family who are going through a terrible moment in their lives. It's extremely personal and to turn it into a race to be first to get the faces reaction is just flat out rude and in bad taste. Why not let Greg say what he wants to say, if anything at all, when he's ready to say it. and then get players reactions after he has a moment to process the fact that he just lost his partner in this world. It's one thing to announce it and whatnot but going after lebron as fast as possible to hear what he has to say is about money. Clicks and views like the other guy said  Edit just to say there's another thread where they asked Kevin Durant the same thing and the general consensus there is that it's a bad move to ask a question like that right after a game. The players are somewhat obligated to do interviews and answer the questions they are asked. Think about the way pop deals with interviews. He's pretty quiet, one word answers. Doesn't seem to enjoy it. Can only imagine he doesn't appreciate this kind of shit. And that is what should be most important. Not whether or not it's a hard question for the player to answer, putting them in a place where they wouldn't react normally, off the court. Sorry for the long rant I just find it really annoying that they just HAVE to get into Pops business like this and that getting star players reactions is way more important than being respectful to the family and allowing them the time they need to grieve and process."
"&gt;Kevin Durant isn’t just an incredible basketball player; he’s an incredible human too.  &gt;From committing $10 million to the College Track program to help disadvantaged kids receive higher education to building and renovating basketball courts around the world so at-risk youth have a safe place to learn and play, KD is giving those growing up in tough situations, like he did, a path to success. His generosity knows no bounds.  &gt;As an entrepreneur, KD brings the same relentless work ethic and pursuit of excellence that he has on the court, focusing on companies and products that are making lives better. Above all, he has ridden the ups and downs of following his heart, making a hard choice and taking control of his own career—and has emerged wiser, happier, with his head held high. He’s a role model for us all."
lol except they did the same to kevin durant and it was clearly blindsided. It's retarded to ask and drop this shit on players
"""You will not believe how Kevin Durant reacts to this piece of news"""
Did they ask Kevin Durant before hand too? No. Reporters are scum. 
"**MVPs**  &gt; Lebron James, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Shaq, Michael Jordan, KAJ, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Hakeem Olajuwon (?)  **Presidents**  &gt; Trump, Obama, Bush Jr, Clinton, Bush Sr, Jimmy Carter, Dwight Eisenhower, JFK, Nixon, Lyndon B Johnson, FDR, Herbert Hoover, Calvin Coolidge, Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Andrew Jackson, Ulysses Grant, John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Abe Lincoln, George Washington  That's what I got off the top of my head. So I guess more Presidents?  *edit : shit, I was on the fence for Duncan, KG and AI but didn't remember the exact year so I was unsure if they won it. Also somehow fucking forgot Steph Curry??? I'm ashamed of myself...*"
"Also, something similar happened with Kevin Durant and as far as we know, he was not given the option for his raw reaction to be aired, it was just posted"
They did the exact same thing to Kevin Durant just a little while ago. Ask him how he felt about it without him even knowing about it and then just kept the camera on his face. slimy
Kevin Durant has a alternative twitter account where he argued with fans in the third person. Ima take his hot take about “blogboys” with a grain of salt. 
http://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-issues-psa-all-blog-boys-and-fanboys
"I respect Kevin Durant showing a genuine reaction, shows that the NBA is more than just the game."
"Lmao, they get Kevin Fucking Durant and a still salty? "
There's this dude named Kevin Durant. He's pretty good.
"""LeNeedMoreHelp is clearly making excuses for when he loses again, you know who doesn't make excuses ? The best player in the world, Kevin Durant."" - Skip Bayless"
Al Horford is only 2 years older then Kevin Durant.
"Year  |  ROY  |  Notable Players | Conclusion -------|-------|-------------------|-------------- 2000  |  Mike Miller  |  Kenyon Martin, Jamal Crawford, Michael Redd | Conclusion: No, not even worth arguing 2001  |  Pau Gasol  |  Joe Johnson, Tony Parker, Gilbert Arenas  |  Yes, but this one is very close, and this is just my personal opinion. Gasol is just over parker for me. He has had such a long peak and still today a formidable starter 2002 | Amar’e Stoudemire | Yao Ming, Carlos Boozer | No, this is another close one. But I believe Yao Ming edges this one out. Even though Yaos career was short, but in the time he played he dominated the game 2003 | Lebron James | Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh | Do i really have to say it? 2004 | Emeka Okafor | Dwight Howard, Loul Deng, Andre Iguodala | No, Not even close 2005 | Chris Paul | Andrew Bynum, Deron Williams, Andrew Bogut | Yes, Deron williams would have been the only one close, but his career seemingly fell off a cliff. 2006 | Brandon Roy | LaMarcus Aldridge, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Paul Millsap | No, however if injuries didn’t derail his career he may have been. But there is just to much talent in this class to say he undoubtedly would have been the best 2007 |  Kevin Durant | Al Horford, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley |  Yes, one of the best scorers of all time. Move along 2008 | Derrick Rose | Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, DeAndre Jordan | No, another story of what could have been but injuries took that away from us. Rose is my favorite player, but to say that Westbrook has not had a better career so far would be false. 2009 | Tyreke Evens | Blake Griffin, James Harden, Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Jrue Holiday | No, but looking back was that an unbelievably stacked class of guards. And Tyreke Evens had the best rookie year. Makes you think. 2010 | Blake Griffin | John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Paul George | No, but This one is hard to judge because Blake Griffin was not actually drafted in this class, but all 3 of these guys are better then Blake Griffin 2011 | Kyrie Irving | Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard | No, aside from all the Kawhi drama this year, he is a Top 10 player in the league, and a defensive monster. No question on this one. 2012 | Damian Lillard | Anthony Davis, Bradly Beal, Draymond Green | No, Anthony Davis is a beast on both ends of the floor and in conversations for DPOY and MVP 2013 | Michael Carter Williams | Rudy Gobert, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Viktor Oladipo | Yeah No, just refer back to these three names 2014 | Andrew Wiggins | Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Aaron Gordon | No, Embiid is on another level above everyone else"
"I have very vivid PTSD memories of Chris Paul shutting down Kevin Durant. Throw Rondo on him, it'll have him shook."
Why is Kevin Durant constantly left off of 1st Team All NBA? Since 2014 it was pretty obvious KD is the #2 player in the league.  Yet he probably is going to miss 1st Team All Nba for the 4th year in a row.  He missed it because of injury one year.  In 2 years the voters put Kawhi over him.  I love Kawhi but come on. And this year because of raw stats Giannis probably will get 1st team over him.
lebron steph kevin durant anthony davis kawhi leonard   easy dub 
Because Kevin Durant left for the Dubs with only 2 playoff wins.
"I must be underestimating NO. So there are people that think the pelicans can compete with the warriors? I just dont see it. Anthony davis will not be enough. All you guys say ""who can answer AD on the warriors?"" Who can gaurd kevin durant ever? And even if they frustrate durant he will still get at least 20 a game plus klay and iggy are playing out of there minds right now. I watched both games in this NO POR series and i think either one is in for a sweep in rd 2. But like i said, maybe im underestimating them."
"Kevin Durant couldn't win with Westbrook, Ibaka and James Harden.  LeBron couldn't win with Big Z, Anderson Varejao and Mo Williams."
This guy is the 3rd best player on his team. Literally the only reason not to hand them the trophy every year is if they're injured. Boring ass league thanks to Kevin wuss Durant.
"But why go there in the first place . Why disrespect what Curry has done for that franchise and the significant and established role that he has for that franchise.  Golden State has gotten better and better every year since Curry came to town and now his teams are being compared to the Showtime Lakers and they have championships to back it up. Curry is PROVEN , Lillard is not. Curry has been the main component of the system for years now and has resulted his in two mvps and historical greatness. Who is  to say that Lillards presence wouldn’t  disrupt the momentum that has been building up full speed ahead towards the all time dynasty that Golden State hopes to solidify. How would Lillard even play in the Kerr system, when he is strictly an iso player and is unproven in being an effective offball player. What would breaking up the Splash Brothers do to Klay Thompson and how fast would klay (and draymond) and Lillard be able to build chemistry and would they be able to recreate that same magic that they had with Curry? It’s not that simple where you can just switch curry and Lillard and expect the same results. It doesn’t work that way. It was different with Kd because upgrading from Harrison Barnes  to Kevin Durant is completely different and KDs game thrives when he has elite shooters around him and it was a perfect match. Going from a proven champion , MVP Curry to another all star point guard who has never sniffed a conference finals would probably not work out as smoothly as most would think. There are levels to this. "
He’s some level in between Kevin Durant and Brandon Ingram. Kid is going to be a household name if he stays healthy 
we could have had Kevin Durant!!! 
He's a better Kevin Durant 
Honestly I think that Adam Silver should ban Kevin Durant from the NBA because he is so good he can just stand there and shoot the worst shots and its efficient ball
I didnt say he played like Kevin Durant. But Smart and Jaylen played great D on him he was just making hard shots 
"You said he played like Kevin Durant. Is he that good, or did Boston just make him look that good?"
“Middleton Sprinkled in there”  Lmao wtf? He was playing like Kevin Durant all series.   Milwaukee’s 2 best players were much better than anyone on the Heat team y’all beat. 
"&gt; PG: Andre Iguodala, SG: Klay Thompson, SF: Nick Young, PF: Kevin Durant, C: Draymond Green  What the actual what what? If this works, Steve Kerr playing 32D HORSE confirmed."
"A depleted warriors team is still miles better than the Celtics team without Kyrie/Hayward/Tatum.   They still have a guy named Kevin Durant and a DPOTY guy in Draymond Green along with the best 3 and D player in the league.   Giannis failed to win a series against a depleted Celtics squad. Losing one game is fine, but getting smacked by them is unacceptable of Giannis caliber. Dude has had plenty of help this series. Middleton is playing lights out. "
came here to say this.  BLASPHEMOUS.  Should go:  1. Anthony Davis  2. LeBron James  3. Donovan Mitchell  4. Ben Simmons   5. Kevin Durant  6. Rudy Gobert  7. DeMar Derozan  8. Khris Middleton

"There is no way Kevin Durant signs long term with the warriors, the warriors can't even give him a Max, he's been taking paycuts  "
Towns also does that while shooting splits similar to Kevin Durant
"""Russell Westbrook is an assassin and he's coming for Kevin Durant. Trust me on that."" Stephen A Smith all season. "
"Wait until it's the 100th time.   And people start wondering how guys like Roy Hibbert, Kevin Love, Kevin Durant and more start showing signs of depression and self esteem issues."
Using players that have never been considered the undisputed best player in the league at one point:   * PG: Isiah Thomas (21/5/14/3) *1980's* * SG: George Gervin (33/5/3/2) *1970's*  * SF: Kevin Durant (32/8/6 on 50/39/88) *2010's* * PF: Dirk Nowitzki (27/9/4 on 49/41/91) *2000's* * C: Hakeem Olajuwon (26/13/4/2/4) *1990's*
"Yeah, that's a ton of recency bias. The Celtics were not really a notable team for most of the 1990s and 2000s. They get media attention now because they have a bunch of marquee players (mostly Kyrie) and the Boston sports market has really cannibalized (thanks largely to the Patriots' success), but the Celtics were well behind the Patriots and Red Sox in Boston sports for most of the past two decades. Even when they were a good team (the Walker/Pierce ""era""), they weren't a notable free agent destination or trade hot spot or anything.  The point is that the Celtics were judicious with cap space, had a good product on the court and a shit load of assets (as well as a great coach), and all of a sudden they got meetings with Kevin Durant and signed Hayward and Al Horford. You could attribute that to media bias but the eternal rule of the NBA is that smart teams win and stupid teams lose, regardless of how they choose to rebuild. It's been true with Boston and Philadelphia and Golden State and San Antonio and it'll probably be true with Utah as well if they continue to go down this path."

" I'm mixed about a KD return.  The Thunder would still be my team, but I wouldn't be happy that he's back.  Would he improve the Thunder?  Absolutely.  Would I be happy he's back?  Nah.  Am I still salty?  Yep.  The dude left us for the team we lost to by one game, it was an easy out.    Did it pan out for him?  Yeah.  Won a ring and was Finals MVP.   Which throws more salt in the wound for us fans who truly believed that Westbrook and him would eventually get there.  Maybe not right away, but we were maybe a few years away from it.     Also, it added to the nauseating Warriors vs Cavs finals x3.  Would it have happened if Durant stayed on the Thunder instead?  Maybe, most likely.  But would the Thunder vs Warriors in the playoffs been more exciting and intriguing?  Absolutely.  Plus, the whole bullshit he's done to Russ upsets me as a former fan of him.    I don't want Kevin Durant back in OKC.  "
"He makes awful decisions based on his emotions and ego and not what's best for the team. How many times have they been involved in a close game and Westbook thinks he gets fouled, then next possession launches up some absolute crap? Too many times. If you watched him play you'd realize how selfish and childish he is. Pair him with Melo, and I'm honestly shocked they made the playoffs.  If he ever grows up he might be a guy I'd want on my team. But for now he can rot in OKC. Would I give him a max deal? *Hell no.*  Edit: Also maybe you're forgetting that year he was playing with maybe the most prolific scorer in the history of the NBA, Kevin Durant, who has proven he can be a part of a championship team."

Young Supersonics Kevin Durant was pretty nasty. Before him I can only really think of the '03 class \(specifically LeBron and Melo\) making a big impact as rookies.
"Maybe I'm stingy about the ""superstar"" moniker, but I think that there are only 5\-10 superstars in the NBA total, and they are basically most of the All\-Star starters \+ Westbrook.  Is Mitchell on the level of LeBron, Anthony Davis, and Kevin Durant? I don't think so. He has the potential to be on that level though, and he's on the right track."
"people still cover for russ even though he would routinely shoot more shots than kevin durant, the single best pure scorer in the league.  doesn't matter the coach. doesn't matter the teammates. russ is russ, and he will not change his behavior and that's why the results don't change.  if you meet an asshole in the morning you meet an asshole, but if everyone you meet all day is an asshole, you might be the real asshole."
"Thunder fans said worse things to Kevin Durant and Westbrook was not angry about that   Sorry, Russ, fans are fans. Your reaction was a bit immature."
Kevin durant
That's a weird way to spell Kevin Durant 
Somewhere KD is laughing. 43 FGA attempt. Westbrook doing Westbrook thing.   Remember this when WB ignore KD?http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2291469-russell-westbrook-ignores-kevin-durant-fires-long-air-ball-instead
Ah good call this Warriors article said they could offer [5/$219m for some reason.](https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2018/04/11/kevin-durant-discount-contract-free-agancy-warriors/)... looks like it's 2019 through and I misread. Early Bird rights allow teams to sign the player to 1.75x the previous contract and limited to 4 years. 1.75x this years contract will likely get capped at supermax level. Contract increases are the same as Bird Rights though at 8%. 
"If Klay Thompson didn't go nuclear in the 2016 Western Conference Finals, Billy Donovan would probably be an NBA Champion. I think a lot of it for Donovan is just getting unlucky, first with Klay and then with Durant.  Now he's forced to coach Westbrook, who is going to play his style no matter what. If he had a different superstar (say Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Giannis, etc.) he would probably look better as he would actually get to coach. He's just got the dick hand of not being able to really coach Westbrook hard because the franchise is entirely tied to Westbrook now."
"Who ever said he was a ""lock"" for heading to the Lakers? The LA media? That same media that told us for the last 3-4 years that players like Danny Green, Westbrook, LaMarcus Aldridge,  Kevin Durant, and Blake Griffin were all heading to the Lakers? I'll believe it when I see it. "
"All you blog boys, it does count for shit when it's Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook trying to double you and you still get the gamewinner off. If somebody's forcing you left while defending, that tends to make you less efficient than you are with your right, and you can't pass your way out of some situations so even if this is not statistically backed up you just can't ignore the vastly higher variety of finishes that Kyrie has, which unsettle defenders and make them bite on more of his fakes."
"The truth is that Melo + PG13 is worst for this team than Kevin Durant. To play along Westbrook you have to be a MVP yourself or you won't find your spot. PG was irregular, and I won't talk about Melo. They never had a system, but an individuality constellation. Westbrook being what he is (A takeover machine), you have to find one and only one very good player and a long bench that cuan run plays dedicated to WB or their second star, ideally a Forward. Get a WB sub that plays like him (DSJ is a perfect example), give WB the keys and you are set. Now to find an MVP level Forward to play with WB when you blew KD (did fit easy, always played there, knew WB) and PG (ready to play with anyone anywhere, wants to be an all time great)... Gl...  There might be an easy alternative : Fire Donovan, bring a real system, and glue Melo to bench while recruiting real shooters. PG would probably leave because it looks like a rebuild, but does OKC have the choice?"
"It seems like underrating the sheer amount of talent the Thunder have had on their team is a common theme year in, year out. Personally, I think their Iso-centric nature of their scheme and their stars make it easy to forget. In ~10 years they've had:  Shaun Livingston  Jeff Green  Nate Robinson  Kevin Martin  Thabo Sefolosha  Caron Butler  Jeremy Lamb  Lance Thomas  Reggie Jackson  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Serge Ibaka  Dion Waiters  Enes Kanter  Domantas Sabonis  Victor Oladipo  Doug McDermott  Taj Gibson  Patrick Patterson  Camerlo Anthony  Paul Goerge  That's 21 names. They range from MVPs (Durant, Harden), to MVP canidates (Anthony, George, Oladipo), to DPOYs (Ibaka) to guys who have played pivotal roles on championship teams (Livingston, Butler*), to guys who have taken over months/entire playoff series (Green, Robinson, Jackson), to guys who have/had a legit place in the league and been meaningful, positive, multi-year contributors with other teams.  Literally none of them played their best basketball with the Thunder. You can pull some stats, or point out who won awards and where, but even in the case of Durant and his MVP season, it's impossible to argue that he's playing worse basketball with the Warriors than he did with the Thunder.  The supporting cast around Westbrook has been insane, absolutely insane during his time with the team. You can blame coaching and scheme all you want, but it's clear that Westbrook only wants to play basketball one certain style, and it's no conducive to getting the most of of his stud supporting cast. The only guy in his time with the team that has played the best basketball of his career with Russell is Corey Brewer on a 24 game sample size. Everybody else has been an inefficient, shell of themselves, who ~80% of them time bounce right back to who they were before they arrived in OKC once they're shipped out of town.  So yeah, Melo was rough this season, Playoff P was a no show outside of Game 1, and Patrick Patterson could've get it going all season. History says that all them of them will have more gas in the tank than expected once they're no longer playing with Russ  ---  *Butler was injured for the 2011 Mavericks playoff run."
"Before i comment further, i would like to preface that I don't like Russ either and i agree with you for the most part that you can't win with him. except for one part  &gt;Kevin fucking Durant, one of the best scorers of all time, couldn't even make this shit work, because Westbrook is a loose cannon on the court  I mean, they were up 3-1 on the greatest team ever in the Conference finals. I think Durant was able to tame WB enough, but that's just cause he's so good-- it would be silly to expect other players to be able to do the same  "
"This team won't win a championship anyway. And Russ has had opportunities to win a few championships he had Kevin Durant. They ran into LeBron, the 2016 Warriors, and devastating alternating injuries. There's a lot of recency hate for Russ and that he can't be the guy. But it's misguided.   Steph can't be the only guy on a team and win a championship as much as LeBron can't do it. Things have to come together with at least two superstars and enough guys that play above average to really good in their roles/positions. Russ has been the singular reason the Thunder has had success since Durant left. He's had to carry the franchise.  Plus, Durant isn't somehow better because he's not with Russ. Oladipo got better from being around Russ and had a chance to show out with the Pacers. Melo isn't worse because of Russ. No one is making him do 17 foot jumpers on iso jab steps taking up 15 seconds of the shot clock. "
"Westbrook is a phenomenal player, but something has to give if the Thunder are going to start advancing deeper into the playoffs with him as their centerpiece. Kevin fucking Durant, one of the best scorers of all time, couldn't even make this shit work, because Westbrook is a loose cannon on the court. It's legitimately a 50/50 shot any play for him to either do something amazing or make an incredibly stupid decision, and those stupid decisions just can't happen in abundance during the playoffs, or your team is fucked.  Even in a game where he drops 40+, he's a liability, because he took almost as many shots as he scored points. That's insane."
And Kevin Durant disappeared.
&gt; ex-OKC star Kevin Durant hugged him and said “You can’t win a championship with those cats”.  I'm dead
It's gonna be hard to get the same shots when Kevin Durant joins our team though.
"They have a terrible system billy divan needs to be fired , you got 3 great offensive scorers and you can’t get past the first round , like I know any other coach in the league had thoese 3 or just PG and melo they be a greater team but it also falls on Westbrook not being a true point guard doesn’t understand pace and flow I like Westbrook but he had a terrible IQ for the game , I mean this team I thought was the second best team in the the league wen they all got together but they can’t even beat Utah without Ricky Rubio not that that the jazz are trash but if you watch this series you seen a difference in each offense , idk man i blame Westbrook and billy Donovan , our Paul in the right system then he’s doing big things same with melo to some degree but I wouldn’t blame Paul for leaving it’s basically KD All over again These are the player they lost in the last 7 yrs  Kevin Durant  Victor olidipo  Reggie Jackson  Serge ibaka  James harden  Dion waiters  Kendrick Perkins  Enese Kanter   All of WHO THAT BEEN BALLING SINCE THEY LEFT FOR THEYRE RESPECTIVE TEAMS "
"Nah I disagree. He's definitely top-10, but his whole playoff run this year has highlighted his weaknesses which in my mind preclude him from being the best of the best.  Here are five players I'd put above him, not in any particular order:  Lebron James Stephen Curry Kevin Durant James Harden Anthony Davis  The super elite players in my mind are not only incredible individually and can create their own shots, but elevate their team's overall play and make their teammates better. He does only the former, and it's obvious that when he's out there it's to prioritize getting his above the welfare and success of the team. "
"No. Kevin Durant is one of the best players in the league (universally Top 5), and is better than Westbrook.   Westbrook is in the 6-10 range on his best days, but usually hovers closer to the 15-20 range.  Paul George is barely cracking the Top 20 on his best streaks. Carmelo is washed at this point.  I think it's highly likely they win this series with KD. "
"Carmelo Anthony yelled “I am the worst player on the court”.  Russell Westbrook gave a look of genuine derangement.  Paul George belted out “I’m going to a different [expletive] squad”.  And before Corey Brewer hit the locker room, ex-OKC star Kevin Durant hugged him and said “You can’t win a championship with those cats”.  "
"sigh this is so fucking frustrating man i love this team but FUCK if it's not one of the most frustrating teams to support.   terrible rotations, non-existent offensive scheme, one dimensional defensive scheme (switch, switch, switch, give up penetration, collapse paint, give up corner 3.) gutless coaching from billy d who is essentially a baby sitter as the team runs wild on the court. paul made a herculean effort at home to look good and then seemingly vanishes tonight. now he'll probably be gone and we'll be stuck holding melo's 28 mil cap hit and be absolutely trash for the next 2 seasons minimum... fuck the basketball gods.   i'm just fucking tired of it man. i watched us squander the talent of james harden, kevin durant, and so many others... this team had dynastic talent and it threw it all away for nothing. it breaks my fucking heart dude."
Paul George is taking the Kevin Durant approach of choking in the elimination game before peacing out.
Maybe that Twitter account that was most definitely absolutely not Kevin Durant was right about Westbrook
For sale: One former Superstar; has hella gold medals. Beat Kevin Durant for a scoring title one time. DOESN’T ball stop or bitch about minutes. 
Just like Kevin Durant. Go figure
"Jealous of our success. That's why y'all hate on us so much. You think Cleveland's a shit tier city (that I'm sure you've never even been to) and think we don't deserve success because of that. You're also arguing us winning a ring against us? Like what? We got a ring. Suck it. And yeah we got destroyed last year by a 72 win team that added Kevin fucking Durant. Nobody was touching that team. We still had a shot. Unlike 28 other teams.   In conclusion, I'll take my world class team in my ""shit tier"" city and you can take your shit tier team in your city.   Oh and flair the fuck up if you're gonna talk shit. "
"Durant should get ZERO praise for taking a pay cut.  He is taking it to play the easiest he can.  If kevin durant was logged into a video game.  He would start difficultly at ""medium"" at OKC.  Then press down to ""easy mode"" by joining a 73 win team.  Then press down again to ""very easy mode"" by taking a pay cut.  Not a competitive bone in his body."
"Well, he’s not the most important player on the team. It’s not arguable, honestly.   He’s the best player on the team. He’s the greatest player on the team.   But, and make no mistake about it, Wardell Stephen Curry II is the most important player to the success of the Golden State Warriors.   Kevin Durant could’ve gone to any team, and he went to a team that didn’t need him to win a championship, and long-term definitely would’ve won another one. The only thing worse that he could’ve done was sign with the Cavaliers.   He could’ve went to any team in the East, but he didn’t because he feared Lebron. He could’ve signed with Portland, pretty sure Dame wouldn’t have minded sharing the rock with KD. He could’ve signed with LA. I’m sure the City of Angels would’ve loved cheering for KD. Could’ve taken his talents to Houston, reunited with Harden.   Like the other guy said, his legacy’s already fucked. He’ll definitely be in the conversation, but it’ll be a hard sell to say him. "
"Kevin ""Reverse Thon"" Durant"
"Your team has had Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook for multiple years together and has won the same number of rings as us  You also had James Harden too lmao, three generational players and the same number of rings as the Toronto Raptors   Durant/Westbrook *in their primes* gave you guys zero Finals appearances and a 3-1 choke "
"I mean, there are three possibilities here:  1. Ring against Thunder came in a strike\-shortened season. Not legit. 2. Ray Allen hit the most clutch shot of all time, which absolutely saved LeBron's legacy. Not legit. 3. Ring came against a team with a bunch of scrubs that needed to bring in Kevin Durant just to remain competitive. Not legit.  I'm just wondering which way his hate flows."
"This honestly makes sense. Whiteside could have a bad series, but his play was on another level of awful during that series.  I think fans oftentimes don't realize how often players being injured or still coming back from injury and thus not being in shape can lead to these awful playoff performances. Middleton, iirc, had a bad series against the Raptors, but now has been healthy for a season and is absolutely killing it.  The amount of times I'll think a player is playing badly, only to then listen to Zach Lowe or Nate Duncan bring up an injury regarding their hands/feet/elbows/legs/etc. that had been bothering them going into the playoffs is ridiculous. That sort of stuff affects your burst, lateral mobility, finishing touch, shooting, etc., and even being slightly off, when the NBA is a game of half-seconds and the playoffs ramp up defenses, has a larger impact than most realize.  Of course, the counter-point to this is that most teams deal with injuries when going on playoff runs. Most teams are banged up by this time of the year.  Anyways, I would almost think that Lillard might be a victim of this. Kevin Love is absolutely dealing with this, so those of you who want to rip on him, remember that he came back from a hand injury and then, during the playoffs, had that nasty thumb injury on the same hand (iirc) that looked like it could possibly be serious for a while there. Just look at how often he loses the ball compared to what normally happens. Now understand how such an injury can affect rebounding, your finishing touch around the rim, and your shooting. Love should be doing more, but he also has some excuses for his worse performances.  Curry is gonna have this issue too. If Jrue is on Curry, I imagine Curry might struggle a bit more when he first comes back (the Warriors still benefit, because now Klay or Durant can get more opportunities). Remember how his 2016 MCL injury affected him, especially as the playoffs wore on, with regards to his burst and handle (his shooting is still going to be crazy good, but separation, defense, and finishing will become far harder). Now on top of that, realize that Steph was saying he wasn't going to be 100% healthy till after the playoffs due to all those ankle sprains BEFORE he even suffered from this MCL injury."
"This is why LeBron and Kobe were and are so adamant about not taking a paycut. That is a precedent that might be cool for you in the short term because youre already rich and you get to play with your friends and better players, but it can affect players 10 years down the line if you make it okay to take a lot less money. ""If Kevin Durant was willing to take a paycut in 2018, why can't you do it in 2025 you're not nearly as good as he was"". "
Breaking news: Kevin Durant takes $9 million paycut to stay with GSW sources tell Chris Haynes. 
"Look man, at least we got Steven Adams out of it.   If there's any chance at all that Harden just walks (ya know, like KD did YES ALBIET MAYHAPS DUE TO HARDEN TRADE), it's better than the alternative.   What did LA get for Dwight Howard? What did we get for Kevin Durant? What did Utah get for Hayward? "
I know he's unpopular around these parts but Kevin Durant. 
"So if a major construction company does work that the market value is $1 billion, but the client refuses to pay them more than $750 million, they have to do it because those are two big numbers?  No. Kevin Durant does not need to accept a 25% pay cut just because he is paid a lot. He is worth 25% more. Period. The end. This is not charity."
"&gt;GOATchefcurry   LOL delusional imbecile kids like y'all makes people hate Curry, even though he's actually a cool dude. Just stop it. No need to hate LeBron just because he raped your favorite player and his team, won another championship, and literally sent them back home crying to Kevin Durant for help. That's just sad  &gt;   Drink ya milk, and go to sleep kid. Stop embarrassing yourself"
"I mean you kid, but when healthy Solomon Hill does a fantastic job of guarding Kevin Durant.   He shut him down a few times just last season. He's not healthy, and almost definitely won't be until next season, but it'll definitely be interesting to see how his 15-20 minutes per game can effect our defense against the Warriors considering he's normally our second best perimeter defender. "
"Yeah, its weird. In that case I would say again that it's similar to field goal percentage. Like if you go to nba.com and click on the stat page, it has a category for league leaders in field goal percentage. The top 5 are DeAndre Jordan, Clint Capela, Montrezl Harrel, Steven Adams, and Enes Kanter. Nobody would look at that list and think those were the best shooters in the league though. If anything, those are usually the worst shooters in the league, and their high fg% just shows that they're only allowed to dunk and not actually allowed to take shots.   Similarly you wouldn't really get much out of comparing the TS of someone like Kevin Durant to Dwight Powell. But when you consider someones role, that added context can help. Like if you see DeAndre Jordan has a higher TS than Clint Capela, you can say that he's more efficient in that role, because he finishes dunks better, or is a better free throw shooter, or maybe is better at converting putbacks, or whatever. It's also good to compare catch and shoot guys, like you can see Kyle Korver has a much higher TS than someone like Trevor Ariza. Both guys are typically just catching the ball and immediately shooting it, sometimes Ariza may drive, but it's still a useful comparison in my opinion.   Sometimes it can be useful to compare it cross role though, for example, this year Steph Curry has a higher TS% than Tyson Chandler. You can look at that and realize that Steph Curry 3s off the dribble, and his midrange jumpers, all considered, are more efficient than Tyson Chandler dunks and 2 foot shots? That's wild. And that kind of puts into perspective how good Curry is."
&gt; **Anybody** can finish better when the help defense has to stay on Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant  hahahahaha
Anybody can finish better when the help defense has to stay on Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant 
"This is wrong on so many levels.  1) The idea behind trading for him now instead of waiting for Free Agency is because teams don't want to compete against each other in Free Agency. Not everyone is a Golden State. If a team like Boston had the opportunity to trade for Kevin Durant before he hit FA, even if he was injured at the time, they'd absolutely pull the trigger.  2) Signing Kawhi in FA also means you have to have a pretty large cap space as well. You have to unload your cap space to even have a shot at him. But if there is a trade involved, you still have the opportunity to get rid of some contracts along with the inevitable assets to get him. It's much easier.  3) The only problem here is the severity of injury. Once Kawhi's doctors clear him medically %100, all the GMs in the league will probably be notified about that.  All in all, you have to remember that Kawhi was absolutely seen as a superstar in this league a year ago. Will his trade value take a slight hit? Absolutely. But it won't go down the flames either."
And Kevin Durant with... another shot of shots

"If you think about building a team in the modern NBA, nearly every team (except some of the tanking teams) has at least one starting calibre PG and one starting calibre big, but I can't think of a single team that feels that they have too many wings.  That suggests that when selecting for need, most teams will want to pick wings - high impact PGs and bigs will probably still be available in later rounds of the draft. So if the best player available is a wing, they should absolutely be picked.   Look at guys like Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, or Paul George. You could throw them on any team in the league, and that team would get better - and the flip side of that is that if you were building around them, you could just pick any impact player without regard to position and it would probably be fine. Whereas choosing multiple PGs could cause your defense to fall apart (e.g. Blazers) while choosing multiple bigs could destroy your spacing (e.g. Pistons)."
"Bench of   PG- Stockton, Payton (setting aside his one off) SG- Drexler, Vince Carter SF- Scottie Pippen, Kevin Durant  PF- Karl Malone (again setting aside the one year), Charles Barkley C- David Robinson, Patrick Ewing"
"All Time:   * PG: Steph Curry / Isiah Thomas / Steve Nash / John Stockton * SG: Michael Jordan / Dwyane Wade / Clyde Drexler * SF: LeBron James / Kevin Durant / Scottie Pippen * PF: Tim Duncan / Dirk Nowitzki / Kevin Garnett / Karl Malone * C: Hakeem Olajuwon / David Robinson / Patrick Ewing  Lakers/Celtics:   * PG: Magic Johnson / Rajon Rondo / Bob Cousy * SG: Kobe Bryant / Jerry West / John Havlicek * SF: Larry Bird / Elgin Baylor / Paul Pierce / James Worthy * PF: Kevin McHale / Pau Gasol / Dave Cowens * C: Shaq / Wilt / Russell / KAJ  I take the non Celtics/Lakers team, but Shaq/Wilt/Russel/KAJ would wreck. "

"Here's a fun active one:  Dominique Wilkins - Kevin Ollie - Kevin Durant/James Harden/Russell Westbrook/Serge Ibaka.  This is only 1982-Present (36 years), but will probably get pretty close to the ones already listed if I had to guess."
"Kevin Love was a lil fatty in college and the dude was hilariously dominant. Like seriously one of the best single college seasons I've ever seen, up there with Durant, Michael Beasley, a few others."
"""Kevin Durant is a much better teammate""  Lemme stop ya right there chief"
"Because Harrison Barnes averaged 19/6/2 on 45/36/83 shooting. He was our only player that was creating for himself and often times had to bail us out with bad shots because aside from 24 minutes of Dirk, literally no one else can create their own shot on a consistent basis.   Players that averaged 19/6/2 or higher this season are:   1. LeBron James 2. KAT 3. Joel Embiid 4. DMC 5. Anthony Davis 6. LMA 7. Blake Griffin 8. Giannis 9. Kevin Durant 10. Westbrook  That is quite elite company to be in, even if he is at the tail end of it. He's only 25 years old, he has an incredible attitude, and is the bridge between the Dirk era and the new DSJ &amp; Doncic/Ayton/JJJ/MPJ/Bamba era. We had money to give and are not trying to compete right now. If he makes $25M and sets a precedent for rookies coming in it's worth every penny. "
"No. I’d rather have the following players over Westbrook:  Kyrie Irving, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Lebron James, Giannis Antekoumpo, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Anthony Davis.   So he is 13th best right now "

"We'll see where the circlejerk goes after LeBron loses to the Warriors again.  Fuck Kevin Durant, for real. "
"What do you mean? Kevin Durant has been killing Holiday. He can shoot over him any time, and he did in game 1. I think people are overreacting to this game 3. Especially in a game that ends in a blowout, you cannot even analyze it well. It just means one team basically let it go when they saw the difference in points as being insurmountable. Blowouts are bound to happen.  Even the Bulls had a huge blowout win over the Jazz in the 1998 Finals. It didn't mean the Jazz were complete trash."
Kevin Durant should be ashamed of himself

"Gary Payton - Greatest defensive point guard ever, I don't think he's stopping Magic by any means, but quick enough hands to make up for the size disparity. Also a really good playmaker in his prime  Kobe Bryant - My go to scorer, and also a defensive beast in his prime. Not afraid of taking on the MJ match up.   Kevin Durant - The most versatile scorer I've ever seen, can pretty much function in any offensive system.   Kevin Garnett - Need an elite rim protector to counter Lebron, and equally someone who can get on the perimeter if needed.  Shaquille O'Neal - BBQ chicken"
"IDK about that. Kevin Durant [really wanted to play with him](http://www.celticslife.com/2016/02/celtics-sign-al-horford-kevin-durant.html), though apparently he wanted to play with Steph and Klay and Draymond more. To [quote Joakim Noah](http://grantland.com/the-triangle/al-horford-atlanta-hawks-superstar/) a few years ago:  &gt; Al is a winner. The only reason he’s underappreciated is that he plays in Atlanta. Everyone in basketball circles knows he’s a top player.”  (Granted, Noah and Horford were teammates in college.) But even Spurs staffers [compare him to Tim Duncan](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/76f2vj/oc_the_al_horford_effect/dodj3nd/)."
"LeBron is by far the second best player in the NBA no doubt, surpassed only by Kevin Durant. He just always seems to bitch and moan on the court all the time though. Theres nothing I hate watching more than see him miss a shot than stare down the ref with that “where my foul at?” look on his face.   No doubt another clutch performance . But you would just think with all that clutchness maybe he could be less of a little bitch."
Call kevin durant in the parking lot
"The fact he needs to beat four future Hall of Famers including a DPOY, the best shooting tandem ever and Kevin Durant to convince you, is what's wrong with this argument in the first place. MJ never beat a team as good as those Warriors, who led the league that year in offensive and defensive efficiency and are the staple of the pace and space era of basketball we now live in. "
Lebron is a better scorer? No  Rebounder. Barely.  Passer. Yes.  Defense. No. Durant is actually a Better defender this season.  Leading a team? Durants team is second seed. Yes he has the Warriors but he's always been leading teams.  clutch plays. Durant and Lebron are arguably the same. Durant has less choking moments than Lebron.   The only argument is passing. And Kevin Durant is actually an underrated passer. So again. Lebron isn't leagues above Durant. They're pretty much 1a. 1b.   And before you start bringing season stats I asked for impact on the game. That doesn't mean stats alone. That means assessing their skill level.  
"3-5 even though the 2007 Cavs had the worst supporting cast in Finals history save for Iverson's Sixers, and the first loss to the Warriors he had to play without Love/Kyrie for 5 of the 6 games, and still won 2. Did MJ ever have to win a Finals without Pippen/Rodman??  ""Better stats"" which ones? Do enlighten me.   Michael Jordan Playoffs:  33.4 PPG, 6.4 RPG, 5.7 AST, 48 FG%, 33 3PFG%  Lebron James Playoffs  28.6 PPG, 8.9 RPG, 7.9 AST, 48 FG%, 33 3PFG%  Two more assists for Lebron covers the point differential. Their output is the same. Couldn't be more identical. Lebron putting up 40 point triple doubles to down the Warriors (the team that said ""three hall of famers isnt enough to beat lebron, we need Kevin Durant) couldn't convince you that he's a better all around player, then nothing will.   Goodnight, keep hanging on to the glory days. "
"You're proving my point though because you're telling me that MJ's supporting cast was good enough to warrant the ""best team of all time"" title. Warriors were literally neck and neck with them and Lebron beat them with the single best Finals performance any individual player has ever had. Without Kyrie and K Love, Lebron took them to six. Then when he got them back, he won it almost by himself with a 40 point triple double , on the road in Game 7. And then the year after the Warriors knew the only way to consistently not have to worry about Lebron was add Kevin Fucking Durant. "
"It's not a fantasyland circlejerk. He's a better passer, better athlete, better rebounder, higher IQ, and overall more talented player than MJ. He's not the better scorer, hes not the better on-ball defender, but when you go into a computer in 2003 and you design your ideal basketball player (before 7 footers could dribble and shoot), it looks like Lebron James.   And when the Warriors beat him.... it will be because they are a better TEAM because it's a TEAM sport which is the one thing MJ slurpers like yourself seem to forget. As if having two of the three best shooters of all time a DPOY and Kevin fucking Durant is a ""bad excuse"" for a Finals loss.  The biggest flaw in MJ fan's arguments is that you all revisionist history the shit out of it into thinking he won six Finals alone, against teams as good as the ones that beat Lebron. "
Yeah if I were you guys I'd be worried    ^^^^^If ^^^^^you ^^^^^didn't ^^^^^have ^^^^^kevin ^^^^^durant ^^^^^:(
"Every time Lebron does something amazing, people call him the GOAT. Those are the insecure people bringing up Jordan.  This post is just a response to them. You can't call a player the GOAT without bringing the guy who the majority of fans consider to be the greatest into the discussion, that's not how it works.   If Kevin Durant had a big game and I said he was the best player on the planet, I'd be making a statement about Lebron too, not just KD, because I would be saying KD was better."
Just need kevin durant and they’d have the same success as the Celtics 
Sign Kevin Durant to your all-star team. 
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there. Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder.

The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him.

"Serious ceiling: Annual All-Star superstar and Top 5 player in the league. He’s 20 and already can score buckets at will in a variety of ways that even polished veterans can’t do. He also will be a tremendous defender.   His ceiling lies somewhere between the game of Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard. Not to say he will get there, but his ability, size, and performance to date says he can.   Only thing really holding him back right now is tightening his handles and being more aggressive. Plus experience - that counts for a lot. "

"Just because he had a bad game doesn’t invalidate peoples claim that he isn’t a rookie , curry has bad games , Kevin Durant has bad games , lebron has bad games. "
"Yeah, like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and...Paul George."
"&gt;  Imagine today’s Oklahoma City Thunder never fulfilling their potential, getting sidetracked by injuries and drugs, wiping their roster clean, then winning championships with an aged Kevin Durant nearly a decade later.   :/"
"&gt;  Imagine today’s Oklahoma City Thunder never fulfilling their potential, getting sidetracked by injuries and drugs, wiping their roster clean, then winning championships with an aged Kevin Durant nearly a decade later. That’s how it played out for the “Twin Towers.”  OOF."
"1. Jordan  2. LeBron  3. Bird  4. Magic  5. Wilt  6. Shaq  7. Hakeem  8. Kareem  9. Kobe  10. Duncan  HM:  Oscar, Moses, Kevin Garnett, Durant"
"**IMO** Kevin Durant moves up to top 10, I don’t think I’d take 10 players over him to play in modern NBA."
The other is a 73-9 team before Kevin Durant that has been coasting through the regular season
Kevin Durant joining the warriors to win his first ring is like losing your virginity by paying a prostitute 
Kevin Durant might still be a virgin based only on his behavior
I hope Kevin Durant poops his pants during the game tomorrow
"GSW created a culture that made it enticing for KD to join and yes they had luck too in Steph's contract but remember that this contract was ""risky"" at the time. The warriors took a leap of faith on Steph improving and helped him learn how to land better, protect his ankles erc. So they  traded Monta and Ekpe Udoh for Bogut. Steph, klay dray and iggy all went to recruit kd. Show him the sharing culture of basketball they've created. Fwiw Westbrook didn't even bother going to the Kd meeting it was just Presti and Bennett. Everyone talks about how KD didn't tell russ about leaving, what did Westbrook do to make him want to stay?   As for luck with cap spike, how about the other teams? What if Ernie Grunfeld and the Wizards drafted Klay Thompson (or Kawhi) instead of Jan Vesley? What if the Wizards drafted Draymond Green instead of Satoransky (all due respect I love Sato)? What if the Wizards had not paid Ian Mahinmi and Gortat the contracts they did and instead used that cap to sign DC's native son Kevin Durant? I use the Wizards as an example because this is a team that could have easily been the Warriors if not for glaring mismanagement by Grunfeld who has been there forever. Warriors were not the only team with cap space for an elite player in the summer of 16. But they deserve credit for creating a place that a player as talented as KD would be willing to go to sacrificing personal accolades and with a superstar on a rival shoe company. Warriors are setting team records for assists and passes in a game. Thats one of the big reasons why KD is here  Tldr: Regardless it was always about basketball for KD where'd he'd have the most fun playing. Ws got lucky in how it worked out sure but to a degree they created a lot of that luck. "
"What this Warriors team is doing is doing now and another half a decade into the future will undoubtedly be special and legendary. But the downfall to this team's legacy is that it will always feel different compared to other dynasties that came before it, hell, even the Heatles run a few year back felt more empowering or special. The Bulls had Jordan the greatest to ever play and there we have Kevin Durant, the second greatest player of this generation who decided to join a already top 2 team to chase easy rings.  They are gonna fuck shit up, but yeah, it's not gonna feel the same to fans of the game."
"if rockets double durant, warriors will have a solution that results in an open player under the basket or klay and steph getting an open look. warriors are smart enough not to let a durant double team lead to a draymond 3 pointer. it's not as simple as double teaming durant and leaving capela under the basket.  ""capela being a good shot blocker can get some defensive blocks"" yea he'll get a couple every game, give or take, that won't define the series.   warriors system isn't overhyped, you're analyzing the warriors offense based on yesterday's game. the regular season is not kevin durant draining mid range 2s like a robot. that's playoff warriors system. their regular season system is giving everyone playing time, ball movement, off ball runs, and 4 all stars in addition to vets all taking pay cuts.  they built the ball movement offense as an extra weapon, because they can dumb down play ""give the rock to durant"" anytime.   ""play lock down defense on KD, Klay, and Steph and see what the other 2 can do"" is what every team has tried to do for two seasons. GS knew this from day 1 and devised an offense around that. you saw it in game 1 where curry was ""neutralized"" with an 18\-6\-8 stat line, but Klay got 28. "
"&gt; A dudes got every right to seek out a workplace that makes him happy  Not Kevin Durant though, obviously."
"No one is fine with being mediocre. All teams are trying to position themselves to win a championship, whether that be in the short, medium, or long term. It's really hard to build a dynasty because you basically need one of the top 3 players in the league to succeed at the highest levels. So yeah I'll tweet at Mark Cuban and tell him to go ahead and trade for Kevin Durant or draft the next once-in-a-generation player. Easy peasy"
"Dude plenty of players have in the past it’s not exactly unpopular either in fact what Kevin did is what’s unpopular. Bird lost to magic and he even used it as an example when talking about the Durant situation in saying he’d never want to join magic, he wants to beat him, it’s a competition"
Kevin Durant telling us we don't understand the hesi pull-up jimbo if we never really hooped.
thank you for telling us what you would do if you were kevin durant. very insightful. you sound like a truly transcendent person on their way to greatness. 
"Ah yes the ultimate role player, Kevin Durant!"
"Also important. Point is, Kevin Durant alone did not ruin the NBA. "
It’s apparent that you didn’t even watch the game so there’s no point at even arguing this out but here’s a shot. “‘Maybe if he moved the ball”? He dropped 41/7 on 75% TS. James was not the problem. CP3 played terrible last night and it was up to harden to score every possession to even give us a punchers chance at winning the game and we where close up until the 5 minute mark. Kevin Durant was knocking down shot after shot contested or not and klay poured in 30 aswell. Curry didn’t even do much offensively and was able to use his energy for defense fully and yet he’s still a terrible defender. Comparing his defense to hardens defense last night is ridiculous considering harden did everything for us offensively and didn’t have energy like he’s had in the past when he could take a seat back and let chris and the other players score. You have no clue what you’re talking about 
Stop projecting and grow the fuck up. The media's sentiment towards KD's move to the Warriors has changed and so should yours. Former and current professional players respect Kevin Durant and believe his ability to choose any team in free agency is the quintessential representation of freedom that the NBPA has fought so hard for. It's only you fucking 12 year old fans who don't understand how important this move was for the players because you're blinded by rage of having to witness the free market in action which doesn't fit your fantasy narrative.
Kevin Durant
That was a fairly average game for playoff Kevin Durant...
"I agree.  When KD was in OKC, our best defender on him was Ariza because he was quick enough to deny him the ball and long enough to contest his shots when he did get the ball, but that’s probably not our best option anymore because a) the rest of the Warriors are much more dangerous than KD’s OKC teams, and b) Ariza has probably lost a step. Capela is very quick for a big man; not quick enough to play ball-denial defense on Kevin freaking Durant, but quick enough to stay in front of him and contest his shots. "
"Hate to break it to ya, but Durant is actually 7'0"". He had to convince a lot of media people to reduce it to 6'9"", so they wouldn't force him to play inside more often. [Source](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/)"
"Highest game 1 WCF ratings in 16 years. Massive interest in the upcoming FA period. He happened to chose a team already popular in China, helps grow that market even more. The league and the owners, except for a select few, couldn't be happier with Kevin Durant."
"&gt; If Kerr retired tomorrow and literally any coach took over, they would win the title. This is because they added Kevin Durant to a team that won 73 games.     I couldn’t disagree more.     I don’t think half the coaches in the league - at least - would sniff the WCF coaching this team. "
The players association rejecting cap smoothing ruined basketball. Kevin Durant was free to make whatever decision he wanted and the players association allowed him to make this decision. 
Doesn't matter. CP3 and Harden can drastically outperform Curry/Klay and the Warriors will still win because they have fucking Kevin Durant and the reigning DPOY. 
"He cheap shotted a dude that was a foot taller than him. Kevin Durant would stomp Chris Paul into the ground,  He yelled ""play ball"" and then proceeded to wilt the entire game while KD dominated him. CP3 is a bitch and he can't back up anything he says or does. He'll wilt like he always does."
Curry without Durant: Kyrie and Kevin love less finals that went 6 games and a 73 win team that lost the same number of games in the post season as the regular season and lost a 3-1 lead. With Durant: 16-1 with the highest average margin of victory in playoff history 
"nice post. thoughtful, clear effort, with no reliance on numbers or previoius series/seasons/eras \(ie a 73\-win team adding kevin durant...uggggh\)"
Also Kevin Durant was looking unstoppable in the first half man. They need to find a way to keep him and klay in check.
"I'm just here to see the curse on Kevin ""the hardest road"" Durant"
Kevin Durant on the Warriors is the real life 2K cheat code..  Outside of injuries no team had a chance last year and as we all saw last night no team has a chance this year.. 
Kevin Durant takes only the hardest roads without the hottest dudes.
Yes they swapped Barnes for Durant would be more accurate. Bogut is out of the league. So is Barbosa. Losing those guys didn't matter. They were replaced with Zaza and Nick Young. Who else of consequence did they lose? Ian Clark? They also added Javale and David West. The core of the team is the same. And they even managed to keep Livingston.   But yes maybe instead of Durant added to a 73 win team we should all say a 73 win team swapped Barnes with Kevin Durant. Still makes it an absurd talent collection.
"Dude, people don't take away from GSW, they take away from Kevin Durant. That 73-9 season everyone was fucking *amazed* by GSW, and even the haters couldn't invalidate the accomplishments. "
"The problem is Kevin Durant. There's no answer for him when Ariza gets called for 5 ticky tack fouls in a half.   Harden did the best he could. 41/4/7 with low turnovers while the rest of his team shit the bed does not fall solely on him. The only adjustment they should make is have Harden cover Draymond next game and let others defend the sharpshooters.   I know with all your r/nba-indoctrinated heart you want to shit on Harden but he put up an MVP performance and singlehandedly kept Houston in the game against the defending champs. Blame Ryno, blame Luc, blame Tucker, blame Ariza and even Gordon for that game. Harden was a savant in isolation yesterday. "
"&gt;**Look. If we are being honest with each other, here, let’s acknowledge what we all know:** The Rockets are 100 percent dead in this series, have virtually no chance whatsoever even to push it to a seventh game, and could spend Game 2 jump-kicking each other in the face for all the good they can do by even trying to make adjustments to what the Warriors did in Game 1. It’s over, and so is the season, and the only thing that can make any of it not-over is both Steph Curry and Kevin Durant falling down a mine shaft that leads directly to the boiling magma guts of planet earth. It would be silly to pretend some other thing.  The author most definitely shitposts in this sub during Nephew Hours"
"Let's just all be honest with ourselves, nobody can beat this Warriors team. The Rockets and Celtics have probably built the two best teams possible without any drastic superstar collusion or an insane outlier like the salary cap jump, and they can't put a dent in these guys. MAYBE a full strength Celtics next season, and even that required one of the worst trades in history and the best GM in the game to materialize.   Think about what it took for this Warriors team to lose 4 games back in 2016. They needed 7 games, a miraculous late shot from Kyrie, a rare incredible defensive stand from Love, and the typical heroics from LeBron. All of that just to barely beat them. Then they added Kevin fucking Durant. And the only way they were able to do that is by benefiting from an insanely flukey salary cap jump and an all-time bitch move from one of the top 3 players in the game.   Can't fault them, all of our teams would have done the same. And they built a pretty incredible team and environment before he joined, but regardless, we should forget about any regular team, built by regular GM maneuvers ever having a prayer as long as the Warriors are still whole. Either LeBron has to join an already stacked team in which several players sacrifice money to take them down together, or the NBA just has to wait them out. I'd like to see the entire league start tanking in the meantime, just to highlight the absurdity of it all.  I'm proud of the Rockets' season, it was an absolute blast, but this is as far as a team can get while the cheat code Warriors are still around. Definitely, nothing to be ashamed of, losing to them. We might take one game, two if the league wants it I guess."
"Yeah I think that gets forgotten. If you listened to Lowe and Simmons this week they talked about how Horford causes a million problems on the pick and pop because he can shoot, he's quick enough to drive, and Boston has capable perimeter players so you can't just double. They talked about how Horford has basically become this unstoppable pick and pop player because he's a smart passer and all of those other factors. Then you get so worried about stopping Horford that Tatum finds backdoor lanes, Rozier goes off, etc. and you lose other ways.  Curry is kind of the same but amplified. You get so caught up trying to keep Curry from getting open looks that you end up leaving your worst defender on Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant, and they don't have help on the drive, etc. Suddenly Klay goes for 15 in a quarter, so you switch to guard him better.  Then Curry goes for a big quarter. Then KD does. Then Klay again. You can't guard every weapon on the team, so you have to hope someone has an off night."
Kevin Durant has alt accounts on here.
"I'd like to see the Rockets double team Durant and  force some one like Igudola or Draymond take the shots. I think both these guys are lacking in mid-range game so they are either forced to go for the 3 or drive to the basket. Capela being a good shot blocker can get some defensive blocks.  People are overhyping the warriors system - yes they have good a system but it is really coming down to the non stop offense of Kevin Durant draining mid range 2's like a robot.   Basically play lock-down defense on KD, Klay and Steph and see what the other 2 can do.   "
"1)The NBA owners do not have divergent interests.. The League splits it's revenue. If Kevin Durant plays for LA his entire career vs. OKC that's probably a difference of a quarter billion dollars in revenue for the League in his career. If not more. Also a majority of teams individually operate at a loss in the League.    2)In 1985 E&amp;Y, the same firm, ran the lottery and many people believe that lottery was rigged.    3)You can argue the Lottery is not rigged because of the technology in place but I don't understand how people can say with absolute certainty that it's not rigged, when it has hundreds of millions of dollars of implications on NBA revenue.   Someone tell me why I am wrong im honestly curious. "
"Stevens deserves praise, but its as if people think these players are scrubs. These were all top 10 picks and an All-Star veteran. I don't recall Larry Brown getting this praise on his way to the Finals with the Pistons and he actually beat two of the greatest players of all time in the NBA Finals. I've heard folks place Brad Stevens above Pop.   Like, c'mon, stop it. Let the man live. Let's see what he accomplishes. It's a lot different (not easier, just different) getting kids &amp; role players to buy in versus superstars. That is why what Phil and Steve Kerr are great.    Fans often look at these players as if they aren't human beings with personalities &amp; lives when they see their talents. They go into MyGM mode and see ratings instead of Kevin Durant, who has over the course of the last 2 years revealed a lot of character flaws, Steph Curry taking a step back, 4 final runs, an enormous lost in a 3-1 defeat, and much more. It's a lot to manage that, set an environment that Klay Thompson would buy into, and much more.   Even more, I've seen this story before. Build them up, only to tear them down -- what, maybe next year, when things don't go so well?"
"Good lord man. Steve Kerr is a great coach and really maximizes the talent. But the almost all the great NBA teams in history are not “made by” their coaches. They are made by their players.  That’s not a knock on Kerr, but the reason the Warriors are the Warriors is because they have 4 All Pros. This team won 51 games in the West when David Lee had Draymond’s role and Mark Jackson was the coach.   If Kerr retired tomorrow and literally any coach took over, they would win the title. This is because they added Kevin Durant to a team that won 73 games. "
Why would is it be obvious the lottery has 100 million dollar implications on NBA revenue in a league that shares revenue. Weather Kevin Durant plays in OKC or LA is the difference between a quarter billion dollar revenue over a players career. 
"&gt; Last i recall steph and co got a ring woithout durant  and Lebron didn't have Kyrie Irving or Kevin Love, BOTH STARTERS. "
"So if Kevin Durant has a bad performance should everyone say they'd rather have Andrew Wiggins?  You can shit on someone's performance (by the way, Horford didn't have any shitty performances before that thread), but it makes no sense to say someone who's several tiers below him is all of a sudden better."
"While I respect the Rockets defensive improvements and thought they actually had pretty good effort and scheme last night there's just no way for them to compensate for Golden State's off ball movement. Klay didn't get off 20 three point attempts because he broke everybody's ankles or because Houston was daring him to shoot, it was because Houston couldn't keep up with him while also trying to stop Kevin Durant from shooting over his defender.  The Rockets can score with the Warriors, but it's impossible to out-shoot the Warriors. You need the defense to slow them down and idk if the Rockets have that. They didn't have it in game one, whether they find it for game 2 will be significant."
Kevin Durant
"Together with his partner Kevin ""Paycut"" Durant"
"Kevin Durant, Draymond, Chris Paul"
"Cry me a river   They traded in festus who was ass, an injured Bogut, a used Harrison Barnes, and Barbosa for Kevin Durant and they still had their core......"
"Not true. The only time the Celtics have moved up in the lottery is in 1986, when our pick Len Bias unfortunately overdosed shortly afterwards.  We’ve had the 2nd best odds twice, in 97 and 07, and fell back both times. In 97 we wanted Tim Duncan and in 07 we wanted Kevin Durant.  So yeah our lottery luck has not been great."
Ok So if you're Kevin Durant and you want to play in a system that fits you and you have a chance to be on the greatest team of all time you say no thanks i'm going to play in Miami or some other average team. All so you can make some people on Reddit think you're a good competitor.
Kevin Durant somehow winning more championships and growing in irrelevancy at the same time 
"The Rockets thought they figured something out by trying to get a switch on Curry every possession they could. Warriors seemed content to let them pound the rock and go after that mismatch at the cost of their shooters' ryhthm. On the flip side, I thought the Warriors did a good job switching everything and making the ball handlers (mainly just James tonight) work for his points. Great night by him but should defer a little more. it's amazing to watch the Warriors on and off ball movement when they're locked in. Even so, when all else fails they just dumped it to KD.   There is no answer for Kevin Durant. "
"Ok if you were Kevin Durant and you had a once in a lifetime opportunity to be on the greatest team of all time, Would you do that or go sign with the heat?  "
Scientists were confused how Kevin Durant suddenly forget how to play basketball after game 1 of the WCF. NBA fans were not. 
Kevin Durant wasn’t on that team that LeBron/Kyrie beat
Lmao he had to touch that screen like 10 times just to circle Kevin Durant..
"this. they built a 73 win team entirely through the draft, with not a single top-3 pick throughout the process. they then went and hired a coach who, while being a players coach, also installed a system that allowed the roster to perfectly execute a gameplan to maximize strengths. then, as the final nail in the coffin for the rest of the league, they went and signed Kevin Durant to complete the roster.  to people saying it isn't fair, what would fair look like? because to me, a team nailing mid-lottery draft selections, installing an incredibly attractive culture, and being seen as THE progressive franchise in the NBA is pretty damn fair. I hate that this team is so fucking good, as a Rockets fan, but man am I impressed..."
"That exact same warriors team could have come back the very next year and won though. And that would have been forever sweeter. The same way the Spurs did it to the heat. But instead they typed in the Kevin Durant cheat code and ok...you won, no shit, if you didn't then you all suck ass."
"I can’t take the “hard to do” part seriously.  Yes I get it, winning a championship in professional sport is the most difficult thing there is to do. This team went 73-9... and then ADDED Kevin Durant. So yes it is always hard to win a championship, but this is the easiest road to a championship that I’ve ever seen before. It’s not impressive, it’s expected."
So like  &gt; ✨💖Kevin💖 Durant 🎶 has✨😍 fucked 😊 up 🎶 the league 🌹for years🌺 to come💯!
"Pau Gasol was not a free agent when he went to the Lakers, so he did not receive the kind of hate directed at Kevin Durant.  But there was a *lot* of outrage when the trade was announced, and people were calling for the league to step in.  No one anticipated that Marc Gasol would eventually make the trade worthwhile, so at the time it seemed like a very one\-sided trade.  The other difference is that the Lakers were not a championship team when they added Pau Gasol, while the Warriors were a championship team when they added Kevin Durant.  But remember, the players union refused to smooth the entry of money from the new TV contract into the league, thus making it possible for a championship team to sign an MVP level player."
"Draymond and Kevin Durant. Hated KD even when he was on OKC. Dray is just so smart but he's a dick on the court, not just in a competitive way just in a dickish way."
Mark Jackson had Kevin Durant?  Goddamn.  \(I'm perfectly on board with the idea that Kerr isn't getting enough love right now and the Stevens circlejerk has gone too far... but I'm just saying...\)
"It's Kevin Durant for me in terms of decisions AND personality. The whole debacle with the social media sock puppets, the whiny and soft way he carries himself, ""The Servant."" "
"So you dont see a problem with mentioning one of the stars playing bad but not the other star who played insanely well? If you are gonna mention one, mention the other too.   ""Regardless of starting slow they still lost games""? Did you really just write that? Jesus Christ...  edit: The 73-9 Warriors added another MVP in Kevin Durant and they won 6 less games that season which goes to show you they didnt have enough synergy together(Yes he was injured for part of the season). Fastforward to the playoffs and they had the most dominant playoffs ever. It literally took a record breaking 3 point shooting from the Cavs to steal 1 game from them. "
&gt;Warriors legend Kevin Durant
"Yeah because having LeBron and two on-and-off All Star’s is the same thing as having two multi-time MVP’s, a DPOY, and a fourth All Star who happens to be one of the deadliest shooters in history and among the best two way guards in the league. Oh and don’t forget the 2015 Finals MVP coming off the bench. With a bunch of guys taking discounts.   The Warriors won a ring, and completed a 73-win season. Then they added Kevin Durant.   The Cavs were one of the absolute worst teams in the league *with* Kyrie, then they added LeBron and K-Love.   LBJ had to come into one of the shittiest teams in the league and he still won it all. No pay cuts, no MVP teammates, and an *abysmal* record with him not playing even to this day. KD took a pay cut to walk into the cushiest situation in league history.   These two are not equivalent situations. "
"2night he showed what means defending a A+ team plus Kevin Durant. Some shots in 2nd and 3rd quarter made me think they are unbeatable, even with a lineups with all Tucker or Ariza. You cannot defend that guy since he got an entire team playing and hustling for him. I got the feeling was Durant's team, not Curry's one. But it's just adjustments, when they will face Cavs or Boston, curry will have more space. Houston is doing a great job, but u can't beat the math: if u wanna double KD, Klay will punish u. If u don't wanna double Kd, you are dead in several ways"
"I don’t think there is a clear debate at all. Kevin Durant is the best player on that team. He went to Oakland, where there was a 2x reigning MVP known as the greatest shooter ever, and became the main threat on offense. That’s enough proof without having to get into it."
Kevin Durant averaged 35.4 ppg in the finals and made first team all nba and 2nd team all defense. I'm not acting like magic was leagues past his prime but he was definitely on the decline. I have Magic as the third best player of all time (after MJ and bron) so I dont underrate him I just think that his final season and final finals performance was (vastly) inferior to KD's finals performance in 2017. 
"Magic johnson at age 32 with the last dying breath of the showtime lakers in 1991 was not as good as kevin durant in his prime, in my opinion.   "
Did Jordan ever face anyone in the finals as good as Kevin Durant?
on 27 fga. Kevin Durant averaged 32 in a season on 20 fga.   7 less wasted possessions for 5 less points. I'd take that 10 times out of 10. 
He is so unlikeable to me I'm happy when they lose. Yep CP3 has me rooting for fuckin' Kevin 'hardest road' Durant 
Fun fact: Kevin Durant is 18kg (40lbs) heavier than Manute Bol's listed playing weight. 
Kevin durant could shoot from anywhere aswell if he was willing to be more selfish and shoot on a lower efficiency. 
"The Celtics have literally nobody useful except Horford to add, that’s basically just the Cavs + Horford and a couple pretty good guys like Tatum and Brown. Still getting raked in like 5, maybe 6 games.  Edit: The Cavs don’t either besides LeBron.  Jesus, I said the Celtics don’t have people that can contribute significantly to defeating the Klay Thompson Steph Curry Kevin Durant “Fuck You” Superteam. So many gatekeepers on here telling me I’m a fake fan for not pretending to myself we have a bunch of superstars on our team. Damn.  Edit 2: Free karma for anyone who wants to chime in and call me a fake fan because I’m not so dumb I think our rookie is better than Steph Curry! Come and get it, just leave another redundant comment."
"Yes. Today a lot of what the Warriors did depended on Kevin Durant attacking his man. He took 27 shots and took 6 free throws. That's a pretty large workload on offense. He also played defense on the best offensive player on the other team. Yes, he has, more help in a general sense, but today the Warriors relied on him to create a lot of offense and still check Harden. There is no measurement which cleanly shows one guy had to give 87 effort on offense to create what he did and the other guy needed to give 94. It doesn't work like that.   I'm also not buying into the idea that Harden has to do everything. Paul is right there, he's not as skilled as iso guy, but he is capable of running an offense. Harden could have shed some of his responsibility to Paul from the start of the game instead of starting it off attacking. It felt like Paul was not involved early and that's taking away from a big reason they brought him in. You just cannot have Chris Paul and then complain that James Harden has to do it all. "
"Kevin Durant, James Harden, Paul George, Victor Oladipo, Carmelo Anthony..."
Nah warriors fans definitely love him. He gave them a perfect condition Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant was absolutely unguardable today but shout out to his defense. He was flying on rotations even picked up Harden for some of the game. Did an excellent job of not reaching and biting. Harden still made a ton of tough shots over both him and Steph. But I am loving Steve letting KD guard Harden.    Also shout out Kevon Looney. He was a defensive machine
Kevin Durant shoots over defender from 17 feet. 
A record setting team turned around and added a future Hall of Famer/All-Time great player in Kevin Durant. People see Klay staying and are already imagining Durant doing the same. Do you imagine these iterations of the Warriors losing any championships barring injuries?
You have Kevin durant as a flair your opinion is irrelevant you're automatically disqualified for being a snake 
Kevin Durant isn’t even the best player on his team
"lol  People who didn't even watch basketball hated Lebron. No one cares about Kevin Durant that much.   Lebron turned his back on his city and state on national TV.   Without understanding the context of OKC, and the Warriors and 3-1, no one would even understand why he was hated. You would have to actually explain to someone all the reasons why KD is disliked.   Lebron was fuckin worse. "
Kevin Durant
"Yep. All GMs in the NBA are like ""you know I have the choice to pay $25 mil a year to Harrison Barnes or Kevin Durant. Let's just choose Harry B"".   Only the Warriors were the team in that choice who thought Durant was the better choice. That's it   "
"Yeah dude like just sign Kevin Durant, I don’t get why franchises choose to be unsuccessful"
If I was Kevin Durant I'd be pretty butthurt about it
Kevin Durant joining the Warriors after choking a 3-1 lead is the epitome of cuckoldry.
"FUCK Kevin Durant, snake bitch ass lanky scrub ruined the NBA I hate Kevin Durant so much, go warriors "
Houston we have a problem. His name is Kevin Durant. Warriors were a vulnerable team with no consistent threat when they didn't had KD.
"How's any of this wrong?   Besides, Kevin Durant doesn't personally owe you parity, especially not after LeBron James has been coming out of the East for 8 straight years."
Kevin Durant ruining it.
Kevin Durant ruined the nba 
Coaches wouldn't even let KD wear headphones while shooting pre-game. He did it and they screamed at him that that's not how they did things there. Once he got to GSW he wore em and nobody batted an eye. [article](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18226416/nba-how-kevin-durant-became-most-efficient-self-yet)
Yeah subbing Kevin freaking Durant for Harrison Barnes. So much risk!
Kevin Durant is the best player in the NBA. 
"LeBron never used fake twitter accounts to harass middle school basketball players who didn't like him.   And then lie about it.   And then *keep* doing petty shit.   In fact, LeBron beat Kevin Durant to make people get over it. Then he beat the 73 win Warriors.   To compare, Kevin Durant *joined* the 73 win Warriors. "
"The one thing I keep thinking about when watching this game was KD and Harden just kept trading haymaker for haymaker. My dream is for one day Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden to play on the same team again. Man f*ck the Thunder this could have been their dynasty and they botched it so badly."
I wish Kevin Durant had the usage rate of Harden or Lebron James.  That would be a blast.   
Kevin Durant legit can't see CP3 when he turns around.
Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green"
"Nah, Hammond (former Bucks GM) went and saw Giannis in Greece playing in a glorified YMCA league. He knew the deal.   &gt;Bucks general manager John Hammond went to Greece early in the spring of 2013, taking along with him assistant Jeff Weltman (now with the Raptors (now Magic)). He’d like to be able to kick back and say he saw from the beginning that Antetokounmpo was destined for greatness, that there was some moment when it all became crystal clear. But instead, when asked if he suspected Antetokounmpo would become what he is now, he’s honest.  &gt;“No,” Hammond said. “When we first saw him, Jeff and I, we thought that he was a player who had a great feel for the game, with great size and length. He was playing point guard at that time for his team. You could see he could handle it, he was a good decision-maker, and he knew how to play. But I wish I could say we knew he was going to be an All-Star at 22 years old. I wish we had known he was going to be this, but I don’t proclaim to be that smart.”  ...   &gt;Hammond had no doubts. “We were sitting with the 15th pick,” he said. “How do you get value at 15? He was our guy. If there were risks, we felt he was worth it.”   http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/news/milwaukee-bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-nba-all-star-playoffs-jason-kidd-kevin-durant/aj6upavfhlut10wxwxjkemm5q"
"The Rockets dribbled a ton and didn’t pass a ton and got crushed on defense. But last round, the Pelicans passed a ton and dribbled a lot less and also got crushed on defense.   This whole thing is so fucking stupid to me. You know why these teams are getting crushed on defense? It’s not because of the number of dribbles they’re taking. It’s because they’re playing against Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant.   It’s not because of dribbling, or because of their rotations, it’s not because of X or Y or Z fixable problem. It’s because the team they are playing against is a *mile* better than they are. As is the case in literally every series that this Warriors team plays. You don’t need to whip out the magnifying glass to try to figure out what went wrong here. The Rockets lost this series two off seasons ago."
"Even if lebron takes the vet min, or takes 20 mill, EVERYONE knows that his value is the max. He's the best player in the league. His value does not go down, its just understood that he CHOSE to take less.  It's like kevin durant isn't it? Everyone knows KD is worth the max. Him taking less doesn't affect FA, For example, celtics signed hayward to the max, despite him being a worse player than KD and KD taking less than the max. Nooone would think KD isn't worth the max just like noone would think LeBron isn't worth the max right?"

"&gt; If there’s a role player hitting free agency and Lebron is taking a $20 million+ pay cut that role player will see his offers lowered.   See, you keep saying this but you're not saying WHY. WHY would the offers be lower? I don't think they would be.  Even if lebron takes the vet min, or takes 20 mill, EVERYONE knows that his value is the max. He's the best player in the league.

I think the Rockets might be better if they implemented a Kevin Durant in their offense.
"Getting guys to buy in is not the same as managing the egos of superstars.  Steve Kerr has probably the most down to earth players a coach could ask for, which is a matter of upbringing and the fact that they're winning, not coaching.  The guy with the biggest ego on that team is probably Kevin Durant and he took a pay cut to play there.  He has his social media problems, but as far as needing to manage his ego it isn't an issue.  Steve Kerr doesn't have anyone like Jordan or a Kobe vs Shaq situation on his team.  Steph Curry even took a diminished role in the offense so KD would join the Warriors.  It's ridiculous to believe that Steve Kerr has to manage egos in comparison to Phil Jackson.  So, once again please explain to me, whose ego does Steve Kerr need to manage?  "
"Have you heard of the Warriors? Kevin Durant? They’re the reason LeBron doesn’t have 2 more rings right now. Talk about the stars aligning, literally."
"Seeing how many warriors fans fight to the death to defend kevin durant, I'm guessing most of you (along with the 5000+ bandwagon celtics flairs that would crop up) would probably defend that."
"Lmfao yes we could've given the Warriors this title in October, are you on bath salts, do you even watch basketball? If Kevin Durant doesn't fall down the stairs and Steph Curry doesn't get hit by a bus this week, the Warriors will sleepwalk to a title in one of the most lopsided Finals of all time."
I don't know what to tell YOU if you think there's going to be a Game 6 in a series between the team with Kevin Durant and Steph Curry and the team without them. There are exactly 0 top 10 players on the Celtics. Superstars win championships and the Celtics just straight up don't have any.
&gt; They went to 6 games vs. Lebron with Deledova as the second best player. Then lost in seven vs Lebron and Kyrie so they decided to add Kevin motherfucking Durant. That doesn't prove the system works it just shows if you have 4 All NBA players on the roster you'll win a championship.   This so much.
"Looks like a chubby Kevin Durant. LeBron still dropped 42 points, he always has bad game 1s."
"&gt; Contrary to popular belief, Kerr's main focus isn't the three point revolution but Versatility, he regularly demands varied excellence from his team.  Both D'Antoni and Kerr stress getting 'great' shots.  To the Rockets, a great shot is getting value through analytics. Getting easy shots at the rim, or threes because they're more valuable. That's it. The further away from the rim you are, efficiency drops off in the mid range. They shoot a ton of threes because even if they have a below average percentage, they'll make up for it in volume, no matter how good the look is.  To the Warriors it's different. A great shot is one that you're good at and can get easily. So for Kevin Durant he's encouraged to take lots of mid range shots *because* he's good at making them. Draymond doesn't have nearly as many attempts from the same range as KD *because* it's not something he's good at. Steph Curry has the green light to pull up from 30 feet because he can get a good look from that range. Layups and dunks are good because they're easy. This is a team that only takes threes when they're good looks."
"Contrary to popular belief, Kerr's main focus isn't the three point revolution but Versatility, he regularly demands varied excellence from his team.  With the KD-Curry Pick and Roll Kerr can spam that play all day long like what Mike D'Antoni does with the Rockets.   However he likes to vary his attack/defense according to what the opposition offers them.  Which is why Javale McGee (offense and defense) was instrumental against the trail-blazers last year. Looney (defense - switch against​ AD) was instrumental against the Pelicans and why Nick Young is going to be instrumental against the Rockets.  Since the League has caught up on the fact that the Warriors are good three-point shooters they've made it a point to drive them off the three point line, so Kerr had them adapt and take what the defense was offering them - free lines to the lane and high efficiency mid range jumpers.  He also likes to maximize the potential of his roster and when you have a Hall of Fame Offensive juggernaut in Kevin Durant who can pick and choose his spots from inside the arc and have the length to shoot over his defenders, Kerr incorporated way more mid-range sets to the Warriors system.  "
"&gt; Harden's iso dribbling was so extreme that you could combine Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson's combined dribbles (549) and they still wouldn't add up to Harden's 550."
&amp; Steph Curry brought in Kevin Durant...now their working on destroying everyone's feelings because they can't handle watching top notch basketball.
Man this guy is a Kevin Durant breed a snake. 
"Lol...ya right. Allen, who was arguably the best perimeter defender in the league at the time, had success against KD in a few games. But he got torched regularly and was dominated late in series when the chips were on the table. And the majority of Allen's success was limited to 2013 when KD was forced to play PG after Westbrook's injury with 0 spacing around him. And KD still averaged 28.8/10.4/6.6 53.1 TS% that series, so ""lockdown"" is a joke. Not to mention Memphis was widely regarded as the league's best defense back then and Gasol won DPOY in 2013     Stats vs Allen    Regular Season      |Player|G|MP|TRB|AST|PTS|TS%| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Kevin Durant|24|38.5|8.1|3.4|26.4|.591|    Playoffs    |Player|G|MP|TRB|AST|PTS|TS%| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Kevin Durant|19|44.3|9.6|3.5|28.3|.549|     Memphis had 3 chances to beat a healthy Thunder team in 2011 and 2014 They lost all 3 games and Durant dominated.    |Rk|Player|Date|Game(Series)|Opp||MP|TRB|AST|PTS|TS%| |-:|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |14|Kevin Durant|2011-05-15|7 (3-3)|MEM|W(+15)|38:51|9|2|39|.673| |36|Kevin Durant|2014-05-01|6 (3-2 MEM)|@ MEM|W(+20)|42:31|10|2|36|.608| |38|Kevin Durant|2014-05-03|7 (3-3)|MEM|W(+11)|42:24|8|2|33|.799|  "
"Don't complain about what? What am I complaining about? If LeBron leaves then I'm okay with that. He won my team a ring. And oh please, the Cavs were never going to trade Kyrie this season. It was so obvious the Boston trade was a last minute hurrah for Kyrie's request. Kyrie simply wanted his own team because he didn't want to be LeBron's sidekick. It's what he wanted and then LeBron came and they won a ring together. Played another season and then hit the Kevin Durant wall. It was his personal decision to leave and try to better himself as a leader instead of getting bounced in the finals again.    And Kyrie + Wiggins would have never amounted to anything. I would take LeBron + Kyrie + Love for 3 years where I am guaranteed a ring over the hypotehtical bullshit you're spewing of having a playoff team of kyrie + wiggins + a free agent (david griffin confirmed it was gordon hayward or trevor ariza lmao)  getting bounced in the playoffs for 12 years. "
"The only people that would see it that way are people that already have something against Lebron and Cleveland fans that feel jilted.   He has been the team's leader the entire time he's played for the team. That doesn't mean staying there forever. Unless Lebron goes to the warriors there's really no comparison to Kevin Durant. He has already won a ring with Cleveland. He doesn't owe them anything more than that if he ever owed them anything at all. Being a legend is about being good at basketball, not facing adversity.  Whether he goes to the Rockets or Sixers or somewhere else, he's kind of cemented his place in basketball history. If he wins another ring or two and plays at as high a level he can move up but there really isn't much he could do to move down at this point."
"I'm not saying he will be immune from any criticism, just that the level of criticism won't be appreciably different. A few of his existing detractors will tack it on the list of why they think Jordan/Kobe etc. are better or why Lebron isn't the GOAT but those people would always have something to say whether or not he leaves, as you point out.  The point is, of the people that don't currently look down on Lebron, not many are going to start looking down on him for leaving Cleveland. Maybe a few, but public opinion on Lebron will still be as favorable as it is now. It's not a Kevin Durant situation or even ""The Decision"" level in terms of how people view Lebron."
"I would disagree about that but it’s debatable. But again, the Warriors replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant. So even if the Rockets are better it doesn’t matter. "
The idea of Kevin Durant ruining the NBA is a fiction made up by sports commentators for ratings and clicks. It has no basis in reality. 
Had Kevin durant and James harden 
Hard hitting analysis like using a stat that puts Karl Anthony Towns above Kevin Durant and Steph Curry and LeBron James to judge a players ranking?Sit down son
"I don’t really care what he does at this point, but it needs to be recognized that he always needed the most talented supporting cast for a star to win it all (Wade/Bosh) and then (Kyrie/Love). When he didn’t have the best co-stars he lost, and even when he had the best co-stars he would lose (2011 and 2014).  Kevin Durant will rightfully be maligned for not being able to win without the best co-stars (Curry/Klay/Draymond), while guys like Curry, Duncan, Dirk, etc we’re able to do it without the best co-stars in the league.   Raises serious questions about Lebron’s place in history against guys like KD and Curry, especially if they win 6 rings for Curry, 5 for Durant or more. When Lebron tried to break parity, it was still a struggle. When Durant (and Curry) broke parity they actually broke it.   I think the best read is that Lebron teams have a lower ceiling than a Durant or Curry team because of Lebron’s ball dominance limiting their potential. I think a Lebron team has an incredibly high floor, but how do you rank Lebron right behind MJ when Duncan teams had that same high floor, but higher ceilings?"
"Can you imagine being a Celtics fan, picking in the top 5 of the draft year after year, having the assets to trade outright for Kyrie Irving, and the cap space to sign Gordon Hayward to a max, look poised to beat LeBron James without their two best players and still have top draft picks incoming.    And despite all that good fortune, be so jealous that Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors, that the warriors constructed a better team with worse assets, and that we are so ready to throttle the Celtics in the finals that you make threads like this instead of being happy with your situation. "
"Wade didn't have to change his play style because the Heat were an elite cutting team. You obviously didn't watch them play, or you'd know that they emphasized off ball movement, and played within a system that isn't Lebron centric. Thats what happens when you have a competent coach along with solid personnel.  Also Harden does the same thing Lebron does, except with better teammates. Both do isolation sets for the entirety of the shot clock and then either jack up a shot or kick out to a teammate. The only difference is in transition where Harden's teammates get involved more often simply because of the D'Antoni system.   Kyrie wasn't relegated to a spot up shooter because he could create his own shot. Give Lebron a competent player who can consistently create his own shot and its a different story. Kevin Love was that guy against Toronto, but Boston's size is too much for him in this series. If you can't see the gap in personnel then you are helpless. It's a lot easier to throw the ball to CP or Durant and trust him to score than it is to give it to JR and watch him jack up a trickshot."
KD is literally leaving at least that much on the table when he went to the [Warriors](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/6/28/12050498/kevin-durant-contract-salary-money-nba-free-agent-rumors). Please don’t reply again unless you prepare an intelligent response with a bit of decorum or I won’t reply to your next comment. 
I think you'd have to put Lebron into the conversation. He's approaching Kevin Durant as a shooter.   Lebron has average .540/.360 for the last two years now. 
Kevin Durant would have still joined
The 2016 Warriors didn’t have Kevin Durant. And these Rockets don’t have LeBron James. It’s over. 
"I don't think Embiid's ceiling can go much higher. I think he's basically already playing at the highest level he's going to achieve - which is an elite/all pro level. What's he going to improve exactly? Going from 10 rebounds a game, to 12? Going from 2 blocks a game to 3? From maybe 22 points to 26 points?   The guy with the highest ceiling is going to be a guy whose already great, but has real flaws to their game. I'd say guys like Antekoumpo, and Ben Simmons. They're as good as Embiid already, but have probably only reached about 50% of their potential. If either develops their shooting to a high level, they'll probably be better than Kevin Durant. Or at least on his level. Like top 10/15 all time"
I think the better question is who are the players that can slow down Kevin Durant. I don't think there are many in the history of the league since Durant is 7 feet tall and is one of the best shooters of all time. 
"I think Ayton is going to help them a lot more than Doncic, they better be sure they're not making a Greg Oden over Kevin Durant\-like mistake by passing on Ayton..."
Not many people can guard Kevin Durant . You can attach any legend you want 
LeBron can barely guard Kevin Durant
Lil B said it best: Fuck Kevin Durant 
"Kevin Durant had a better freshman year. But I still want JJJ, Bagley reminds me of a more mobile Amare but even less defensive ability. Plus he is nearly identical to John Collins in strengths &amp; weaknesses. "
I thought Jeff Green would be better than Kevin Durant 
There really is no point in watching the rest of the playoffs. Fuck you Kevin Durant
"Agreed.  I think we'd generally make it past the Toronto's and Washington's, and depending on the year you could flip a coin vs Cleveland and Boston.  I don't think we'd win a championship at all though.  We were a really, really good, balanced team.  The Warriors are a really, really good, balanced team with Kevin Durant."
"The key is who can slow down Durant and has the length to bother his shot and the athleticism to stay in front of him.   Rodman would hurt the offense too much. Pippen might be a little too short (though I know Tony Allen has guarded him well in the past).   Honestly, Horace Grant would be a really good choice. Kevin McHale would be very interesting, especially because he would make him work on defense too.    Wait, I know -- Robert Horry. "
"The dominance you’re describing is what the Warriors were on pace to do when they won a championship then won 73 games the next season.   The Warriors really are unprecedented. There’s absolutely zero suspense this year. They are going to win the finals, period, no question. No series will be longer than 5 games. And this is in a pretty strong conference, it’s not like they’re just benefiting from a weak set of competition.   The Warriors *were* a dominant team before Kevin Durant joined them. Now it’s just a team that doesn’t even have to play all that well and can still win a title pretty easily.  It is especially rich to hear GS fans say “you’re just salty it isn’t your team.” Buddy, look at my flair. You think I’m salty about the NBA when my team isn’t winning? "
"KD is a hell of a basketball player but there's always going to be that asterisk after his name. Before he joined the GSW, he was getting destroyed.   I don't believe that Kevin Durant can carry a team like LBJ is doing.   Kevin durant stats look amazing though but at the same time, he has the team that allows him to do whatever he wants.   See what I mean? "
"I think you're missing the point. It was a team that was an established championship caliber team PRIOR to getting Kevin Durant. A team that set the NBA record in wins. Miami lost in the first round prior to forming the big 3 in 5 games. So already we have a pretty stark difference. One team was a contender who pretty much kept their entire roster, only they upgraded one of their weakest positions with one of the best players in the league.   Miami got off to a slow start and struggled to stay about .500 for a while. While they definitely course corrected they ended the season not even gaining the number 1 seed in the east. They had 58 wins which, while good, put them at the third best record in the NBA and only one game above two other teams. To contrast, the warriors won 67 games their first season with Durant, which was the best in the league.   In the play-offs that season Miami went 5-5-5 in the east. Which is definitely impressive, but then they lost in a pretty ugly 6 game series to the Mavericks. Golden State went into the play-offs and swept every team in the west before dropping one game to the cavs in the finals after it was pretty obvious the series was over. At no point last season did the warriors look mortal. In their first season Miami definitely did.   If you think for a second that the big-3 miami squad ever looked as unstoppable as this GSW team does, you're either revising history or are having memory troubles."
"The first observation is that the fact that Ayton shot better from long mid-range than short mid-range suggests he shot a lot of unguarded mid-range shots as well.   I'll be honest though, I care a lot more about 3 point shooting than midrange shooting. Ayton is a decent shooter, but he's not Kevin Durant. He would need to shoot like 67% from mid-range for it to be a better shot than JJJ's NBA 3-pointer, and that's just not going to happen.   If I were his coach, I'd want him to spend most of his time in the paint and try to develop his spot-up shooting behind the arc as well. Mid-range shots are important for practice, but I wouldn't want him actually shooting them in games unless he's wide open. I definitely like JJJ's shot chart a lot more than Ayton's, but I think that's mostly down to coaching."
"The problem I have with Ayton is first of all he is a center. Second, he has poor defensive instincts. There's guys like Enes Kanter who are beasts offensively and on the boards, but who have little impact on the game, and I fear Ayton is one of those guys. I wouldn't be comfortable using a top pick on a guy who I'm not sure I could have out there at the end of a close playoff game.  As for Bridges, I think he is the best wing in the draft, and I think wings are high value picks. There's something interesting with how much NBA GM's struggle at taking wings.  If you look at the top wings in the league, you get Lebron and Durant selected at #1 and #2. They were considered generational talents. After that you have Giannis (#15), Kawhi Leonard (#15), Jimmy Butler (#30), Klay Thompson (#11), Paul George (#9).  When looking at these guys, some things become clear. They tend to go 2-3 years in college, and they tend not to put up big stats. Usually 15-18 ppg.  The biggest thing is they have the bodies. Mikal Bridges has the body you want with a massive wing span.  Then if they're going to be a great shooter, it shows in their college shooting percentages, not only the three, but also FT%.  Bridges is shooting 43.5% from three and 85.1% from the free throw line. Check, check. The visual test shows a shot with good mechanics and a quick release as a bonus.   These guys that play good defense and have intangible offensive effect on the team tend to show up in net rating. Jimmy Butler had a +36 net rating as a sophomore and a +24 net rating as a junior. Kawhi Leonard had a +19 net rating as a freshman and +26 as a sophomore. Klay got up to +14 as a junior, but he was more of a shooter and not a big defense guy, or doing much other stuff on offense.  Mikal Bridges is absolutely insane in net rating. +36 as a freshman. +37 as a sophomore. +34 as a junior. When Mikal Bridges is on the court, his team murders the other team. Now Villanova had good net ratings all around, but Bridges stands above their other draft prospects, like Brunson +26 and DiVincenzo at +20. Of course they shouldn't be knocked for a high net rating from being on a good team when Bridges was the best player, so a big reason they were so good was because of him.  Bridges had a BPM of 13.4 and 13.1 his last two years in college. Thompson had 10.1 as a junior. Kawhi Leonard 9.1 as a sophomore. Jimmy Butler +9.4 as a junior. (They didn't track BPM when George was in college).   All signs point to Mikal Bridges being a superstar and possibly the best wing prospect since Kevin Durant. His advanced stats are just so insane, it's insane that so many people are ignoring them.  I think he's an unselfish player who plays well within the team construct and plays to win and because of that his counting stats are a little lower than people would like them to be at, and as a result he's being overlooked for the stud prospect he is. "
"bruh the fact that you have to sag off fucking kevin durant in order to *try* to keep Golden State in check is absurd. it's like, yeah, we'd love to double up on you KD but you have two of the greatest three point shooters to ever grace the game just sitting beyond the arc. and, oh yeah, your power forward is one of the best passing big men in the game. so, here's 6'4 PJ tucker to guard your 7-foot ass. oh? you're also one of the best shooters in the game? well fuck me."
"Who will probably play a ton of minutes and be bad, like pretty much all rookies on bad teams are. Even Kevin Durant was a replacement level player his rookie year."
"Conveniently leaving our that Kevin Durant joined literally the best regular season team of all time (and what should have been the best team period of all time, but they choked and LeBron went godmode).  There is a reason people say anywhere but golden state would have been better."
Kevin durant
"How many great teams have the Celtics beat that are on the same level as Golden State? NONE. ZERO. ZILCH.   They are constructed like Golden State, except they didn't have the best regular season record ever, then added Kevin Durant.  That starting line-up gets beat by Golden State in 5 games.   Horford won't be able to guard Draymon in transition or on the perimeter. Kryie can't play defense.   If you have Kwahi at the 4, then they have a chance.  it is all fools gold. I went through it with Houston now. We don't have the star power. Celtics don't have the star power. "
"&gt; there is something bigger than money at Oracle, that very few teams can offer.  Yeah a championship lol do you think Kevin Durant took a paycut because of how much he loves the Oakland environment or because he knows he shatters all parity in the league and will win several easy championships?"
"Lol dude without steph, the best 3 point shooter in NBA history, klay, who holds the record for scoring in a single qtr, and Kevin Durant, multiple time scoring champion(!!!), scoring points would be vastly more important to the warriors, like how it is with the other 30 teams in the nba. But because those 3 can score with anybody draymond gets such a fucking pass Jesus Christ "
"Riiiight...the '03-'04 Lakers signed Gary Payton and Karl Malone to play with Kobe, Shaq, and Derek Fisher who were coached by Phil Jackson, but the Warriors adding Kevin Durant to a core of young players drafted and fostered within the organization is the creation of an unprecedented, unfair super team, and no one *cough* Miami *cough* Lebron *cough* has ever done this before."
I'm biased but I'm going to go with the Lakers.  Kuzma can flat out score. Ingram is young and and ideally turn into that dream Scottie Pippen/Kevin Durant player. Lonzo has the best playmaking ability out of all the young players in the NBA. 
The mere presence of an all time competitor like Brady around Kevin Durant would make him freeze up and miss every single shot.  So if you got another part of the team that can handle the other 3 you got a solid chance.
"Man, F U C K Kevin Durant. He deadass killed the joy out of the fight for theNba championships. Everyone very well knew before the season began who was gonna win the chip. Everything else was just speculation and a bunch of what ifs. Even the sports critics know. It’s their business to say otherwise so it generates controversy and arguments etc "
"The top 10 or 20 or even 30 players of all time are not differentiated by their on-court skill. They are differentiated by their on-court success and achievements.   Durant has the skill to be a top-10 all time player, but even with skill that success isn’t guaranteed. I think a cautionary tale is someone like, say, Kevin Garnett, who wasn’t really differentiated in skill or talent from his contemporary, Tim Duncan. But Duncan unquestionably achieved more than Garnett, and the all-time comparison isn’t really close.   In KD’s case, 100% he had a shot at being an all time great. But this move locked him in as a retrospective 1b to Steph’s 1a, forever. Barring an injury to Steph, Durant will likely always trail Steph in Championships, MVPs, and general fan sentiment. He has locked himself into a situation where 15-20 is the absolute peak. Which is fine - that’s his right. It’s just a little disappointing.  "
"CP3 is an extremely intelligent player and you could probably slip him onto any team and he would be able to put up impressive stats. Now with that said his stats did take a hit because he forfeited touches to Harden and from that his points and assists have gone down from last year, but he is still playing well because he's CP3. Also, Houston and Golden State are drenched in talent and efficient offensive systems with great coaching. Cleveland is the exact opposite. The Cavs coaching is non existent and the quality of talent on the Cavs compared to the Warriors and Rockets is barely comparable. LeBron is literally taking a bunch of role players to the ECF essentially by himself. You're are trying to make the point that Durant, Chris Paul, and Klay didn't take a dip in performance when playing with Steph/Harden and using that as a benchmark to how well Kevin Love, JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, and Kyle Korver (who has been very good) are playing with LeBron. It's a fallacy and not an appropriate way to construct your argument. "
bu-bu- Kevin Durant killed the NBA
Kevin Durant is the best player in the league.
Maybe Cleveland recruited the wrong Kevin?  It’s Kevin Durant who would’ve been a great fit. Not Kevin Love. 
Kevin Durant and Steph Curry
Kevin Durant ruined basketball.
When Golden state likely sweeps the Celtics or Cavs you'll all be reminded of how much Kevin Durant ruined the NBA
Free agent dude. Free to choose his location.  The league office can't make Kevin Durant go where they want him to. That's insane. He broke no rule. 
"Scorer refers to any way you get buckets. That includes shooting, but also drawing fouls, abusing mismatches, finishing inside, actually creating opportunities for yourself, etc.  Shooter refers to your jump shot, particularly your three pointer and mid ranger. Curry is easily the superior three point shooter. From mid-range it's probably a wash, but Kevin Durant is better in his ability to actually get good looks from mid-range because of his ridiculous length. "
Kevin Durant has been better than bron for 2 seasons 
"'freedom to choose what co workers to be around'  for fuck sakes, you guys really need to stop this crap where you compare people who get to play professional sports for a living to guys in accounting, it's a joke.  Their world in no way resembles that of an every day person so stop trying to project like it does. These athletes are paid to compete, and receive sponsorships and whatnot based on their skill.  People, or at least most, want to see them compete at a high level.  Kevin Durant chose to avoid all competition and stack an already stacked team to guarentee a championship and alleviate the pressure of leadership.... and that's fine, but he also wants respect for his game, for championships he wins, etc... and that's where this becomes a complete joke.  He doesn't want to beat the best, he just wants to be lavished with praise, which is a shame because he's one of the 2 best basketball players alive right now."
Well it's not like all 350 of those players are on the other team.  Kevin Durant went to the best team in the league so he'd basically never be challenged.  No team will just focus on stopping him because they literally can't.  It's a total joke as far as competing is concerned.
"Oh look. The “I hate Kevin Durant, give my terrible article clicks”. The Star is trash. "
Kevin durant ruined basketball tho...
r/NBA: K Love and Demar are so brave for admitting they have mental health problems. There really should be more awareness and people should take it more seriously. Props   r/NBA: Kevin Durant is such an insecure little pussy ass bitch. Imagine being this insecure. He’s seriously so mentally weak LMAO
"Although I agree that the Celtics are an incredible team and are better coached, the truth is that nobody on the Celtics is as good as Steph or Durant. I think very highly of Horford, Hayward, and Kyrie. But Draymond and Klay are also insane, and the fact that the Celtics’ 5th option is better than the Warriors’ can only take you so far.   For some reason people seem to be totally incapable of grasping g how good this Warriors team is. This Warriors team is like if the Celtics are even better than you think they’re going to be next year, and then *on top of that* they added Lebron. We were talking about this Warriors team like it was potentially the best team of all time *before* they added Kevin Durant. It’s broken people’s brains - it’s like people refuse to admit the insane dominance that this team had.  Last year the Warriors lost a single game in the entire playoffs. And yet people insist they’re bearable because there was a conceivable way that if everything had gone against them, they would have won in 6 games. That’s insane dominance. There is no competition with them."
"I wouldn't say he ruined basketball, cause warriors play the perfect basketball. Ball moment, shooters all around just all around beautiful game. But they are so good that they don't have any real competition. Kevin Durant ruined competitive basketball "
Are you dense?  The league didn't allow the CP3 trade because they owned the Hornets. Their reasoning is dubious but they had the authority to do so.  Kevin Durant was a free agent. The league does not have the authority to veto legal free agent signings nor should they.
Not our fault Kevin Durant literally broke the NBA. 
Kevin Durant was a free agent you goof.  The league office doesn't have the authority to veto a perfectly legal free agent signing.
"Communism-Ball. Install a cap FLOOR that is exactly the same as the cap CEILING. Playoffs as normal but once you get to the finals, Durant goes to one team and LeBron goes to the other.   Regular season games are refereed by Kevin Garnett, Metta World Peace, Boogie Cousins or golf legend John Daly. ""Bitch Moves"" (as determined by the official) result in the immediate ejection and year long expulsion of the player. Players who do not stay competitive and ""play ball"" have to have a staring contest with Kevin Garnett immediately after receiving the call while Boogie blows in their eyes. Players who refuse to participate in the contest or lose the contest are sentenced to either working out with LeBron every day (you have to call him sir) or replying positively to every single message Kevin Durant receives on any social media."
He's like a beefy Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant wants to drink Parker's bath water. 
Haha this guy is crazy kevin Durant is the best ever and I am definitely not Kevin Durant hahaha
As others have said already. Players association fucked up by rejecting cap smoothing. Chris Paul is the president and LeBron James is the vice president. Players were eyeing their big pay day and did not think of the potential fallout. Kevin Durant just did what was best for himself for what he wanted. Sure he could've lead his own team with Russ to win the finals. Or he could've squandered his prime and not win a ring while playing frustrating Russ basketball. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity and he took it. I like watching the best version of basketball possible. 
But I thought Kevin Durant ruined basketball?
"Draymond got himself suspended from all his Antics throughout the season. Wasn’t All his technicals added up which caused him to get suspended? He caused that problem. Not Lebron.  The same could be said for the 2015/2016 year. No Kevin Love, Kyrie got injured. Cleveland had a likely shot at winning the title if they were around.  And then Draymond is one of the first people to call Durant to join him when they couldn’t beat Cleveland that finals. So let’s blame Draymond if we are playing the blame game here."
Y'all act like Kevin Durant wad born with his talent lol
How is that relevant? I don't even think they had a chance when they had played zero games.   Also the entire subreddit has been talking about how Kevin Durant ruined basketball and that the Warriors are going to easily walk their way to another championship and that there's no reason to play because they're already going to win.  Some of those talking points are threads on the front page right now. And we're just going to forget about all of it?
"Why would he got anywhere *but* GS? He'd make the same money everywhere, but if he went anywhere by GS he would have been in the same situation as OKC where he was the number one option and could be exposed as someone that couldn't elevate his team and couldn't beat the top talent. OKC was a better team than anyone he could have signed with besides the Cavs and GS. Why would he put himself in a situation where he would continue to be exposed as a loser?  Going to GS meant he had no pressure to be the number one option because he would be splitting touches with the best offense in the league. He had no pressure about bringing home a ring because the Warriors were a few bad breaks from bringing home a second championship without him. All he had to do to be successful on the Warriors was play as well as Harrison Barnes.   Kevin Durant is a coward and desperately needs validation. Knowing that, there was never anywhere for him to go but GS."
"It is pretty easy actually.  - Houston - James Harden/Chris Paul - Cavs - LeBron/Kevin Love - Warriors - Curry/Durant/Klay/Draymond - Celtics - ...Coach Stevens  This team has no real stars right now. So when you are talking about them, it is very easy to look at the Coach as the reason why they are having success right now. If Kyrie was playing, everyone would be talking about Kyrie. "
"2-2 Ties in both Conference Finals Series, now this is what I'm talking about, with being said I still think what Kevin Durant committed was an unforgivable sin. "
Kevin Durant burned our crops and poisoned our water supply. 
You know what I hate the most about Kevin Durant. That podcast he was talking about how he is just at the top of his professional career just like any other person at the top of their profession. It sounded like he was humbled. But then he just calls a bunch of journalist blog bois because he doesn’t understand what TS% is or eFG%. 
Kevin Durant is ruining the nba 
The shooting was SO BAD in the fourth quarter for GSW.   Stephen Curry: 1-8  Kevin Durant: 1-5  KD had TWO SHOTS that didn't draw iron! I never thought I'd see that.

Kevin Durant
"&gt;Read the quote below before downvoting. He didn’t take or want a time out until Klay got trapped. He didn’t even try to get a TO- he knew he wouldn’t be seen at the end of the court. Dray tried to get a TO at that point but it didn’t get noticed.  Then I suggest you read what the OP was saying.   &gt;The TNT announcers were right to suggest Kerr should have let the team ""play it out"" off the inbound to possibly catch the Rockets off guard. But they did not. Kevin Durant looked a little out of control driving and then kicked it to Klay Thompson in a bad position, with a good defender on him. Timeout. Timeout! Nope."
"One dude is basically getting 2/3 his buckets from either passes from teammates or 1 on 1 drives opened up by all time great spacing from teammates, the other has been putting up the same type of numbers for years without another playmaker and driving into multiple defenders in the paint.  One dude struggled to avg anything close to 10 assists passing to all world teammates while the other set the all time record for points created per game.  One guy is constantly getting embarrassed on defense while the other is stepping up and making crucial plays.  One guy has klay thompson, kevin durant, and draymond green, and is tied in essentially the finals versus the guy who has chris paul, clint capela, and eric gordon.  No, it’s not really close.  Steph was better in 2016 hands down, I’ll readily acknowledge that. 2015, 2017, 2018 all go to harden."
"Cause it's a media award that doesn't mean much of anything. Chris Paul is best player in the series, no one on Golden State can match his heart or grit that he play with. Dude gives 110% every time he steps on the court. Meanwhile Kevin Durant signs with the team that beat him in a 7 game series the season prior in the western conference finals, lol. "
"Lol just because you read and repeat this shit on reddit doesn't make it true. He is in no way better than Kevin Durant, there is just no argument for it at all. He also don't do anything to separate himself from the players in the tier below Lebron/KD. And I haven't seen any single reason this season or these playoffs to rank him ahead of James Harden. "
[Yep ](https://nypost.com/2018/05/17/draymond-greens-mom-throws-the-blame-on-kevin-durant/ )
"Now, now.  Let's not denigrate women by using language associating them with Kevin Durant."
"Nah, I had 0 complaints back in 2015. Well deserved title. Choked in 2016. Added Kevin Durant to get over the hump in 2017 = doesn't count like other rings do."
"People just want to have hope that the eastern team to come out won't get mauled by the western team to make it out. Everyone knows that a healthy warriors team murders this years iteration of the Cavs, but hey the rockets are new and have a shot to come out of the west so people tell themselves that they aren't actually a 67 win team and don't have the best offense in the league so maybe the Cavs could win it. The rockets realistically are heavy favorites but hope clouds that.. hope doesn't cloud the fact that a 4th go at Warriors vs. Cavs is predetermined since we have seen it before lol  I actually do honestly believe that the Cavs have a better chance vs the rockets vs the warriors on matchups but really not that much better tbh. Warriors defense clamps all stars and the fact that the rockets can make consistent offensive runs against them blows my mind ive not really ever seen a team do this to their defense besides pre- Kevin Durant days. Two amazing teams that are title caliber are having a fucking war in the west right now.. "
They didn't but that would probably have been the first 6 game series of the Kevin Durant era *vomits in mouth
"Isn't the ""Kevin Durant era"" just one and a half play-offs so far? "
"Oh yeah and the owners. So the top NBA executive(s), star players and owners and money keeps everyone in line. Which makes me think that an NBA contract would work like a music industry contract and you get paid for results? But.... That scenario wouldn't really be the worst, except for the rigged ref part bc think of it like this... Steph on paper and in the press got what 5yr/201m? But what if in that contract it says he has to win the 2018 wcf in 7 games (i mean more likely this part is in flux depending upon what storylines are interesting) and only Kevin Durant knows this bc he's under the same contract but Klay doesn't know and Capella doesn't know etc so Curry still has to will his team to victory (and defeat) so he can fulfill the contract and get all the 40m for that year... A game within a game scenario wouldn't be so bad... for posterity I mean. But money is money and money-people are pure shit so whatever is happening I'm sure we're getting the lamest version like it's rigged and everyone who stands to profit is in on it."
"I mean really, the only people who would need to be involved would be Adam silver and the most influential players, Curry Durant, harden paul, the ones who will have the ball during deciding moments. The refs could be in on it for extra insurance. Not sure why the announcers would need to know anything but maybe since there are so many former star players who may have been in on the same kind of hushed arrangement. It would be awful to find out for sure that the NBA is rigged but not too shocking when you look at the career earnings list. What else could someone like Kevin Garnett have done to make the amount of money he made?"
Yet he's the reason why we lost apparently. Big fat no. Let's hope Kevin Durant doesn't isolate every possession and shoot us out of the game in game 5.
"That was a great game, but that's the only one I can remember. Kevin Durant has no Boston game 6, or Detroit game 5. He doesn't have a single playoff game where he faced serious adversity and came up with the W for his team. Not one. In the very next series he lost on his home court to a Spurs team that didn't even have Tony Parker in the second half of game 6.  Then in 2016 he basically choked away a 3\-1 series lead. And let's be honest he was horribly inconsistent in that Golden State series. 30\-8\-3 on 54 TS&amp;#37; and he had more turnovers than assists."
"I would put all these players over him in no particular order, maybe could even think of a few more.  LeBron James  Michael Jordan  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Larry Bird  Magic Johnson  Tim Duncan  Hakeem Olajuwon  Shaquille O’Neal  Wilt Chamberlain  Bill Russell  Kobe Bryant  Oscar Robertson  Jerry West  Karl Malone  Julius Erving  Moses Malone  Kevin Garnett  Dirk Nowitzki  David Robinson  Dwyane Wade  Kevin Durant  Isiah Thomas"
Fuck Kevin Durant for killing the NBA
"Guys settle down, he is/was/has been recently hurt, this means you need to apply double standards to this shot game. In addition think of one you can use for Kevin Durant, I mean SNEKD! SAD!"
"Seriously. This is Golden State, They have Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant. You want to give them a 3 to win? "
"Kevin Durant shrinks when his team isn't winning. One of the best offensive players ever, and easily the best on the Warriors at getting his own shot, doesn't take that shot. That's bad, and it's games like this, why he will never be treated as a great despite the likelihood of him winning 3 or 4 rings in his career. "
"If Kevin Durant slept with Ayesha Curry, what would the ramifications be?  I see this going one of two ways. Let's work through both scenarios.  First, Steph comes home from a long trip to the local Foot Locker. He's greeted to the sight of an elongated, legless, carnivorous reptile plowing his wife in the pastry maker. That's when he realizes, just as the prophecies foretold, Stephen Curry is a cuckold prince. He grabs his pacifier, curls up into a ball, and weeps. At that moment, Lebron James enters the Curry household, and then begins to spoon his son to sleep. The rest of the NBA is none the wiser.  In the second scenario, Stooph does not come home that night. When he next sees Ayesha, she tells him everything. Steph arrives at practice early the next day. When he enters the locker room, its just him and the servant.  ""You been suckin' them toes, boy?"" Stooph says.  The servant approaches. They kiss cheeks.  KD enters Bob Myers office.  He shouts, ""Myuhhh wife!"" while dressed as a crude recreation of Sacha Baron Cohen's character Borat, from the surprise 2006 blockbuster, Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.  Robert knows what he must do. He gets on the phone, and within moments, Otto Porter, Tomas Satoranksy, and a 2018 WAS 1st round pick are headed to the Bay. The return was less than satisfactory, for Kevin had announced (via his 7 Twitter accounts) that he was retiring at the end of the 2017-18 season, so that he could return to his roots, either on ground of some sort of forest or jungle, or inside of a glass box in a invariably edgy 14 year old boys room.  Ron Wallsley and Bradley Bealtrix Lestrange arrive at the airport to pick up their newest teammate/pet Kevin Durantbledore. They touch wands and restore peace within the fractured NBA.  Stooph and Ayesha stay together in this timeline."
They would've been better off if he just took the elbow jumper. It's Kevin fucking Durant he shoots like 60% from there lmao.
1.	LeBron James 2.	Kevin Durant 3.	Steph Curry 4.	Kawhi Leonard 5.	Anthony Davis 6.	James Harden 7.	Giannis Antetokounmpo 8.	Russell Westbrook 9.	Chris Paul 10. Irving/Lillard/DMC/Embiid? 
And this time they even added Kevin Durant so what could possibly be the excuse
it's a lot better imo. We overcame a 12 point deficit TWICE on the road against the freaking kevin durant golden state warriors.  
"James Harden yelled, “There you go!” Eric Gordon gave a look of pleasant surprise. Chris Paul belted, “Bite me.” And before Stephen Curry hit the locker room door, ex-OKC star Kevin Durant hugged him &amp; said, “I can’t win with these cats.”"
"If they theoretically blew it up but didn't actually blow it up that'd be a sweet deal for them.   ""The Warriors have traded a theoretical Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry to the Suns for ten 1st round picks."""
&gt; Does Kevin Durant deserve criticism  Yes
"2 games ago: DURANT HAS 1 ASSIST, HE IS NOT PASSING THE BALL, WARRIORS OFFENSE IS ABOUT MOVING THE BALL, HE IS ISOING TOO MUCH   NOW:  Does Kevin Durant deserve criticism for passing out the ball down 2 with 6 seconds left?    LOL  "
Does Kevin Durant deserve criticism for joining a 73 win team?
Game 5 Klay Thompson Detail Game 6 Draymond Green Detail Game 7 Kevin Durant detail. He only needs to hit .6666 he got this. Save us Kobe. 
the consensus idea is if your guarded by the small guy take the shot because you know he cant block it smaller guys actually can get to spots faster and if you run him over and hes on that spot on the floor first thats a charge. Then again your Kevin Durant put him in the post off of that.
"In the 2016 NBA Finals the 73-9 Golden State Warriors blew a 3-1 lead to the Cleveland Cavs. In response to losing, Draymond Green called former MVP and top 5 player in the NBA Kevin Snake Durant crying and begging him to join the 73-9 Golden State Warriors.

Kevin Durant not missing a free throw all playoffs is one of the more casually elite stats I've seen in a while. Damn.
KEVIN DURANT COMING TO ROCKETS NEXT SEASON CONFIRMED
"Clearly you did not, it took a Draymond suspension, an ejection of Curry, 40+ games from LeBron AND Kyrie, no Kevin Durant, a 50%+ from three JR, and more. Aggressiveness? No bro, it takes LeBron James and all that I just listed to beat the warriors."
"""fuck you im kevin durant"""
"Kevin Durant has been off tonight, usually he has at least 1 rip through foul per quarter which puts his team into the bonus much quicker. He hasn't been on tonight"
I honestly feel bad for the people who hate Kevin Durant so much that they can't enjoy watching one of the greatest basketball teams of all time led by the single greatest shooter of all time paired up with one of the most gifted total basketball players of all time and the most loveable sidekick shooter of all time. Shit must be sad. 
He's talking about Kevin Durant and that has everything to do with the cap spike. 
"Steve Kerr yelled, “There you go!” Kevin Durant gave a pleasant look of surprise. Klay Thompson belted, “We’re on a [expletive] run now!” And Before Steph Curry hit the bench, ex-NBA star Reggie Miller hugged him &amp; said, “The score looks so different now!”"
"Kevin ""why did you let me do this to my life"" Durant"
"&gt; If he pulls up for a deep 3, that's him saying, ""All right, I'm trying to get this s--- over with."" He's trying to knock you out. He's trying to end you. That's what killers do.

I would like to express my displeasure in the previous actions of Kevin Durant
Kevin durant still needs a brush
Your team has fucking Kevin Durant on it. Not to mention Draymond Green. You're the loser here.
Give us Kevin durant. 
Kevin Durant still hasn’t won a championship 
why is Kevin Durant on the same as Steph Curry

"Kevin Durant yelled, “Rest in peace!” Klay Thompson gave a look of massive shock. Stephen Curry belted, “We got an [expletive] funeral now.” And before Draymond Green hit his coffin, ex-Thunder star James Harden hugged him &amp; said, “And 1.”"
"Yes, then you added Kevin Durant. Maybe without him you guys would get pushed again, but with him on your team there's simply no competition. Your team is the best ever assembled, just be happy with that lol"
Kevin Durant that spindly spider you can't even stop that
FUCK  KEVIN  DURANT
"Your question asks when he was the best. I would posit the definition of best as 'the ability to go beyond everyone else.' (the 'VORP' argument if you will) Not exactly controversial, but others will say that team accomplishments/total wins etc. outweight this.   With that in mind, some people will argue that it's ""after Kobe won his rings"" or something like that. But the moment LeBron james went for 25 straight points against the Detroit Pistons in game 5, he reached a peak where no one else in the league could reach. To this day, that is my favorite LeBron game. I am not a LeBronophile (or at least wasn't back then). But when we saw that game, we knew that he had finally arrived and was not going to take no for an answer. And since that day in 2007 to now, I have not seen a player have as dominant of  runs as LeBron in any number of games/series.   Just off of the top of my head, his first runs against the Celtics in the playoffs-- he was clearly the best player. It's just that his 2nd best player was either Boobie Gibson or Illgauskas. The 2009 playoffs, the guy gets beaten by the Magic when he's averaging some 35 ppg. He only lost because he couldn't fight through double and triple teams-- and worse, when he drew that much attention, his team wouldn't make the wide open 3.  I would argue that once LeBron went to Miami, and specifically the 2012 season, he jumped up to an even higher peak. THis was when the only people that could objectively be compared to LeBron James were Kareem, Michael, Magic, Russell, and Chamberlain.   Anyway, that day in 2007 was the day LeBron became the best player in the league-- and even though he didn't win rings or win as much as some of the other players who got recognition during that time, if you ask any GM from 2007 to now if there was a player they would take over LeBron James 99% of the GMs (basically not a Lakers GM) would take LeBron over anyone else during that time period. I might even go further and say that there probably has not been a single post seasongame/season by any player not named LeBron on any team in that timespan that compares to what he did in 2007. No Steph Curry game. (Honestly, Klay against the Thunder has a better argument than Steph). No Kevin Durant game. No James Harden game. No Kobe game. No Tim Duncan game. None of them could compare in magnitude to what LeBron did in 2007."

Warriors need to realise Kevin Durant isn't the only player on their team. Too much isolation.
"they went on a 9-0 run to get it down to 12 and then the game got out of reach. He was trying during that run.   Everyone is saying Bron had a subpar game for his standards. It was also probably Lue's worst game of the playoffs, the lineups made no sense. The cav's don't have a chance if Hill and JR play like that plain and simple but I don't really see people making excuses. It's more just understandable that he is tired and if this is considered on of his worst game's of the playoffs than he is clearly the best in the league. Kevin Durant didn't score the last 7 and a half minutes of game 4 and nobody says shit. "
KEvin Durant on pace for 83 points.
First bucket for Kevin Durant?   Really Marv? Really? 
“And that’s the first bucket... for Kevin Durant” Marv he just scored on the last possession
Ughhhh Eff Kevin Durant

"Great scene in Rockets locker room. James Harden was FaceTiming his daughter, Kevin Durant. She asked to see CP3. Someone brought the phone over to CP3 and she said “There you go! ” CP3 responded, “We got a fucking squad now.”"
"Stephen Curry yelled, “There you go!” Steve Kerr gave a look of pleasant surprise. Draymond Green belted, “We got 4 fucking all stars now.” And before Klay Thompson hit the locker room door, ex-OKC star Kevin Durant hugged him &amp; said, “We ruined the NBA.”"
"whoa whoa back up. I definitely never compared Tito to Kyrie. I also don't take comparing Tatum to Hayward casually. Hayward is a borderline all-star. Tatum is pretty clearly well on his way to a whole other level. There have only been a handful of rookies in the modern era like him. We're going to look back on this like comparing rookie Kevin Durant to Caron Butler.  Tatum isn't yet as good as Hayward was last year, but I think I might give you even odds that Tatum gets there before Hayward gets back to there (if Hayward ever gets back to there)."
"yeah, fair point. And in looking around at others opinions I realized that The Greek Freak was better in every statistical category than Kevin Durant but still is on the second team. Man, my eye test is off this year. "
"Kevin Durant made the All-NBA First team over Giannis. Here's how they matched up: Points - Giannis Rebounds - Giannis Assists - Durant Steals - Giannis Blocks - Durant FG % - Giannis PER - Giannis WS - Giannis GP - Giannis # of All-Star teammates: Durant - 3, Giannis - 0."
"&gt; I think KD and Giannis are really close  ......nnnaaaaahhhhh  KD is already established as an NBA champion, MVP, and most importantly, a clutch scorer. Sure, in theory, none of these things should influence his rankings this season, but they definitely create subconscious biases that impact how the media will vote. I don't think KD and Giannis would be very close. I'm interested to see which one of us will be proven right when vote counts are released   EDIT: Votes were already released. Kind of hard to tell whether or not you define this as ""close"" so interpret as you will:  All-NBA Voting *excluding guards*:  LeBron James 100 1st team votes, 500 total points  Anthony Davis  96 1st, 4 second, 492 total points  Kevin Durant  63 1st, 37 2nd, 426 total points  Giannis Antetokounmpo 28 1st, 71 2nd, 1 3rd, 354 total points   LaMarcus Aldridge 2 1st, 68 2nd, 22 3rd, 236 total points"
Ah. Yeah the doncic hype is pretty out of control. Saying he is not on the same level as LeBron and Kevin Durant is getting me downvotes somehow. This sub man.
"KD and Curry wont get another MVP while they are on the same team unless they somehow average 50 points, or one of them is injured for a season. They will always take votes from eachother, and I can always see their accomplishments downplayed a bit when compared to other players. Something like ""wow they are great, but it must be a bit easier when the team has to also somehow guard Kevin Durant"", or ""yeah they are great but they aren't carrying their team in the way someone like Lebron, Westbrook, or Harden does"".

"Let's establish off the jump that the Celtics are incredibly coached, they know their roles and rotations, everyone taller than Terry Rozier has no mental issues with matching up with Lebron, regardless if he dominates or not. There's no fear, there's nothing to lose on their side, they aren't supposed to be there, so they can play free and Marcus Smart can knock down energy threes early in the shot clock, and Jaylen Brown can drive to the rim in transition with no trailing help and feel confident about finishing in traffic.   With that being said...It's incredibly disappointing as an NBA fan, as a basketball fan, to see the position the Cavaliers players have put themselves in by not taking responsibility in deference to Lebron. This team is full of #1-#3 options when they played for their respective squads, and now they can't make layups, defend in transition (Rozier to Horford oop) or one of the simplest things wing players should be able to do, create their own shots. No offball screens except for the pindown Korver play, no backdoor cuts on the road, no crashing the offensive boards! Which you can say isn't necessary due to the athleticism of the NBA, relatively low percentage chance of securing the board, etc. So then where's the hustle of getting back down the floor, and picking up guys as they cross halfcourt. From guys who are trained communicators like George Hill not leading his unit, to Rodney Hood being a zero, JR Smith being a zero...  It's like this entire team bought into the Lebron Coast phenomenon. Lebron's got us, he's capable of so many moments of individual brilliance. And he's saved their asses time and time again. But nobody seems to be taking any of the responsibility for a loss. In Miami and with Kyrie, the big 3 and Kyrie shouldered responsibility for wins and losses there. Why isn't Jeff Green talking about how he should look to exploit his matchups more in the low post, on a night where your shot isn't falling, where are the drives to the rim and quick dumpoffs to an athletic big man like Nance who can create contact. Why isn't George Hill calling plays instead of iso'ing like lebron in traffic. They're trying to play like the rockets with none of the three point shooting, ball movement, hustle, or team spirit. The Cavs deserve to lose this series, and Kevin Durant should go in the HoF for breaking the game of basketball. Let's not even go into the contract situation Lebron has left the Cavs in for a guy that scored one point in the ECF. No putbacks, no roll oops, can't create his own shot, can't play off the crowd on the road, can't dribble or space the floor or knock down 18 footers, can't switch onto smaller guards consistently. What is tristan thompson for? And Jeff Green played for Brad Stevens! Where's his insight, his understanding of Stevens Coaching method? Where's Lue's let Brown and Tatum get theirs, but shut the role players down? This game was for the taking, if just one role player doesn't do their job to a t. And zero cav's stepped up and said,"" I want that responsibility."" Pathetic."

"Text below in case you are having problems with the WSJ paywall, though my link should have cheated that.  _________  Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, doesn’t own a car.  He realized several years ago there was a smarter way for him to move from one place to another than the way he’d always done it. And that’s when he decided to sell his Lexus SUV. He stopped driving. He started taking Uber everywhere.  It might sound almost unfathomably odd for someone who runs a professional sports team in a city known for sprawl to get rid of his car because he’d rather commute by climbing into a stranger’s car, but only if that someone were anyone other than Daryl Morey. He applied the same empirical rigor to the question of how he should get to work as he did the question of how the Rockets could improve their chances of winning the NBA title. Morey calculated that it would be cheaper, a better use of his time and safer for everyone involved if he were in the back seat.  That was all the rationale he needed to go carless. He’s so pleased with his decision almost three years later that he says he’ll never have a car in Houston again.  “There’s a whole bunch of ways I can ruin my life right now,” Morey said. “One of them could be that I do something stupid driving and hurt myself or hurt someone else. So why even have that risk?”  The way he thought about his method of transportation happens to be a surprisingly useful way of understanding how the Rockets are now tied with the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals. Morey looked at the same facts as everyone else before this season—that any NBA team with Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant was probably going to win the championship—and then he thought differently than anyone else.  The Rockets weren’t content to wait out the Warriors. They went after them instead. Morey understood that he had to be aggressive, extreme and contrarian to beat a team that may turn out to be unbeatable.  Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey understood that he had to be aggressive, extreme and contrarian to beat the Warriors. Photo: Bill Baptist/NBAE/Getty Images  They were willing to try anything. They defied conventional wisdom when they traded for Chris Paul even though they already had James Harden. They had the audacity to shoot more 3-pointers than 2-pointers. They overhauled their defense by signing complementary role players who could be especially useful in a series against the Warriors. They were coached by Mike D’Antoni, whose name has become synonymous with playing fast, and they played slow. They isolated more than any team in the NBA, and because they had Harden, they averaged more points on their isolation possessions than any team in the NBA.  But all that zigging when the rest of the league zagged only gave the Rockets slightly better odds against the Warriors. They were a really good team, possibly a great team, with the burden of playing one of the greatest teams in the history of basketball. The Rockets were unabashed about their obsession with the Warriors because they had to be.  They needed to chase every little edge they could get. They also needed to get lucky. And then maybe—maybe—they would have a shot to beat Golden State.  That’s what they have now: a shot.  The Rockets saved their season in Game 4 by winning exactly the kind of game they were built to win. Morey’s grand plan might actually work. The series is 2-2 heading into Game 5 on Thursday night, and it has become clear the Rockets are the only team capable of seriously pushing the Warriors this season. They are the last defense against the Golden State dynasty. And they’re in this position in no small part because they were constructed by the type of person who thinks it’s reasonable to live in Houston without a car.  Morey says his approach to driving was like his approach to investing and, for that matter, building an NBA roster. He tried to strike the right balance of risk and return.  Morey treated the rules of the road as mere suggestions. He was not a fan of red lights, and he found red lights for left-hand turns so objectionable that he sometimes ignored them.  “I skirt the speed-safety line,” he said. “I go really, really fast, but I’m super safe. I haven’t had an accident since I was 20.”  “You haven’t had an accident in three years,” said his wife, Ellen, who still owns a car, “because you haven’t driven.”  The streets of Houston are safer now that he’s no longer behind the wheel. He types away on his BlackBerry—yes, his BlackBerry—and works on the way to work. He can be productive even when he’s in the car. And he never has to worry about parking.  Morey understands that it might be necessary for his family to own a car. He doesn’t necessarily endorse it. “It’s...fine,” he said.  But not everyone understands his logic for not having a car. Morey recently explained to a colleague that he was trying to optimize his life around only things that were important to him. That person asked: “Are you Buddhist?”  The other explanation for why he Ubers everywhere is that Morey actually likes meeting the people who drive him around Houston. He talks to anyone who talks to him. When one driver told him that he was a musician, Morey indulged him and listened to his songs. “They were pretty good, I thought,” he said. The driver then told him that he personally delivers his CDs and even claimed to have made one delivery to New Zealand. “I sorta, maybe believed him,” Morey said, “although I don’t know why.”  He’s been in so many Ubers by now that he’s developed opinions about routing algorithms. He thinks about beating Houston traffic the same way he thinks about beating the Warriors. It may not be possible, but all he can do is bend the odds in his favor. He prefers that his drivers use Waze. Except if he’s really in a hurry. In which case he checks Waze and Google Maps to compare his options.  “I’ll let them vote on the route,” Morey said. “And then I’ll use my own judgment.”"
"Kevin Durant joined a team where he only had to be as good as harrison barmes to get a ring or be on the greatest team, record-wise, of all time."
"I mean, you could make the same argument that if Kyrie and/or Love hadn't been injured in their first matchup back in 2015, Cavs would have won that matchup. Lebron alone brought them 2 games, and just didnt have any relief after he got matched up with Iguodala, relief that one of the other two could've easily provided.  Kevin Durant most definitely fucked things up in the sense that a healthy warriors team is basically unstoppable, just because of the sheer amount of solid options they have."

"As a Warriors fan, I'm not sure that Boston with Kyrie and Gordon would have trouble scoring the ball. Everyone on Boston is a 3 point threat and while Kevin Durant and Curry would be the best 2 players on the floor, Kyrie is probably 3rd (though I love Klay) and Jayson and Jaylen are both potentially going to be top 10 players in the league at some point.   The way they play D and share the ball is going to make a series where everyone is healthy on both sides, interesting. I'm still taking Golden State in 7, but I do think Boston would keep it competitive and as the Warriors slow down, Boston could easily steal a series. "
"Yeah it's hard to go against Nash because the dude was just so damn efficient and a genius on the court, but his lack of defense is hard to look past. Both were incredible in their primes, but CP3's defense gives him the edge. I'll give Nash the edge on offense although it is a toss-up, but we're comparing a guy who has been put on Kevin Durant during stretches in playoff games multiple times in his career to a guy who made all opposing point guards look like all stars.

Fucking Kevin Durant isn't enough?
Their opponent also didn’t have Kevin Durant in 2015 
I'm sure Kevin Durant is 6'9 too
*Kevin Durant. Dude has the ball in his hand with 8 seconds to go and he gives it up to Klay. He should have just taken the first good shot he had considering the dude that was on him was 6'6'
"Why would Kevin Durant, one of the greatest scorers in the history of the game and #2 player in the league according to a certain guy, be looking to pass the buck to someone else? He's averaging 35 points a game...2.5 assists a game. Really?"
Cause Kevin Durant. People used to like Steph Curry 
" Bringing up assist ? All the play making is done by harden and Cp3. Golden State it's a group effort (except for when Kevin Durant doesn't feel like it).  Steph is always part of the reason GSW performing well even on off-nights, this guy runs every route out there which disrupts defense. Stats don't show that. He leads the league in distance traveled for a reason.   If you show me stats, i might take Wilt over Bill Russell. History would laugh at me.  I will not stand by these Steph Curry witch-hunts "
'Kevin Durant is the best scorer in the nba'
Well more specifically Kevin Durant did.  I don't think the warriors did anything wrong
We all know Kevin Durant will take those puppies and kittens to a kill shelter when the game is over. Can’t win with these cats and dogs 
"Rondo hasn't been able to play consistent hard defense since he helled his arm up in the playoffs. He really only can turn it on at moments so not that surprised about it really. Boogie is also a poor defender tbh, it really doesn't  make much sense defensively for that team with their twin towers. Davis can switch everything but is for sure best playing as the paint protector, but since boogie can't switch he has to play outside of his comfort zone. Cousins has to be put into the paint so he isn't exploited as much by faster players and he still isn't a great rim protector but he is better at it than anything else on d besides steals. E'twaun is not good at d at all, he has never been a positive defender, even when playing in position. Now he is playing out of position in a constant mismatch against bigger players who are just as fast and mobile as him, he is 6'4"" sub 200 and guarding players like Kevin Durant. So there are 3 turn styles who need constant help and 2 all nba level defenders clogging their holes."

"The Rockets have a chance to beat the team the Thunder lost to, but now that team also has Kevin fucking Durant. The Rockets are an absurdly good team and everybody has slept on them this entire season due to the warriors.   Rockets easily beat the thunder. You're subbing out steph for Russ, klay for dion waiters, and now Clint Capela has a big man to match up with (Adams)"
"In 2016, the Cavs were a much better team. Also, in 2016 the Golden State warriors didn't have Kevin Durant. Now they do. They have shown repeatedly that they are the best team in the league, and the rockets have balled out against them. Though he will try, LBJ cannot win the finals by himself. The warriors, provided they advance, will demolish the Cavs. The rockets, if they advance, but CP3 stays hurt, could have trouble against the Cavs, as they only really have Harden without Chris Paul.  Don't act like 2016 is even remotely the same. Look at this warriors team. They're a lot better now."
I agree the threads are shit. But don't you not want them to win? Part of me feels like they're the villains in a movie that are threatening to destroy the whole league. If they lose there's at least a chance of disbandment. Last year's finals was one of the worst finals series I've watched since 09 or 07. It made me sit back and think... Oh yeah. They were the best team in the league and then added Kevin Durant.... What did I expect from this? 
"Well there's really just not much you can go on outside of slowing down every individual play of a game and directly looking at missed calls.  I think your point comparing AD/KD is fair, but we know KD as someone who will get a lot more leniency from the refs, where as AD is someone who will take a beating and not necessarily be rewarded for it. Both Harden and KD are players who had rules changes instituted to stop them from getting so many ""ghost"" calls, yet we still see them getting that benefit of the doubt pretty often.  &gt;I find most of the numbers around FTs hard to parse because it also doesn't take into account intentional fouls and end of game fouls to get the ball back.  I agree here as well. My only major point in my post was to say that if Eric Gordon ""gets zero calls"" then there are quite a few other players who are also getting zero calls. Obviously it's meant to be hyperbolic, but if your name isn't James Harden or Kevin Durant in this series, you probably aren't getting much help from the refs.  &gt;Even drives/game isn't that strong an indicator  This is true, that's why the only way I can think to attempt to break it down in just advanced stats is by how often they are actually shooting FT's versus how many FG's they actually attempt.  While it may not be the *strongest* correlation, it does show that the guy does in fact get calls. I just have/had a really hard time saying that ""x"" player gets screwed by the refs more than everybody else, if they have are regularly getting calls. This whole thread just seemed to be a reaction to a couple missed calls more-so than the series/playoffs as a whole, which is why I made that original post of a couple lines.  My attempt was not to say that there is a perfect way to analyze or deduce whether or not he gets all of the calls he deserves, more to say/show that he does in fact get calls. Whether or not they missed a couple on him doesn't mean he gets **no** calls, it just means that they missed a couple calls on him."
The NBA is still pretty uncompetitive thanks to the Kevin Durant. 
"Kevin Durant certainly doesn’t make the team worse. However, I think the warriors are way more entertaining to watch when it’s just curry and Klay jacking shots"
"Kevin has always tried to one up Kobe. Add 1 to 2 and you get 3, add 1 to 4 and you get 5. 24 =&gt; 35. The immature fool Kevin durant disrespects Kobe every time he wears his jersey and it's been right in front of us this whole time "
"They are not lucky, they have the best player in the NBA who puts them on their back and carries them. His name? Kevin Durant. He is 3 best player of all time."
"But we're talking about **guarding a player**. And yes, HEIGHT MATTERS. Durant has mastered a jumper that is hardly a step back. He simply inches backward and shoots directly over whichever shorter forward forced to guard him \(because no center can defend his speed, and no guard has a chance at contesting his shot\). I only used max sprinting speed to prove a point \- Kevin Durant is nearly as fast as Lebron. I don't argue Durant is faster in a race. I argue that his longer strides allow for a similar speed in moving from point A to B. Less forceful, because Lebron is built like a truck, but still covering equivalent distance.   I used career totals, not season totals. This season presented outliers for both players that skew their current season numbers: Lebron lacks any surrounding talent \(huge fan of Kevin Love, but Tyronn Lue simply cannot utilize him properly\), and Durant playing with the Warriors minimizes his responsibilities, especially those that are measured in box score \(hardest road, indeed\). This is why I used career totals \- to form a baseline more closely related to overall output.   \(Although I don't know how to create the tables, which I do like. If you could message me on how to do that, would be much appreciated\).   You're right \- Lebron is the best athlete in the game and the best transition player. Maybe both of all time. But again, you aren't answering the question: ""**hardest to guard**"". Transition defense is certainly a factor of defending a player, but is not truly in spirit of the question. The question clearly implied defending in the traditional sense; a man to man defensive assignment. Lebron is the best transition player because of his passing, one of the greatest passers of all time. On fast breaks, he will either score, get to the line, or more importantly, always find the open man. But that is not the question. No one draws the defensive assignment to guard Lebron on fast breaks. That is why they are transition buckets. Because the defense is not set. Haphazard, scrambling, out of order. Transition buckets are always to the favor of the offensive team.   One on one, in defensive position \(assuming you are the average NBA player, let's say anywhere between 6'4 and 6'10\), who would be hardest to guard? No possible answer but Kevin Durant, who creates a mismatch at every single position unlike any we have ever seen, but for Magic Johnson and Lebron, who are both primarily playmakers, rather than pure scorers. "
"Kevin Durant, second best player in the league, is better than Russell Westbrook. Hot take here."
Soft minded Kevin Durant is not ahead of Larry Fucking Bird. 
Kevin of Durant
Durant being taller is not rational reasoning to infer he is faster. I can't believe you are seriously trying to argue Durant is faster than Lebron that's ludicrous. Lebron is the premier transition player in the game. He is the best athlete in the game. Lebron is faster than Durant you would get laughed at anywhere arguing otherwise.  &gt;Second: Completely 100% wrong.

Kevin Durant does not have a reliable eurostep that is true. That's why the best way to defend him is to give him driving lanes to bait him so he drives then cut him off and he'll shoot that off one foot awkward fading floater rather than a set jumpshot or a layup.
