"I  have attended almost every home Blazer game in the Dame era. He has his moments, but I have almost never seen him wreck a game like Russell Westbrook."
Cuz Russell Westbrook the GOAT bitch
"Warriors entire bench for Russell Westbrook, who says no?"
The following list is **my opinion**. I have arguments for every ''controversial'' pick (Westbrook over Curry and Harden in particular).  1) LeBron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Russell Westbrook  4) Stephen Curry  5) James Harden  6) Anthony Davis  7) Giannis Antetokounmpo  8) Kawhi Leonard (despite being injured for almost the whole season)  9) DeMarcus Cousins  10) Jimmy Butler  11) Chris Paul  12) **Kyrie Irving**  13) Paul George  14) DeMar DeRozan  15) John Wall  16) Damian Lillard  17) Karl Anthony Towns  18) Joel Embiid  19) LaMarcus Aldridge  20) Kristaps Porzingis

Russell Westbrook should suddenly stop shooting 3s.
Yeah that scrub who's not good enough like reigning MVP Russell Westbrook. 
"Methodology explained here - https://fansided.com/2017/09/20/kawhi-leonard-mvp-prediction-2017-18-season/  [The formula used](https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-18-at-3.52.12-PM.jpg&amp;w=1712) + [Constants](https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-18-at-3.53.14-PM.jpg&amp;c=sc&amp;w=205&amp;h=211)  &gt;This equation misses on players who win MVP for narrative driven reasons more than on-court reasons, like Derrick Rose in 2011 or Allen Iverson in 2001. Both of those players were very good the year they won MVP, but may not have carried their teams in the traditional sense compared to other MVPs.  &gt;This methodology has been able to correctly predict 25 of the last 38 MVPs, including the 2016-17 MVP Russell Westbrook.  &gt;A 66.0 percent hit rate is not perfect but does a good job at identifying at the very least who the right candidates are. Of the last 38 MVPs, 34 have received one of the top three MVPScores in the season they won. In fact, only two of the last 38 MVPs did not rate as the top-5 most likely winners by this metric and both times it was the same player: Steve Nash, who came in eighth by this metric for his 2004-05 MVP and ninth for his 2005-06 MVP.  (this was posted before tonights games but it wouldn't have changed much)"
"The message is clear and the voices unanimous. No longer shall we be shackled by the preconceived notions that there exists more than one player in the NBA better than James Harden. No longer shall we adhere to the outdated cries of fans worldwide screaming for justification of former MVPs. No longer shall we bar James Harden from the top two players in the NBA. Flopper. Choker. Slut. All of the insults James Harden has endured, they're toppling before our very eyes. He's getting to the rim on instinct. Facilitating remarkable offensive comebacks. Practicing abstinence. It's undeniably remarkable, as evidenced by both our eyes and statistics alike. He's a close second in PER at 31.35. Virtually tied for second with EWA of 8.7 (8.8 Giannis, 10.5 LeBron). Operating at the highest PTS/48 out of any qualified player. He retains jaw-dropping efficiency while operating at the highest USG% in the NBA this year- a full percentage point ahead of Russell Westbrook. Right now, LeBron James and James Harden are in a league of their own. It's irrefutable. Indisputable. Now that we have that established, let's explore how the rise of James Harden occurred. October 27, 2012. Rain trickles down the glass slopes of Harden's mansion. Perhaps it's a symbol of his pain- they are window panes, after all- or perhaps it's just precipitation. Irrelevant. James Harden scrolls through his phone, reading analytical pieces regarding his departure to the Houston Rockets. A single tear falls in unison with the pouring rain. The tear trickles down his cheek, gently running over his chocolate skin with the benevolent care of the hottest-chested nurse. It smoothly pours into Harden's world-beating beard, renowned and adored by NBA fans worldwide. Had anybody been there to witness it, they themselves would have cried directly into the beard of Harden as well. But what happened when Harden fell asleep that night? Do you think that he slept like a normal person? Fuck no. The guy was just traded. Surprisingly, though, he slept well. Perhaps better than he ever had. The clock strikes 3 AM, making no sound because it is a digital clock and an alarm is not set. But that's irrelevant too. James is encapsulated in a dream. He sits atop a snowy mountaintop, completely nude. It's not sexual, mind you, it simply reflects his newfound sense of isolation and feelings of vulnerability. He places his head down and cries quietly, snowflakes settling gently on his lightly tattooed breast. Again, a tear trickles down into his beard. Harden looks up with bloodshot eyes, wondering how he will continue on without his counterparts in Oklahoma City. Suddenly, he makes out a figure. It's indistinct, a shadowy presence of sorts that stands before him on the peak. It begins to speak. ""James, stand up."" He stands up. ""I understand an occurrence of great negative magnitude precipitated ere the eve of the previous night. It's a tragedy, really. An injustice of no bounds. You see, I'm Seattle born-and-raised. That team was my livelihood. The bane of my existence. Then it got ripped away from me- James, I'm here to help you get revenge. Don't freak the fuck out."" The shadowy figure extends an arm towards Harden, reaching for his beard. The shadow suddenly slips and falls- it's snowing outside- and his hand instead wallops into Harden's dick. It caresses the ungodly bounds of Harden's downstairs forest, seemingly enchanting it with a cascade of mystical woodland nymphs. It begins to glow. ""James, you're blessed now. Enchanted. Every game, every night when you see those fans cheering for you from the stands, your pants beard will glow with heavenly bioluminescence. It will grant you mystical powers, you will draw contact at will, shoot at will, and you will attract former Los Angeles players for absolutely no reason."" ""Also, you have chlamydia now. It only stops itching when you eurostep lmao"" And for the next five years, Harden shot and eurostepped his way to unequivocal stardom, fighting a courageous battle with chlamydia along the way. For these reasons, we must recognize him as the second best player in the NBA behind Lou Williams, who is patient zero for three distinct types of gonorrhea. Thanks for reading.  "

"It was his meniscus which is how he was able to come back so fast. But then he had to have two follow-up procedures as a direct result, one to fix a loose stitch.   &gt;Oklahoma City point guard Russell Westbrook also went to The Steadman Clinic to have his torn right meniscus repaired in April of 2013, after he collided with Houston’s Patrick Beverley in during a first-round playoff game. Westbrook underwent another surgery in October of 2013 to repair a loose stitch, and then a third operation in December to address excessive swelling.  http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/09/06/danilo-gallinari-regrets-going-vails-steadman-clinic-first-knee-procedure/11465/ "

Hoping Russell Westbrook is personally offended by this.
Bruh you literally have Russell Westbrook on your team lol
Russell WestBrook statline tonight: 5/18 (28% FG) with 7 Turnovers.
"Btw if you watch our game at all, he actually have wet fadeaway and midrange. Yeah his 3pt shooting needs improving. But he dom't really need a 3pt range to be effective. This seaso  he is 3rd in total points 4 points less than russell westbrook. He have more 40+ point game (4) than less than 20 points game (2).  He is 2nd in points per game 28.5 points per gamethe leading player is harden at 30.9 points per game.  So would not say that shotting is his achilles heel. He needs to improve on that but he can still produce and give your team points even if he don't have any 3pt shot"
"From a physical stature standpoint, sure.   Athletically, Russell Westbrook. Dude could outlast Goku with a bag of sensu beans. "
I agree with your first point especially. If the end game for KD is to pull a grand return to OKC a la LeBron to Cleveland. KD won't be seen as a returning hero to lead them to championship greatness he will be seen as the 2nd child to the prodigal son Russell Westbrook.
"don't forget when Embiid shot and killed Russell Westbrook and they gave the corpse a technical, or when Giannis walked out into the stands and dunked from behind the backboard but they gave it to him."

Not to mention the entire team was built around LeBron, remove the engine from a car and how does it drive? "
"MVP isn't an award for the player whose team would see the biggest drop off if they weren't on it.  Also, just looking at some stats, Curry, Harden, and Giannis beat Irving in WS/48 and value over replacement player. LeBron beats him in VORP as well. Giannis, Curry, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook all have significantly better on/off ratings than Kyrie. It's hard to argue he lifts his team up more than anyone else."
"Lol... I'm sure they're also eyeing Giannis, LeBron, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Embiid, Porzingis, Harden, Chris Paul..."
Salah Mejri and Russell Westbrook are similar players too  they both yell a lot
They're both teams made up of pretty likable players. I think the most polarizing figures are KD and Draymond and I'm pretty sure other players (not named Russell Westbrook and Paul Pierce) actually like those guys too  Edit: I forgot Paul Pierce was no longer relevant
Still better odds than any team lead by Russell Westbrook. There's a reason KD dumped y'all lmao
Russell Westbrook scares me 
You don't have to be better than Russell fucking Westbrook to be good. I'm not sure what you are even saying here. I'm sure there are still people out there that would say he's better than russ but what exactly does that say about how good John wall is?
I have a hard time believing Russell Westbrook and John Wall have two of the ten worst contracts in the NBA.
"Ah yes those terrible John Wall, Russell Westbrook contracts..."
No . Supermax is what Westbrook got - 5 years/$205 million  https://www.si.com/nba/2017/09/29/russell-westbrook-okc-thunder-contract-extension
"Well at this point you're just trolling. Do you watch any of the Thunder games? If so, you would've heard both the local and ESPN commentators bring up, multiple times, the fact that Paul George and Melo approached Westbrook in early December and told him to stop trying to change his game to fit them. They were comfortable with Westbrook being the #1 option on the team and that he no longer needed to take 3s to help the team but could defer these to PG and Melo.      Here's another article that comments on it:   http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21896228/carmelo-anthony-russell-westbrook-just-playing-game-led-win-streak      &gt; Breaking news: after a winning streak star player says they've been playing better.      That's not at all what I'm saying, if you bothered to read. I am saying that there has been a self-confessed change in team dynamic in early December, between the Thunder 3, that has lead to a successful change in their play-style, comparing with the preceding period.      Are you somehow more informed of the situation than PG and Melo and Billy Donovan who have all commented on this change, not to mention the other journalists with inside information?      Either you accept what PG, Melo, Billy et al have been saying at face value or you don't. If the latter, you've got no evidence one way or the other so why don't you fuck off until you do?"
Russell westbrook is young^please^help^me
"Haha, yeah maybe I'm envious of his talents, but who wouldn't be! He can jump and run like crazy!   This is all homer spin. ""It's not a bad attitude, it's a competitive attitude."" He's petty. He's quick to pick fights. Lazy on defense. He doesn't play team basketball because he constantly is making selfish plays, going for high difficulty and low probability. You tell me that's not all bad attitude?   Assists-wise, it's because he's getting the ball every play. This is probably you're best point I'll grant you that. But guess who among the top 10 assisters in the league, has the highest number of turnovers. Surprise, Russell Westbrook!   ""It's not dumb decisions, it's *risk taking*""  Haha, ok, let's just call him a poor judge of basketball risks than. Oh wait, that's the same thing as a bad decision maker.   His 1 on 1 defense is solid, but he gets lost in plays and loses his man. He's an unreliable defender.   And by the way, the clips I showed were from the second best season in franchise history and this year, so it's not like it's just because of bad years, haha.   Just quit being a homer and get your head out of your ass and accept that Russell Westbrook is a flawed player. Definitely not likable. An offensive machine, but not an all-around player. That's the essential problem with his triple-double stat, it usually implies a good all-around player but that's not what Russ is. "
"Here you go. This enough or do you want more?      &gt; Carmelo Anthony believes the biggest change for the Oklahoma City Thunder during their recent streak of 12 wins in 15 games is Russell Westbrook getting back to playing his style of basketball.  &gt; Speaking to reporters after the Thunder's 124-107 win over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday, their sixth straight victory, Anthony singled out Westbrook's performance as the key.   &gt; ""I think the fact that Russ is just playing -- not trying to defer to anybody, to any one of us -- just playing his game and letting us play off him ... I think he's much more effective by doing that rather than deferring to myself or Paul,"" Anthony said, via ESPN's Royce Young. "

"&gt; Russell Westbrook on why he's never been in the dunk contest: ""I only dunk on people."""
"Sometimes yes and most of the times no.   Look at his offensive rebounds and total rebounds the first few years of his career - now compare them to his current averages. His total rebounds pretty much doubled going from 4.5-5 to 9-10 the last 3 years - Yet his offensive rebounds are still exactly the same at 1.7 pr game. There have already been hundreds of threads proving how much Westbrook ""steals"" the defensive rebounds from his bigs. It's pretty much a fact by now that Russell does stat-pad to some extent - but as many point out it's their best way of running the fast-break which I completely agree with. His defensive rebounding is misleading and overrated, it doesn't really contribute to anything, Adams should be a 12-13rpg player and westbrook 5-6, but instead they're both averaging around 9. Adams 3-4 drebs and westbrook 8drebs. It's all really a system, if it wasn't for Russ, those rebounds would get picked up by adams instead.  Edit: and yes, I am just annoyed at how much credit Russ gets for rebounding, hate me.. There are many guards in the league who are just as good at rebounding as him, and who would also be able to average the same numbers in that system - yet people like to call Russ the best rebounding guard of all time, despite the fact that he averaged normal numbers before KD and Ibaka left."
"I would be incredibly sad because the only way the NBA championship falls that far down the line is if KD, Steph, LeBron, Harden, CP3, Pop, Jimmy Butler, and Russell Westbrook all die in a sneak attack by the Cylons."
me:  1. Donovan Mitchell  2. Kyle Kuzma  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. Kristaps Porzingis  5. James Harden  6. Devin Booker  7. Anthony Davis  8. Kevin Durant  9. Joel Embiid  10. Stephen Curry  11. Kawhi Leonard  12. Ben Simmons  13. Robert Covington  14. Andrew Wiggins  15. Karl-Anthony Towns  16. Bradley Beal  17. Damian Lillard  18. Kyrie Irving   19. John Wolf  20. Steven Adams  21. Russell Westbrook  22. Paul George  23. Jimmy Butler  24. LeBron James  25. Lou Williams
"Yeah all that is nice but NBA is over here trying to jerk off over the 76ers and is willing to ignore how Westbrook put himself in the path of the dunk in a CLEAR charge attempt. No one thought about this critically they just up vote dumb shit and move on.  Case and b point look at the highest rated comments in the thread.  ""My condolences to the Westbrook family"". Is that funny? No. It's not original either. Or correct since Russell projects himself backwards to get the call."
Russell Westbrook Paul George Carmelo Anthony Steven Adams Raymond Felton Jerami Grant  All those guys are pretty above average or higher for their roles.
"Maybe because Russell Westbrook is leading in rebounds, assists and steals over LeBron James. LeBron is averaging 26.8 points per game over Westbrook 25.7 points per game which isn’t too far from each other. It seems as if Westbrook has the momentum to pass LeBron since Westbrook just passed LeBron in total points but that shouldn’t count since OKC played 2 more games than CLE this season so far. RW (1286) LJ (1285). "
"Her point is that star players always get those calls. Yet Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder, and the current NBA reigning MVP did not. I thought it was pretty clear? What did you miss about that? "
Depends on if whether Russell Westbrook is leading the MVP narrative or not
"The reigning MVP should get more respect and protection than unknown role players or rookies who haven't done anything. It's really that simple and I don't see anything wrong with it.   Westbrook is a big star, one of the biggest draws in the league. Even folks that don't care much about basketball know who Russell Westbrook is.   Whether you like him or not, he is pretty enigmatic and makes the NBA more exciting. Fouls like that have to be called in order to avoid more reckless play from 7'2 behemoths like Embiid. "

"Dude. Yes. This is exactly why players don’t want the fucking all star draft televised. Because look at how the media is digging for a story in Cleveland right now.   Russell Westbrook thought he got picked last and look at how the media reacted. Every single show they have discussed it. Can you imagine if they televised the draft and Curry picked Klay with his 5th pick instead of his 4th? (Making up that scenario, not sure what exactly happened)  ESPN and reporters would ask Klay what he thought, or Curry “Why?” in interviews, plus make a god damn segment out of it “Dub-State Drama?”  I’m glad the players didn’t televise the draft. The media doesn’t deserve it. And unfortunately, if you told them that, the media would say you’re against free speech, when really the argument is that they should just have higher standards. "
"During the 2016 NBA playoffs, Russell Westbrook would take off all his clothes, fill one of the tubs with marinara sauce, get in and pretend he was a meatball during every halftime. Kevin Durant felt bothered by this, and it heavily influenced his decision to join the Warriors. Unbeknownst to KD at the time, Klay Thompson has an affinity for filling the tub up with maple syrup, laying around and pretending that he's a waffle. "

"Edit: TIL Thunder fans on here have the most delicate psyche in history.   Some of you people are actually fucking crazy, it's insane how personal you guys make this.  Am I the only one that's saddened by the fact that Roberson being injured is a ""huge blow to us"" and the Thunder will have to rely on ""some other players"", what like Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony and Paul George?  For fucks sake. The circle jerk around OKC is absurd. They have 3 of the best players in the league and REGULARLY play like shit.   EXPLAIN THIS. SOMEONE.  How in the fuck does a team with Wes, Anthony and PG play like shit more than a couple times a year? And how the fuck does a team like that rely so heavily on Roberson to play defense?  Fuck, the delusion in this sub over the Thunder is fucking crazy.   So many of you can't handle that KD was tired of treading water and went to win a championship.   I'm calling it now. So long as the Oklahoma City Thunder have Russell Westbrook, they'll never win an NBA championship.  If they trade him for pieces to build around Anthony, and PG, if they can convince him to stay if he's center to their plans, they would have a chance to beat the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals.  Instead of just downvoting and moving along, tell me EXACTLY why I'm wrong. No one has ever actually don't this by the way. Can you be the first?  "

It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns.  This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"
"Get better soon Robes!  Russell Westbrook Triple Double!  Paul George was hot in the beginning, but he calmed down quickly.   Tbh Tobias Harris deserves more all-star consideration than Andre. "

"There is a great video series on YouTube called By Any Means Basketball that breaks down injuries, provides information on prevention, etc. Their [Kobe video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFLKPq_86A4) shows that in addition to his huge workload (40 mins a night) Kobe had pretty bad landing mechanics that likely contributed to his knee surgeries in 2003 and 2006. Following his third knee surgery on his right knee in 2010, he began to favour his left leg immensely, landing on just his left leg after dunks and even face-up jimbos. To make matters worse, his landing mechanics often had his knee driving over his toes, which for anyone who squats knows, is terribly hard on the knee.  First he developed tenosynovitis in his left knee (overuse) and then came the achilles.  It takes a lot of practice, muscle memory, and discipline to change your jumping, sprinting, and landing mechanics. Russell Westbrook changed his first step mechanics following his knee surgery and it may have just saved his knees (though he does still have a lot of hard one legged landings after dunks). This is all to say that if Boogie adapts his bio-mechanics, drops some weight, and gets that leg strong as hell -- he may still play a long and healthy career.  **Mandatory Lebron praise:** His biomechanics are near perfect. Holds the rim after many dunks to land on two legs. Absorbs impact through his hips, lands on the balls of his feet (not heels), and pushes out to fall on his butt when he's too far in the backseat on a landing."
"Obligatory reference to Basketball Reference's MVP Tracker.  This is based on voting patterns and it's not perfect -- it would have picked Harden over Westbrook last year.

"its called having Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anythony and Steven Adams compared to the clippers missing 5 or 6 out of their best 8 players for the majority of the season which is when lou has really showed up"
Russell Westbrook would’ve gotten ASG MVP last year if they didn’t bench him.
All i will say is that CP3 does not like playing against Russell Westbrook in the playoffs lol  History doesnt lie
"Contact injury meanssomething cause the injury, like Russell Westbrook getting hit in the knee by Patrick Beverly.  Non contact means there may be structural damage,  like the ligament or tendon just gave out on the athlete"

OKC TRADES WHOLE TEAM LESS RUSSELL WESTBROOK FOR LEBRON JAMES
The Russell Westbrook special
"ESPN: Kevin Love says his team “probably doesn’t want him,” wants to join Thunder, “I know Russell [Westbrook] like [me]”"
"&gt;But LeBron and Curry got on the phone and did their part in leading the NBA back to a friendlier place. Two NBA icons, who have changed the game in their own ways, got together to pave the path away from the petty. LeBron, especially. He drafted Irving. With his first pick in the second round, after Curry started the round by selecting Thompson, LeBron drafted Russell Westbrook — ensuring Westbrook and Durant will be teammates again.   I feel like drafting Westbrook and Durant onto the same team is more petty than friendly."
Almost positive that Lebron snatched up KD first.   Something like this.  Round 1 LeBron: Kevin Durant Curry: James Harden  Round 2: Curry: Giannis Antetokounmpo LeBron: Anthony Davis  Round 3: LeBron: Kyrie Irving Curry: Joel Embiid  Round 4: Curry: DeMar DeRozan LeBron: DeMarcus Cousins  Round 5: LeBron: Russell Westbrook Curry: Klay Thompson  Round 6: Curry: Draymond Green LeBron: Kevin Love  (Quick note: I think Steph leads the charge on picking his teammates and so LeBron panics a little and grabs Love to prevent drama.)  Round 7 LeBron: Kristaps Porzingis Curry: Kyle Lowry  Round 8 Curry: Karl Anthony-Towns LeBron: LaMarcus Aldridge  Round 9 LeBron: Bradley Beal Curry: Jimmy Butler  Round 10 Curry: Al Horford LeBron: Victor Oladipo  Round 11 LeBron: John Wall Curry: Damian Lillard
"Honestly man the team was just kinda trash last year. Not so much in the talent we had, but more so in the way the talent fit together. I don't think the front office was expecting KD to not re-sign, which not only screwed our finances, but also the team was not built with the idea of Westbrook being the sole star in mind. Thus we didn't have a consistent secondary ball handler (Oladipo wasn't nearly the ball handler he has become this year and our backup point guard was Semaj Christon), we did not have enough cap space to sign anyone big without bird rights, and we also had very little spacing in our starters and bench(Oladipo was forced to play more of a spot up role as a result, Sabonis was forced into more a stretch PF role, and later in the season Taj Gibson's range only extends to midrange. McDermott and Abrines were the only shooters we had but Doug was inconsistent and Alex wasn't as developed as he is now). All of this resulted in a depth chart that just wasn't suited to competing for a high seed or going deep in the playoffs. If it wasn't for Russell, this team probably would have missed the playoffs by a good margin. You would be very hard pressed to find a player who could lead that team the way that he did. The team was extremely inconsistent, especially on offense, and while Russell was at times a part of the issue, he was usually the only one who could work to right the issue. There were so many games last year where late in the game the team would be struggling to get the offense moving, and then Westbrook would flip some kind of switch and just seemingly force the team to a win through sheer willpower. While there were gripes about his efficiency and volume, there wasn't anyone on that team that could consistently do better as a ball handler and playmaker, thus leaving the bulk of the responsibility in Russell's hands. Say what you will about Westbrook and the team last year, but once Durant signed with the Warriors, all of the hope and optimism Thunder fans had for the upcoming season was in an instant smashed into a million pieces. It would have been easy to have marked it down as a lost season, but Westbrook would not allow that to happen. There was something magical about watching him down the stretch, completely ignoring the inflated, stat-padded, illegitimate triple-doubles, with the way that he drove this team with unrelenting intensity with insanely clutch plays and ludicrous shots. Some of the video links are dead now, but just watch some of [these](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/4/11/15261172/russell-westbrook-clutch-highlights-buzzer-beater-mvp). Russell may not have been the best player on the best team last year, but you can not tell me he was not the most valuable."
"Yet another instance of not addressing the information I put forth and changing the subject. The Thunder don't have any bigs that have good enough court vision or passing ability necessary to throw an outlet pass that would be more effective than Russell Westbrook, their best playmaker and one of probably the top three fastest players in the league with the ball in their hands, having the ball from the outset. And I don't understand how you've come to the conclusion that Westbrook's '16-'17 season statistically worthy of MVP consideration. It is fair to say Russell's last season was statistically ludicrous. The Thunder may not have won a lot of games, which was one of the huge gripes people had about Westbrook, but you can't deny his stats were definitely there."
Russell Westbrook and 3pt bricking in the 4th. 
"You’re all good, my friend. I’m not trying to insult anybody - I just think Russell Westbrook is awesome. But I’m not about attaching anyone over it.   God bless ya"
Russell Westbrook 
"That's assuming that Steven Adams could give an quick and accurate pass to a speeding Russell Westbrook. He's a great center and an okay passer for his position, but it seems a little too risky"
"&gt;But that isn't the argument. You're creating a straw man - a logical fallacy.  I was not trying to claim CJ McCollum is some incredible player, simply raising the fact that he is one of the bigger name, more skilled players that Westbrook ranks ahead of. In the same vein, I can say after watching watching about 65 Thunder games this season, the stats you brought up don't do him justice in his skill on the fastbreak. I never claimed Russell is deserving of the MVP trophy this year, but due to him actually winning the award last year, he is unequivocally an MVP."

"This doesn't seem like a fair assessment of Westbrook's ability in transition. First of all, the statistics it seems you are using from NBA.com only include possessions in which the player finished the possession, either through a shot, foul, or turnover, and does not account for possessions where a player might have gotten an assist. This removes a huge part of Russell's game from the equation. The 33.6 percentile at which Westbrook ranks is for points per possession on transition plays out of every player who has recorded at least on transition play on the year. This still ranks above other great players such as John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons, and CJ McCollum. Furthermore, if we narrow down the field to players who have played at least 30 games and have recorded at least 2 transition plays per game, Russell is in the 60th percentile for scoring frequency in transition, 22nd out of 80 in shooting percentage in transition plays, and is second overall in transition points per game.   Edit: If you want to expand the field of players by having it be all players who have played 20 games or more and have at least 1 transition possession per game (213 players), Westbrook is in the 55th percentile for scoring frequency and the 69th percentile (66th out of 213) in shooting percentage"
"It amazes me how everyone paraphrases this interview, but somehow his answer slightly more dickish each time.    When they asked if any other rookies ""caught his attention"",  he shook his head and said “I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That’s where I want to be. I think for me, that’s what I love to watch.”  Him saying he doesn't follow other rookies and only watches superstars is a lot different than dogging the other rookies.  "
"Seriously dude, introspection. Read the damn quote. Simmons was asked if any other rookies had caught his attention. He said none had. **he never mentioned Mitchell, nor any other rookie.** All he said is that he watches the greats, not other rookies.  People made it into a diss at Mitchell because Mitchell is the 2nd best rookie this year, but Ben Simmons didn’t say a single damn thing about Mitchell.  For someone who has literally no idea what you’re talking about, you’re really full of yourself. Can you be a big enough person to admit you were wrong, or are you going to continue obliviously insulting me like I’m the one out of my depth?  “None,” Simmons responded promptly. “I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That’s where I want to be. I think for me, that’s what I love to watch.”"
"Ben's comments were taken out of context.  EDI: This is the full quote (same thing he said before the season):  ""None,"" Simmons told ESPN. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like (Kevin Durant), (LeBron James), (Stephen) Curry, Russell (Westbrook). Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch."""
"like i said, that is not how the game is played anymore. almost every team in the league has their ball handlers grabbing these uncontested rebounds   https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/12/22/16809866/nba-triple-double-boom-russell-westbrook  ""Teams have never been more cognizant of transition defense than they are today, which means an emphasis on setting up on defense before the opponent can exploit any gaps. This, in turn, leaves plenty of defensive rebounds to be had completely uncontested. Enter Westbrook, James Harden, Ben Simmons, LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and, yes, Chris Paul. In a league that’s playing the fastest it’s played in over a quarter century, every split second counts. Having the rebound go to your lead ball handler is not only effective, it will soon be the norm, if we haven’t already gotten to that point.""  "
Why don’t you like Simmons? [Is it because of his arrogance?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8b9eby/comment/dx4xd1e?st=JFUEQMIR&amp;sh=7e70b476) You must hate Russell Westbrook than!
"Russell Westbrook, last season?"
"A bit nit picky, but that’s fine. Let’s use Russell Westbrook. He shot 28% from the 3pt and 85% from the FT line in his rookie year. "
"In most situations, but also not in many. The Thunder rely heavily on Westbrook's transition game (he averages an entire field goal more than the number 2 in transition FGAs), and he gets a lot of his assists out there. As such, opposing teams will have their guards stick to Westbrook extra tightly during outlet situations, and disrupt a lot of potential transitions. While you might get more quality transition, you'll probably get less. If Russell Westbrook grabs a rebound, its an automatic fast break. He can outrun practically anybody in the world on a basketball court. He's a very special case, this doesn't work for 95% of professional basketball players, let alone high school and college players (where this adage is usually taught). It also allow him to survey the floor and choose his trajectory more effectively."
"Come on man... Lebron was the only reason the Cavs were good. They went from 61 wins in 2010 to 19 wins the next season. OKC still had Russell fucking Westbrook. Please dont make comparisons like this, they’re genuinely stupid.  Anyone who thinks the 2009 and 2010 Cavs were good enough to win a championship needs a reality check.  In the 2009 playoffs, Lebron averaged 35/9/7 on 62% TS, had a PER of 37.4, a BPM of 18.2 and a WS/48 of .400!!! Do you even understand how mind boggling those numbers are?   And despite all of that, Cleveland didnt even make the finals. That’s how bad they were outside of him.  Dude literaly had a top 5 playoff performances ever and couldnt make the finals. So please dont compare his situation to KD’s ever.  "
"Yeah it's pretty nuts seeing who all Simmons matches up with every game.The key is he doesnt just switch; he can be hte primary matchup defender on any position in the NBA.    http://stats.nba.com/team/1610612755/matchups/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Defense&amp;CF=DEF_PLAYER_NAME*E*Simmons  You can see from the link he has averaged at least 13 poss a game guarding each of the following: Al Horford, Kristaps Porzingis, Eric Bledsoe, LeBron James, Russell Westbrook. Really anybody any time.   The most versatile defender in the NBA this year really comes down to 3 guys to me looking at the data: Ben Simmons, Jeff Green(yes that Jeff Green) and Justise Winslow    http://stats.nba.com/team/1610612739/matchups/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Defense&amp;CF=DEF_PLAYER_NAME*E*Green  Green not only guards the John Wall types but also spends more time on the true Centers the Jusuf Nurkic or DeAndre Jordan types than Simmons did.   http://stats.nba.com/team/1610612748/matchups/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Defense&amp;CF=DEF_PLAYER_NAME*E*Winslow  Winslow is also just absurd. Spends about equal amount of time on the Kemba Walkers of the world as hte Karl Anthony Town's of the world.   This type of versatility these guys have is way way rarer than people think. The guys you would think would spend this much time guarding 1-5 in the reg sesaon like Giannis LeBron Draymond etc dont really to nearly this degree. "
"That's also because athletes in high school are not the same as Russell Westbrook. RW is #2 in the league in points per game in transition, and having your best ball handler and attacker to start with the ball is a great way to start the attack."
"Even twenty years from now it will blow people’s minds that Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden were all on the same team in their early 20’s"
"It has zero to do with how fast the ball is moving for it to be up the floor, but Russell Westbrook is one of the best penetration players as well as one of the better passers the league has. Him having the ball barreling at you as fast as he can often leads to opposing team fouls to stop any movement, which is a good thing for OKC. Not every rebound is a 70 foot outlet, so that argument is bad. Also, OKC has two ball dominant penetrators that can scare a defense- Westbrook and PG. Your notion that another guard on the team, like Raymond Felton and Alex Abrines, are gonna scare the opposition on the break is laughable."
"I'm loving where this issue is leading a lot of people in this sub.   First, the argument was that he statpads and if he manages to get the 16, it will be the ultimate proof.  But, now that it is determined that he only needs 13 for the NBA consider it a triple double, people are demanding that he grabs 16 boards or they will never consider the triple double that they said wasn't legit as legit!  Russell Westbrook possibly averaging a triple double in back to back years in today's NBA is ridiculous. But, somehow the people that resent him for accomplishing the feat are even more ridiculous!"
*entire narrative* to you. there are many other reasons that justified Russell Westbrook being the 2017 NBA MVP.
"Players who have averaged Triple Doubles in a season:  1. Oscar Robertson (1961-62)  2. Russell Westbrook (2016-17)  3. Russell Westbrook (2017-18)  It literally is a record, the same as how the 50-40-90 club is a record. With that in mind, you simply cant include Russ’ 2018 season in the record because it simply wasnt one."
I feel that this post was just a ploy to say Russell Westbrook needs 16 more rebounds in his final game of the season to average a triple-double for the second season in a row.

Has Russell Westbrook stop existing?
"Got to admit, I thought it was going to be about Russell Westbrook needing 16 rebounds."
"Maybe Russell Westbrook if he needed 55 in the last game to average a triple double for the 3rd straight year. Otherwise, nah."
How would he say Russell Westbrook? 
"Adams got boxed out on offense? That has nothing to do with Westbrook getting rebounds on defense (vast majority of his rebounds) when 4 OKC players are boxing out and RUssell is chasing rebounds. Memphis cant prevent it, unless they stop missing shots all together. "
"Westbrook scoring 2500 points last year is nuts. Also, never thought I'd hear the phrase Lebron James joining Russell Westbrook for a record."

How many rebounds does Russell Westbrook need?
Russell Westbrook needs 16 rebounds to averaged a triple double in the game against Memphis Grizzlies.
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there. Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy."" My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."
This reminds me of how Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder needs to grab 16 rebounds next game in order to clinch a triple double average for the 2017-2018 NBA season
#HEY DID YOU GUYS KNOW RUSSELL WESTBROOK NEEDS 16 REBOUNDS TO GET A TRIPLE DOUBLE FOR THE SEASON? OH YOU DIDNT? WELL NOW YOU KNOW YOURE WELCOME 
#HEY DID YOU GUYS KNOW RUSSELL WESTBROOK NEEDS 16 REBOUNDS TO GET A TRIPLE DOUBLE FOR THE SEASON OH YOU DIDNT? WELL NOW YOU KNOW YOURE WELCOME 
"Quality shitposting, but let me bring the usual reminder:  &gt;Westbrook and Robertson as the only players to average a triple double for an entire season.  This is quite likely not true, Wilt Chamberlain, possibly Bill Russell too, may well have averaged triple doubles with blocks but that was before blocks were being recorded. "
"When you compare Bird and Magic, do you really look at who won the ROY? Same for Oscar Robertson vs Jerry West. Do you even know who was ROY in these cases? Would you believe me if I told you that Tom Heinsohn won the ROY over Bill Russell? Emeka Okafor was ROY over Dwight Howard. In the end, Mitchell shouldn't worry that Simmons is the ROY, play out your career, and don't worry about some stupid hardware that guys like Mike Miller, MCW, and Okafor have achieved, and greats like West, Russell, Olajuwon, Malone, Stockton, Barkley, Curry and many others didn't win. In the grand scheme of things leading a team to championships matters more than anything, Finals MVPs are the personal acolade which really one should stride for. I feel like Westbrook worries way too much about putting up numbers out of this world and hurts his team for personal achievements rather than prioritizing what's the best for the team. I personally feel like MVP's like Rose or Westbrook, or Malone's 99 MVP are like meh.. in the end, you were disappointing the biggest stage. I hate to say it, but Duncan was probably more deserving of the MVP that year, and I would love if the MVP could encompass playoff success a little. I'm not saying to strip MVP's from Wilt or give them all to Russell. Anyways, I'm siderailing a little, but in the end I want Mitchell to help give my Jazz a title, and hey if that means Simmons gets all the personal accolades, I could really care less. I'm sure Mitchell will get tons of personal accolades, but ROY doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things."

"Do you actually know how those stats work or do you just see a stat that makes your player look good and go along with it? Ben does really well with that stat because its just cumulative DBPM which is influenced heavily by AST% and RB%, same reason why Russell Westbrook had the second most DBPM in the nba last year and the highest single season BPM ever by a wide margin despite being a lazy defender. So no, it isn't ""value"" its a terrible stat that doesn't tell the whole story."
"Russell ""Rodney Dangerfield"" Westbrook"
TIL nobody on r/nba fucks with Russell Westbrook.
Yeah I heard that he worked out with Russell over the Summer. Great to see Westbrook take a young guy under his wing like that.
Good to know he's finally reached the level of the all-time great Russell Westbrook
"For the same fucking reason Russell Westbrook has said how impressed he is by Mitchell, it’s what normal people do when a guy scores 20 on a playoff team his rookie year. Holy shit your logic is cancerous  You literally can’t read Simmons comments after being asked about Mitchell and say he isn’t being an asshole. He refuses to acknowledge that he exists, much less that he is a good player. That’s being an asshole.   Should Lebron never be expected to praise his teammates and other players just because he’s the best? Like what lmao"
"Did you read the article?  ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  He's talking all-time, historical greatness.  I don't think it has to be considered a slam on Mitchell, Believe me, as a diehard Mitchell fan I'd defend the shit outta that if I sensed any shade. I just think his comment is a byproduct of thinking big picture/long term/historical greatness. And good for him.  I honestly think anyone interpreting Ben as having any sort of beef with Mitchell is just looking for a fight."
Russell Westbrook is a larger version of Iverson.
"PG is more of a create his own shot kinda guy than a catch-and-shooter. He is not a good fit with Westbrook for similar reasons as Durant.  Melo is old and imo it's disrespectful to Steven Adams every time I hear announcers talk about the Thunder's ""Big 3"" as if 2018 Melo is a better player than 2018 Adams.  Imagine if the Thunder had a real catch-and-shoot guy at SG or SF... Here's an example of a realistic starting roster that would actually work around Westbrook:  1. Russell Westbrook  2. Klay Thompson  3. Andre Roberson/Jerami Grant  4. Patrick Patterson  5. Steven Adams  Then again, Klay is probably the most ""plug-into-any-roster-and-make-it-better"" player in the league."
"**When the 6-foot-10 point guard was told the Rookie of the Year race appears to be a two-man show, he buried his head down and proceeded to chuckle. Asked what rookies have caught his attention this year, he didn't mince words.  ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""**  Nobody asked him what other rookies he likes or thinks are good.  They asked him which rookies ""caught his attention"" and he responded saying none because he follows the greats, since that's where he wants to be someday.  That's a perfectly acceptable answer and isn't dogging DM or any other rookies.  Ppl will play that narrative, but it's a stretch. "
Yes the team was better w/Russell Westbrook playing then with Semaj Christon. That is because Russell Westbrook is a very good offensive player and Christon was the worst player in basketball.

"Lol not a single person on planet earth said Victor Oladipo would be a better player than Russell Westbrook this season.   Not the most delusional Pacers homers, and not the biggest Westbrook haters. "
"If Westbrook were a forward I would agree, but the guard spots are so packed this year. Harden and Lillard are locks, then you've got  -Russell Westbrook  -Kyrie Irving  -Victor Oladipo  -DeMar DeRozan  -CP3   -And Jimmy Butler (if you want to count him as a guard)  So someone who is deserving will definitely get left out. "
Russell Westbrook comparison threads always end with such hostility. 
"Even that’s out of context though  &gt;""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""

"Yeah it’s funny I think 90% of us would have locked in Kevin Pritchard at Indy for worst trade at the time, but it’s been shocking to see it work for him. The reason I didn’t criticize OKC as much is because I thought the logic made sense. If you’re going to pay Russell Westbrook 30 million a year, you might as well give him a team that has a chance (in theory.)"
"This is arguably the second Process that worked in the last decade.  The 2006-07 Sonics finished 31-51 with a veteran roster that included high-paid guys like Ray Allen, Rashard Lewis, Danny Fortson, and Luke Ridnour. They responded by getting rid of almost all their significant veterans, drafting Kevin Durant 2nd overall, and trading Ray Allen for 5th overall pick Jeff Green. They played Durant out of position at SG (at 6'9"", 240 lbs) his entire rookie season to develop his ball skills, but also to tank further, finished 20-62, and drafted Russell Westbrook (one of the most raw but highest-ceiling prospects) 4th overall the next year. Then they finished 23-59 and drafted James Harden. During this whole period, the Sonics/Thunder made virtually no efforts to sign any impact veterans, and ended up with three generational talents.  I stopped paying attention at that point, but I assume those guys played together for many years and won a few championships."
"Wow I’m surprised that KOC gave Russ First Team All-NBA:  &gt; Russell Westbrook gets the spot for now. Westbrook’s impact as a scorer, playmaker, and rebounder plus the way he’s carried the team during its playoff push as Paul George and Carmelo Anthony both struggle give him the razor-thin edge over everyone else. I’ve been dubbed a Russ hater for all of my criticisms of his game, but that’s only because he can still be so much better with just some minor tweaks. Westbrook is still awesome."
"**All-NBA First Team**  * Guard: James Harden, Houston Rockets * Guard: Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers * Forward: LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers * Forward: Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors * Center: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans  The five players from my MVP ballot fit nicely here. Stephen Curry and Chris Paul could’ve gotten Lillard’s spot, but both played less than 60 games. Giannis Antetokounmpo missed out on a first team forward spot only because of the brilliance of James and Durant, while Joel Embiid wasn’t good enough this season to outdo Davis for the first team center spot.  **All-NBA Second Team**  * Guard: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors * Guard: Chris Paul, Houston Rockets * Forward: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks * Forward: LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs * Center: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers  Curry, Paul, Antetokounmpo and Embiid were all obvious selections for the second team, leaving just one forward spot up for grabs. That went to Aldridge, who has been outstanding for San Antonio, keeping the Spurs in the playoff hunt despite only having Kawhi Leonard for nine games due to his bizarre, season-long quad issues.  **All-NBA Third Team**  * Guard: Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder * Guard: DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors * Forward: Paul George, Oklahoma City Thunder * Forward: Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves * Center: Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz  Westbrook is close to averaging another triple-double, while DeRozan has been the engine of a Raptors team that could win 60 games. George and Butler were the clear choices as third-team forwards, with the NBA thankfully changing Butler’s eligibility from guard only to guard/forward, alleviating a very difficult task of trying to find a sixth forward worth including.  The final spot came down to Karl-Anthony Towns or Gobert, the league’s best offensive and defensive centers, respectively. By the slimmest of margins, Gobert gets the nod.  **All-Defensive First Team**  * Guard: Jrue Holiday, New Orleans Pelicans * Guard: Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers * Forward: Al Horford, Boston Celtics * Forward: Paul George, Oklahoma City Thunder * Center: Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz  Gobert, the defensive player of the year, was an easy choice, and sliding Horford over to forward makes for two of those. Holiday and Oladipo make their teams massively better when they are on the court (Indiana is 7.3 points per 100 possessions better with Oladipo out there and New Orleans is a full nine points per 100 possessions better when Holiday plays). George gets the final spot — both because he’s a great defender and as a nod to Andre Roberson, who was on pace to be the league’s best defensive player before suffering a season-ending knee injury.  **All-Defensive Second Team**  * Guard: Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves * Guard: Dejounte Murray, San Antonio Spurs * Forward: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans * Forward: Robert Covington, Philadelphia 76ers * Center: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers  Minnesota has struggled on defense all season long, but would be completely lost without Butler (they are 7.4 points per 100 better defensively with him on the court). Murray, on the other hand, made a real impact in his second season, and first as a starter. Covington is the prototypical “3-and-D” player, and Davis is simply a monster. Embiid was the automatic choice as the second-team center.  **All-Rookie First Team**  1. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers 2. Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz 3. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics 4. Lauri Markkanen, Chicago Bulls 5. Kyle Kuzma, Los Angeles Lakers  Simmons, Mitchell and Tatum were automatics. Markkanen has exceeded just about everyone’s expectations in Chicago, looking like the foundational piece the team hoped he’d be. Kuzma has predictably cooled off after his hot start, but still has been a gem of a find as a late-first rounder.  **All-Rookie Second Team**  1. John Collins, Atlanta Hawks 2. Lonzo Ball, Los Angeles Lakers 3. Dennis Smith, Jr., Dallas Mavericks 4. Bogdan Bogdanovic, Sacramento Kings 5. Bam Adebayo, Miami Heat  Trying to fill out the all-rookie second team is always a challenge, but this year was easier than most thanks to a deep class. Collins has emerged as a long-term rotation piece in Atlanta. Ball — despite all of the noise surrounding him — has actually contributed to winning as a rookie point guard, which is hard to do. Smith had an encouraging year in Dallas, where he’s been given the reins as the future of the franchise. Bogdanovic has been Sacramento’s best player, while Adebayo has shown the supreme athletic tools that will likely make him Hassan Whiteside’s successor in the middle in Miami.  edit: formatting"
"**Most Valuable Player**  1. James Harden, Houston Rockets 2. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 3. Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans 4. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers 5. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors  Harden goes wire-to-wire in this race, and will be a fully deserving MVP after finishing as a runner-up twice in the past three years. There has been a late push from James and some voters that he should be the pick for what would be a fifth time.  James had his chance to take control of the race when Harden went down with a hamstring injury on Dec. 31. Instead, January wound up one of the worst months of his career, the Cavaliers subsequently imploded and eventually swapped out nearly half their roster at the trade deadline. That simply can’t be ignored, nor should it be considered a positive even though the Cavaliers are better for making the trades.  As for the rest of the ballot, Davis edges out Lillard for third because of his contributions at both ends. Fifth place could go in a few directions — including toward Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo — but Durant gets the nod for helping lead the Warriors to near 60 wins despite the team’s myriad injuries.  **Defensive Player of the Year**  1. Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz 2. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers 3. Al Horford, Boston Celtics  Gobert has been the NBA’s best defensive player this season. The only debate is whether he’s played enough games to edge out the league’s second best defender, Embiid. But that was before Embiid’s recent orbital bone fracture, which knocked him out for the final few games of the regular season. The difference thus became negligible, paving the way for Gobert to win. Horford gets the nod in third for being the linchpin of Boston’s defense, the NBA’s best this season.  **Rookie of the Year**  1. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers 2. Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz 3. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics  One of the year’s most contentious races. Simmons and Mitchell look like future superstars, and both are deserving. But Simmons gets the nod for how he’s played down the stretch — including a triple-double in Friday’s thrilling victory over the Cavaliers — helping the 76ers to what should be the third seed in the East. Tatum gets third place due to his contributions in Boston.  **Sixth Man of the Year**  1. Lou Williams, Los Angeles Clippers 2. Eric Gordon, Houston Rockets 3. Fred Van Vleet, Toronto Raptors  Williams and Gordon are closer to starters than bench players, but since they qualify they are atop this list. Williams gets the nod for his brilliant play with the Clippers, who he helped stay in the West playoff race until a loss to Denver Saturday. Van Vleet gets third place for his role as the leader of Toronto’s brilliant second unit, the NBA’s best this season.  **Coach of the Year**  1. Brad Stevens, Boston Celtics 2. Quin Snyder, Utah Jazz 3. Dwane Casey, Toronto Raptors  This was, by a significant margin, the toughest race to figure out. There are eight legitimate candidates: Stevens, Snyder, Casey, Philadelphia’s Brett Brown, Indiana’s Nate McMillan, Portland’s Terry Stotts, San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich and Houston’s Mike D’Antoni. A case can be made for all of them.  Stevens gets it, though, for the way he’s helped the Celtics to 50-plus wins despite losing Gordon Hayward five minutes into the season, and Kyrie Irving after just 60 games. Snyder is second for turning a rookie (Mitchell) into the focal point of his offense who led the Jazz to a top-four playoff spot in the West, while Casey is third for guiding the Raptors from one style of play to another with largely the same personnel, an extremely difficult task.  **Most Improved Player**  1. Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers 2. Andre Drummond, Detroit Pistons 3. Spencer Dinwiddie, Brooklyn Nets  Oladipo will almost certainly be the unanimous winner given that he went from being an awkward-fitting sidekick to Russell Westbrook in Oklahoma City to an all-star in Indiana. Drummond gets second for his all-around improvement — including his stunning turnaround at the free throw line — while Dinwiddie is third after transforming from a fringe NBA player entering the season to a surefire rotation player in Brooklyn.

The incident got a lot of press. [Here's one article](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/pattisonave/Idiot-76ers-fan-flips-off-Russell-Westbrook-gets-ejected-and-called-out-on-ESPN.html)
"Semi related, have you noticed how triple doubles only became an ""arbitrary stat"" after Russell Westbrook made them normal?"
Thanks to r/nba I learned Russell Westbrook doesn’t actually have any basketball skills. He is a freak athlete whose athleticism will deteriorate the moment he turns 30 and that will be the end of his basketball career as a star player.
"...by being russell westbrook? duh? it wasn’t as bad back then because he hadn’t gone totally one-man army mode yet but it was becoming more and more obvious that the two weren’t compatible.   and gsw’s system is so very different than okc’s iso-only, kd-do-everything that the comparison is worthless.  man i’m so tired of explaining obvious shit "
"Yeah, they tried to make that on a ""who has had the best career"" and cut off people with short careers because of that. Using the data I collected last year, the current VORP leaders that are active players (this may be a bit off as it's last years data) is:  * Lebron James * HUGE DROPOFF * Chris Paul * Dirk Nowitzki * Dwyane Wade * Vince Carter * Pau Gasol * Russell Westbrook * Kevin Durant * Manu Ginobili * Andre Iguodala * Stephen Curry  So Manu is probably one of the bigger steals of the century.  edit: overperforming starting 5:  * SG - Manu (VORP as of 2017: 46.8, pick 57) - 1999 - 30th overall in VORP/Game * PF - Paul Millsap (VORP as of 2017:33.5, pick 47) - 2006 - 47th overall in VORP/Game * PG - Kyle Lowry (VORP as of 2017: 31.5, pick 24) - 2006 - 37th overall in VORP/Game  * SF - Kawhi Leonard (VORP as of 2017: 25.6, pick 15) - 2011 - 13th overall in VORP/Game * C - Marc Gasol (VORP as of 2017: 31.2, pick 48) - 2007 - 23rd overall in VORP/Game  This being said Nikola Jokic should probably be there at C instead (VORP as of 2018: 13.7, pick 41) - 2014 - 17th overall in VORP/Game (2017) or maybe even Rudy Gobert (VORP as of 2018: 15, pick 27) - 2013 - 34th overall in VORP/Game (2017)  edit 2: definitely a case for jimmy G buckets as well (VORP as of 2018: 23, pick 30) - 2011 - 25th overall in VORP/Game"
"Keep Simmons and Embiid. We're not 100% sure how good they'll be, but AI is a known quantity.   I don't know if he's going to lead you to the finals through LeBron or the Celtics, and if he's not doing that, what's the point of the move? Also the Sixers are so we'll rounded now, is AI going to pass the ball? We can only speculate. And it's not an iso based game like back then, defenses are a lot different.   You're basically getting... a ferocious competitor that's almost as good as Russell Westbrook? In that range?   Also, 4."
"OKC Thunder, love Russell Westbrook.   I think as long as it is not Rockets vs. Cavs in the finals, I'll be ok. If those two play in the Finals, I have no clue who to root for as I hate both pretty equally. "
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there. Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy."" My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."

"Russell ""Andre Roberson"" Westbrook"
"I wouldn't, lol. I don't see us going anywhere with a core of Russ, Melo, and Blake. Only one of those players I trust at this point is Westbrook. There's no spacing with that squad at all and Blake and Russell need that to thrive. I'd much rather wind up in last year's situation where we just try and get great roleplayers around Russell."
"tl;dr Westbrook is the human embodiment of opportunity cost  I'm not sure I completely agree with that.  Unlike almost every other superstar guard I've seen that was so reliant on his athleticism, he actually does have a weirdly high BBIQ in certain respects despite his glaring blind spots.  If you look at the some of the adjustments he makes game to game and season to season it's obvious that he's smart enough and works hard enough on the mental and tactical side of the game to stop making these kinds of mistakes.  That's why I hoped that he'd have put it together now but instead he kinda just doubled down on his strengths while ignoring his weaknesses.  It's just that the things he does well are so explosive and eye catching that a lot of people overlook his flaws, which in contrast, are much harder to notice because they're usually things that *don't* happen because of Westbrook.  For example, if you have Russell Westbrook, the offense MUST run through him.  He will not be the Wade to someone else's Lebron, meaning like 90% of your tactical options are already off the table.  The same sort of things applies to personnel- you have to bring in players who can play with Westbrook in terms of fit on AND off the court.  You also have to accept that a large number of young players will have trouble developing while playing with Westbrook.  Those things are just harder to notice and gauge the value of than triple doubles and vicious dunks."
"All of those things got Russell Westbrook to sign his extension, which basically guarantees relevance for our franchise for the next 5 years regardless of what happens with PG and Melo. Gtfo"
"Reminded me of playing pickup against one of your good friends. All of the sudden there's more on the line, which lights a fire under you.

"It's completely ingenuous to not include patrick patterson. I've said it once and i'll say it again. Patterson's defense won the game, not westbrook. Russell was fenomenal on-ball but it was patterson who did a COMPLETE job hedging and containing harden out of high pick and rolls. "
"Obviously I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion, I have a rockets flair talking about James Harden half a day after he loses to Russell Westbrook and one of his lowlights being highly scrutinised by this sub, my opinion doesn't mean shit compared to yours right? "
"&gt; I knew what needed to be done  I legit chuckled out loud when I read that.  Of all the NBA superstars, no other NBA player is more likely to take a [dumb shot (or shots)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMIUovSg6TQ) or [space out and play defense on nothing while his man floats to the 3 point line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5gARTD3Vgo) or back cuts than Russell Westbrook, and when he 'knows what needs to be done' it's finally start playing defense.  He definitely played great defense on Harden and I actually think that won them the game but still, hearing that out of Westbrook's mouth just makes me giggle.  I mean, those clips are just from the past 2 months,  I didn't go digging for clips of when he was young and dumb or try to hunt down every bad play from the course of his career.  Maybe he just said he 'knew what needed to done' because it was a new feeling for him."
this is a complete shitpost and i shouldn't even regard it  BUT  russell westbrook is dragging this team to the playoffs just like he did last year's team whether you like it or not
Man I would totally be down for a Russell Westbrook who took on a somewhat smaller role on offense and went all in on becoming the defender he has all the tools to become. 
Win Shares per 48 is a better metric to use. He's ranked 34th among players who have played at least 50 games and 1200 minutes.

Can’t wait for the thread in a couple days “Russell Westbrook needs 25 rebounds in the next game to average a triple double”
"Honestly, even tho I’m a laker fan, I’m wishing you guys get a ring this year. I fucking love Russell Westbrook. He deserves that shit."
So is Russell Westbrook selfish for taking the $205M extension?

After all, the GM isn't on the court.  &gt;One side has Simmons and Embiid. The other doesn't.  Simmons is great, Embiid (when healthy) is great. I think the Celtics can have comparable or better star talent considering their prospects (we've already litigated the judgment of players after rookie seasons) and their ample war chest. "
"He's on offense. He has the right to any space that's not currently occupied by a defender. Russell was running at a pretty brisk clip, Chris read that and immediately brought his right leg all the way across his body to establish his space. Westbrook literally had nowhere to go, and about halfway through that swing, Russell makes contact.   It's not pretty basketball and it sucks that it's not ENTIRELY the defenders fault, but it is most DEFINITELY a defensive foul. "
Figures that when I want OKC to lose the most Russell Westbrook decides to go all Gary Payton on the Rockets.

Russell Westbrook.
"Nah this wasn't a Russell Westbrook ""Welp looks like I'm gonna shoot 40 shots and go down swinging even though I can't hit jack"" game but rather a James Harden game 6 Vs the Spurs. Lebron was directly responsible for the 7-0 run at the start of the fourth."
"* Miami Heat are in surprisingly bad shape given how little they have to show for it. They're pretty much over the cap with only 6 players really (Whiteside, Olynyk, Johnson, Waiters, Dragic, Richardson). They can't even resign DWade and he's coming off that sweet, sweet Chicago buyout money, do they use up their MLE for nostalgia? Their future rests on Adebayo and Winslow, and Winslow is already almost off his rookie deal.   * Cleveland, if Lebron leaves. Even worse situation than Miami because of how they've bled draft picks. Like Miami they can probably rally into the bottom of the EC playoffs as a 6-8 seed behind a Hill/Love combo with some role players tossed in, but they've lost a lot of draft picks and have very little young talent to work with. They have to hit a home run with their lotto pick this year to have any kind of hope if Lebron leaves (especially if he goes to like Philly which won't have to do a sign and trade. At least with the Rockets they can probably get the 2020 and 2022 1st rounders to eat Ryan Anderson's contract in the sign and trade)  * OKC if George doesn't resign, but Melo opts in. On one hand, they'll probably just cut Melo immediately and it'll be 1 year of pain. But think of everything they gave up, to end up with nothing but a wasted 2018-2019 season (because the Melo cap hold will prevent them from doing anything), they're looking at an empty 9-11 finish in the West (just good enough to not be a useful lottery pick) and then having a 31-32 year old Russell Westbrook in 2019-2020 with nothing but Steven Adams as help and a $38 million a year cap figure. Ouch  * Detroit Pistons. I guess this depends on whether you think the Blake Griffin/Drummond pairing can be salvaged, but they make up 50-60% of the salary cap alone and neither is going anywhere for awhile. Either it works or it doesn't, and if it doesn't it'll be hard for them to either tank or move forward. It's a little ironic, because they were kind of in this situation before and the boldest thing Van Gundy did when he first came in is cut Josh Smith loose to try and move forward. Time really is a flat circle.   It gets a little harder to find a fifth, so I'll just do some honorable mentions that can kind of be lumped together.  * Portland * New Orleans  * Washington  All three teams are potential second round playoff teams, so they aren't in the same depressing boat as the above, but none of them have any clear path to get any better. No young talent expecting to make a huge leap or upcoming lottery picks, lots of long-term, hard to move contracts, no cap flexibility. This has consequences. Watch Portland spend too much on Nurkic (because they can't replace him if he walks), and New Orleans will be dropping a large contract on a big man coming off an achilles injury despite a potentially awkward fit. I, of course, think Cousins will come back and play his best basketball and the ""awkward fit"" will instantly turn into ""hard to defend"" and take basketball by storm....but I can see how objective outsiders may be more skeptical.  Washington went through this situation already last year when they had to drop $100 million on Otto Porter who, like Nurkic, good player, but not worth the contract he got.   I wouldn't call their situation bad, all three of these teams are going to produce multiple seasons of entertaining basketball and that's never worthless, but it's hard to see a different path forward for them outside of the teams they are now.  Incidentally, I *don't* think the Spurs are in as bad a shape as some people may think. If they have to trade Leonard, Leonard is worth a lot more than say a Lebron James sign &amp; trade. He's under contract, and while he can opt out in 2019-2020, he won't be a sign and trade. Anyone who doesn't want to pay SA's price would have to clear cap space for two seasons and hope they get him, that's a bold (and probably desperate) strategy.  If SA has to move Kawhi (who has a very friendly $20 million cap number) they'll be able to offload some deadweight with him. You're definitely getting Patty Mills alongside Kawhi.  Which means other than whatever young players they want to keep (Murray, White, Anderson, Betrans, etc) + Pau Gasol's $7 million buyout, they'll have a clear cap sheet in 2019-2020. "

"My reason for picking MJ over LeBron is this; if we think about the reason why Kareem isn't considered the GOAT, despite having a stellar college and pro career, it basically comes down to people believing his height was a major factor in his success, that his unstoppable sky hook was more a result of natural gifts than hard work in perfecting his skills. Which is dumb of course, but it's still hard for many people not to think that. Now, if height is a major advantage for Kareem, I'd say size is a major one too for LeBron. The guy is just a unit! That strength enables him to do things that most people wouldn't. Those drives to the hole, power dunks and blocks, etc. Of course, it's dumb to just consider LeBron all about size, coz his basketball IQ is probably the biggest asset he has. Now when it comes to Michael Jordan, at first glance, he doesn't have a clear advantage over the other NBA players. So when you watch him play, you realize that his skills put him in a category above everyone else. A scoring champion who was a defensive beast! People talk about numbers and like assists and rebounds to pick LeBron over Jordan, but if you look at the type of systems both guys played in, LeBron is successful when surrounded by shooters, which means that his drive and kick game will naturally lead to more assists. On the other hand however, MJ played in the triangle offense, which had more ball movement and meant that he wasn't a facilitator. If you look at his assist numbers before Phil Jackson became the head coach, he averaged 8 assists that season. MJ also averaged more offensive rebounds than LeBron. We have seen with Russell Westbrook that those are really the numbers to pay attention to as you won't get freebies in that category  even from your own teammates.   The most important thing in the LeBron vs Jordan thing for me though comes down to this: if Jordan had played in the West, we know that he'd reach at least 6 finals(possibly more) and win them, considering he beat the best in both conferences all the times he won a chip. If LeBron however played in the West, he'd only have played in 2 - 3 finals. Even possibly less, considering the Ray Allen shot and the Draymond suspension.   I know GOAT discussions will forever be subjective and everyone will have their favorite. That's fine. This is just my opinion. "
"absolutely. He's a winner. He's the perfect nba weapon. He's an amazing teammate. He provides the most spacing in the NBA. He's incredibly efficient. Produces on off nights. His instincts are amazing, this guy is just more clever than the average baller. Amazing vision.  Not afraid of the moment. Not afraid of risk or adversity. He's doesn't need to dribble to be effective. He doesn't need the ball to make his team better. You put curry on any team and their team is better no matter how you fit it.  People will look at Curry and Westbrook and probably see it as Russell and Wilt. They'll not get the nuance of his game and what he does to separate teams he's on from being average and it's a shame.   ALL HAIL CURRY!"
I'm doubting that trading for a 33 y/o Melo on a two year deal effected Russell Westbrook signing his extension.
"When listening to sports radio or on lots of talk shows when ever they mention superstars they often say” a Lebron James, a Kevin Durant, a James Harden, a Russell Westbrook.” And then they get to their point or they’ll talk about top point guards and talk about Chris Paul, Lilard and Westbrook and dove into their topic and never even mention him. I get that he was injured for a lot of the season but come on you could at least mention him. I don’t need them to gush about him but you shouldn’t ignore that he exists."

"I could be wrong, but when people say Russell Westbrook held back OKC/KD and that Russell can't be a 2nd option on a contender. That went to 4(?) Conference Finals and the NBA Finals, Durant had his MVP season there. Lots of success up until KD left. Unless we are saying that he held the team back from winning 5 chips in a row. Also, this all happened while he was one of the most 1st option-iest 2nd options ever. I think Russell plays a selfish, low IQ style of ball, but I think it's because he's been told that how his teams win games."
Victor Oladipo is a better version of Russell Westbrook than Russell Westbrook.

"I wish LeBron was weird enough to see reigning in Westbrook as enough of a challenge to boost his career. He subtly treats Russell like a horse saying things like ""Whoa there, easy Russ!"" while Westbrook sometimes acts up, but sometimes doesn't."
"Theres no doubt his job is made easier by playing with the Warriors than when he was playing with Russell fucking Westbrook. That doesnt mean the cavs were just giving him wide open layups and dunks the whole series. He had one wide open dunk that everyone focuses on, but also made a lot of other contested shots as well. "

"
Ah the Russell Westbrook method 
"\&gt; I think Andrea Bargnani is a great player and that with the right coach and fanbase he could dominate.  \&gt; Kyrie Irving will never win a championship  \&gt;Lebron is past his physical peak and has begun his physical decline. This isn't to say he can't adjust his game and keep up his production, but I think the best and most explosive dunking days are behind him.  \&gt; I'm totally biased, but I think Dion Waiters will emerge as the best guard to come out of the 2012 draft. Better than Lillard or Beal.  \&gt;I think Lebron is far more comparable to Scottie Pippen than to MJ and that people just tend to forget how good some of the guys from the past were. And I'd rather have Scottie than Lebron.  \&gt;Monta Ellis is better than Russell Westbrook.  lol"
Oscar would go Westbrook sure idk about being top 10 in my list. I just picked by who would exploit the rules best while making players better.  In today's era I'd select Russell before Wilt.
"&gt; Why would you want him over someone like Westbrook, Curry, or Irving?  Because Paul is at least good at everything.  - Magic Johnson: Wasn't a good Defender, Bad Shooter (for all but like three seasons); CP3 is great at both of those  - Russell Westbrook: Not a good Defender, Questionable Decision Making, Bad Shooter; CP3 is/was great at all of those  - Jason Kidd: Arguably the shittiest scorer for a player of his caliber, has the nickname ""Ason Kidd"" for his lack of a jumper (which he later developed); CP3 is a great shooter and scorer (People will hate because he has never been a huge scorer like Westbrook but ha has averaged 18.7ppg for his career which is less than a point below Reggie Miller in Miller's first 13 seasons)  Chris Paul can  - Shoot  - Draw Fouls  - Finish  - Break your ankles with his handles  - Eat up rebounds (Career 4.5rpg as a 6 footer and he just had a career high at 32)  - Force Turnovers, career 2.3spg, 6x Steals Leader  - Lock your guard up, 9x All-Defense  - Has an assist to turnover ratio on par with Magic (Amazing Facilitator)  - Was athletic as fuck (One time he dunked on Dwight) before he destroyed his knee and after doing so continued to be amazing (didn't need to be as athletic to destroy your team).  CP3 is great at a lot of things and at least 'good' at every other skill that is required/necessary at his position unlike most other players including greats.  edit"
" Russell Westbrook is only as good as his bigmen are at rebounding/boxing out. Once he loses Adams his efficiency and +/- will be abysmal, whereas Adams' play will be remniscient of peak Andre Drummond.   The Sixers will never make the finals with their current core. (Embiid/Simmons)  Ben Simmons rookie year is basically his peak/he will never develop a jumpshot  Joel Embiid will never play a full season  Donovan Mitchell will be the best player in the league in 6 years  LeBron James will never win another championship"

"No for maximum suffering, trade him for Russell Westbrook. "
"My dad is a pretty casual sports fan, really mostly just follows sometimes because of me, and even he noticed that Russell Westbrook and Andray Blatche were pretty selfish and bad when we watched them (This was years ago, when Westbrook’s positives were outweighed by his negatives)."
"Most improved player to me is going to from tier 3 to tier 2, or tier 2 to tier 1. That is, it's a clear improvement, but it doesn't necessarily imply that your team is a contending team. For example, the case of Oladipo fits well. He was a tier 2 player, and now has emerged as a tier 1, capable of carrying a franchise.  MVPs are not given just to Russell Westbrook because he averaged a triple double. It does sound great, but his team was still 6th seed, and with no expectations of making an impact in the playoffs. That's a ridiculous award for stat padding. This year he averaged again a triple double, and his team only managed to win one more game in the regular season and the playoffs. I don't think he is even in contention for top 5 in MVP votes (Harden, Lebron, Davis, Lillard, ... DeRozan? Kyrie? Durant? Curry? Westbrook?).  But when Nash really took the Suns to the playoffs using that amazing offense, you could really see that he transformed completely the league with their style of play. It's not just a nod that he surprised the league. He actually put them in contention."
Why was Russell Westbrook in it. And u gotta shit on Lonzo 😂😂
"It's unenforceable and shouldn't be attempted to be enforced.    If you build a great team that everyone wants to play with/on, you deserve to reap the benefits of it.  If you build your team around someone like Russell Westbrook, you won't be able to keep other top-level talent no matter how much you pay them, and that's the way it should be.  "
"What if the Heat drafted Russell Westbrook instead of Michael Beasley or what if Lebron stayed but that one seems less plausible in my opinion. We could have had a developing Russ next to Lebron, Bosh, and Wade instead of Chalmers, imagine that."
"&gt; ""There's an increasing number of people around the league who think the Thunder should look at trading [Russell] Westbrook. To be clear, not a report. Not Thunder sources think they should do this. Just in spitballing ideas with teams around the league, there's a number of people who have heard, just like, 'It's time for something to change here.'""  ""Nobody think they're going to trade him, but you know what would be a siiiiick headline?"""
"Maybe, maybe not. Shit isn't a computer simulation. Maybe more usage = more turnovers = less confidence = worse shooting. Maybe that feeds into a cycle and in three years he's doing his best Russell Westbrook impression, taking 40 jumpers a game. "
"Lol Pippen made Jordan.  Jordan didn’t win a playoff series before Pippen was on the team, let alone a chip.  Scotty will be forever slept on, but he had game.  And a massive schlong.  If he doesn’t come around, Jordan might have just been Russell Westbrook"
"Athleticism is probably the wrong word, all NBA players are elite, once in a lifetime athletes.  It's just shorthand for saying he's not Russell Westbrook where you'd worry his game would suffer in his mid-30's."
"They have completely different play styles. Russell Westbrook is the better distributor, rebounder, and more of a volume scorer  whose main threat is driving it in. Dames biggest threat is his shooting and is more efficient of a scorer but not as good as a distributor or rebounder."
"I mean why can Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant be successful then in selling their gear when they're around as good as Leonard and they were in freaking Oklahoma City? No, just being in those places isn't going to instantly make you a charismatic player whose gear they'll want to buy. With stuff like Internet and all of that the location matters less and less, and it's more about how personable/funny you can be in commercials/interviews and stuff to make your things fly off shelves. Look at how Kawhi was in that recent Jordan commercial. They'e not portraying him as quiet dude who does nothing. They play off that, in fact, to make the commerical. "

"&gt; Kobe, Gasol, and Odom are a superteam  Fuck no lmao. Kyrie and Love have both made All-NBA Teams. Odom never came anywhere remotely close to an All-Star team. Hell Love made All-NBA teams before playing with LeBron and Kyrie was clearly on a career trajectory towards All-NBA selections, while Pau got fewer All-NBA votes than Mehmet Okur and Eddy Curry his last year in Memphis.  &gt; No because any advanced stat will show how inefficient Westbrook is  That's **ALL-TIME RECORD HOLDER FOR SINGLE SEASON VORP LEADER** Russell Westbrook to you. You know, the advanced stat that actually measurably has the most predictive power ? Yeah, that one. '17 Westbrook &gt; any Lebron ever, confirmed."
Yeah but the problem is you're just basing that on regular season performance. Russell Westbrook was phenomenal in 2017 regular season and James Harden in 2018 but that doesn't make them the best players in the game especially while it is known Lebron is coasting. I know I never bought into the idea that Curry is the best player in the game because I knew Lebron was coasting and I knew Curry was unproven.

Did I even mention Dirk in my comment? I’m just saying Westbrook has been past Dame this whole time.  Frankly it looks like this whole conversation involving Dirk is about a guy staying with a team his whole career so no shit Dirk has been around longer? And Russell been around longer than Dame? I don’t see the point in this comment
Are you talking about Russell Westbrook? Westbrook will make the hof. The majority of mvps will. But to average a triple double two seasons in a row?
"&gt;Russell Westbrook has better stats than both of them over the last 2 seasons, but he's (rightfully) not in this discussion.  Better ""stats"" in terms of just per game stats. But not better in advanced stats since he shoots like 43%."
"It just feels disingenuous to name anyone else honestly.  It’s a nice counter to those who haterade. What options are there? AD? I mean he’s got all the tools, but...you know.  KD? Not even unarguably the best on his own team  Then, Steph? You can just feel it’s not true.  James Harden? Nephew... Russell Westbrook? Wellll, I can see that tho for a certain subset of people. "
"In 9 minutes per game he played without Durant, he had 38% usage on 69% shooting - that's scoring more than 10 points in 9 minutes of game. That would break some more talked-about records if he scored like that for 40 minutes. But let's say that he looked okay, and the result was okay. When Durant plays, he settles back a lil bit, shares more, tries to play more safe, but Warriors on the whole probably have better, more reliable offense.  On the other hand, KD moving gave us a chance to see the fun of Russell Westbrook doing his one man army show, so that was not the worst too."
"Dwayne Wade recruited two stars to come play with him in Miami.  Russell Westbrook started on a team with two other stars and now balls by himself (assuming like I do that PG is gone, and that Melo is no longer a star)."
"[Huh, weird, I didn't know that.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambidexterity#Basketball) Also apparently Russell Westbrook and Larry Bird were the same way, and Simmons and Luke Kennard are the opposite (righties who shoot lefty)."
"I love Russell Westbrook, but Russ and OKC's culture are a match made in hell. OKC are way too soft on guys and Russ needs a coach and organization to show him less love love and way more tough love. He's self-motivated but he's misguided in thinking that the best way for him to help the team is to do it himself. The same applied to Durant but he had the balls to get out and go to GS where everyone is held accountable. Also bonus: Durant didn't leave OKC because of Westbrook OR because of ""the easiest road"", it's because the culture in GS is what he thinks basketball should be and realized OKC was holding him back from being the best player he could be by just saying ""nah KD, you and Russ are good enough to get this done eventually."" If you watch the KD docu series, he's gone once we don't sign Pau Gasol. He doesn't look at the Warriors as ""the easy road"", just an organization that takes all the necessarily steps to ensure winning at every level. He doesn't look at OKC as that."
"I understand ur prob sick of people shitting on Russ so i won't take offense but I think [this article](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23364202/zach-lowe-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-nba) and especially this quote really drive home my point.   &gt; Westbrook is not as innovative a passer as James or Harden. He has led the league in assists mostly making drive-and-kick passes the defense expects. It is a tribute to Westbrook's greatness that he can break apart defenses so often, and so completely, as to lead the NBA in assists making expected passes. James and Harden make unexpected passes. They are two and three steps ahead. James especially triggers passing sequences. **The Thunder ranking dead last in total passes is an annual tradition.**"
Russell Westbrook. He won an MVP. 
"Was that what his role was in OKC? After watching that last game, I thought his role was to be an on the court spectator to the Russell Westbrook Show."
"&gt; 1 - Russell Westbrook smothers talent and cannot/will not win an NBA title as a first option  that, and i'm fairly convinced he can't play as a second option. period. "
Russell Westbrook would've won a title if he stopped playing point guard and started playing shooting guard.    
Ingram and ball  Ingram was getting Durant comparisons during the draft. In 6-7 years he'll be matching durant's production from when he was 27. Gotta remember he's also a full year younger than Jaylen.   Ball averaged 10/7/7 as a 19 year old rookie who missed a lot of time. I can only imagine what stats he'll put up in his prime. He'll basically become Russell westbrook averaging triple doubles year after year
"One of Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook or James Harden    At least one of those guys have never been a top 5 player for everybody so whomever that is for you should be the answer "
"If we’re limited to these positions: Erik Spoelstra, Russell Westbrook, Klay Thompson, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Rudy Gobert.  If we can rearrange some things: Erik Spoelstra, LeBron James, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic."
"-When it's all said &amp; done, in the future, people will forget about LeBron's record in the Finals &amp; instead, praise for making (so far) 7 straight Finals appearances.  I can name countless NBA players, Hall of Famers, etc.. that struggled just to make 1 &amp; even worse, none at all.  -It might be a while until the Lakers become elite, championship contenders.  -Russell Westbrook will never hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy.  -Piggy backing off the previous opinion, I believe if OKC never traded Harden, they would've been the dominant team for multiple years in the West just how GS is right now."
"If you get to the free throw line, percentages matter less. The real number is ""points per shot"". Don't take shots if you aren't getting points. I completely agree with what you are saying. I'm a Lebron James fan, he does PPS amazingly. But James Harden does it even better (he gets to the free throw line by selling fouls like a boss). Unlike Russell Westbrook who cannot make a shot, but still takes all the shots he wants. He led the NBA in attempts by a large margin, but was barely top 10 in points."
"He does but so does Russell Westbrook. What separates the 2 is that Lebron finds a way to win. As did Kobe. I'm not going to downplay Lebron's accomplishment in 2017 because it wouldn't be an easy feat for anybody. There's no way for me to provide evidence that Kobe would be able to match that, but you can't just say that he wouldn't either.  IMO the greatest playoff run of all time by any player was Dirk Nowitzki in 2011. Switch Lebron and Dirk that year and can you comfortably say that Lebron wins with the Mavs or even makes it to the finals? It doesn't mean Dirk is better all time than Lebron. This is sports and amazing things happen from time to time. You can't just say that someone as good as Kobe definitely wouldn't be able to match Lebron had they switched places."
"You're right about context. So why is it that so many people only point to stats when it comes to Lebron v Kobe? Russell Westbrook has better stats than both of them over the last 2 seasons, but he's \(rightfully\) not in this discussion.  Lebron's obviously been the best player in the sport for a long time and is an all time great with an argument for the GOAT. I don't believe he is, but I think it's valid to put him up there. That being said, it's ridiculous to me how many people dismiss Kobe as not even being on his level. That's crazy and you'll never hear that from current or former players."
"&gt; That’s arrogance to you?  Never said it was.  But its definitely multiple ""clap backs"" and pot-stirring.  &gt; I’m sure you’ll be the first to recognize that Simmons saying that MO other rookie caught his eye was more disrespectful, right?  Not at all.  He said no rookie caught his eye because he focuses on watching Top 5 players and not his peers.  The quote:  &gt; ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  Mitchell standing up for Ben is cool tho and indicates there's no actual beef."
We could be talking about Mike Conley or Russell Westbrook the same way in a few years
Russell Westbrook is/was a decent FT shooter in his first year. Ben not so much.
"Look, the argument was ""WOW he's extra special bc the league doesn't play a high usage style!"" and the rebuttal is ""they don't, but he does for his team.""  Doncic got his by playing like Russell Westbrook against the worst team in the ACB. That's all it is."
Russell Westbrook. The supposed MVP can´t win a playoff series even with a stacked team. Sad. 
&gt;Russell Westbrook smothers talent and cannot/will not win an NBA title as a first option  This is not unpopular at all.  
1 - Russell Westbrook smothers talent and cannot/will not win an NBA title as a first option  2 - CP3 is still a choker in spite of his game 6 against Utah.  Beating a beat up Jazz team is no reason to prop him up as an all-time great.  I expect a full collapse in the conference finals against Golden State
He surgically removed Russell Westbrook from his heart
The Russell Westbrook of his era.

"Dude got clamped by Thanasis Antetekounmpo. He struggles against nba level athletes. Don’t just take numbers as the holy grail. Kevin Love is 1 inch away from having the same vertical as Russell Westbrook.   Plus the height reached vs NBA guards doesn’t make sense, he’s 6’7. He should be able to get higher than 73% of guards. Same thing with his standing reach. "
Russell Westbrook is bad
"There was a kid at my school that I HATED and he was supporting the miami heat in the 2012 NBA finals. In spite of this guy, I decided to support the opposite team to him - The Oklahoma City Thunder (A team I knew NOTHING about)  The miami heat won the NBA championships and I had to listen to Fat Jack brag about how his team was the best. Then we had James Harden leave and go to the rockets. This was not a good time for me.  The next year I followed basketball and thoroughly enjoyed the passion that Russell and Kevin played with. From the close games with Memphis is the playoffs to somehow beating the (What I thought at the time) UNBEATABLE San antonio Spurs.  Kevin leaving was one of the most unpredictable things I expected happening to our organisation (Fuck KD). But I now dont hold that against him. I actually wouldnt mind if KD, James harden and Russ all came together in there later ages of Basketball.  That left one person, Russell Westbrook.   Though he may shoot some of the worst shots i have ever seen, he's made some of the greatest shots I have ever seen. From the game against Viktor Oladipo and the Orlando Magic to The youngsters on the Denver nuggets, Russell has always reminded me on why I love basketball.   "

"&gt; There are maybe 10 players in the NBA making more than $1 million a year on endorsements  There's a lot more than 10 players making $1M+  1. LeBron James: $52 million  2.

"I was bored today so I took a shot at this. I have Klay just inside my Top 20 and Draymond just outside.

"No it's not hypocritical. Pop's job is to prepare and coach his players. He's also supposed to defend them in the media. His job isn't to police the league for dirty plays.  Zaza has a [history just as bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2XqX1Ig08) as Bowen's. Zaza has a history with not only the Spurs, but with Kawhi specifically! [Other players have called him out on it](https://sports.yahoo.com/russell-westbrook-kyrie-irving-call-zaza-pachulia-dirty-player-054357615.html), just like what used to happen to Bowen.  You really expect Pop to stay silent when shit like this happened over the course of a couple seasons? To his star player no less?  Defending Bowen's aggressiveness and condemning Zaza's unnatural closeout are the same thing: he's defending his guys.  The real difference between Bynum/MWP and Bowen's step under is that stepping under someone's foot is dirty. What Bynum/MWP did could've been lethal. Pop would absolutely not defend a Spurs player - even Tim Duncan - if he clearly and purposefully unloaded and elbow into the back of someones head.  My point is that of course Spurs fans are going to still like Bowen and appreciate him, even if he was dirty, just like you guys did with MWP/Bynum. Just because a player who was a major contributor for us over a decade ago did some dirty shit, that doesn't mean we will tolerate dirty play that targets our guys. If that was the case, no fans would be able to criticize dirty play."
"I agree, OKC almost took GSW out with KD and Russell, and I think Curry&gt;Westbrook."
Times were special back then...Stephen A would have spontaneously combusted on live air if this happened today with Russell Westbrook 
"&gt;I don't know how problematic the 'wide reaching' conclusions are if they're true, though, right?  I don't know what you're getting at. You can't look at 2 minutes of tape of a player and make far reaching conclusions about their entire career playstyle.  &gt;Like what I was saying in my reply there; he had shortcomings as a passer from the high post, but I'm not aware of any other players who overcame that issue so I couldn't say whether or not those shortcomings were enough to disqualify him from the best-high-post-passer title.  Again this is a conclusion you can't reach given the evidence presented. You can make the same video with Vlade and make the same conclusion if you wanted to. You'd be wrong, but that's what El Gee did.  &gt;On Rodman...I dunno dude, maybe he fucked the Spurs over but he cleaned up for the Bulls, and my entire point there was that he was a better pure rebounder,  He did the same thing on the late Pistons and on the Bulls. The Spurs was just a time where he literally cost them a playoff game. There are many players who put up ""empty rebounds"", Marcus Camby, Westbrook, etc. If Wilt or Russell did the same thing they would be able to surpass Rodman easily. There were also many rebounders that dominated the boards against Rodman. Look at Karl Malone vs. Rodman in the 97 and 98 finals. He grabs 15 and 16 rebounds per game in the RS and half that against Malone. In 1992 he gets outboarded by Patrick Ewing when in the RS he reached his all-time best of nearly 19 a game. In the deciding final game Ewing outrebounded Rodman 19 to 9 with 7 offensive boards for Ewing. These were the first 3 playoff series I checked. I stand by that Rodman was a stat padder and when it actually mattered and he had to actually play defense his numbers suddenly drop. On the other hand with Wilt and Russell you can see their rebounding numbers go up, even when facing eachother, despite the game slowing down for the playoffs."
"Hmm that's a good question, and hard to say because a lot of these FMVPs that I would consider ""good but not great"" like Jo Jo White or Dennis Johnson ended up making the Hall of Fame, presumably in part due to their playoff success. Cedric Maxwell ('81) is the only one who did not.  Of the guys not yet eligible, they should all make it. Chauncey ...? *May* make it. Tony Parker will probably make it based on the titles (although I wouldn't call him a historically great player), Iguodala is borderline at best...  So far, every eligible MVP has made the Hall of Fame, but that's getting borderline in the future too. Derrick Rose probably will not, I suspect... Russell Westbrook probably *will*?"
I just realized Russell Westbrook averaged another triple double this season. Was this mentioned? I didn't see it much. Most of the OKC stuff I saw was about PG or Melo (or them vs the Jazz).   I guess it's not as cool the second time but to me it's still really impressive. Especially since he had to share the ball with 2 stars this seasons instead.
Y’all would take Russell Westbrook on your team in a heartbeat if you’ve seen how consistently ballsy he plays every single game for his entire career 
OKC are very good dunkers  Russell Westbrook  Terrance Ferguson  Paul George  Jerami Grant  Steven Adams  Andre Roberson  Alex Abrines  Josh Huestis
"But Wade led his team. You need to rewatch the Spurs in 2017. They were up 22 (somewhere in the 20s) third quarter against GS until Kawhi went out with an injury. They then proceeded to lose the game. It doesn't matter what you say, the facts show that Kawhi was amazing last season, especially in the playoffs. He has also finished in the top 3 in MVP voting in 2016 &amp; 2017, something Embiid hasn't done even this one year. I can't see how you're arguing for an All-NBA second team guy vs a perennial MVP candidate.   Simmons played better one season, which coincidentally was the same season PG went to be a second option to Russell Westbrook. I'd like to see Ben Simmons averaging 28 points in the playoffs consistently. He failed this year against a team missing two All-Stars. It's his fault they lost that series. 15 straight means nothing if you die off in the playoffs and it doesn't help that those games without Embiid were against some of the worst teams in the league. For you to argue that Simmons is better than PG off one season is pretty dumb, and it's even worse when you take into account PG is in a harder conference and has prove himself to be far better throughout the playoffs and his career.  Honestly, I looked at your post history and you seem to have be very biased towards 6ers players to an extent that just destroys rationality. It's just plain dumb to say Simmons is better than a guy who did so well against two-time NBA champs and does better in the playoffs than he does the regular season. Also dumb to say a guy who just got All-NBA Second team is better than a consistent MVP candidate. You're letting your team bias get to you."
Russell Westbrook is my favourite player in the league 
"Russell Westbrook, Eric bledsoe, John wall, rajon rondo.   All are comparable weights to NFL receivers, and they are certainly not too slow. There are plenty of fast enough NBA players that could play wr that are also not considered too tall. "
"You're not talking about rule changes, you're talking about Wilt complaining about Shaq getting calls like Russell Westbrook would complain about Durant getting them. Wilt couldn't do that to anyone because no one even defended with their body back then, which is apparent when you watch tape."
I'll take one Russell Westbrook please
"The best way to think of players like Russell Westbrook is that they are high floor, low(er) ceiling players.  Players who dominate the ball, don't get teammates involved, don't play strong defense and don't contribute well off the ball on offense don't offer a lot of benefit to the team when they don't have the ball.  That means when you get more talented offensive teammates, the team doesn't get to it's highest ceiling because there's only one ball. Whereas someone like Curry helps Durant because he draws defenses to him, can hit an open three if the D collapses on Durant, etc. There's a reason no one doubled Durant off Curry or Klay in the finals.  But the Russell Westbrooks are still super valuable. Dominating the ball is not a negative if you are really, really good. LeBron dominates the ball, and while he contributes to his teammates in more ways, you still want him running every possesion. Westbrook isn't LeBron, but the reality is, his ability to always get to the rim, his effort level, means that you can't be that bad on offense. Compare him to a Draymond Green -- who scales wonderfully with great players. If you flipped Dray and Westbrook (on a Paul George-less Thunder), both teams get significantly worse.  My biggest issue with Westbrook in this space is that he doesn't recognize any of this. He would work better with his teammates if he would simply not take shots when he's tired or not willing to drive to the hoop.  If he just eliminated the shots where he clearly doesn't have the energy to take a good shot, he'd be such a better player."
Russell Westbrook wins a championship. 
I'll delete my account if Russell Westbrook ever wins an NBA Finals. 
Russell Westbrook team. He’s the opposite of kd. A true competitor. I also love Steven Adams.
I'll delete my account if OKC ever trades Russell Westbrook.
"yeah, because he shot 2173 times and shot 27 times per game. No other player has shot 2000 times in a season from 1986-2018 other than MJ, and only three other players have even shot it 1900 times (Jerry Stackhouse, Allen Iverson, Russell Westbrook). Hardly anyone even has even averaged 24 FGA per game in the last 2 decades, and that was what Russ did last year when his usage was off the charts. Of course you’re going to average more PPG if you’re chucking up 27 shots a game.   Iverson shot 24 times per game once and that was the 20th highest scoring season ever. KD has the highest PPG season in the 2010s and he didn’t even shoot 21 times a game. You probably won’t see anyone will 27 shots per game for a season ever again.  I’m not saying it’s easy to do, but he did shoot quite a bit.  EDIT: lol Kobe fans with all the downvotes. I’m just stating facts"
"Imo [this article](http://www.backpicks.com/2017/12/04/backpicks-goat-9-wilt-chamberlain/) really thoroughly debunks the idea of Wilt as the greatest ever. He's still one of the best ever--because of his defense--but his offense is really overrated. And it has nothing to do with weak competition.  [here's a chart of Wilt's season averages plotted against his team's offensive efficiency](http://www.backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Wilts-Correlation-PPG-and-Team-ORtg.png)  4 of Wilt's top 6 scoring years were on an below-average offenses. The other two were barely above. What the hell is the point of scoring 45 points if your team still has a below average offense? LeBron could turn Tristan thompson and 3 Jose Calderons into a top 5 offense--Wilt scoring 40-50 points a game simply wasn't making anyone better. The best offenses of Wilt's career are all on years he scored roughly between 15 and 25 points.   [Here's another chart](http://www.backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TSA-to-Ast-Ratio.png) that shows early Wilt was by far the greatest black hole in league history.   In 1965 he spends half the season on worst offense in the league. He gets traded to the 76ers, and in 1967 they hire a coach that convinces him to pass more. Wilt averages near 8 assists a game, the 76ers start 37-4, and it immediately becomes the greatest offense (to that point) in league history. For a moment it looks like Wilt has truly become a complete player. The next season wilt becomes obsessed with passing (like he previously was with scoring), and decides to lead the league in assists. He does! But he's chasing stats again, and the team regresses.  Wilt's whole career is full of examples like this, where he chases stats in a way that would make Russell Westbrook feel shame. Here's a really ridiculous one:  &gt;[Wilt] became fixated on setting the field goal percentage record and at the end of the 1973 season would pass up easy shots to preserve his shooting numbers.  &gt;&gt;“March 28, 1973, Chamberlain didn’t attempt a shot or take a single free throw while playing 46 minutes in an 85-84 loss to Milwaukee. Coach Bill Sharman, when asked why Wilt didn’t shoot, said, ‘I don’t know why. You will have to ask him. That really hurt, him not shooting’ -St. Petersburg Times, March 29, 1973  &gt;&gt;“Wilt Chamberlain, who entered the game with 24 successful field goal attempts in a row, kept the streak alive in an unconventional fashion. He took no shots at all” – The Milwaukee Journal, March 28, 1973”  Chamberlain never dominated offensively like Jordan, Shaq, or LeBron. On defense, sure. On offense, he was more like a big-man version of Russell Westbrook, except with the stamina to play 48 minutes of stat chasing basketball. He played in a less-scrutinized, non-analytic era where not only did many fans not understand how Wilt shooting basically all the shots was hurting his team, but his *coaches* didn't either. Wilt found his most team success (and won his only two championships) when he played with coaches that didnt let him do that shit"
1. Send Kyrie Irving to the Jazz  2. Send Russell Westbrook to the Rockets  3. Ben Simmons to the Bucks  4. Joel Embid to the Raptors  5. Send Anthony Davis to Cleveland  
Russell Westbrook
"I remember watching it...Affectionately call it the ""Smush Era"".  Kobe made Russell Westbrook look like John Stockton that season...The last KB8 season before he switched numbers. Shoutout to those fucking moon boots that he made everyone buy in the early 2K also. Ugliest shoes ever. He redeemed himself with his Nike Line at the end of his career though as far as his shoes were concerned lol"
"I was going say if Paul George signs with us, but apparently he was still using the Thunder private jet a few weeks ago so he hasn't completely let go.  I'll delete my account if Russell Westbrook averages another triple double next season. Its going to happen isnt it. Fuck"
"David Robinson, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Dwight Howard, Tim Duncan, Russell Westbrook."
"1. Lebron 2. Kevin Durant 3. Steph Curry 4. James Harden 5. Russell Westbrook.   The first 4 for obvious reasons, Westbrook because the dude averaged a triple double for the whole season!"
PG Damian Llilard   SG ???   SF LeBron James  PF Anthony Davis  C ???  6th - Russell Westbrook  Damn this Lakers all-rumored team is gonna be off the charts 
"Let's compare starters and reserves  Golden State:  PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: LeBron James  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Draymond Green  Bench:  PG: Shaun Livingstone  SG: Nick Young  SF: Andre Iguodala  PF: Jordan Bell  C: Javale McGee  USA:  PG: Russell Westbrook  SG: James Harden  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Paul George  C: Anthony Davis  Bench:  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Jimmy Butler  PF: Gordon Hayward  C: Joel Embiid  Sure, Golden State will probably win the starters matchup, but unless they play all 48 minutes, their reserves are gonna get slaughtered."
People don’t consider Russell Westbrook the best point guard of this era either assists aren’t everything
"Yeah... There was a time around like 2013 that I was really contrarian and thought Wilt was the GOAT but I realized after some research and just learning more about the NBA that that was not true and seeing Russell Westbrook makes me realize that even more that stats (especially box score stats) aren’t everything. Russell Westbrook had the greatest season in NBA history by a mile according to BPM so I definitely think we are going to see people say he is one of the GOATs in the future, especially if he were able to get a ring at some point."
I understand Wilt better having watched Russell Westbrook the last couple years. I suspect in 2-3 decades people on the internet will be wondering why RWB wasn't considered the best player of his time. 
"&gt; Where Jordan accepted a fairly set role and was even willing to give the ball up to play with the team, LeBron imposes his will on both the opponent and his own team, forcing everyone to adapt.  Michael Jordan is the all time NBA/ABA leader in usage rate and lead the league in usage 8 times. That’s right - he’s ahead of “mega ball hog” Russell Westbrook even with his years on the wizards included.    LeBron is 7th and has only lead the league once.   You can’t just make stuff up.   "
Do we give credit to Russell Westbrook for the emergence of Kevin Durant and James Harden? 
"Bcuz Russell Westbrook seems stubborn as fuck to play with and their system was not utilizing KD/WB’s talents simultaneously. They lost the WCF thanks to hero ball when up 3-1. It seemed like both KD and WB were both making bonehead play after bonehead play to lose the game. So I can understand that he’d want to leave, esp to the “company” that he went to"
Thunder fans think since Westbrook got them there last year that he could do it again. Russell Westbrook will never be that good again. That was his PRIME year. Not to mention the West is slowly getting stronger. 
Russell Westbrook
Russell “stat stealer” Westbrook 
"Everyone is saying the obvious answer which is Russell Westbrook, but here's why:  He's selfish.  He has low bball IQ.  And most importantly, his play style won't win at the highest level in today's NBA."
Russell Westbrook by far
Russell Westbrook is the easy answer so I'll go with Kyrie.
"Russell Westbrook, or as I like to call him Josh Smith If He Was A Point Guard"
"Russell Westbrook will be making $46,662,000 in the 2022-23 season at age 33."
"&gt; 3 and 4 aren't definitive , but are notable   &gt; Part 3, Toss Up: Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook      &gt;From my research I'd say there's at least 5 of the 25 best players ever in the league now, playing at a high level, and possibly as many as 11  Did you read what OP posted entirely before bashing it?   "
"I don't know if there is an NBA player that has as big of a green light as Kobe did. Curry and Westbrook are the only ones that come to mind and Curry is a guaranteed Hall of Fame player while Russ is Russ.  Edit: because I hate to just say things without statistical support, Kobe averages 19.5 shots a game. If we remove his first two seasons and his injury season from the average his realistic career average is 21 shots/game. (20.96875 rounded to 21).  League Leaders from the last 5 years who beat that mark?  Russel Westbrook (2017: 21.1 fga/game. 2016: 24 fga/game. 2014: 22 fga/game.) and Melo (2013: 21.3 fga/game.) If we stretch it back another 5 years then Monta Ellis beats it once and Melo beats it another time.  Historically, only Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain have led the league in shots attempted more than Kobe. Allen Iverson is the only player in the last two decades to come within reaching distance of Kobe's shots attempted.  So if we look at the last twenty years of NBA history, the only people who come close to the green light that Kobe was given over the course of his career were Russell Westbrook, Dwayne Wade and Allen Iverson. If we include more of NBA history we get names like Kareem Abdul-Jabaar, Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan.  As much as I hate Russell Westbrook, I think it's pretty safe to say that that's NBA legend company. So all the people who get close to Kobe's green light are NBA legends. Obviously Kobe did something better than the rest of them, what was it?"
What the heck does Broadie mean and since when do they call Russell Westbrook that?
"Any GM who didn't sign Russell to a max deal in that situation would be fired within a year or two and probably never work in a lead front office role again.   As far as ""low efficiency"" Westbrook ranked 11th in PER this season, 1st last season, and 4th in the 15-16 season when Durant was still in OKC. He even showed that with Durant his usage rate can be much lower while still maintaining a top ten player efficiency rating. Almost every advanced statistic says he is a top ten player, he can draw a crowd, and he makes a small market team relevant in the national discussion (ask Giannis how easy it is to make a small market team relevant). From a business standpoint having a player who does all that is way better than struggling through a rebuild that often doesn't work. Philly had a brutal rebuild that actually looks like it worked, but they could end up like the Kings going through multiple rebuilds without any playoff experience or fan enthusiasm. Why risk that when a team with Westbrook is at worst a 1st round exit and at best is a good player away from contending once Golden State breaks up. I would even say the Thunder could be competitive against Houston if George didn't bolt (probably not going to happen) and they built more chemistry. Possibly even a better coach since Donovan doesn't seem to be pushing any if the right buttons. "
"I'm sorry, but we have 9 years of watching Russell Westbrook post a TS% of 53%. We've seen him shoot 31% from 3 for 9 years. We've seen the dumb mistakes, ill advised shots, and volume play for 9 years. This wasn't some new story that came out of no where. Russ has succeeded once in his career, and it was with KD and Harden and then their last year with just Harden. He got another All Star this season in PG and still they got bounced int he first round because Roberson was injured.  Idc about his MVP, Russ had a USG% of 41% on 55% TS. You will not win games if he's the star of your team point blank period. He's been in the league 9 years and the last 2 years once he's been ""free"" his splits have been 44/33/80. That's not going to win you basketball games if you feed him all day. You will not be able to build a team around him. He needed a DPOY guy in Roberson to be an actual contender and once he went down their entire defense went to shit. The last 2 years aren't the proof, the last 9 are"
"It is a smart move. You always trade a year early then a year late. Russell Westbrook by himself isn’t getting you past the first round imo. He got paid already. I bet a team like New York would love to have him, and you could get a lot for him. "
"Did you watch Miami play? Dwyane Wade is not Russell Westbrook; he almost never just took pull up jumpers. And Chris Bosh wasn't taking jumpers from the corners, that was Haslem. Bosh's sweet spot was on the right wing.  Question: When LeBron was on the left block where was Wade? He couldn't shoot 3-pointers, so he wasn't there. Wade was either cutting, working out of the post or finding soft spots in the defense for mid-range jumpers. His pump-fakes, step-backs and fade-aways were deadly from the high post. Wade's mid-range game was certainly not the oil for the Heat offensive machine, but it was integral for keeping defenses honest.  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfWCVEDwE5I) game is indicative of Wade's work. He killed Indiana out of the high post and from mid-range. Pay particular attention to the play @3:33. LeBron drives into the paint, then hits Wade in rhythm for a pull-up jumper.  "
"Semaj Christon hit the shot to get Russell Westbrook his 42nd triple double of the year, an NBA record"
"It's crazy that people have forgotten how good that Thunder team was, and how shocking it was that Miami completely dominated them in the Finals.   OKC won at a 58 win rate in the shortened season. They swept the defending champ Mavs. Then they completely manhandled a really, really, *really* good Lakers team (even with Kobe averaging 38 ppg in the last 3 games). **Then** after going down 2-0 to the Spurs in super close games (who would make the next two Finals and win one of them with one of the best teams of all time) they won 4 straight and headed into the Finals on fire.   OKC was favored in Vegas. They were favored in the media. They were favored by popular opinion. Kevin Durant was already a superstar averaging 30-5-5. Russell Westbrook was turning into a superstar, and James Harden was exploding in the Conference Finals.   Miami really fucking struggled that same playoffs. They went to 6 in the second round against the Pacers with baby Paul George and Danny Granger (who shit the bed hard in the playoffs). They went to 7 in the Conference Finals against Boston, and would have absolutely lost that series if Lebron James did not have one of the greatest game 6's of all time.   Miami was **definitely** not *heavily favored* against the Thunder. The Thunder were being called a new dynasty, while Miami was looking liked a failed dynasty with their second disappointing playoffs in a row. "

"I used regular season only cuz point was to more or less show which players protect their 3-point percentage more by deciding not to put up 3's. In the playoffs, that kind of goes out the window.

"
"u right. he's leaving to join LBJ, Kawhi, PG, DMC, and Russell Westbrook in LA. "
There is no way signing Russell Westbrook to a max deal can be called a bad idea. 
"NBA teams don't play zone defense now, what with the defensive 3 second rule, you really can't.    Jerry West was more like the Westbrook/Harden model rather than a Curry or KD model.  He would nail outside shots if you left him open, and if not, he'd drive past you and score or get fouled trying to score.  He was in top 5 in FTAs for every year he played a full season.    And Oscar Robertson was like a Magic Johnson type - big, strong, the best athlete on the floor with the ball in his hands.  Elgin Baylor was Jordan before Jordan.  Fastest/quickest player off the dribble, skied above the rim, unguardable.  Bill Russell had the tenacity and will of purpose that Jordan, Bird, Olajuwon, LeBron and Curry have.  They refuse to be stopped.  He would will his team to victory, whatever it takes.  GOAT, imho.    Wilt was just Wilt.  Holy cow.  Kareem in Shaq's body.  "
Why are we acting like Russell Westbrook is good?!?!?
How would PG joining the Rockets affect Russell Westbrook?
Russell Westbrook and PG13 were out partying in Vegas last week. They seemed pretty tight. 
"And Manu Ginobili, Zaza Pachulia, Russell Westbrook and Corey Brewer"
"Yeah, wtf is that about? It didn’t fuel that notion with any of us fans.     I thought the more relevant part of the article was that Stein’s report echoes Woj: &gt;However, the report from Stein backs up what ESPN reporter Adrian Wojnarowski said last week that the Thunder have a real chance to keep George in free agency this summer.  &gt;“Oklahoma City has done a great job on selling him on a future there,” Wojnarowski said. “He liked playing with Russell Westbrook, Steven Adams and Billy Donovan.”"
lol two guys with Russell Westbrook and Manu Ginobili on their teams called Dray a complainer 
"Very surprised at some of these takes lol  Perhaps some need to rewatch the finals or at least game 7 and the boiling anger Bron had as he begrudgingly dapped up GS players. If you think this guy would be cool to watch Lonzo ‘learn’ how to be a championship asset you’re touched.  Another reminder, there are only 3 teams to either beat or almost beat GS in this run. Cavs, Rockets, and OKC  That’s Kyrie, Chris Paul, and Russell Westbrook lol smh And Chris Paul has to Audie this game to be more of a SCORER  You don’t need ‘selfless playmaking’ to beat GS. You need killers. And Bron and Lakers would trade Lonzoin is a heartbeat if it brought back a killer or put them in position to get one in 2019"
"1. Kyle Singler gets slapped because he’s fucking Kyle Singler.  2. Kevin Durant gets slap number 2 for proving to me that all men in my life will inevitably hurt me and that good things don’t last.   3. Russell Westbrook gets slap number 3, right on the ass for being the stylish, triple double machine who will always try his best but will never be good enough to win a ring. "
"Ah yes, the modern day Russell Westbrook. As opposed to the Westbrook of yore"
"You can literally just change things and it works for any player comparison...  ""If Curry was way more athletic and couldn't shoot as well, you would get modern day Russell Westbrook."""
Russell Westbrook not a top 10 guard ?  What the hell does a top 10 Guard look like to some people.  
So much funnier. I remember reading a post somewhere about Russell Westbrook not even being a top 10 guard in the nba with analysis and the dude was serious. He didn’t think it was a [nephew] situation but the rest of us did lol

"The scenario: 2019 game 7 of the NBA finals the Seattle Supersonics vs the Providence Steamrollers. It has been an intense back and forth affair between these two superteams. It is the fourth quarter and the LeBron lead Steamrollers are down by 2 with one more play in their arsenal.  As LeBron dribbles the ball down the court the tension in the arena is palpable. As Bron reaches the half court he is approached the defensive one-two punch that is 8x DPOY Dwight Howard and Chris Paul with robo-legs. They put the clamps on him immediately and with great ferocity. As the shot clock dwindles towards zero LeBron feels a slight tinge of panic until he sees the deliverer of his salvation. With the finesse of a bald eagle with opposable thumbs he lobs the ball towards the hoop for it to be caught by none other than the reigning 6MOTY Dion Waiters. Waiters proceeds to 720 tomahawk dunk the ball into the net as a flagrent foul is called on his defender, mr Russell Westbrook. As Dion Waiters lays on the court in agony he can only mutter a single phrase before he passes away into the arms of the hoop gods: ""and-1""  Without Dion to shoot the definitive free throw the Steamrollers are dejected. That is until a familiar figure appears from the ether to save the day. This figure is none other than the legendary Michael Jordan. He shots the proceeding free throw with such fury and precision that the hoop immediately catches fire.  It's over. The Steamrollers win after a franchise best 78-4 record. And as Lebron and Jordan celebrate the victory they glance over at one another, tears in their eyes, and give each other a single, solidary nod of respect."

You need to sign Russell Westbrook so he can stand under the basket and wait for the rebound for that plan to work
"Yeah, unfortunately AAU is most likely always going to be run by the shoe companies who have monopolized it for several decades. Unless there was some massive overhaul of the youth scene that mirrored the European Football Academies that are tied to club teams/national teams, but that's so far from being feasible.  When I think of team basketball in this age, I automatically think of the Spurs in the Tim Duncan/Parker/Ginobili era. The offense revolved around Duncan, but as the years went on you started to see Parker,Ginobili develop. Bruce Bowen became an elite 3 and D guy outta after flying under the radar in Miami, Danny Green couldn't even make Cleveland's bench and eventually he was hitting 3's against them in the Finals. There was a system in place and they fully executed it, that's what I consider team play.  Not Chris Paul/James Harden always needing the ball in their hands for the offense to run, or Russell Westbrook essentially playing ""PASSBACK"" all season on offense while PG and Melo chucked 3's. I appreciate the ball movement that the Warriors' offense had, but I can't stand the reliance on the 3 point shot in today's game."
"“argument ad hominem” lmao log the fuck off.  i literally practice law but goddamn please don’t act like a fucking reddit loser stereotype.  “i guarantee i know more about basketball than you” sounds good  “Coach” Nick, another basketball genius like you, didn’t think Russell Westbrook was better than Goran Dragic until the 2015-16 season, check his tweets unless he deletes.  No one said anything about Russ being top 5 in the nba, just that he is in my top 5 favorites which is why your smug bullshit about not watching basketball  is hilarious.  You say some shit about Russ turning it over at a high volume and then when Harden literally was worse about his volume of turnovers in a similar role of being the only primary ball-handler, just dismiss it. That is ridiculous to dismiss based on your interpretation of understanding what play they are making. For the sake of argument, I also am a basketball genius and only true basketball geniuses can see what Russ is trying to do, i guess you must not watch enough basketball to understand what Russ is attempting to do. Maybe you should watch a game. See how fucking stupid that sounds.   i’m blessed to be talking to a basketball genius like you I guess. But no one fucking brought up Russ’ passing. You said he turns it over a lot and  acted like Harden somehow didn’t, which is 100% wrong. But you are so smart I guess it doesn’t matter. Thank you for educating me you fucking brainiac.   "

Lonzo has a lot of potential but right now he's unplayable in certain situations unless you're a lottery team"

"Since 2010-2011 Russell Westbrook had the higher usage rate every year while KD was in OKC.  No, he should not have the ball more.  He's not an efficient play-maker.  He's not efficient at anything he does.  Give the ball to one of the best scorers in NBA history.  "
RUSSELL WESTBROOK SHOULD GET TRADED TO THE CAVS TO HELP OUT LEBRON.
I went with... Russell Westbrook/CJ McCollum/Jayson Tatum/Robert Covington/Steven Adams. Gives Russ 3 competent shooters all above average defenders and able to switch as well as gives you 2 extra guys who are capable of creating for themselves.
 Russell Westbrook is a top 10 player in the league at being a first option. Argument presented. Please provide aforementioned stats.

RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS A TOP 5 PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE AND WILL CURBSTOMP YOU WITH HIS MOLE
Imagine posting up around a tree playing some woodsball and you peek around and see MVP Russell Westbrook charging at you screaming bang bang 
"Aint nobody reaching. Those are facts. Russell Westbrook won an MVP and his team didnt even win 50 games that season.  He aint got no stats in the top 5. He can play D, thats about it. He aint doin much playin lately."
"no team led by russell westbrook is a legitimate threat. he caps his team’s ceiling too low.   e: just the truth guys. roberson does not give the thunder enough to leapfrog anyone. neither does noel or schroeder. jazz have another year and are almost certainly a better team, houston didn’t lose all that much (unless capela goes) and are likely to pick up melo. okc is fourth at best next year. "
"Imagine the speed and explosiveness of russell westbrook, and the strength of shaq in a 7'1"" body"
"No he isn't much better. Did you watch the fucking playoffs? Booker couldn't do what Mitchell did    Guarding Russell westbrook, averaging 27 against the thunder and 24-5-4 overall in the postseason, trading twenty point quarters with the reigning MVP at the time in a closeout game and making a bunch of clutch buckets "
Russell Westbrook will remember that
 I'm going to start using that currency converter for everything. The Thunder signed Russell Westbrook to a deal worth 40 Boogies 
"He didn't sign the extension till over a month(very close to the deadline) after they offered it to him. You can look at that time and find plenty of anxious fans/reports wondering if he was going to elect to go into free agency. For example, https://newsok.com/article/5558844/why-the-question-russell-westbrook-asked-and-answered-last-summer-has-surfaced-again-about-the-thunder-superstars-future?utm_campaign=ShareBar-Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=NewsOK.com  I don't understand how someone can be totally ignorant of a situation and have the audacity to call people out on 'mental gymnastics'"
*Thunder have traded Russell Westbrook for cash considerations* 
But those guys don't look like Monstars. Russell Westbrook does.
"[Bucher] I just texted Dennis Schroder on trade to OKC Thunder. He's thrilled: ""(OMG Emojis) HUGE. I'm so excited. Russell Westbrook is my favorite player."""
"I mean, to an extent, this is exactly what the Russell Westbrook pick was."
"""Did OKC give up too much to get rid of a guy who has been labeled trash, although he puts up 37.5 FG% and 21.4 3PT% in the playoffs, which 0 other guys do?""  ""Is that a trick question? They gave up Me7o Anthony, who cares? I could care less! First of all, understand something. When you're giving up first round picks, if you are a quality team in playoff contention, it really doesn't mean that much, that's number one. Number two and more importantly, Me7o Anthony is gone! The State of Sooner, Oklahoma should be celebrating. Throw a parade already whether you win a championship or not. This man was a bonafide scrub! He can't play! No disrespect whatsoever, but I'm sorry to call, tell everybody the truth, the man can no longer play the game of basketball. He has a fat ass, he can't shoot the ball, he has bad attitude, he can't really move even though he's me7o, doesn't really know what he's doing, doesn't have a high efficiency shot that he or he puts to memory that he can do two times in a row. He has no game whatsoever, plays no defense, doesn't have the heart, the passion or anything that comes with it, and you're asking me whether they gave up too much? Please. The Oklahoma City Thunder knew exactly what they were doing, they should be celebrating right now, and Russell Westbrook should not be saying a word!"""
"Iso and miss jump shots, like Russell Westbrook?"
Playing with Kyle Lowry isn't the same as playing with Russell Westbrook.

"No one is arguing about who is better, it is about who is greater. Kobe is probably top 5 most skilled players in NBA history but greatness is a different story. As for clutch, it's not close. For reference I'll link an article below.  [http://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/\_/id/24200/the-truth-about-kobe-bryant-in-crunch-time](http://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/24200/the-truth-about-kobe-bryant-in-crunch-time)  As for eye test, I agree Russell Westbrook is one of my favourite players ever and it isn't because of advanced metrics. But advanced metrics do account for something and they have to be considered, it doesn't have to the end unto itself but it is an integral part. As for a big 3 always existing, in 1999 Duncan was the only player who averaged above 20 on the Spurs, only 3 players averaged above 10. In 2000 Kobe put up 15.6/4.6/4.2 on 37.6/20/91 shooting and 4 players put up more than 10 including Shaq who put up 38/16.7/2.3/1/2.7 on 53.7% shooting and 80% from the line. Kobe at this point had played 2 more seasons than Duncan had when he won Finals MVP. But that is too much to write about, the fact is this Duncan has always been the best player on 5 championships and has always been the man in the Finals while Kobe had a top 10 all time player for the first 3 championships to guide him through the process. No one is debating Kobe's position at the second/third tier of basketball greatness but Tim Duncan is in the first/early second tier of basketball greatness."
Russell Westbrook cares more about stats than winning
No love for Russell Westbrook and Paul George?
Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Paul George  Carmelo Anthony   Kevin Durant  (Small Ball lineup) Crazy how talented our team would be considering we’ve only been around since 2007
"Russell Westbrook will live his life with the Thunder.   I don’t care if he sucks in 5 years, Sam Presti will become a target if that ever happens   Edit: I guess the downvoters are coming from people that don’t want Westbrook yo play in okc "
well I'd be more willing to back up Russell Westbrook than Jeff Teague 
But [they are](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=John+Wall&amp;player_id1_select=John+Wall&amp;player_id1=walljo01&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id2_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y2=2018&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;idx=players) tho. John's percentage from deep is about a percentage more than Westbrook's.  You also need to take into account the difficulty of the shots. Most of John's threes are wide open because defenders are sagging off of him.
"They need their star player to allow himself to *be coached.*    Whomever replaces Donovan is gonna hit the same brick wall that Scotty Brooks and Billy Donovan did. That wall is Russell Westbrook. And the OKC fans will turn on the HC, and rinse &amp; repeat. Sigh. "
You know whose not a snek? Russell Westbrook. And he probably won’t play in a conference final game for the entirety of his prime. 
Paul George stayed because OKC has a perennial MVP candidate in Russell Westbrook locked up through the prime of his career.   Toronto has a 32-year-old Kyle Lowry and a really deep supporting cast.  These aren't really similar scenarios.
It kills the team's chances because you guys HAD the 1 guy who could prove Toronto's loyalty to a player. Think about OKC. No one would want to go there if it wasn't for KD and Russell Westbrook. 
"Oh, it'll be humbling because of how large a personality Westbrook has. Russell isn't going to take shit from Schroder, guarantee this."
"Well, Paul George has Russell Westbrook. Not as good as LeBron, but much more enticing than Kyle Lowry"
"I thought ""Russ"" with regards to rap meant Russell Westbrook for like six months"
Russell Westbrook is better than LeBron James because he lead his team to the playoffs averaging a triple double in consecutive years while playing in the Western Conference.
Ricky Rubio is better than Russell Westbrook because gritty Rick ate Russ's lunch during the playoffs.
OKC also at least had the ability to say “we already have a top 5 player in the league signed for the next 4 seasons.” Kyle Lowry isn’t the same as Russell Westbrook. 
Their a chance but don’t bet on it. Toronto doesn’t have a Russell Westbrook for kawhi so he’ll probably bounce after 1 season 
"More proof these old GMs are out of touch with the modern player.   These players dgaf about your “culture”. They don’t want to retire like Karl Malone, they want weather, they want their friends, they want to live where they vacation, they want markets. They see GS and they don’t want to be left out   It all sucks but you have to know these things. PG stayed yea that’s cool but Russell Weatebrook is one of the most alpha personalities in the league. Kyle Lowery or Fred vanvleet is not Westbrook, on court or personality wise "
russell westbrook (and Harden for that matter) have really distorted guard rebounding expectations
Russell Westbrook plays in Okc and that doesn't matter at all because he has a personality that people like 
I’m so thankful for Russell Westbrook and Paul George. 
"Russell ""Carmelo Anthony"" Westbrook"
"At the end of the day, Russell Westbrook blew a 3-1 lead to Steph Curry and has 0 rings."
Kyle Lowery is not Russell Westbrook. People are delusional thinking Kawhi will be like PG
"Iris on Russell Westbrook:  ""I don't know who the (expletive) that is"""
"""Russell Westbrook signs five year extension"""
“Russell Westbrook has suffered a torn meniscus and will miss the remainder of the post season”
"I don't think he necessarily should, but Russell Westbrook might be remembered this way if they never go far in the playoffs again"
*Obligatory Russell Westbrook comment*
"He was a better player on that day, and he’s one reason Russell Westbrook has never gotten out of the first round without Durant carrying his stat-padding ass. "
Russell Westbrook or Andrew Nicholson
"""Is Russell Westbrook bi"""
"Don't let this be some final judgement of character on these guys, but I've run into a lot of NBA players in LA, and here were my experiences with active players:  **Stopped for chats or photos with fans:** Dwight Howard Kevin Durant Jimmy Butler Paul George Draymond Green DeAndre Jordan Kemba Walker Lance Stephenson Rajon Rondo Jeremy Lin Brook Lopez JJ Redick JaVale McGee Luol Deng Chandler Parsons Jordan Clarkson  **Acknowledged fans but did not stop:** LeBron James Dirk Nowitzki Russell Westbrook Klay Thompson Kevin Love Pau Gasol Trevor Ariza Tyson Chandler Larry Nance Jr. Ed Davis Timofey Mozgov   **Did not acknowledge fans at all:** James Harden DeMarcus Cousins Carmelo Anthony Blake Griffin Kyrie Irving John Wall Kyle Kuzma Joakim Noah Morris twins Kendrick Perkins Julius Randle D'Angelo Russell"
 Yeah I'd definitely switch CP3 with Kyrie. CP3's still such an impactful 2-way player that should probably be above Russell Westbrook if we didn't have such a skewed view of offensive stats over defensive impact. 
That's the most Russell Westbrook answer ever
Ah reporters asking dumb ass questions and Russell Westbrook. Name a more iconic duo. 
"Easy Russell Westbrook.  Won’t be popular, I know the number padding, playoff record, turnovers etc.  Dude can ball. His teammates love him. He backs down from no one. Plays every play likes it’s his last. And stat padding or not, you Have to be really good to average a triple double."
"1: LeBron James (2003)  2: Kevin Durant (2007)  3: Joel Embiid (2014)  4: Russell Westbrook (2008)  5: DeMarcus Cousins (2010)  6: Damian Lillard (2012)  7: Stephen Curry (2009)  8: Rudy Gay (2006)  9: Andre Iguodala (2004)  10: Andrew Bynum (2005)  11: Klay Thompson (2011)  12: Taurean Prince (2016)  13: Devin Booker (2015)  14: Michael Porter Jr. (2018)  15: Giannis Antetokounmpo (2013)    Starters: Curry / KD / LeBron / Giannis / Cousins  *long, athletic group that can shoot and move the ball*    Bench: Russ / Harden / Klay / Embiid / Bynum  *killer offense off the bench with a Sixth Man of the Year, two MVPs, and prime Bynum was very capable*    Role Players: Lillard / Booker   *Lillard was All-NBA and can fill in both guard spots, Booker is a scoring machine*    Limited Minutes: Prince / MPJ / Gay  *versatile players that can switch on D and come in for minutes*  e: formatting  P.S. Threw away 2017  "
"Nope. Google trends looks at the *proportion* of all searches in an area that pertain to your subject matter and then compares it to all other areas.  If you want an example (numbers aren’t real but the concept is)  In Oklahoma City,  there were 2 million searches, of which Russell Westbrook was 100k (5%)  In Toronto, there were 4 million searches, of which Russell Westbrook was 100k (2.5%)  In LA, there were 10 million searches, of which Russell Westbrook was 1 million (10%)  Google trends would give L.A. a score of 100 (because it’s the max), okc a score of 33 [((score - min)/(max of 10% - min of 2.5%)) = 2.5/7.5 = 33], and Toronto a score of 0 (because it’s the min). If you use excel it’s called a percentrank.  So, relatively speaking people care considerably less about basketball outside the GTA. That’s not to say there’s no one outside the GTA that cares, just that if you were to stop an average person on the street there’s a lower likelihood that they care about the raps."
"If Allen Iverson played in this era, do you think he would be as loved as he was in his time, or would he fall into the Russell Westbrook category of yeah he has great stats, but he plays no defense and is a chucker and they're empty stats."
Russell Westbrook will be praised by future basketball hipsters who only watched a couple highlith videos of him and were amazed by his ability to record triple doubles. 
"I think Embiid is a very realistic dark horse for MVP next season, especially considering the case against other notable candidates.  Hear me out... voter fatigue and a general aversion towards superteams are very real and determining factors when it comes to the MVP voting. As a result, players such as James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, and Kevin Durant can likely expect diminished support amongst MVP voters in the immediate future.  An equally significant factor to winning the MVP award – barring some sort of statistical anomaly, such as averaging a triple-double – is team success, and very rarely does the MVP come from a team that finishes with &lt; 50 wins or outside the Top 4 teams in their respective conference. Subsequently, the case for players such as Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard, and Karl-Anthony Towns becomes somewhat less conceivable for the 2018-19 season.  Therefore, the likeliest candidates remaining are LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, and Joel Embiid... I think it’s a given that LeBron will be the consensus preseason favorite to win his 5th MVP award, but if the Lakers fail to live up to their already lofty expectations and Kawhi/Kyrie are unable to overcome lingering injury concerns, I believe it is completely within the realm of possibility that a healthy Joel Embiid averages 25 ppg and 12 reb while anchoring Philly’s defense and leading the Sixers to the 2-seed in the Eastern Conference... Thus, rendering him the 2018-19 NBA Most Valuable Player.  (For what it’s worth, my second dark horse candidate would be Donovan Mitchell. I think it’s very possible that Utah could nab the 3-seed in the West while Mitchell builds upon his incredibly impressive 2018 playoff run, in which he averaged 24 ppg 6 reb 4 ast.)"

Russell Westbrook on Golden State
"After his current contract, Russell Westbrook in any jersey besides a Thunder jersey wouldn’t look right "
"What makes the 2011 Dallas run so unique as opposed to other championships? Just take a look at the roster they had. Outside of Dirk Nowitzki and Tyson Chandler, they had a bunch of role or below average players on their roster. I know they also had Jason Kidd and Jason Terry, but both were at the end of their careers (I know J.E.T is still somehow in the league). No disrespect to Barrea or Shawn “Ugliest Free Throw” Marion, but who are we kidding? You don’t think you’d win a championship with a team of DeShawn Stevenson, Corey Brewer, Brian Cardinal, Steve Novak, Ian Mahinmi, and Alexis Ajinca on your roster.  The Dallas Mavericks 2011 team was a team that played so well with each other and the cards played out perfectly. This wasn’t a KD, Klay, Dray, and Curry or LBJ, Wade, Bosh superstar team, no. This was a team that won 57 games and *ran* through the Lakers lead by Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Derek Fisher, Lamar Odom, and Metta World Peace. A team that, just a year prior, had won the championship. Ran through an Okhlahoma city team lead by Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Kevin Durant, Prime Kendrick Perkins, James Harden, and Thabo Sefalosha. And, to top it all off, ran through a Miami team of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh that was said to be a ‘superteam’. I remember it like it was yesterday, where even when the Mavericks were down 15-20 with 5 minutes left in the quarter, they managed to make a comeback.  A team that had just won its first championship and what does Cuban decide to do? He let’s go of Barrea, Chandler, and signed the headcase that is Lamar Odom who didn’t even want to play for Dallas. And ever since that year, the Mavericks FO has been surrounding Dirk with worse and worse talent, until recently, right as he’s about to retire…"
"&gt; Replace this statement with any superstar.  You can't seem to make your mind up, the whole point of your bullshit is that he doesn't make his teammates better, but now you're saying he does to the extent that any superstar does?    &gt; name something he elevated for any player.  For one, that is spoken exactly like someone who is just making an argument centered around shooting percentages with a basketball reference tab in the background. I'll name something he elevates for players - win totals.  Both Melo and PG left a weaker conference, and still won more games this year than on their previous teams.   &gt; have opportunities to score and force an assist instead  When? In the last game of the season vs Memphis? When he's trying to get teammates going because he's bricking? I think it's a pretty hard sell to try to assert that Westbrook purposefully gives up buckets at the detriment of his team. For one, because he is *always* trying to do whatever it takes to win, and for two, year before last he won the fucking scoring title (31.6 ppg)!  &gt; literally the same  In the comment before this one, the point you were making was that after KD left, Roberson's shooting percentages and other stats had not increased. KD leaving is not LeBron arriving, Roberson is not Bosh, and the 2017 Thunder are not the Heatles. I can't think of a shittier extended comparison that someone has honestly tried to make to me in my life. Are you saying Mario Chalmers made LeBron James and Chris Bosh better basketball players?  &gt; Oladipo [...] got better after he left  Oladipo's numbers got better after he left because he was handed a franchise, along with a personal drive that got ignited in him when he left which resulted in an enormous amount of work being put in on his part. To attribute his season to being away from Russ is reductive to the extreme and not fair at all to Vic.    &gt; parroted BS that gets repeated here  [Weird to say for someone who is just parroting an article from the Ringer.](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/12/13/16770062/victor-oladipo-russell-westbrook-okc-effect)  &gt; His energy inspires, sure.  &gt; For some people it may make them work harder.  I'm not saying that Westbrook is magical. No one is. I'm just saying the same thing you're admitting left and right here. There will always be variables that fuck with a statistic when it comes to sports. You can't make assumptions as if these are experimental conditions, with stats revealing concrete truths about interactions between players' games. Who knows what these players' stats might look like in a vacuum? But we can clearly see that Westbrook drives other players to try to match his energy and intensity, echoed by the words of his teammates, present and past. If you don't consider that beneficial, then I don't think we're going to change each others' minds, man."
Russell Westbrook
"Are you dumb?  &gt;Lol. Are you trolling me or just genuinely dumb? No offense, I do think it's the former, but I'm not 100%. I mean, watch a few Thunder games and see what happens with the offense when Russ rests, and tell me they don't miss him.  Replace this statement with any superstar. Also with Paul George leading the offense they looked perfectly fine. Defensively if anything, they looked more trash with Westbrook off the court. Not offensively.  Not going to quote your next statement. Then name something he elevated for any player. All you guys say is he elevates teammates except arguably the only person who got better playing next to him is maybe PG and honestly it was pretty much in line with his last 4 years. 40.9%, 37%, 39% and then 40.1%. It's not anything amazing or world breaking. Yet you all act like Russell made him better. Brewer. Patterson. Grant. Melo. etc.... the best people can possibly claim is Adams and maybe PG 3PT which is a stretch. And everyone else has remained the same as they've been or worse than their career numbers.   Selfish assist is not an oxymoron. Watch Rondo and Westbrook play. They have opportunities to score and force an assist instead. Watching Westbrook play for assist is like watching Kings Rondo in full effect where he would give up an easy bucket to make someone else shoot to keep his assist title. You can't be serious.  LBJ+Bosh is different? You just added Melo+PG. It's literally the same. That's why I used the example. It was supposed to be stars teaming up. I didn't use the year KD left. I said this past year. Melo+PG isn't as good as Wade+Bosh but Westbrook also didn't make anyone better.  All you guys say is get people open looks and involved. You can say that about anybody. It's parroted BS that gets repeated here with nothing to back it up. Nothing proving it. Oladipo is used as the poster child but he got better after he left. Who on his team has he elevated that you can point to and say, yeah that's all Westbrook? No one.  Some players lead by example. Some players lead by just being better than other players. That's Westbrook. His energy inspires, sure. But he doesn't elevate people's game by playing next to them. Inherently playing next to Westbrook will not make you a better player. For some people it may make them work harder. But on court, I don't see him elevating anyone's game. Same with Kyrie, he doesn't elevate teammates games."
Russell Westbrook can attest
Russell Westbrook would fit right in.
"5'4"" former all conference PG in high school, hyper-athletic, volume shooter but always led team in assists..  Think a mini, less confident Russell Westbrook."
Thought he said Russell Westbrook. But D'Lo...really? Come on Pogba
"Maybe you should know about basketball a little before taking out of your ass.  Who said baseball is the only sport?   Who said roid only purpose is to add muscles? Maybe read a little before you pretend to know something or maybe you have hard time with reading comprehension?  Being stronger or faster doesn't help you to became a better player since there are more gifted athletes in NBA who's always in DNP.   Let me guess, you must think if you are stronger NBA center, you are better rebounder and better ft shooter??  Is that why Barkley and rodman are two of the best rebounders in history of the game?   Wow, you must think basketball is like football or baseball, huh?  Russell Westbrook must be one juiced mofo with all those triple doubles!!  Oh wait, it's for recovery purposes since no other therapy or legal supplements doesn't exist or good are not good as roids. I wonder why AI played 40+ minutes every game with various injuries thoughtout his career when he could've just juiced it?  "

"Unpopular vote, Russell Westbrook. I choose him because he is the face of OKC, and I think he represents the team as a whole.

"Oh, advanced stats I’m guessing huh...Bc by regular ol stats he put up comparable numbers to Russell Westbrook and Steve Francis as a rook. And he’s younger than they we’re.   DSJ is a year out of HS at the hardest position to acclimate to but still avg 15 and 5. If that’s his floor I’ll take it 10 times out of 10 over a guy who still hasn’t proved he WONT be a bust. Frank literally did nothing all year lmao He also showed them in that little amount of time that he isn’t a PG. So he’s kinda been demoted already. In a year where almost every lottery pick showed signs, he did nothing .    I’ll also take his peers opinions over yours. CP3, Steph, and many others rave over the kid. If you can’t see he’s a baller that’s more on you. Frank will lucky to be a Courtney lee type player  "

"I don’t think anyone has any issue with the officiating in the finals. It was the Western Playoffs that had all the problems. Pretty much from the start. Also, almost every series that should have ended in a sweep but ended in five games instead had some sketchy officiating in favor of the team in danger of being swept. Russell Westbrook hit Ricky Rubio in the face three times in the span of three or four seconds, committing multiple fouls that he should have been automatically ejected for, yet nothing was called.  The officiating was really bad in just about every series in the playoffs at some point. Only a few actually seemed sketchy, and the rest seemed more due to incompetence.  Edit: Added a thing, and fixed an autocorrect problem."
"Game 7, The 2019 NBA finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers Vs The Oklahoma City Thunder!   4th quarter 7 seconds left on the clock, score 99 to 101. Smooth operator ""playoff P"" drives into the hearty defense of Kevin Love and shoots, misses, but the foul!    Paul George readies himself on the free throw line. Russell nods, the power of friendship will guide the shit.    The first one sinks.    Westbrook beans with joy and pride, for the power of friendship will propel them to an easy overtime victory over the cavs.    The second one misses.   Westbrook sits in awe like JR as kevin love rebounds the ball, the 19th rebound in his 34/21/3 statline.   His eyes pop like a madman. Westbrook screams a roar as the confetti falls and begins punching the floor. His animalistic rage breaking his hand, forcing him to comeback 20 games into the 2020 regular season.    Only able to average double doubles. Westbrook never has another triple double after the 2019 finals."
"Thunder,Russell westbrook"
"Lol the caption is ""Russell Westbrook posing with Victor Oladipo's MVP trophy (circa 2017)""  Maybe not the best link"
Russell westbrook won mvp last year. Hes not even top 10 player. Lebron is the best player in the world. Whens the last time he won mvp. Thats a best season award not a best player award
Westbrook and Adam are much better. Give Russ shooters from 2-4 like James and Russell will EAT that free space.

It’s accurate was the most overrated mvp in history right above Russell Westbrook and Allen iverson.  Trio of overrated chuckers. 
Russell westbrook vs Gobert as best players. That 's a pretty big difference 
Russell Westbrook is a superstar who makes his team better
"In summation: you're essentially insinuating that Westbrook's stats are padded, and because they are padded they are therefore intrinsically less noteworthy and impactful than legendary players before him, no?  First, do you think players from the past were somehow insulated from stat padding? Have you ever watched a Bill Russell game in it's entirety? There are countless instances where Russell is the only one attempting to grab a board while the rest of his teammates box out. There are even more instances where his teammates stand around and watch him score. Additionally, this sentiment is even more pronounced in Chamberlain games. I would argue that their stats were (what you would call) the MOST padded. I'm not attempting to cheapen their legacy. On the contrary, I believe I'm strengthening it. It is a testament to their dominance. Imagine being so great at scoring/rebound/assisting/whatever that you're coach essentially goes, ""Alright guys, u/PyrrhosKing is so supremely gifted that he's going to grab all the boards, and score all the points. Everyone else just play defense, box-out, and shoot when he passes to you."" When a generational athlete is on the floor one must take that into account in the game plan. Russell's and Chamberlain's monster games were in part intentionally designed. So, to insist that Westbrook's triple doubles are less valuable than the numbers put up by those before him is either an honest error, ignorant, or simply maleficent.  Second, triple doubles are ironically not *necessarily* about the stats. Yes I said it. The stat of all stats, the triple double, is not a benchmark for sake of numbers alone, but rather triple doubles are indicative of superior effort. Let me digress for a few sentences: Can you dunk? Can you tell me how much effort it takes? NBA players make it look so easy, but the effort to spring a 6'4""+ 200lb+ man into the air is enormous. Do you think rebounds just happen? Even if all of Westbrook's teammates were to only box-out and allow Westbrook to grab every board, it still takes a massive amount of energy and effort to do so. It is easy to sit at a keyboard and pour over stats and insist that something done for the first time in history is dismissible as anything less than phenomenal, because - what? Steven Adams may clear the lane for a Westbrook rebound twice a game? In reality, what you call stat padding is a product of game planning and happens by design, and occurs on every team that has ever existed. It does not diminish any feat nor does it fully encapsulate the entirety of the effort and overall gamesmanship involved with the game of basketball. So, to address one of your assertions: Yes, we should think differently about a player like Westbrook based on triple doubles, because he is being asked to do more for his team than almost anyone else in the league on a nightly basis. He has been asked to give the most effort over the longest period of time, and this is evident citing his back to back triple double seasons.  Third, since people are more aware of stats, and thus triple doubles, there are more people out to stifle a Westbrook triple double - a la defenders with the mentality akin to, ""he's not getting one on me."" Additionally, you were right on one account, we do hear (some of us read) about Wilt going for points and assists...AND ALSO REBOUNDS!  Westbrook's not only as good as his rebounding numbers, he's better. If he were able to delegate even one of his duties he would be capable of averaging somewhere around 20 boards a season. We'd see 40 point 20 rebound games on a semi-consistent basis, and maybe even a few 50 30 games.  Finally, r/nba thinks they have really stumbled onto something with Westbrook and his supposed stat padding. Please. First of all, it's straight up not padding, it's the delegation of duties that best befits a team's success. These schemes and principals have been in place since the inception of basketball. To be honest, your over analyzation and overly dismissive attitude is coming across as thinly gilded hate. Being overly dismissive is foolish. You seem to have somewhat of a handle on the statistical portion of the game, but you are massively out of touch with it's heart and soul.  edit: grammar"

I am sure that WB could top Julio's top speed if he didn't have to control a ball and evade people on his way to the rim.  &amp;#x200B;  also, read [this](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12588495/no-3-russell-westbrook). It showcases his insane athleticism. Julio Jones is a freak of nature, but c'mon, these numbers are insane."
Lebron is basically just a pumped up Russell Westbrook that cares a little more about legacy than the latter. Give me that slim shady easy money sniper when the game actually matters.
"you just did the same thing you accused OP for, against KD. be objective.  KD can hit a spot up shot from anywhere on the court. LeBron can't. Theres more to playing off ball than cutting.  LeBron is most definitely not ""the most lethal cutter in the game"" because he is consistently average to well below average from the free throw line, where KD is perennially at or slightly below **90%**  there were numerous reports within the cavaliers camp that lebron was hunting assists, its irrefutable that this sub's darling does the same exact thing russell westbrook does without being shit on for it. Bron plays in a drive and kick system where the his teammates job is to hit shots after lebron trucks to the rim.  we've seen KD win an MVP when his star teammate went down and he kept his entire thunder team fed.  you bring up superficial shit with bron being a better screen setter and roll man.. thats not KD's role.. he's not 6'8 270.   yet still the Steph KD PnR was one of the most lethal sets.. due to both parties.  and better scorer by an edge? be real, KD is far and away the best scorer in basketball."
"Not really, I mean curry averaged 7.7 assists on the 2015 warriors who also had the most team assists per game in the league.  Russell Westbrook without a doubt has played on more talented teams than that."
I remember several years back that OU football coach Bob Stoops said that Russell Westbrook could have been a star in the NFL as a safety.
I swear “Russell Westbrook shouldn’t have won the 2017 MVP” is the new “the James Harden trade was very bad for OKC” with Simmons. Every damn podcast he has about the NBA he circles back to shitting on Westbrook. I like Simmons and I do typically respect what he has to say but oh my gosh I’m going to lose it the next time he talks about Westbrook not helping his teammates and how Harden should’ve won the 2017 MVP. That’ll also probably be 5 minutes into his next NBA related podcast. He also definitely does this because he’s boys with Durant.
"Can't find any pics but he did play tennis in college:  ""Russell Westbrook was asked what kind of tennis player he was back when he played in college — the kind of player that stayed back or the type that attacked the baseline.  What you think? he asked, as everyone broke into laughter.  Unfortunately, Westbrook said he hasn’t played for a few years now, meaning few of his teammates have seen what we can imagine is a very aggressive tennis side of the Thunder guard."""
"Well let me put it this way. A guy like Steph Curry may have statistically fewer assists but there is no doubt that he is a better passer. Why? Well think about it Steph is a guy who’s always moving in the offense and in order to do that he allows a lot of his team mates to handle the ball so that way when the defense makes a mistake( like over reacting to the steph 3) he can simply take advantage of the imbalance on the floor. Whether it be catch and shoot 3s or making the smart easy pass that put his teammate in a position for an easy basket. He functions within the offense and that allows the team to operate at maximum efficiency, he uses his gravity and his vision to make the right play consistently. As a result the warriors have 28.6 assists per game( highest in the league) while steph averaged 6.1 assists per game. This seems to indicate that the assists are being properly distributed.  Compare that with Westbrook which is a guy who has the ball in his hands 95% of the time, and when he doesn’t he just stands there and allows the defense to load up on the ball handler, he doesn’t move and he doesn’t create good opportunities for his teammates but statistically he has a higher assist average than curry. Why? Because his usage is insane, last year OKC was second last in assists per game as a team. They averaged 21 assists per game and Russell averaged 10.3 assists per game. So that means nearly half of OKCs team assists come from one player. That is the sign of a team that is not only lacking an offensive system and in need of a culture change but it is the sign of a team where the ball tends to stay in one place in the hands of one player. If you’re best player has 10.3 assists then the next highest guy on the team can’t be averaging 3.3 assists because that is too imbalanced. I mean look at the assist distribution: http://m.espn.com/nba/teamstats?teamId=25&amp;category=avgAssists&amp;season=2018  Now the cavs and the rockets suffered from this as well but with the rockets the offensive system was designed to have either CP3 or Harden isolate in the pick&amp;roll and then pick apart the defense when they sag off shooters. This worked for them because they actually had sharp shooters on the weak side and because they have two of the top 5 best passers in the NBA that could probably get you 20 assists by themselves but most of all it’s because the system was designed that way. The cavs were actually struggling because of how dependent they were on Lebron, Lebron has seemed to realize that he’s going to need to play within an offensive system in order to actually beat the best teams which is why he joined a team with multiple high level passers and the 7th highest in assists per game as a team (23.8) so he can use his gravity in the offense much more effectively which will only lead to more team assists which is the sign of a high functioning offense.    Oh and Washington averaged the 5th most assists per game as a team so their offense was actually clicking very well. Their assists were actually distributed much more evenly across the board"
"CP3 has been the best player on a team winning a playoff series.  Way more efficient and a better defender than Russell.  Heck, Thunder a few years ago barely beat Clips when KD was star of Thunder and CP3 was star of Clippers.  CP3 much better playoff performer than Westbrook."

"Not me but my brother had to guard Russell Westbrook in high school but this was pre-dunking Westbrook his junior year.

"Full Quote:  &gt;There’s this narrative that Russell Westbrook is a bad teammate and that people don’t want to play alongside him. You hear it from some media members and from opposing fans. Some people say it’s because he doesn’t pass enough, some people bring up his personality. As someone who’s played with Russ for two years and gotten to know him well, what do you think of that narrative?  &gt;JG: That’s just ignorant. I think people just listen to the media and believe it, but Russ is a great teammate and a great person. Players obviously want to play with him. PG just re-signed to come back. I just re-signed to come back. I know of a lot of players who want to be in OKC. I think that’s a huge misconception in the media and I don’t know why it’s said. He’s a great player and everyone wants to play with great players because we all want to win. He definitely passes the ball. I’m not really sure what else to say about that. It’s just ignorance."

"The only point guards with better ten year stretches are Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson, ~~Isiah Thomas and arguably Gary Payton, Steve Nash, Russell Westbrook, and Chris Paul.~~  FTFY."
Imagine we hit Houston and the person Melo's failing at guarding in the PnR is Russell Westbrook.
"On an unrelated note I find it kind of amusing (and pretty cool tbh) that James Harden and Russell Westbrook essentially swapped MVPs, scoring titles, and assists titles going from 2016-2017 to 2017-2018"
"During John Stockton's *ten year peak*, he averaged 16/13 with 2.6 steals on 61.9 TS%, while only missing four regular season games. He made the playoffs every single season and played 108 playoff games during that stretch, averaging 16/12 on 57.4 TS%. During that ten year stretch, he was named All-Star nine times, All-NBA ten times, and All-Defense team five times. Even if you just consider those ten years, and not the other nine of his career, he would still be second all-time in total assists and ninth all-time in total steals.  Other point guards had greater individual seasons or multi-season stretches, but Stockton's sustained excellence over an entire decade (not even considering his other nine contributing seasons) is incredible. The only point guards with better ten year stretches are Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson, Isiah Thomas and arguably Gary Payton, Steve Nash, Russell Westbrook, and Chris Paul."
"You're missing my point.  LeBron James has flaws.  James Harden has flaws. Russell Westbrook has flaws.  Draymond Green has flaws. Giannis Antetokounmpo has flaws.  It's not always about who has the least weaknesses, but who has the greatest strengths and can be more impactful overall."
"Russell ""no chill"" westbrook"
"&gt; We really discrediting Russ's accomplishments because KD was there?  The Cavs just made 4 straight finals.  Do you expect them to make the Finals this season?  I can't believe this needs to be explained, tbh.  &gt;Russ has only had 2 seasons to do something since KD left, the first with a completely shit, hollowed out roster.  Oladipo, Adams, Roberson, Kanter is not a 'completely shit, hollowed out' roster.  Especially when OKC fans spent most of last season bleating about how Roberson was a DPOY candidate and Kanter was a top 5 center.    &gt;It's really unfair to focus on those two seasons when he's had a career full of success.  He has never lead a team past the first round.  I personally don't care enough about Russell Westbrook to make that criticism, but it is a valid point.  You can keep complaining about it, but it's valid.  "

"Read below from an Action Network article and come back to that thought:  ""For starters, there’s this: Oklahoma City’s starters (Russell Westbrook, George, Anthony, Steven Adams) are +14.8 this season per 100 possessions in net rating with Roberson on the floor. They are +1.8 without him. It is a devastating differential.  The Thunder were fifth in defensive rating (points allowed per 100 possessions) going into the game Roberson was injured. Since then? They rank 17th.  *Yeah, but what about the offense?*  Good question: Before Roberson’s injury, Oklahoma City had the ninth-best offense in the league, despite a horrible start to the season. Since then? OKC’s offense ranks 17th.""  That’s not to say Roberson was a great offensive player. But it’s pretty clear that OKC could compensate for Roberson’s offensive limitations in a way it cannot compensate for losing his defensive presence."

lol this is my exact point. 'Bill Russell is top 5' yet they've never even watched an entire game of him. Wilt is considered dominant because of his stats yet these are probably the same people that say Westbrook puts up empty stats.

Even if you take into account lineups, variance and strength of opponent.  This means that if instead of Carmelo you added a player that adds +0 points per 100 possessions, OKC would be better off.   Melo impacted the team negatively over the course of the season, and it's the 2nd year in a row he's a net negative (-0.4 PIPM in the Knicks superteam).  -----------  Edit: And that doesn't take into account the playoffs, where everyone was awful, but Melo was the worst one. The teams performance tanked against the Jazz. It's surprising how little criticism the Thunder players got for their playoff performances, since everyones rating went 2 points lower.

"I liken watching baseball on TV to watching poker on TV. It can be hella exciting, but its not aesthetically pleasing. These guys aren't exactly acrobats doing inhuman movements that make you jump out of your seat.  Regardless, their skill is in inhuman. The sort of control these guys have over curve balls and sliders is a genetic gift, as is hitting those balls.  But watching Russell Westbrook break down 4 guys going coast to coast, and dunking on them, or watching Antonio Brown stretch out for a huge diving catch, isn't exactly like watching Ubaldo Jimenez carve out a line-up of batters with brilliantly ordered series of change-ups and fastballs.  Its awesome and cool in its own way, but its not exactly acrobats and ninjas wowing you with over the top display of ballerina-esque athleticism. Occasionally you get amazing plays by fielders, but those are far too rare to keep people who haven't studied the game hooked.  I think the league is going to eventually have to adopt rules that the NBA, NFL and NHL have to make it more offensive oriented if they want to remain competitive. Pitchers control the games, the batters and fielders are secondary. They need a better balance of the three, and you will get a lot more acrobatic and aesthetically pleasing displays of athleticism.  I don't know how to do that. Maybe change the rules on the size of bats ever so slightly? Move the mound back a feet or two? I really have no clue, but I think they're eventually going to have to see the league batting average go up if they want to keep casual fans excited. And unfortunately, that has been on its way down for a while, pitchers are getting too good.

"If we’re just talking about scoring, it’s absolutely Lonzo Ball. Out of the 400+ players who played 20+ games and took more than 5 shots per game, Lonzo Ball was BOTTOM 10 in FG% and FT%. He was an above average defender and a great rebounding guard. But his scoring ability was sad. He’s basically Russell Westbrook Jr. Lonzo is one of the VERY FEW people to take more shots per game than points per game. Let me remind you, that is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to achieve. "
"I dont know what to tell you with regard to Kareem. He is up there with the very best in my eyes. I put more value on Chips but he is a GOAT level player.  And i meant in the playoffs vs Wilt, but regardless - Bill was the best player on the best team, and a greater teammate who made everyone better. Wilt was an athletic freak and all time talent who was also a proto-westbrook style stat padder. Both were all time greats but Russell was a better winner."
"Before Celtics fans comment, heres all the players that I believe are better than 1× Allstar, 0× everything else, Gordan Hayward. I will go from team to team, not rankings.  1. Kyrie Irving 2. Al Horford 3. Jayson Tatum 4. Kevin Love 5. Kristaps Porzingis 6. Andre Drummond 7. Blake Griffin 8. Kemba Walker 9. Joel Embiid 10. Ben Simmons 11. Victor Oladipo 12. John Wall 13. Bradley Beal 14. Kawhi Leonard 15. Kyle Lowry 16. Giannis Antetoukoumpo 17. Khris Middleton 18. Nikola Jokic 19. Steph Curry 20. Draymond Green 21. Kevin Durant 22. Klay Thompson 23. Demarcus Cousins 24. James Harden 25. Chris Paul 26. Clint Capela 27. Jimmy Butler 28. KAT 29. Mike Conley 30. Marc Gasol 31. Russell Westbrook 32. Paul George 33. Steven Adams 34. Lebron James 35. Brandon Ingram 36. Anthony Davis 37. Damian Lilliard 38. CJ McCollum 39. Devin Booker 40. Demar Derozan 41. LaMarcus Aldridge 42. Donovan Mitchell 43. Rudy Gobert  Thats 43 players. You dont have to agree with all of them, but theres no way that Hayward is better than 18 of these guys and claim ""top 25 player"".         "
"He’s played in the league for one year, and he shot 34% from three while shooting 7 a game. League average for shooting threes is 36%. I don’t think we can blanket say that’s his whole career.   We somehow think that Ben Simmons can add a three, or even a midrange to his game. Laker fans, myself included, add hoping to see Lonzo up his three. We think Giannis is going to add a decent three at some point. Russell Westbrook is trying to add one now   But it doesn’t always have to be waiting for some hypothetical. Brook Lopez added a decent three to his game. Kawhi added a three after entering the league. Jason Kidd was not a shooter when he entered the league, but became one of the best ever.   All those guys started with virtually no three point shot. The first group wants to be decent, the second group was. Mitchell’s already pretty decent at it. I don’t see how we can’t expect growth out of him, just as we did with the others. If he’s average now, why can’t he grow to a higher percentage? "
"When I see Russell Westbrook I see the Kobe in him. Kobe had a better supporting cast than Westbrook ever did/does though. 2012 was great, but I'm not sure how it compares to Shaq, Horry, Fisher supporting cast. Even 2010 had Bynum, Fisher, Odom, Gasol, Artest, and Brown.   I think if the core would have stayed together then maybe OKC would have had a similar supporting cast (I say supporting, but KD would have been option #1). It was too many high caliber players and could not pay them all + Harden wanted more of the spotlight than 6th man.  But why is Westbrook spoke about so differently than Kobe? They have almost same mentality and I'd say Westbrook is even more athletic. Is it because of the defense?"
During KD's prime he has had more help on his teams than any player ever.  Oscar during his prime probably had the least (of any top 20 player).  Of the 10 years Oscar was on the Royals (with no help) they were top 3 in offensive efficiency 9 of those 10 years (including being 1st for 5 straight years).  Oscar was able to do this because he scored 30 points a game and was top 3 in TS% while averaging 10 assists a game.  He was basically Russell Westbrook with Steph Curry's efficiency.  You give any guard no defensive help and they aren't going to be able to win.     
"How people expect Westbrook to act:  Waiter: ""I'm sorry Russell Westbrook we don't serve PB&amp;J here. Can I interest you in any of our steaks?""  Westbrook: ""What's my answer?""  Waiter: ""I should go to the grocery store and buy some peanut butter and jelly?""  Westbrook: ""There you go."""
Okay so what's the argument for Melo being better than any of these 10 guys [I got from a random ranking](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2768443-ranking-the-top-50-players-in-the-2018-nba-playoffs#slide17):  * Lebron James * Kevin Durant * James Harden * Steph Curry * Russell Westbrook * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * KAT * Chris Paul
&gt; There were reports of him refusing to run plays during crunch time  Do you know how many NBA players you could say that about?   Is Russell Westbrook a cancer? Was Michael Jordan a cancer? 
"If Russell Westbrook had Steph's athleticism, he would not be in the nba"
I like Russell Westbrook and think he’s a good player 
LeBron James (obviously)   Steph Curry  Kevin Durant  Dwyane Wade   Chris Paul  Dirk Nowitzki  James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Manu Ginobili   Tony Parker   Vince Carter 
Russell Westbrook is better than Curry and Harden
"I had a long post drawn up, but it really comes down to this. It's sort of a weird comparison, but Charles Barkley was the 90s version of Russell Westbrook. Not as lean, not as fast, but bigger and stronger (though they're probably about the same height...). Guys like that just have a killer instinct to destroy their competition and they have the physical gifts to do it."
Russell Westbrook is a good player and isn't an overrated chucker
Russell Westbrook isn't a good teammate.
russell westbrook is the best PG in the nba. 
Carmelo Anthony was bad last year because of Russell Westbrook
"The T-Wolves are never going to be good unless KAT discovers consistent defense, and Andrew Wiggins just isn't what he was hyped to be. Portland isn't going anywhere with Dame and CJ as their top 2 guys. AD is leaving New Orleans unless something drastic happens with the roster. Blake Griffin just isn't a franchise player. Trae Young was probably the wrong pick for Atlanta. A team built around a big that plays no defense (Jokic) just isn't going to win a title in the current NBA. Ben Simmons actually does need a jump shot to take Philly to the next level. Russell Westbrook probably isn't quite the right guy to lead a team to a championship."
"He wasn't just big, fast, long, and strong, he was very skilled on offense. How many power forwards played ever that you'd be ok with grabbing a rebound and pushing the ball up the floor themselves, at full tilt no less? That was Barkley's signature play, grabbing and going like a 280 lb Russell Westbrook. "
"Wait, are you telling me James Harden, Russell Westbrook, *and* Kevin Durant were on the same team? "
"""I'd have lots of rings if I had Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook carrying me"""
"Russell Westbrook has been in top 5 of MVP voting for 4 years, and actual won it. Kawhi's Finals MVP did not make him a superstar no more than Iggy's did. It's an accolade for a 4 out of 7 game series, not 82 games. "
Russell Westbrook is literally the worst player ever.
Wow this russell westbrook guy must be awful. Does he at least make it up with rebounding and playmaking?
Wtf I hate Russell Westbrook now. 
"Bro, look at Steven and JV head to head match ups JV can’t score on Steven and when Steven gets his few iso opportunities, JV gets hurt.  Just because he is USED as a PnR Big because he plays with RUSSELL WESTBROOK. Doesn’t mean he has no skill, that shit is just not needed. Not saying he is an all star talent, but what he CAN do isn’t as necessary for the team.  It’s like Shaq dialing back his full arsenal to play in the triangle offense. The team didn’t need all of his moves"
“was the man THE MYTH **THE LEGEND** RUSSELL WESTBROOK NOT INVI- oh”
"* Shaq/Kobe  * Curry/Durant  * Jordan/Pippen  * Kareem/Oscar  * Kareem/Magic  * Shaq/Penny -- brief but amazing  * Stockton/Malone  * Bird/McHale -- McHale is criminally underrated  * West/Wilt -- Lakers Wilt was not Warriors or Sixers Wilt  * Russell/Sam Jones  * Durant/Westbrook  * LeBron/Kyrie  * LeBron/Wade  * Magic/Worthy  * Reed/Frazier  * Moses/Erving  * T-Mac/Yao  * Dirk/Nash -- more could've been than actually was  * Nash/Amare  * Duncan/Robinson -- kinda more on paper than really, Robinson was declining  * Duncan/Kawhi -- not really, looks good in retrospect but Kawhi was pre-prime and Duncan was at the end  * Duncan/Parker -- more Duncan/Parker/Ginobili than just a duo  * Hakeem/Sampson -- like 2 glorious years  * Simmons/Embiid -- possibly in the future will prove to be an all time duo  probably more I'm forgetting. list isn't really in order, though generally tried to put the stronger ones at the top."
"And then if we consider that guys like Russell Westbrook are reportedly left handed, but learned to shoot right growing up, that number is probably even closer to 10% in reality. "
he's gonna be either the next Derrick Rose or next Russell Westbrook
"Kyle Singler and Andre Roberson aren't comparable in the slightest. Roberson plays 26 minutes a game, Singler plays 5 minutes a game.  Russell Westbrook and Roberson aren't comparable either since Westbrook is shooting basically 30% from 3 and puts up 4 shots a game while Roberson isn't even averaging 1 shot a game from 3.  Again, if Roberson could actually shoot from 3, he'd shoot more from there and have a better percentage. He made 8 3 pointers in 39 games and 1037 minutes.  The team was actually better on offense when Roberson was out of the game than in, so that's not true.  I'm not talking about his cutting and driving, he's actually fairly decent in that role. I'm not trying to discount the guy, OKC is overall better when Roberson plays, but there's no need to overrate the guy by saying he's able to shoot when every metric in the game says he can't."
PG - Russell Westbrook  SG - Ray Allen  SF - Grant Hill  PF - Dennis Rodman  C - Shaq  Lulz
Lmao. Russell westbrook has as many triple double averaging seasons as simmons has rookie season
"He's never been an all-star because he has to contend with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, James Harden, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, used to contend with Kobe Bryant and now has to contend with DeMar DeRozan. There's like 7 future HOFers in that list. The guy's still not exactly Chandler Parsons.  (Side-note, Chandler Parsons has to have the worst contract in the history of basketball)"
" &gt;10. Five days after firing coach Dwane Casey following a sweep at the hands of the Cavaliers, the Raptors send out a tweet congratulating him for being named a finalist for Coach of the Year. 9. Bulls forward Bobby Portis clocks Nikola Mirotic in the face during practice, breaking multiple bones in Mirotic’s face. In the aftermath, most of the Bulls seem to take Portis’ side. With Mirotic out, Portis gets a significantly larger role in the Bulls’ rotation. Mirotic returns to the lineup in early December and the Bulls go on a seven-game winning streak fueled by the Bulls outscoring their opponents by 39 points in the 86 minutes Portis and Mirotic share the floor. 8. Jason Kidd gets fired by the Bucks and then tells anybody who will listen (though he told Ramona Shelburne first) that Giannis Antetokounmpo tried to save Kidd’s job. 7. LeBron James essentially stages an on-court strike for the entire month of January in an (ultimately successful) effort to get half his team traded. In the final game before the trade deadline, LeBron chest-bumps Cedi Osman and Tristan Thompson while celebrating a game-winning shot … but snubs Isaiah Thomas, who is traded the following day. 6. J.R. Smith gets suspended by the Cavs for throwing a bowl of soup at assistant coach Damon Jones. 5. Kevin Durant, who is definitely not sensitive and/or Mad Online, gets caught operating multiple burner Twitter and Instagram accounts. Durant states, among other things, that he didn’t like the Thunder organization or playing for Billy Donovan. He also says the roster in Oklahoma City featured a bunch of bums (and Russell Westbrook), explaining, “Kd can’t win a championship with those cats.” 4. Shortly after a tension-filled game featuring Chris Paul’s return to Staples Center, it’s reported that the Houston Rockets utilized a purportedly secret tunnel to confront the Los Angeles Clippers’ Austin Rivers and Blake Griffin. The reported plan involved sending Clint Capela to the front door of the Clippers locker room as a distraction while Paul, James Harden, Trevor Ariza, and Gerald Green sneak around the back. Several NBA players claim the tunnel isn’t actually secret, but nobody cares because calling it a “secret tunnel” is funnier. Updated reporting indicates that Paul and Harden were peacemakers and that Tarik Black—not Capela—went to the front door of the locker room. Again, nobody cares because the other version is much funnier. 3. In late September, San Antonio announces Kawhi Leonard will be out for the entire preseason with “right quadriceps tendinopathy.” The Spurs issue vague statements about his progress throughout the first two months of the season before he finally returns to the floor in mid-December. After nine games, the Spurs announce he’s out indefinitely. ESPN then reports a rift between Leonard and the Spurs, stemming from Leonard’s reliance on outside medical opinions. As Leonard spends more time away from the team, conspiracy theories emerge about his alleged unhappiness in San Antonio and every person in America fires up the trade machine. Tony Parker, meanwhile, tells the media his own quad injury was “100 times worse” than Leonard’s, and Gregg Popovich repeatedly answers questions about his star’s status by saying that Leonard’s “group” will decide when he can play again. 2. No. 1 overall pick Markelle Fultz suffers a mysterious injury—or does he????—that robs him of the ability to shoot. Videos (like, dozens of them) surface of Fultz shooting free throws and jumpers with a janky-ass form that looks absolutely horrifying, and Fultz becomes the subject of endless internet fascination as people debate whether the injury is real. Fultz sits out every game from Oct. 25 through March 26, all the while continually taking strange-looking jumpers (including a session in which he strictly shoots with his left hand) in front of media members who film him continuously. Almost immediately upon his return, Fultz breaks his teammate Joel Embiid’s face. 1. Spurred by an anonymous tipster, the Ringer puts together an exhaustive case which suggests 76ers president of basketball operations Bryan Colangelo operates five burner Twitter accounts that he uses to: disparage the performance of his predecessor in Philly (Sam Hinkie) and successor in Toronto (Masai Ujiri); criticize Sixers coach Brett Brown; telegraph the trade in which the Sixers moved up in the draft to pick Fultz; criticize Sixers players drafted by Hinkie such as Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, and Joel Embiid; disclose private medical information about Okafor; and engage in gossip about Embiid’s off-court exploits. As of this writing, internet sleuths have decided some of the accounts may have been operated by Colangelo’s wife."

Russell Westbrook will win a ring eventually and I will hit diamond on rainbow six siege eventually.
Of course Westbrook is a great teammate r/nba is just full of blogbois That change the narrative depending on what their arguing. Example. Calling KD to golden state the weakest move in history and a free ring when defending LeBron but act like KD would rather play for the Brooklyn nets than play with Russell Westbrook when the team he left him for is the best regular season team of all time 
Bill Russell Westbrook. 
"If Russell Westbrook didn’t spend half the game charging at the basket like a runaway freight train Adams wouldn’t even average 5 points a night. He’s benefited more from Westbrook than anyone else on that damn roster, this team probably would have made it to the 2nd round if they replaced Adams with Deandre Jordan last year. "
"What the fuck does that mean, Russell Westbrook?"
"Not crazy but close.  Only once in the last 30 years has an MVP come from a team that didn't finish top 2 in their conference. It took Russell Westbrook averaging a triple double to make it happen.  Oladipo has a near 0% chance to win the MVP if the pacers don't outperform three of the Celtics, Raptors, Sixers, Bucks and that seems very unlikely to me."

Russell Westbrook: Defensive eye control. MY MVP
"If Anthony Davis misses this shot, the game goes to overtime. Russ and KD lead the OKC Thunder to a victory. The Thunder grab the 8th seed over Davis' New Orleans Pelicans several months later. The now healthy Thunder play against the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the NBA Playoffs. The Thunder pull off an upset in 7 games. The Thunder lose to the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. The Rockets play the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. The Cavaliers win in 7 games.

In 2016, the Thunder face the Warriors again, but this time in the Western Conference Finals. This is the Thunder's 7th consecutive playoff appearance.

The Oklahoma City Thunder win their first championship at home in just 6 games. Westbrook and Durant share a Finals MVP. This crowd is ecstatic! In 2017, Zaza Pachulia is not with the Warriors.

"Whats the point of competing for a first round knock out. You already know he will leave after a year if it doesnt work out because of location. Also dont give up on Sexton, he reminds me a ton of russell westbrook and if you kept up with him you know he grinds to get better and is probably the most hardworking player in that class. I know you guys are used to having things happen quickly but just build on your young pieces for now. "
wouldn't all these dudes dominate as goalies? I'd think someone like Russell Westbrook could be the best goaltender ever
"When? Especially having pulled their starters with 8 mins left and down 17 with 2 mins left   They were there to statpad, that's why Russell got mad for Adams not shooting when he made a even better pass instead   It ignores how Adams boxes out for Westbrook to pad his rebounds "
https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/10/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-golden-state-warriors-thunder-work-friends  You talk big but you failed to type it into Google yourself. KD said that because that is what you are supposed to say about your teammate. He doesn't really feel that way

"Dude, LeBron cost himself the MVP. He tanked for a month to get IT and Crowder off the team. Soon as they were gone he went from DeMar DeRozan stats to Russell Westbrook stats, lol"
Russell Westbrook is Matthew McConaughey's bookcase in interstellar
&gt; nobody will ever win anything with russell westbrook on their team  Except before KD left he was a huge part of multiple 55+ win championship contenders. The Thunder coulda won a championship by now if injuries hadn't taken two playoff runs from them. 
I don't think he's over rated but let me just say that nobody will ever win anything with russell westbrook on their team or donovan being your coach
And you shouldn't be.  The jump to Russell Westbrook/Demar Derozan efficiency from 3 is the realistic jump here.  He might get to Lebron level (extremely likely never KD) but right now that would be an astronomical jump for a single offseason going from terrible 3pt shooter to you can't leave him open.  
Its nonsensical to bring stats into the equation. It’s not fair to say that Ben Simmons is a better rebounder and passer because he got more of them as a point guard than lebron did as a small forward. Ben clearly has a huge advantage for rebounds playing against ppl that are usually at least half a foot shorter and an advantage for assists because he’s the only one to bring up the ball unlike rookie lebron. We don’t say that Russell Westbrook is better than lebron based on the numbers. 
"&gt; You really want to make the argument that if lebron was in the same position and system as Jaylen  But he's not. So he isn't a better defender. I'm sure Russell Westbrook would be a much better defender if he didn't have to average a fucking triple double to make the playoffs, but nobody is calling him a good defender. Stop it. "
John Wall and Cousins if he were healthy  Russell Westbrook and James Harden for good times sake  Ben Simmons and Donovan Mitchell because I feel like their games compliment each other  Steve Nash and AD  
"I’m fucking with you if you couldn’t tell btw. I knew you were probably talking about this season, but technically you weren’t. We call this a bait. Also he can be talking about dunking on someone when it’s friendly banter. Also you saw what happened to Russell Westbrook right?"
"from a 538 article:  &gt;Ever since Durant took home that hardware, Westbrook has outshone him in both Real Plus-Minus (8.1 to 5.6) and Box Plus/Minus (10.7 to 6.7). You can blame a little of that on a banged-up Durant toiling through injuries — his per-minute numbers are slightly down since 2013-14 — but most of it is because Westbrook has become an irrepressible hardwood force in his own right. Durant hasn’t gotten appreciably worse; Westbrook has simply gotten that much better. He may not quite be the best player in basketball right now (Steph Curry is off in another dimension), but Westbrook has staked a pretty solid claim to the No. 2 slot, well ahead of even Durant’s form in his MVP season.  &gt;Before last season, Westbrook was firmly ensconced behind Durant as the Thunder’s second banana, a configuration that — if history was any kind of guide — appeared ordained to stay in place as long as both players wore an OKC uniform. But Westbrook blossomed in Durant’s absence last year, and the changes to his game have stuck. He’s upped his offensive efficiency — despite a crushing workload — and he’s even improved to become one of the game’s best defensive point guards this season.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-wasnt-supposed-to-get-better-than-kevin-durant/  He started to take the lead role on the team and it seemed pretty evident on the court. He was able to generate shots for everyone and become that true PG. He developed some form maturity that isn't measurable or tangible. The pace that he started to play with was extremely valuable and I've never seen it from him. We have to give Billy Donovan some credit with this. I'm sure Billy got through to Russ somehow and having that change of coaches probably helped him develop a different aspect on the game.  2015-2016 was his 2nd best year, IMO. I think KD getting injured helped him and Russ getting injured helped KD. It's fascinating what growth can come when you have the ball more. "
"My favorite quote is ""what?"" By Russell Westbrook"
"Yeah but Lonzo's ability to rack up assists on such low usage is crazy.   Lonzo, Rondo and Draymond are the only 3 guys in the league to get 6+ assists on &lt;20% USG (all ~17%). Lebron's never played with a playmaker like that.  The usage rate of Lonzo and Rondo combined adds up to roughly 1 Russell Westbrook (34%) and less than James Harden (36%).  Overall, in terms of usage, Rondo + Lonzo + Lebron = Westbrook + Durant.    I think if we see the playmaking centred entirely around these three then we should see them maintain a pretty good level of play.     That's assuming that Lonzo plays at his rookie level too and doesn't see a sophomore jump.   Also, with Rondo moving to the bench (dropping his USG) and Lebron saying he wants to play off-ball a little more  (dropping his USG) I think there might actually be enough space for Lonzo to feast."
**OKC**  4: Russell Westbrook  24: Serge Ibaka   
"The difference is, OKC has Russell Westbrook, an MVP caliber player, the Hornets do not."
"according to this sub?  James Harden, Draymond Green, Dwight Howard, Russell Westbrook and KD"
Russell Westbrook being able to play defense and not doing it is worse than KAT being soft. 
Goku - LeBron James Vegeta - Russell Westbrook Android 17 - Jimmy Butler Piccolo - Kevin Love Krillin - Tyrone Lue Majin Boo - Kevin Durant
"westbrook is especially bad with all that wasted athleticism. if a ""regular"" guy like chris paul can play solid defense, then russell should honestly be the next gary payton"
"I'd go with guys with distinct looks and playstyles, like the first one. My picks would be:  Russell Westbrook James Harden Anthony Davis Kevin Durant not sure a bout the last...Blake Griffin maybe? "
There is literally a quote about Melo telling Westbrook to just play his own game after he was trying too hard to get he and PG13 involved at the start of the season.   Edit [source](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2017/12/28/carmelo-russell-westbrook-is-more-effective-by-not-deferring-to-me/) 
"Not only did he not make an all defense team, [he got 0 votes for the all defensive teams](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8lll87/voting_for_the_nba_alldefensive_teams/), putting him behind noted defensive stoppers like Russell Westbrook and Dame Lillard."
The constant disrespect towards Ben Simmons is so confusing. Dude was a top 10 defender at 3 different positions on the court with 15/8/8 as a rookie lol. Giannis is the Russell Westbrook of the East. Stat stuffing doesn’t always lead to wins 
"Almost everyone in the NBA does lol. KD, Kawhi, Paul George, Paul Pierce, Chris Paul, Klay Thompson, Russell Westbrook... all of them are or were attached to the Lakers at some point."
"and thats all scoring is dude, or else Otto Porter would be a better scorer than Russell Westbrook because he's more efficient and takes a backseat."
"Games: Stephen Curry - 7 games  Anthony Davis - 13  Damian Lillard - 11  Giannis Antetokounmpo - 14  Russell Westbrook - 14  James Harden - 11  LeBron James - 13  Kyrie Irving - 10  Tyreke Evans - 9  Kevin Durant - 10  Edit * I thought players had a lot less back to backs before finding this, most teams had around 12-14"
1. LeBron  2. Stephen Curry  3. Kevin Durant  4. Dwight Howard (I almost put him 3rd fwiw)  5. James Harden  6. Chris Paul  7. Dirk Nowitzki  8. Dwayne Wade  9. Russell Westbrook  10. Anthony Davis  Melo gets honorable mention at 11th.
Can you imagine having Russell Westbrook as your father-in-law?
Russell Westbrook only makes love for the purpose of having children and he gets his wife pregnant the first try every single time so shut your disrespectful mouth.
"My wife hates basketball. All the players she would know come from me or something in the non-sports media.  Current: LeBron, Curry, KD, Russell Westbrook (my favorite player), Harden  Past: MJ, Pippen, Shaq, Kobe, Rodman"

Not to mention the fact that every picture of Kawhi hes surrounded by like 4 raptors coaches lol"
So then I guess Russell Westbrook outplayed LeBron too in 2017?
"Melo also looked fantastic last off season in pick up games against  Russell Westbrook, Paul George and cp3 and we thought he was in shape. We still have to take this with a grain of salt.  Obviously Luka has something to prove and is a young player. He may have different motivations, drive, etc. But this is still a watch out. "
"Russell Westbrook needs to tweak his jump shot ever so slightly and he'll be a knockdown three point shooter. Also derrick rose is going to have the best shooting season of his career from three,  I'm calling it."
"For real. I could easily see Giannis staying with the Bucks for his whole career. Not to mention guys like Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Steph Curry, and Damian Lillard all have been loyal, and received the loyalty quantity of money in return for it. "
WR: Russell Westbrook
"They're automatic finalists for another 3-4 years. The Raptors have a great core group of young players who will fill out what Lowry leaves behind as he ages. Plus, Lowry has transformed into a high-skill PG who isn't beating you with his explosiveness.  On top of this, Lowry has played a relatively low amount of NBA games for his age. Russell Westbrook is 3 years younger than him, and has played approximately 750 games, while Lowry has only played 790 games.  With Vanvleet, Siakam, Poetl, Delon Wright maturing, I think they could seriously give the Warriors some trouble in a year or two.  1 - Kyle Lowry2 - Jimmy Butler  3 - Kawhi Leonard4 - Taj Gibson5 - Jonas Valanciunus  Bench: Wright, CJ Miles, Vanvleet, Monroe, Siakam, Poetl.  That is outright scary. And with that roster, and their young guys becoming more and more valuable, they could easily make some moves to reel in another big name (probably a big).  Edit: Formatting."
"""Russell Westbrook is the closest thing we have to an active volcano in the NBA""  Lol"
"A'ight, here's a shooting percentage comparison. I will compare the following players:  - Rubio,  - Westbrook, since he is regarded as an elite scorer *and* is Rubio's opponent in the video,  - Jeff Teague, because he was touted as the replacement ""who will actually score unlike Rubio"".   I'll use the last season, since earlier you said ""Rubio has barely improved"".   [Basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Ricky+Rubio&amp;player_id1_select=Ricky+Rubio&amp;player_id1=rubiori01&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id2_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;y2=2018&amp;player_id3_hint=Jeff+Teague&amp;player_id3_select=Jeff+Teague&amp;player_id3=teaguje01&amp;y3=2018)   Rubio shot 1.6% worse from three than Teague. And 5.4% **better** than Westbrook. Yes, better.    From inside, he was worse. 2.6% worse than Teague and 3.4% worse than Westbrook.    From the free throw line, he was **12.9%** better than Westbrook and slightly better than Teague.    I'll give you that his inside shooting is not as good. But Westbrook is regarded as elite, right?   What I'm trying to say here is, that, no, his shooting is not better than those guys. But you should call it average at this point of his career. Three percent worse from inside, while on par (or even better) from three and free throws is not what people should call *bad scoring*. He's not *bad* as you state.   Now compare those to his rookie season and see if he barely improved.   And while Teague is definitely better at shooting (by the astoundingly huge margin according to reddit of ~2%), the Wolves are paying him 4 million more than Ricky so fans can see [this](https://youtu.be/khjxyiNfVSI?t=9s) multiple times per game. Yay?"
Rozier may have more talent but he often doesn't play to the benefit of the team. He reminds me a lot of Russell Westbrook (not in terms of skill) but in the fact that he always wants to control the ball (to a fault) and his stats are somewhat padded
Russell Westbrook 
Hurt em more - never forget that Russell Westbrook and Paul George got outperformed by a rookie in the first round 
Russell Westbrook.  He just looks like he is always mad. I have remind myself teammates go out of their way to say he is a good teammate because from body language alone I am pretty sure he wants to murder every person he meets.
and Russell Westbrook.
"**Playoffs Shooting Percentages 17-18 (Totals per game)**      **2P%**   Ricky Rubio: 38%   Russell Westbrook: 41%      **3P%**   Ricky Rubio: 31%   Russell Westbrook: 36%      **FT%**   Ricky Rubio: 79%   Russell Westbrook: 83%      I don't care what numbers from Russ make you happy, I'm glad Rubio isn't my point guard."
I mean Russell Westbrook was close  two years ago. He finished 3rd in assist per game that year and led the league in points per game
"Name a year where lebron won a ring by himself. You cant hold it against kd for going to the warriors. No team with Russell Westbrook on it will ever win a championship, he plays his best basketball in a way that detracts from his teammates play."
Russell Westbrook is the player who is most likely to get a triple double
Harden actually had the greatest offensive season ever in 16-17   Downvoted for facts... https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/russell-westbrook-nba-best-individual-season-greatest-all-time-michael-jordan-stephen-curry-040817
"Not really. He's been an amazing player for a while, just didn't get his due, and his team and coaching staff were not up to par. He was small and skinny, and similar to Conley, didn't put up a lot of shots, so casuals weren't in love with him. Sadly for Conley he's stuck in a super small market playing 80s basketball while he's one of the best point guards of the decade. At least Curry got a modern coach and good teammates at some point.    Player|PIPM| :--|:--| Devin Booker - 2017/18|-1.3| DeMar DeRozan - 2017/18|+1.5| Stephen Curry - 2011/12|+2.1| Kyrie Irving - 2017/18|+2.3| Stephen Curry - 2013/14|+5.5| Mike Conley - 2012/13|+5.8| Kevin Durant - 2016/17 (GSW)|+5.9| Russell Westbrook - 2016/17 (MVP)|+6.7| Stephen Curry - 2016/17 (KDs 1st year)|+8.8|  Curry has always been extremely underrated. He was seen as a ""shooter"" early on, while he was already an MVP level player under Mark Jackson. His boxscore stats have never been *extremely* impressive a la Russ, but they were still very good. Curry casually averages almost 7 assists for his career, while playing alongside David Lee, Monta Ellis, Stephen Jackson, Jarret Jack, etc, and under Mark Jackson. The Warriors were 12th in ORtg in 2013, which says enough of Jacksons coaching.  Curry is the ultimate plug and play guard. He fits **every team**, and contrary to popular belief, he's an average defender, and sometimes even a good one. He doesn't have Durants height, but he's smart, quick in the passing lanes, stays in front of his man and stays focused.  ------------  If Player Impact Plus Minus doesn't work for you, Curry has been at the top of RPM since it was created. 6th in 2013, and 1st in 2014, top 4 **at least** since then.   He just never got the credit he deserved until he averaged 30ppg, since there's people that still believe Harden should have won MVP in 2015 (lol)  Something similar happens to Draymond, where his alltime great defensive presence is undermined.  Meanwhile KD for some reason is though of as a good defender, and people think Klay is prime Sidney Moncrief, while he's very average on the defensive end.  "
"You might think that, but he was 27 in the 2015-16 season which makes it fairly normal.  For comparison, Russell Westbrook was 28 in his MVP season, Steve Nash was 31-32 for his MVPs, James Harden was 28 last year."
"I think Westbrook will retain his athleticism much better than Dwade. Unless he’s knee issues prove to be lingering and debilitating like Wades, He’ll keep his explosiveness but lose that relentlessness  To me Dwades athletic decline was extremely obvious on defense bc he was one of the best defenders in the NBA until 2013. Russell isn’t the same on defense but unlike Wade he doesn’t have a reliable fadeaway move or can play out of the post. Still Wade was a good player for Miami and his savvy moves prevented a swift decline  They won’t age the same way but wen Westbrook loses that ability to go 0-100 in 2 seconds for long stretches it will become ugly. His mid range pull up only works bc defenses r scared about him driving past a defender. Wen he loses burst and bounce ability, he’ll be extremely ineffective  Tl;dr - his decline won’t occur gradually like Wades but wen it does it will be ugly"
"IIRC you guys gave russell westbrook and john wall A perimeter defense grades  most NBA observers don’t think much of either guy’s defense at this point  without giving away your methodology, what aspects of defense does your approach value higher than other evaluators/metrics?"
Melooooo lmao  As a side some of my favorite photos of Thunder players are at away games with a yellow/gold crowd during the playoffs. The contrast of the blue and gold is very pleasing. 2016 Warriors series comes to mind.   [example](https://www.slamonline.com/archives/russell-westbrook-kevin-durant-havent-talked/) 
"Picked the top ten with my wife when this started. I got pretty close but only one spot on:  10- Chris Paul, 9- Jimmy Butler, 8- Joel Embiid, 7- Giannis A, 6- Russell Westbrook  Got the top 10-6 right, just different ordering.  5- Steph Curry, 4- Davis, 3- KD, 2- Harden, 1- LeBron.   Only got LBJ in the right spot but picked all the right dudes in pretty close positions.   "
"None of that makes his teammates better....he only passed because he had the second highest usage rate of all time. Nobody gets better playing with kobe. Same with Russell Westbrook. His bbiq??? Have any examples? Typical night for kobe when he didnt have all stars on his team was 7 for 24 shooting 25 ft fadeaways getting double teamed in the corner. He never had the ""intangibles"" to make his teammates better. It was always about him, nobody else."
That’s fashion icon Russell Westbrook to YOU. WE STAN A KING
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook. Am I doing this right? 
"Lower. In non-numerical order, here are 13 players I'd take over Draymond.  1. LeBron 2. KD 3. Steph 4. Harden 5. CP3 6. Russell Westbrook 7. PG13 8. Giannis 9. Embiid 10. AD 11. Kawhi Leonard 12. Kyrie Irving 13. Karl Anthony Towns"
Media will build a rift like they did with Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.  Media continues to believe they didn't get along. KDs burner account even defended Russ and called the rest of the teammates trash.
Russell Westbrook will remember that 
"This is such an uninformed take.   His efficiency is above league average. His TS% (56.1%) is just below Brad Beal (56.4%)  His TS% is above guys like:  Demar DeRozan, Blake Griffin, Donovan Mitchell, Kristaps Porzingis, CJ McCollum, Russell Westbrook, and John Wall  "
"Hey guys, I was wondering if y'all could go into a little bit more depth on why Russell Westbrook was ranked ahead of Chris Paul on the Top 100. Both are great players, obviously, but to me, Paul is the better shooter/passer/defender, more malleable, and less exploitable in the playoffs. Great work on the list, as always. "
"&gt; In an appearance on Laugh Out Loud Network’s Cold as Balls with Kevin Hart, Thomas was asked to rank his top 5 point guards in the NBA. He said he’d put himself at No. 1, followed by Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, John Wall and Damian Lillard.   I feel like he was just trolling because of it being a Kevin Hart show"
[Apparently](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/report-mo-bamba-posts-sprint-time-faster-john-wall-russell-westbrook/) Bamba is faster than most of those players. 
"KOC is definitely on the Russell Westbrook all hate team as well.  He's up there with Bill Simmons, coach Nick from bball breakdown, Danny Leroux, and Nate Duncan.  I'd much rather have Russ get scoped when he needs it and take time off to stay healthy when he needs it. A ton of major injuries happen when minor injuries are shrugged off and players play through some pain. "
"I love watching Russell Westbrook, might be my favorite player in the league, but I’m glad he didn’t end up signing with my team. Athleticism is his best skill, and that is a finite resource with an expiration date on it"
"I mean whenever people walk about height though they want that information in relation to other players. Shoes change, and I'd rather know James Harden is exactly 2 inches taller than Russell Westbrook than know that KD is ~about 3 feet from the basket when in shoes.."
Young Russell Westbrook... my first reaction was “was there an old Russell Westbrook?”

"&gt; Are there players that you suggest I keep my eye on? Up-and-comers?   **best dudes in the league/most fun to watch:** pretty much anyone who's been on the all nba / all star team. Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook are considered the best (in no order).  ""**Up-and-comers"":** Ben Simmons, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Nikola Jokic, Karl Anthony Towns, Devin Booker. Luka Doncic is this upcoming year's hyped rookie."
"1) Is OP a doctor?  2) Is OP anywhere near Russell Westbrook and his medical team?  3) Does OP have any inside knowledge about Westbrook's knee, his procedure, his diagnosis, and the current state of his health?  If the answer to these three questions is ""No"" then OP is fear mongering for no real reason. "
"Freaking Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double, again! In two consecutive seasons, that's actually insane!"
"This guy hates Russ, I will never forget the article last year about OKC having a Russell Westbrook problem, and once he started performing he tried backtracking.  Fuck him."
have you ever been russell westbrook? ...or even in the nba for that matter? can we really trust your doubt?
"Nope.   It's entirely possible that without KD, the warriors don't win in 17 and pretty likely they lose in 18. I know this is one of the sideways ways of shitting on KD, but Steph's legacy winning 3 or 4 rings is much better than him 1 ring.  And if Steph were here, he'd probably tell you the same thing.   It's weird, because this point comes up a lot and it's like we're trying to say players should focus on individual accolades over winning to better their *legacy*. But then at the same time, this sub shits on Russell Westbrook for atleast the appearance of focusing on individual accolades."
"When it comes to basketball iq and Russell Westbrook I feel like he'd be that kid in school that never studied but did solid on tests most of the time and got like a B average. You look and think, ""Damn, he'd be a much better student if he studied more or didn't procrastinate"" but for Westbrook it would be either jacking up 10 threes a game (despite being a worse three point shooter than Smart last season), blocking his own teammate (like two seasons ago), or searching for fouls at the three point line that aren't there, or just forcing up bad shots in general.  I'm not saying that his is really bad because he does a lot of good things on the court but imo he is frustrating to watch for me because of his tunnel vision.  Edit."
"https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/sports/wp/2017/02/14/russell-westbrook-is-leading-an-evolution-in-nba-rebounding/   ""Westbrook's rebounding activates Oklahoma City's best brand of offense. The Thunder entered Monday as the 21st-ranked offense in the NBA, but had scored the third-most fast-break points per game. When Westbrook snares a defensive rebound, he zips down the floor, a fast break unto himself. Essentially, Westbrook serves as his own outlet pass.""  ""It's huge,"" Thunder reserve forward Nick Collison said. ""It allows us to get into transition more than a lot of teams. Even just a guy finding him to make the pass, that one second allows them to get back. Some of those that end up in transition shots wouldn't be if we had to find him.""   https://fansided.com/2016/12/05/nylon-calculus-westbrook-triple-doubles/  Fastbreak opportunities are desirable for teams like the Thunder, whose halfcourt offense is mediocre at best and must be supplemented by more dynamic options. Oklahoma City dedicates 17 percent of its possessions to offensive transitions, the highest rate in the NBA. Its effective field goal percentage of 63 ranks in the top 10. While turnovers can be reduced, the fact remains that pushing the ball up the court is a good strategy overall, especially when you consider the alternatives.  also in this same article it talks about how okcs both speed and effective fg percentage off of defensive rebounds significantly rises.   but yea teams dont scheme for their guards to grab defensive rebounds hahahaha"
"Yeah IDK why this is controversial. It's exactly what happens. The big men box, Westbrook gets it and runs it up the court.  The Celtics had an incredibly famous fastbreak system way back with Bill Russell and Bob Cousey.   Russell would get the board and he could throw it to the same spot every time without having to waste time scanning the court because he knew Cousey would be there to catch it and initiate the offence.   Teams having designated defensive rebounding schemes isn't a new thing."
"it was a partial scholarship, and the Westbrooks couldn't afford Stanford.  UCLA stepped in with a basketball scholarship.

That's probably the most Russell Westbrook thing I've ever heard.
"and pays his own bills:  'He is often alone. “I know what to do,” Westbrook says. “I don’t need a bunch of people around to give me—whatever those people give you.” He pays his own bills, a rarity in the NBA, hauling stacks of them into the Thunder lunch room. “This isn’t $32,” a staffer heard him grouse at a miscalculated invoice.

8) Russell Westbrook  9) Chris Paul  10) Joel Embiid
Russell Westbrook just came off of averaging a triple double for the 2nd straight season and George was in solid contention for DPOY for half the season and probably could’ve gotten an all-defense selection as well as being close to the steals title and averaging 20+ points and however many assists and rebounds 
"No.   Not at all. Not even fucking close. Kyrie is literally overrated.   If you're going to actually compare Kobe's mindset it would be Russell Westbrook. He goes hard, every single night, and by far on the court is the best player. Kyrie as amazing as he hit that shot in game 7 is overrated, **heavily**. He appeals well with the younger generation but if you look at his +- they are bad.   The most impactful player on the Celtics is Horford but Kyrie has the nicest handles so everyone remembers him the most. Westbrook literally wants to break you down mentally and destroy you so reconsider your career. "
skill wise perhaps... but playing style wise they aren’t similar at all.   i don’t really see the comparison.  EDIT: comparing lonzo to any pg that can’t shoot is like comparing any athletic pg to russell westbrook. even if their rest of the games are different. or any pg who can shoot to steph curry.

"Some clown once told me Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook were all on the same team. What a joke!"
"Russell Westbrook single-handedly holds the Thunder back and while he's on a team, that team will never be successful."
"&gt;You clearly don’t watch Westbrook if you don’t think he is a better scorer or defender than he was his 3rd year in. Also  Or I'm not watching him with homer goggles.  &gt;”Not at all. Playing a guy who plays with such a chip on his shoulder in Russ who truly believes he's the best player in this league and approaches and attacks the game like that every night and even did so in practices prepared me for the role that I have now with my new team. Every bit of those battles I had since I first got into the NBA and played for Oklahoma City and then playing against Russell I think has prepared me for now.”  Literally nothing about actual basketball. Did he help him read the game so he can pass better? Did he help him with his defensive positioning? Did he help him with his shooting (lol jk)?  &gt;Literally a quote from Reggie in the article crediting Westbrook. You are a hater that doesn’t watch him play, you ignored the passage in which Reggie literally gives Westbrook credit. Watch him play then you can talk I’m done arguing with you when you clearly don’t know what you are talking about and ignore every stat and former teammates that say Westbrook is great and often times credit him for their success.  You're the one ignoring FG%, 3P%, steals, offensive rebounds, assist/TO ratio, first round exits and missing the playoffs."

"&gt;That’s funny because literally everything about him has improved even statistically.  Not the important stats like FG% and 3P%. Or other important metrics like offensive rebounding; he isn't any better of a rebounder, he just grabs more from his big men. Or defensive metrics like steals.  &gt;That’s funny because Enes averages 6 more minutes per game for NYK than he did on OKC.  If you look at his whole time at OKC instead of his final 2 seasons there.  &gt;Reggie literally said the reason he got better is because of Westbrook but I’ll trust you that he hates him.  Do you have any source for Reggie actually praising Westbrick for making him a better player on the court or are you just making shit up. [Because as recently as last year, they didn't like each other.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/russell-westbrook-vs-reggie-jackson-feud-takes-yet-another-petty-turn/)  &gt;And I’m not claiming he is perfect player his jumper could use some work but calling him overrated trash is just you being a hater  He won a fucking MVP and can't even make it out of the first round."
"I'm not saying he's a lockdown defender, just that he's made progress that is visible both on the court and in the advanced stats. Saying Kyrie ""doesn't play defense whatsoever"" is like saying that Russell Westbrook ""Can't hit a 3 to save his life."" Yeah he's below average but it's not as though he's the worst in the league. "
"Go to basketball-reference.com  Search ""Russell Westbrook""  Under ""More"" click ""Game Finder""  From there just modify the parameters to find what you're looking for.  Btw it's 122-78 when Russ scores 30 or more points. Pretty iffy win percentage tbh only 61%."
"Buuuuuuut.... he couldn’t get it done with Westbrook and Harden. And that’s gonna hurt him in an argument against guys like Jordan, Lebron, Magic, Kareem, etc Durant will probably be top 15 for sure. But can you put him ahead of Kobe or Shaq? Because the top 10 is stacked. Let’s just say....     Jordan    Lebron    Kareem    Magic     Wilt    Russell    Bird    Duncan    Shaq    Kobe      Let’s say that’s the top 10.... who do you take Out to put Durant in? I can’t take anyone out. He’s definitely not cracking the top 5. You ain’t taking out a Magic Johnson to put Durant in the top 5."
"In his book, Celtics fan Bill Simmons had Magic 4th best ever, one ahead of Bird.    I can't remember what he wrote, but Magic could basically play any position.  As a rookie, he started in a finals game at center for the injured Kareem and had a dominanting performance.  Bird was the better rebounder, but not as much as stats suggest.  Point guards are often in the least ideal spots to get rebounds, and the Lakers weren't relying or expecting Magic to be main rebound guy like a Russell Westbrook, instead letting guys like Kurt Rambis be more in charge of that when on the court.    Also though, Bird was probably an even better rebounder than his stats would suggest, as he often played with McHale and Parish pulling down a significant amount of the rebounds."
When it matters Lebron plays defense. Against the Spurs Walton put him on Aldridge on a key possession in the 4th and Lebron didn't even let Aldridge get the ball. And then the other night against the Nuggets Walton put Lebron on Jokic who had a bunch of turnovers and missed layups against Lebron.  And Lebron and Kawhi are the only superstars who run back on defense at least sometimes. Anthony Davis NEVER does. Kevin Durant NEVER does. Steph Curry NEVER does. Kyrie Irving NEVER does. Russell Westbrook NEVER does.
"The reason why there is so much confusion about this is because Russell Westbrook is a better player than those mentioned if the goal is not to win a championship. For example, if the goal is to take a team of defenders/trash offensive players to the playoffs, WB is hands down better than those players mentioned. If the goal is to give a national spotlight to a small market team, sell shoes, and get ratings, WB is much more of a Star than them. So in that sense, he is a better player than Dame or Kyrie. WB doesn’t have what it takes to be the best player on a championship team but neither do Kyrie or Dame, really. The only way those players are better than WB is that they are much more well  suited to be the second best player on a championship team because they are better off ball players and make better decisions."
"LeBron signed for the max he could get, which was 35% of the cap. The term ""supermax"" seems to have different meanings for people, but generally that's what it means: it's the largest max contract anyone can get, starting at 35% of the cap. This is because a ""max"" contract is based on how many years you've been in the league. For players with less than 7 years experience the max starts at 25% of the cap (like what Andrew Wiggins got), for players with 7-9 years of experience the max is 30% (like what Paul George got), and for players with 10 or more years the max is 35% (like what LeBron got).   However, under certain circumstances players can be eligible for the Designated Player Extension (DPE) where they can get a max starting at 35% with less than 10 years experience (like if you win an MVP, DPOY or are an All NBA selection) but only if you're still with the same team you finished your rookie contract with. Players like Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook got those deals.   But no matter how great you are or how many years you've been in the league, you can't get a new contract starting at more than 35% of the cap, which is why it's ""the supermax"". So this summer LeBron signed a 4 year deal worth $154 million because that's what a 4 year deal starting at 35% of the cap was worth (with raises it goes up every year). Next summer Durant could sign a 4 year deal with the Lakers for approximately $161 million, which is 35% of next year's cap (which is supposed to be higher than this year's is). "
Damn.   We have Rachel Nichols stating Russell Westbrook made a bad basketball decision.  Damn.
"I said it once, I'll say it again. Russell Westbrook, the way he is right now, barring any major changes in his playstyle, will never win a championship in this NBA era. "
"I'm not trying to discount those accomplishments, but I think being the leader of the best regular season team ever is just as good if not better as Kobe making the 7th seed. Russell Westbrook did a similar thing when he won MVP, and Harden did a similar thing when Dwight went down.   Good players can carry bad teams to the playoffs, but teams don't just beat the regular season wins record every 5 years or so"
&gt; for whatever reason  His name is Russell Westbrook.
"Well, that’s because he was used pretty badly over at Orlando and at OKC as well.   At Orlando, iirc they put him over at PG for a bit and that’s just not where he’s comfortable.   At OKC, he had to play second fiddle to Russell Westbrook, who of course just racked up all the stats.  (EDIT: Overall, Oladipo just didn’t really have any room to grow and show off the talents he had on the court. Orlando didn’t use him well in general, and OKC wanted the offense to run through Westbrook. Because Oladipo was a player that had a similar play style to that of Westbrook’s, there wasn’t a super big threat on the perimeter to help spread the floor to make room for either of them. I believe that’s why Oladipo and Sabonis were traded for Paul George.)  However, once Oladipo finally got the chance to be the focal point of the offense in Indiana and play the way he knows best, he exceeded all expectations and was pretty consistent all season.   (EDIT: Currently, Oladipo is just a better overall player than Gordon because the Indiana offense relies heavily on Oladipo’s abilities to make plays and score for them. Houston does not do that with Gordon.)"
Imagine thinking Russell Westbrook is a top 5 player still.
&gt; You have Russell Westbrook  He said give him hope
"Remember when Presti was a genius for adding Melo? Then remember how he was a genius for trading Melo?  I just wish, as a basketball fan, that just for once, Presti would decide to be a genius for **surrounding Russell Westbrook with some motherfucking wings who can shoot**. Just guys who can knock down open 3s. Bonus points if they can defend okay and switch on defense. "
"You have Russell Westbrook, Paul George, and Steven Adams. "
"Honestly he has horrible shooting mechanics. Its an incredibly rigid and robotic 90 degree shot-put (almost), with absolutely all the power coming from his triceps and forearms arms. He doesn't use his legs, and releases the ball at the literal peak of his arc (so there is literally no upward force helping you shoot). He holds the ball so far out from his chest and shoulders, that he basically is only using his triceps and forearms to launch NBA three-pointers. Most of it should come from the legs, but Jesus, just observe Westbrook's shooting form closely and try to replicate it next time you're playing basketball. Its ridiculous how inefficient his shot is with regards to utilizing force from your entire body. He almost seems to be over-forcing the 'perfect shooting form'. Look at the difference between Klay and Westbrook's shots. They're almost identical, but the devil is always in the detail. Klay's shot uses his legs perfectly, and releases as his body is moving upwards the fastest. He also keeps the ball much closer to his body, and not outstretched away like Russell, so that he can spread energy used on the shot throughout the upper body muscles.     I know its good to have confidence, but you're arguably the greatest slasher the world has ever seen, and you're launching contested three-pointers well-behind the three-point line, a skill you don't excel in.  He shot 30% from 3, but 53% on two-pointers (Anthony Davis's career average on two-pointers).  Like fuck! So many easy wins lost because Westbrook doesn't strictly utilize his superhuman strengths during end-of-game situations."
"There are many differences between Russell Westbrook and Marcus Smart, my issue is that Westbrook has poor shot discipline. He realizes that draining a 3 in the clutch would be awesome, but he's not self-aware of his limitations from distance and the fact that taking contested 3s in close games is not good for his team."
"Anthony **Banette**             Russell **""Wynaut""** Westbrook            **Magmar** DeRozen             **Lucario** Doncic                 **Regigigas** Jackson                Kevin **Luvdisc**"
"I'm not arguing Westbrook is the best passer in the league, but labelling him as somebody who doesn't pass is flat out wrong. People are unjustly confusing his poor shot selection with selfishness when the stats and eye test show that he is a more than willing passer. Grantland had a great piece called 'Russell, the Creator' a couple seasons ago on Westbrook's ability to create plays for teammates "
Celtics player of the game: Russell Westbrook
"You're right, it's not.  https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/20/15370190/russell-westbrook-fourth-quarter-shooting-thunder-vs-rockets-game-2-playoffs  https://hoopshype.com/2018/04/28/oklahoma-city-thunder-russell-westbrook-utah-jazz-field-goal-attempts-postseason/  Yeah.  A 31% career 3 point shooter -- why, he should shoot 40 or 50 times a game!  Of course, you'd still find a way to blame Donovan when he goes 5-25 from downtown."
"Donovan cannot hold Russell ""Why Not?"" Westbrook accountable, and I'm not sure there's anyone available who can. This is a bad situation."
I know Russell has gone off on Portland a few times simply because of some dumbass fan in the Rose Garden trying to heckle Westbrook.  First half the game he looks completely disengaged about the game but then some fan opens their mouth and Westbrook just goes off on my Blazers :(  
"Donovan played a major part on choking the game away, but let's talk about Russell Westbrook for a second..."
I love when Russell Westbrook shoots the game like a crackhead despite better options being available. 
"Westbrook had Durant, Ibaka, and even Harden for a while and OKC couldn’t win shit. Westbrook then has PG13 for a year, and after this game, it still looks like it isn’t going to work out. What is the common denominator here?? Fucking Westbrook.   Russell needs to turn into a true PG, take fewer shots, and average like 15-18 ppg. Hell, had he done that when Durant was there, OKC would have at least one championship by now. "

"Clearly nobody here actually bothered to read the article this quote came from. PG said this almost a year ago when asked about what it was like to play with WB and about his reputation for being difficult or whatever. This came from [a story Royce Young wrote for ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24960627/the-story-how-russell-westbrook-convinced-paul-george-stay-oklahoma-city) about the year-long courtship of PG after trading for him. This is not something PG said yesterday or something. When he brought up LeBron, he was still on the Cavs."
The context is that [this quote was from early last season when he was asked about what it's like to play with WB.](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24960627/the-story-how-russell-westbrook-convinced-paul-george-stay-oklahoma-city) He said this back when LeBron was with the Cavs. Bleacher Report is just taking this and running wild with it though (as is their nature). 
"This actual quote is from ESPN, [from an article posted today,](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24960627/the-story-how-russell-westbrook-convinced-paul-george-stay-oklahoma-city) but the quote from PG is from nearly a year ago."
"If you read [the actual article](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24960627/the-story-how-russell-westbrook-convinced-paul-george-stay-oklahoma-city) (Bleacher Report is just blogspam), you'll see this quote from PG is actually from early last season, nearly a year ago. He's not defending his decision, he's just talking about what it's like to play with WB."
Ok..... Russell Westbrook has led curry in almost all those stats the last 3 seasons and i dont think hes better either. 
"Lonzo's game has never been one that requires him to be assertive. His game is quite the opposite of that, in fact. He facilitates for his teammates, he always has. That's what he did at UCLA when he had a shockingly low usage rate and only scored 14 ppg. Lonzo is not a typical point guard, and anyone who is waiting for him to morph into like Russell Westbrook or Kyrie Irving are always going to be disappointed.   Lonzo is really more like Draymond Green, in that he's a good defender, and offensively he just helps facilitate everything. He just makes the offense run smoother, makes his teammates play better. Now obviously he's not as good of a defender as Draymond is, but Draymond's also not as good of a shooter or passer as Lonzo is, so it's not like they're identical players or something, just that they're both players that can't really be compared to most typical players because what they contribute is so unusual.  The main way I think Lonzo is similar to Draymond though is that his value to a team will go up the better his teammates are. A lot of players might contribute more on a team if everyone else stinks and they have to do everything (or are allowed to do everything). But nobody thinks if Draymond was on the Hawks or something that he'd demonstrate anywhere near as much value as he does on the Warriors, and I think the same is going to be true for Lonzo. If Lonzo looks better this year, or if the Lakers look better, part of that is because Lonzo has better teammates this year (specifically LeBron). The Lakers were never counting on Lonzo to carry the scoring load, or to run the offense, they're counting on him to lift everyone else up due to his unselfish play, and that's what he's doing. It's what he's always done."
"I would put Chris Paul ahead of Russell any day of the week, even though I'm a big time Westbrook fan. He's an insane player but he isn't that good of a point guard. Cp3 on the other hand is a great point guard and a great player. Not a great teammate tho, in opossition to Russ. "
[Russell Westbrook to Steven Adams is the NBA’s leading assist combo with 222 last season.](https://twitter.com/okcthunder/status/983479082900971520)
"I did read the article, it was great, but it doesn't change my opinion that Russ has/will struggle to fit in a different system.  I thought this part was interesting.  &gt; He wants to win more than anyone on the court, but his desire to win can complicate the outcome. This is the crux of the For Russ/Against Russ debate.  &gt; ""It wasn't always fun,"" one former teammate says. ""The first few years [I played with him], it was. But things got more and more out of control.""  &gt; The Thunder routinely rank at the bottom of the league in any ball movement stat of choice -- passes per game, hockey assists, isolations, etc. Personnel have changed through the years, coaches have changed, but Westbrook is the constant. Some free agents the Thunder pursued in 2013 and 2014, such as Mike Miller and Pau Gasol, questioned what their future would look like in OKC with a ball-dominant player like Westbrook. The team attempted to reform its offense a number of times, each iteration dissolving at some point in the season as the gravity of Westbrook eventually swallowed it.  I think this part plays into the argument that Russ struggles to change. It also shows when you see how awful he is as an off ball player, he doesn't cut or really space the floor.  It just seems like George loved his energy, mindset, and hunger. It's clear that not every player likes to play with him (same with LeBron), but the ones that do really mess with him. If it was another star player they may have left this summer.   &gt; But this time, George is open to finding his role within the Russell Westbrook Experience. At the end of November, after three straight losses have dropped the Thunder's record to 8 -- 12, he urges Westbrook to start playing like Westbrook -- no matter what it means for George's stat line.  &gt; Sure, plenty of Westbrook's teammates, current and former, swear by his competitiveness and passion. ""I think guys like playing in that environment,"" one NBA agent says. ""I have not had anyone that's complained about [Westbrook]. He's a good guy and a good teammate.""  &gt; ""Russ raises the bar,"" another player says, ""but it's not for everyone.""  I think George is similar to westbrook and that really connected them. I think he meshed better, at least personality wise, than durant.  &gt; ""You've got guys in the league that have that -- I would say 'a--hole' in them that people think Russ has,"" George says. ""And that's fine. That's fine to be an a--hole. You should be an a--hole at some point. The difference is, you've got guys that are a--holes that don't care to be your teammate. Russ is going to be there, regardless if he's getting on you, if he's chewing you out. If it's something he feels he needs to address with you, he's going to do it. But he's going to be your teammate at the end of the day. He's going to have your back, he's going to stand his ground and he's going to go to war with you. After, he's going to laugh, he's going to joke -- that's Russ. He's a different type of teammate.""  Royce in the article even said westbroo not isolating himself and trying to be friends with George helped (which he didn't do with durant). "

"Conversely, if you’re a big like Adams then you’d love to play with Russ because he can give you lobs and create offensive rebounding lanes for you.   Or if you’re a shooter like PG then you’d love to play with him because of the open looks he generates. Guys like Klay, Beal and other talented shooters would be perfect fits for Russ. PG already is the perfect fit but there’s an archetype of players that fit with Russ.    Also, it’s ironic because LeBron in Cleveland had star players like KLove and Kyrie sit on the wings and wait for the ball. Essentially, they’d take turns in the offense. Harden also has the same system set for him. He dribbles for about 11 seconds before making a pass or taking a shot. This play style isn’t unique to just Russell Westbrook. "
Kyle Lowry over Russell Westbrook? Imma need you to stop posting 
Is this for that Russell Westbrook/Tim &amp; Eric collab I heard so much about?
and then we have Russell Westbrook. I love the NBA
Reason #105 why I love Russell Westbrook. 
Agreed.  If you don't think that Russell Westbrook shooting 43% from the field is the absolute pinnacle of NBA offense you are definitely a low-testosterone soyboy.
Someday I would like to be as cool as Russell Westbrook.

"Russell Westbrook plays in OKC and he’s a household name. Giannis plays in Milwaukee. Where he plays has nothing to do with it. Look at players on the New Orleans Saints. Brees and Kamara are superstars. I hate the argument that he has to move to get recognition. When he wins mvp, or at the very least finishes top 3 again this year, maybe that’ll put an end to it. "

"&gt;I know what efficiency and TS are dude.  You clearly don't. You were confused earlier when I referred to TS% directly, and you keep saying shit like this:  &gt;DeRozan is better from midrange than PG. PG is better from three, but DeRozan hardly attempts threes.  DeRozan is less efficient than PG, DeRozan is only better from 2. DeRozan is only about as efficient as Russell Westbrook.    &gt;The fact that people on this sub even had him in the discussion for DPOY means he is generally overrated.  The fact that you think he shouldn't have been in the discussion last year tells me you didn't watch him play at all. His impact on the defensive end cannot be overstated, and he's always playing hard. The team defense fell off after Roberson left because Roberson and PG were carrying the defense together and PG's role on defense changed.   Roberson probably should've been getting more attention, but that doesn't mean PG shouldn't have been in the discussion. "
Russell Westbrook with the shooting of Steph Curry. 
"I agree with many of your points. However, to play the devil's advocate, some people are just not great shooters no matter how much emphasis is on the 3-ball now. Look no further than Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony. Maybe T-Mac becomes a better 3pt shooter if he played today, maybe not. But I could probably see him make one or two extra shots per game simply due to how much freedom the offensive player has and he's one of the best offensive talents the game has seen."
Holy shit he's Russell Westbrook with a jump shot.
Wdym that's just Russell Westbrook in the 4th 
"As visible, the only two exceptions were the 2010 Rose MVP and the 2015 Curry MVP.

"he most certainly IS overrated. it took him joining up with a mvp to make a conference finals. the dude has choked away 4 series on his fucking own (2008 wcsf, 2012 wcsf, 2014 wcsf, and 2015 wcsf) and has allowed the guy he is guarding increase his stats and shooting percentage in 5 playoff series (2008 tony parker, 2009 chancey billups, 2011 derrick fisher, 2014 russell westbrook, 2018 steph curry)"
"Yeah and Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Jimmy Butler, DeMarcus Cousins, John Wall, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, to name a few.   Having said all that, spitting is another kind of low. "
"Pretty good first game to start with lol. Statistically points are, at the end of the day, probably the most important statistic because that's how you win the game. Players who can impact the game a huge amount in other ways (like having 10 rebounds and 14 assists even if they don't score) are of great value, but all stars are ultimately people who can do those things AND score. Especially when defenses tighten up and a game is on the line, ultimately teams need someone who will win them the game. That being said, however, it's more important then ever for players to be multi-faceted. If a player can only score and can't do things like play defense or move the ball, their value drops significantly.  Regarding teams:  * The Spurs: Are technically the underdog in that they historically do not attract big free agents and instead have drafted and developed a majority of their players and consistently overachieved with them. Has the best coach in the NBA currently, Gregg Popovich. Right now the team has a lot of underdogs in the form of stars who are considered good but not good enough to ever win a championship (DeRozan and Aldridge).    * Oklahoma: Has one of the best players (at least statistically) in the league, Russell Westbrook, All Star in Paul George and very good center in Steven Adams. Their coach isn't anything special and that's historiclaly been OKC's problem; their coaching rarely elevates the team. But their GM (who orchestrates trades, drafts players, signs free agents), Sam Presti, is one of the best in the league by making really savvy, smart moves and drafting excellently. Pretty interesting history in that OKC drafted Kevin Durant, who is a Top 2 player, and Kevin Durant ultimately left OKC because he felt he couldn't win a championship. Definitely an underdog in that many people feel a Westbrook-led team with only Paul George is not enough for OKC to win a championship. A lot of other people feel OKC will never win a championship with Westbrook in general.  * Raptors: Probably the biggest underdog because they're always been regarded as incapable of performing in the playoffs. They have improved their regular season performance over the years by a huge amount, yet have continued to struggle to make it to the Finals (TBF though, Lebron beat every team in the East year after year). They just acquired Kawhi Leonard from the Spurs but had to trade DeRozan (a huge fan favorite). A major issue right now is whether Kawhi, whose contract expires on a year, will want to stay on the Raptors, a notoriously unattractive team for major free agents like Kawhi. They also have Kyle Lowry, one of the best point guards in the East. Their coach is Nick Nurse, a rookie head coach who, as an assistant coach last year, revamped the Raptors offense to be faster and more spaced out. Their GM, Masai Ujiri, is one of the best in the league, similar to Sam Presti in that he drafts incredibly well and consistently makes moves to better the roster, even despite being unable to land top free agents. History-wise, the Raptors have always been overlooked and their stars have always left the team for bigger markets or better opportunities to win (Vince Carter, Chris Bosh). They are definitely the biggest underdogs of the batch because, unlike OKC, a team that has made the Finals and been incredibly close to making the Finals numerous times, the Raptors have almost never been considered even close to winning a championship over the past few years. This year might be one of their best shots, however, because they have been looking pretty great with Kawhi as their focal point.  "
"A healthy DRose is probably scarier than Russell Westbrook coming down the lane at full speed. I love Russ's game and think he's a force, but Rose has a little bit more finesse when finishing. Give him a lane and he'll give you two points and maybe a free throw."
"You really don’t understand how stats work  Per 36 doesn’t inflate stats of players who played a lot of minutes lol. It only does that if they don’t play much. It adjusts stats of everyone who plays a lot of minutes EQUALLY.. that’s the point of the stat  Kyrie was almost 10% TS better than Russell Westbrook and easily outscored him by a wide margin when adjusting for the fact he played like 7 less minutes lol  Honestly how can you say that and not realize how dumb of a statement that is? He’s drastically worse in every statistic expect the one that’s entirely based on minutes played and he played 7 more of them  Also how does guard defense matter if like 5 of the top 7 defenses all have terrible guards? It clearly isn’t very impactful  Stats aren’t hard bro... they really aren’t. Don’t use raw stats, people will just shit in you in this sub for doing that cause it’s super 1980s. Like I have never seen someone use total points seriously lmao... that stat is literally just based on who plays more games"
"I feel like the only advanced stat I can think of that doesn't love Westbrook is his TS%  [have a look through this](http://bball-index.com/player/russell-westbrook/), most advanced stats say he's one of the very best in the league which is fair. I'd actually argue he is perceived better overall by advanced stats than he is by the eye test because of how much higher stats seem to rate his defence "
"Russell Westbrook and Oscar Robertson are the only 2 players to shoot worse than DeRozan did while going off for 32 points, 14 assists, and 8 rebounds. "
"Just wow smh.   Russell Westbrook was near the top of both of those stats... he was still really bad scorer last year compared to Kyrie  How you gonna use ppg when I literally already said he was 4th in ppg per 36 min and 100 poss? He played 32 minutes and scored 24 pts a game... that was top 5 in the league  He shot 62% TS which beat guys like Giannis, and destroyed Westbrook  He was a top 5 scorer last year. Don’t use raw stats lol... they don’t mean anything, you really should know that  Lastly, I didn’t just say defense doesn’t matter. I gave you 2 reasons why it doesn’t matter and you didn’t respond to either. How much did defense matter if the fucking Celtics were 1st in the nba lmao? "
"I think Westbrook had the best one, he came as Russell Westbrook as Russell Westbrook."
Jason Kidd was basically the modern Russell Westbrook then though. 
"\&gt;Had they won 80% of those games, they would have won like 60+ per year last years, smartass.  We'll just leave your comment up there in case you delete it for stupidity.  I'm sorry can you explain your math to me just so I can get a peak inside your peanut brain. How did you come to the conclusion that either of the two years Westbrook averaged a triple double they would have won 60+ games....are you just dividing 60 by 82?  [https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2018/03/12/thunder-have-won-82-percent-of-games-that-westbrook-got-triple-double/](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2018/03/12/thunder-have-won-82-percent-of-games-that-westbrook-got-triple-double/)  \* Thunder is 81-18 in the regular season when Russell Westbrook has a triple-double. \*  I suggest you look up the difference between \*averaging\* a triple double and actually getting a triple double in-game. My mistake I was incorrect it was actually 82% of games, not 80%."
"James Harden is the only player to average 29/11/8 since Oscar (Russ never has). Russell Westbrook is the only player to average 30/10/10 since Oscar.  Hopefully the masses are intelligent enough to realize 29/11/8 and 30/10/10 are both arbitrary cutoffs. Being the only one to have achieved one is not more ""impressive"" than the other."

I love Russell Westbrook.

Anthony Davis or Russell Westbrook
"If Kyle Korver is a Jazzman, is Russell Westbrook a Thunderman?  Or is he a Thunderer?"
The only way I could see that happening is if cloning was real and each team got a Russell Westbrook. 
Especially on Russell Westbrook Day!
Sounds like a very Russell Westbrook thing to do
So his TS % is firmly in “Russell Westbrook range”
"\*Russell Westbrook\* ""Hold my beer."""
Here’s the list of the players with the highest triple doubles   Rank	Player	# Times  1	Oscar Robertson	181  2	Magic Johnson	138  3	Russell Westbrook	107 / Jason Kidd 107  5	Wilt Chamberlain	78  6	LeBron James	74  7	Larry Bird	59  8	Fat Lever	43  9	James Harden	36  10	Bob Cousy	33  11	John Havlicek	31 / Rajon Rondo	31  I’m on mobile so formatting be damned 
"If you shoot 20% on three pointers then you fucking suck at three pointers and should stop taking them, even if they're open/wide open.   Westbrook is a career 31% three point shooter, and hasn't been efficient (33%) since his MVP season, shooting 29% on them last year. At some point, you should just stop shooting. He doesn't have a history of being a good shooter, he's just shooting them based on status. Most threes taken by Russell Westbrook are bad threes."
I thought yesterday was Russell Westbrook day?
Reminds me of the time [Russell Westbrook did that too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8d8rjyEnDE)
Today is Russell Westbrook day make your posts hating or loving him now 
"I think the modern comparison would be Tim Duncan.  If you can anchor a top team defense, the result is what 5 titles,  vs Westbrook and harden who maybe more influential scorers who can’t even get title.  That’s the argument for Russell,  he was the best player and anchored an elite defense( the most important part in winning a championship) to the tally of 11 titles.     That his impact and body of work, overrides a scorer who has done less winning "
The warriors are sub .500 without steph.  Russell westbrook led the thunder to a a better %  without the luxury of another all star. Not a great excuse for a player of kds caliber
Like box score or what stats are you pointing at? In that case russell westbrook is the goat. 
"The top 8 has been the same as people reckoned it was a year ago.  Lebron James is the best player in the world.   Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are #2 and #3, order undefined.  Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook are #4 through 8 in undefined order.  So asking if any of those last 5 players are in the ""top 5"" overall is a tricky question, every one of them over the past year has been at a point where most people would put them in the top 5.   Right now, I would guess for most people it looks something like: Lebron, Curry, KD, then 2 of Kawhi, Giannis, and Davis, with Harden and Westbrook at #7 and #8 right now."
Russell Westbrook stopped a hot KD many many times in the 4th
Jerami Grant is our second best 3pt shooter at .361% (Deonte Burton is 0.364%  Russell Westbrook is our second worst 3pt shooter at 0.196% (ahead of Raymond felton at 0.154%)   I know Russ can be inefficient but 19% from 3 is horrendous

You’re saying that as a bulls fan? Are you kidding? I would kinda get it as a twolves fan but definitely not with the bulls. That year he’s had the 3rd most possessions in the clutch with 1 minute left in the game and he is the 2nd leading scorer in the clutch behind only Russell Westbrook the MVP of that season....
Russell Westbrook and the Washington wizards 
"Are we debating on who is simply better at basketball? Because guys from today are always gonna win that, no point in even debating it. But the fact of the matter is that Cousy was unquestionably the best at his position when he played. He won championship after championship. Former players all say this, coaches who watched him, and long time fans say how good he was.   You want to put Russell Westbrook into 1960s ball? It’s literally a turnover every time he dribbles, he’s going to get called for carrying ASAP. You have to judge these guys based on how dominant they were compared to their competition. Westbrook has frequently had his teams come up short and he’s usually instrumental in that. Cousy has a good team around him, of course. But don’t forget Westbrook played with the best scorer ever and has had MVP level pieces around him his entire career. "
This is Russell Westbrook levels of inefficiency 
"&gt; Bob Cousy was playing 60 years before you were born  How come whenever I use this argument against Bill Russell, or any number of athletes in other sports, I get disregarded?  Also how am I acting like a basketball encyclopedia?  Am I only allowed to rank players that I watching during my life time?  If that's the case, take Cousy out and put in STEVE FUCKING NASH (can't believe I forgot him) because I definitely watched him in his prime.  Me including Cousy above Westbrook is the opposite of me being an encyclopedia, I'm taking the word of people before who say he's an all time great. "
"Paul was comfy. But no one was comfier than Russell ""Rock the Baby"" Westbrook in the 4th "

"&gt; despite numerous huge names being available this summer the lakers only managed to get lebron  Other than Paul George, who are you referring to? What ""huge names""? And PG didn't even make it to free agency, he agreed to return to the Thunder before even giving another team a chance to meet with him, supposedly because he loves Westbrook so much (but more likely because his agent, Aaron Mintz, has a feud going with Lakers' GM Rob Pelinka, because Pelinka traded Mintz client D'Angelo Russell in a salary dump).   &gt; there are already credible reports that kd/kawhi/butler/kyrie will never go there.  There are? I've seen people speculating or guessing on where they think those guys might go but I've yet to see any actual reporting on it. Asking someone like Jalen Rose or Rachel Nichols what they *think* a player will do a year from now can be fun and entertaining, but they're usually pretty clear to say ""I'm not reporting anything here, I don't have any inside knowledge, this is just my guess"" before saying anything. If you have links to reports of these guys having made up their minds, by all means, post the links.  Sorry man, I get that you hate the Lakers and this is probably a rough time for you, what with them having signed LeBron and having the max cap space needed to get KD next summer, all without having to trade any of their young assets.

"[Brian Windhorst just wrote an article today which 100% answers your question.](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25384727/lebron-james-takes-control-lakers) Here's the pertinent part:  &gt; When James came to the Lakers, he relished the idea of being able to play off the ball more, to use his post-up skills and to generally expend less energy. That was the idea behind signing Rondo, and Lance Stephenson ... it would ease the need for James to do as much creating.  &gt; But as those who have been around James over the years will tell you, there is the July version of James when he's sitting on a couch with a glass of wine and talking basketball philosophy. And there's the midseason version of James who wants to win above all else and trusts himself above all others to make it happen. As is typical, the latter has been showing itself as the games pile up.  &gt; When Rondo has been active and he and Ball have split point guard duties, some of that has happened. When playing alongside Rondo, James had been averaging less time of possession in games than players such as Zach LaVine and Jamal Murray. When Rondo has been out, James' ballhandling time is up there with John Wall, Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul. Basically, where he has been for years."

"How much better does Booker have to shoot before people finally start to consider him ""efficient""?  He was at a TS% of 56.1 last year and is at a 56.2% this year.  For reference to other guards who have to carry a similar offensive load, there's...  * Russell Westbrook:  Career 53.2% TS, best season was 55.4% TS * Donovan Mitchell: 54.1% TS last year, 51.1% TS this year * Demar Derozan: Career 53.6% TS, best season was 55.5% TS (last year) * Kobe Bryant: Career 55% TS, best season was 58% TS and only 4 of his 20 seasons were 56% or higher * Tim Hardaway Jr.: Career 54.5% TS, best season is 56.8% TS (honestly surprised me) * Bradley Beal: Career 55% TS, best season is 60.4% TS  Also, Booker is currently leading all SG's in PPG at this point with 24.9 PPG this season.  I'm not going to pretend that he plays defense, but when will this narrative that he's just an inefficient chucker stop?"

"For pts/rebounds/turnovers, Russell Westbrook leads the way with 5 games, Harden has 2 of those.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=game&amp;year_min=1984&amp;year_max=2019&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=10&amp;c2stat=trb&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=10&amp;c3stat=tov&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=10&amp;order_by=player"
"I agree that sometimes too much focus is put on 3 pt %, mainly due to the state today's game, but Westbrook might be the [worst high volume 3-point shooter ever.](https://fadeawayworld.net/2018/11/26/russell-westbrook-is-one-of-the-worst-3-point-shooters-in-nba-history/) Incredible player, whose defense has also improved immensely over the years, but poor shooting matters if you want to be considered the best PG in the league."
"Russell Westbrook has been so close to getting the quintupple-double of terror: 10+ points, assists, boards, turnovers and missed threes.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201701130MIN.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201701130MIN.html)  21 pts, 12 assists, 11 boards, 10 turnovers, 1-10 from behind the arc. Unfortunately his TOs have gone down the last two years so I doubt we'll see it."
"he’s extremely overrated and when adjusted for absurd pace his stats aren’t all that impressive  He spent half of his career in the weakest era in nba history and the only team success he had was with Kareem on his team. Someone like Kobe is streets ahead of him and should be far higher in all time rankings  “Scoring prime of curry and passing ability of Nash”  Fucking lmao, go adjust Curry’s scoring and Nash’s passing to that era and they fucking blow his stats out of the water  Edit: don’t mean to be harsh he is a legend of the game, but for example if you took harden or Westbrook’s production and adjusted it to that pace it isn’t even a comparison  &gt; Here’s what Westbrook’s pace-adjusted 2016-17 stat line looks like: 38.4 points, 13.2 rebounds and 13.0 assists per game. &gt; Oscar averaged 44.3 minutes per game in 1961-62. Westbrook is logging just 34.7 minutes a night this season. That’s nearly 10 minutes less per game. What happens if we add an extra 9.6 minutes per game (a factor of 1.277) to Russell’s current production? &gt; 49.1 points, 16.9 rebounds and 16.6 assists per game.  http://www.basketballinsiders.com/russell-westbrooks-remarkable-adjusted-statistics/"
Noel is the biggest Block-Chaser in the league. Now he’s getting taught by the Russell Westbrook school of stat padding. That’s a bad mix
"Most years in the 2000s, the east didn't feature a single team that would have been a top 4 seed in the west. It was *bad*. Making the finals in the east was about as impressive as making the 2nd round in the west. Take the Carmelo Anthony Nuggets or the Pau Gasol Grizzlies and move them to the east, and either would have had multiple finals appearances.   The single win in the finals was a tremendous performance, but how much can we draw from any one game? By the way, in game 2, Iverson came back and scored 23 on 10 for **29** shooting yet the 6ers only lost by 9. Do we also *blame* Iverson for that loss? How did the 6ers stay in that game?  Truth is Iverson's the 6ers were a well put together team. Combine a medium efficiency, high volume scorer who is subpar defensively with a bunch of premiere defenders, and you have complementary strengths. Iverson was incredible at volume scoring with no need for help. The rest of the 6ers were incredible defensively and couldn't offer much offensively. Take Iverson off the team, and the 6ers get a ton worse because the 6ers were designed to be dependent on his volume scoring. However, put Iverson on a team with good offensive firepower, and his impact is gonna drop dramatically, so a lot of how impactful he was for the 6ers was a consequence of having the right teammates.  And you have to understand, I'm not saying Iverson was bad. I'm more saying he was like Damian Lillard or Russell Westbrook are today. Great players but not at the level of players like Lebron, Curry or Durant."
"Russell Westbrook plays as if he’s the only player on his team.  Had a 40 year old coach in church league. Whenever we’d be down by 10+ he’d rip off his warm up jacket and put himself in the game, and miss 4 or 5 threes in a row in an attempt to get us back in the game.  That’s Russell."
No one with 45 wins and who has finished 7th place.  In 81-82 Moses Malone won with 46 wins but they were tied for 4th place but lost the tie breaker and finished 6th when only 6 teams made the playoffs. He also lead the league in rebounds and was 2nd in scoring. In 2016-17 Russell Westbrook won 47 but averaged a 30 point triple double and had only the second season long triple double.  That was twice in 25 years and they were the lowest in modern history and. Both were major outliers and better finished than Kobe’s team.  Players on mediocre teams don’t win MVP’s. it’s not a travesty. 
"My favorite part of this podcast was how Royce Young said Russell Westbrook took so long to address the media after that loss to the Nuggets that he knew for a fact the Nuggets entire team had showered and dressed, left the arena, gone to the airport and flown to their next location and were on their descent with the landing gear down before Westbrook *finally* agreed to address the media after his woeful performance that night. What a diva lol"
The Russell Westbrook approach 
"LOL if anything this is revisionist history.   You are totally ignoring his play that season and especially the series before against the Spurs where he dominated off the bench. I don't particularly like Harden but he was really good up until the Finals where he went MIA.  &gt; While it would have been great to keep Harden, it wasn't a money thing.   It was totally a money thing. Clay was considered cheap until he was given so much shit for his $5m difference. He finally overpaid Kanter. That Thunder team didn't necessarily need Harden but they legit never went after a good 3&amp;D player on the market which was basically their only hole. Anyway back to the money thing...look at any article after that trade.  [Exhibit A](https://newsok.com/article/3774653/oklahoma-city-thunder-what-if-james-harden-had-signed)  &gt;The luxury tax fluctuates, depending on league revenues, but let’s estimate it at $72 million in 2013-14. It would be in that range. The Thunder’s luxury tax for that season would be $12.75 million. That’s not chump change. Clay Bennett and the ownership group would not like such a payout. But the Thunder could live with it. It’s been a profitable franchise in OKC. Sure, the Thunder could knock off a bunch of that luxury tax by cutting Kendrick Perkins and claiming the amnesty waiver, but someone has to play center when the Lakers and Jazz and other traditional-lineup teams line up. So the savings wouldn’t be a clean $8 million (Perkins salary, minus the minimum).  [Exhibit B](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-oklahoma-city-thunder-traded-james-harden-2012-10)  &gt; If OKC re-signed Harden to a max extension, it be paying Harden, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, and Kendrick Perkins over $70 million alone in 2014-15. And would been paying the tax until at least 2016.  [Exhibit C](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/sports/basketball/oklahoma-citys-trade-of-james-harden-validates-david-sterns-design.html)  &gt; A system that forces a small-market wonder to give up a star player — to a team in a much larger market, no less — seems cruel and counterproductive. It looks even worse coming just two months after the Lakers created one of the greatest quartets ever, adding Howard to a lineup featuring Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash and Pau Gasol. "
Sounds exactly like Russell Westbrook so I can see why he’s disrespected now

"It seems like his teammates and Donovan are ok with Westbrook relentlessly getting boards. Whether that’s what’s best for the team is subjective to us fans. I’m gonna honestly disagree with you when you say “that’s not winning basketball.” I think that’s a stretch because it seems like you’re saying that the team could reach another level of play if Russell doesn’t put himself in the pack for grabbing rebounds? No way am I trying to sound like a typical r/nba dick lol, that’s just how I’m interpreting what you’re implying.   A fast paced Thunder team ala Showtime LA would be cool if quick outlets to Russ in the open court were increased.   Lazy D and taking plays off, I have no argument against. He does it lol. "

There are a few guys in the NBA who can read passes well but aren't seen as defensive stalwarts. Russell Westbrook is a good example.
"the washington wizards, trae young, russell westbrook, "
"23 year old KD had Russell Westbrook and James Harden on his team...  leading that team to the finals is a lot different than Giannis trying to lead last years team with Jason Kidd coaching (and then when he got fired, Jason Kidd’s replacement) and Khris Middleton (underrated but not near Russ or Harden level) as his second best player.  Comparing them in that regard is at best a really iffy argument.  Who’s to say Giannis couldn’t win an MVP in the next two seasons?  Dude is averaging 27.2/13/5.7 1.4 Steals, 1.2 Blocks on 57.7% shooting...  "

"Full credit to /u/Mind_Fcuk     ""The anti-Kyrie as a MVP candidate arguments are almost comical in there level of hate. I'm not suggesting that Kyrie should be MVP - nobody is - but he's unquestionably a legitimate top 5 candidate. The main thing the anti-Kyrie as a MVP candidate crowd seem to forget is this: THE BOSTON CELTICS LOST ALL-STAR F GORDON HAYWARD LESS THAN 6 MINUTES INTO THE SEASON. Coming into the season, the Celtics were projected to finish #1 or #2 in the East (#4 or #5 overall). Again, that was WITH ALL-STAR F GORDON HAYWARD. Once Hayward went down, most predicted that the Celtics would be lucky to finish .500. In light of that, consider that the Celtics are currently:  First place in the East, and #2 overall, despite playing an insanely front-loaded schedule that has seen them play as many as 5 more games than other teams over the same period of time (and, remember, they played the very first game of the 2017-2018 season).  On pace to win 63 games, which would be tied for the 4th most in franchise history.  Owners of the longest win-streak in the NBA this season, 16 games, which is tied for the 9th longest in NBA history.  Owners of wins over the other top six teams in the NBA: the Warriors (#1); the Raptors (#3), the Rockets (#4), the Spurs (#5), the Cavs (#6), and the Timberwolves (#7).  How many other teams could lose their second best player - many even consider Hayward the Celtics' best player (which would bolster Kyrie's MVP case even more!) - and actually exceed preseason expectations that were already elite to begin with? (Maybe the Warriors, who would still be the favorites to win the NBA Championship even if either KD or Steph were lost for the season.)  Further bolstering the case for Kyrie as a MVP candidate is the fact that, rather than being the defensive liability that everyone said he'd be, he's actually playing, arguably, the best defense of his career. In fact, he's helped Boston become the top rated defense - both in terms of DRtg and in Points Allowed. Again, this matters because, coming into this season, many - especially here on /r/nba - argued confidently that Kyrie was ""the worst defender in the NBA"" (and, even if he wasn't the worst, he was second or third to only to IT and Dame). Importantly, the Celtics have a DRtg of 101.3 when Kyrie is on the floor, which - not only ranks ahead of their DRtg with Horford on the floor (101.8) - but would also still rank #1 in the NBA. It should also be noted that Kyrie has consistently been at his best defensively during ""crunch time,"" making key deflections, steals, and blocks (yes, even blocks!).  Kyrie's value becomes most apparent once you consider that Hayward's value was primarily supposed to be on the offensive end (Hayward has been an average defender, at best, throughout his career). A big reason why Hayward was recruited so heavily to Boston was because they needed a second player who could create offense to pair with IT. His loss becomes clear when you look at the Celtics ORtg when Kyrie is off the court: 98.7, which would rank dead last in the entire NBA by almost 5 points per 100 possessions! (Russell Westbrook is the only other viable MVP candidate whose team has an offense that bad when he is off the court). Compare that to the Celtics' ORtg when Kyrie is on the court (108.1) or their overall ORtg on the season (107.2) and Kyrie's value becomes unambiguous. Without Kyrie, even with the improvement on defense, they'd be that .500 team that everyone said they'd be lucky to be at this point. Even if you prefer the ""eye test,"" it is inarguable that Kyrie is the only Celtic player that can consistently and reliably create his own shot or create a high quality shot for others.  Finally, Kyrie is leading one of the youngest and least experienced teams in the entire NBA. And that doesn't even account for the significant roster turnover they experienced this summer. Boston wasn't coming into this season as some All-Star laden well-oiled machine full of grizzled veterans that had experience playoff success together; Boston is a team relying heavily on (7) rookies (Tatum, Ojeleye, Theis, Nader, Yabusele - as well as Bird and Allen, who are rookies on two-way contracts), a second year player who came off the bench as a rookie (Brown), young career role players (Smart, Rozier, and Larkin), and players with minimal to no playoff experience (Morris has played in 4 career playoff games; Baynes has averaged 8mpg in 26 playoff games).  Should Brad Stevens get some credit for Boston's success? Absolutely! He should be the frontrunner for COY. But let's not forget that his career record without IT/Horford/Kyrie is 65-99 (.396), it's 113-133 (.459) without Horford/Kyrie, and it's 166-162 without Kyrie (.506). In fact, Stevens has never won more than 53 games in a season as a NBA head coach (last season), a feat he will exceed if the Celtics win just over half (.512) of their remaining games (Stevens career W% is .536). Again, Brad Stevens should be the 2018 COY, but everyone pretending as if he turns role players into playoff teams is exaggerating his coaching genius just a tad.  Again, I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT KYRIE IRVING SHOULD OR WILL WIN THE 2018 MAURICE PODOLOFF TROPHY FOR NBA MVP. What I am arguing - and I'm confident persuasively - is that Kyrie Irving has been a legitimate top 5 MVP candidate so far this season.  hungry+humble""      "
"Man the league is missing a golden opportunity. Picture this, Eastern Conference Captain Lebron James is down to the final two picks, there's only one choice left for Lebron.... Kyrie Irving, or KD the man who's suppose to take over for him as ""top player"". BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE,  Lebron swallows his pride and picks Kyrie Irving. Camera zooms in on KD's face.. knowing he's last pick in the draft and the man who has to pick him... THE BOII RUSSELL WESTBROOK  fade to black"
"No worries.  This sub is like cancer.   OKC is going no where fast with Russell Westbrook, regardless of how talented he is. "
"Imagine Team Lebron vs. Team Curry, the narrative potential is through the roof  Team Curry  *Steph Curry*  *Kyrie Irving*  *Kevin Durant*  *Draymond Green*  *Anthony Davis*  vs.   Team Lebron  *Russell Westbrook*  *Paul George*  *Lebron James*  *Kristaps Porzingis*  *Demarcus Cousins*     "
"I'm probably one of the biggest Wiggins believers on this sub but this isn't a fair comparison. Harden was in his second year, came off the bench, played only 26 minutes a game, and had to share the ball with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook."
Except if you are Russell Westbrook. Then you dribble dribble dribble and then put up a brick 
"Huh? You're telling me a normal Russell Westbrook performance is him shooting 65% from the field and only turning it over twice? He's a beast of a player but he isn't that good (no one is)  I literally said earlier that I don't agree with the premise of the post bruh, relax "

"To piggyback on this, just about everyone the Thunder traded has far exceeded expectations. This doesn't speak too well for Russell Westbrook if you ask me, especially as the current Thunder has far under performed expectations."
Do folks here even watch Westbrook play? The sheer amount of explosive energy he puts into every second of every fucking play? Wtf is wrong with people. Russell Westbrook is the best player on the court in any matchup that isn’t against the Cavs or the Warriors or MAYBE (and that’s a big maybe) the Rockets
"You're right. Since 1978, only 5 MVP winners have been on teams with records that were worse than 55+ wins.  Moses Malone '79 - Rockets won 47  Moses Malone '82 - Rockets won 46  Michael Jordan '88 - Bulls won 50  Steve Nash '06 - Suns won 54  Russell Westbrook '17 - Thunder won 47  53 wins would be a historically low team performance for an MVP winner."
"Yes but that doesn’t mean they’d do it again. The west is so strong this year, w/o KD and with steph consistently being hurt they don’t win. If you take mvp Russell Westbrook with Kevin Durant the warriors lose. And they never beat a healthy cavs team so add pg13 to them Cleveland wins in 5 MAYBE 6. "

"It's not just a buzz phrase, it's a good way to understand this phenomenon. There's a concise explanation of it [here](http://wmbriggs.com/post/63/). Bottom line, athletes and teams get a lot more attention from the media when they've recently been performing exceptionally well or exceptionally poorly relative to their expectations (The Thunder have a Russell Westbrook problem). After the articles are written, the performance of these athletes and teams will tend to revert back to a level that is less exceptional but also closer to their ""average""."

"If LeBron didn't put those numbers up and simply chose to take a conservative, safe, or ""more efficient"" approach on offense, the Cavs might've gotten swept. LeBron fueled the Cavs in ways that are simply immeasurable by stats. Russell Westbrook and James Harden were arguably in a better position than LeBron. And I'm sure losing Kyrie was not easy for the Cavs especially since it was on the biggest stage. David Blatt had to experiment with new lineups at the worst time.   I believe his assists numbers were then his Finals high, which is why I used the (!). I'm amazed by his performance because, as you said, he managed to log 45 minutes a game and still kept the Cavs in it, while also carrying a massive offensive load."

"the top 5 point guards of all time are (in no particular order) magic johnson, chris paul, stephen curry, steve nash, and russell westbrook  most people generally agree that this is the best era for point guards in basketball and most people generally agree that basketball players are better now than they were in previous eras. but few are comfortable with applying that to their all time rankings  i don’t want to hear your “best vs greatest” nonsense!"
"That take could power China for 30 millennia, or Russell Westbrook for 9 minutes"
They are 5th best record right now without their best player because of the way they move the ball. They beat the Miami Heat with the way they moved the ball. When you don't have an immense scoring threat as your main ball handler you move the ball. Should Ricky Rubio be pounding the ball like Lebron? Russell Westbrook can get to the hole at will but they have a worse record(with a better roster) than the Spurs missing their best player. 
"Well, this post is totally wrong about Randle. But I don't blame you. You say what a lot of people say. It is just you are all wrong. He does not have a low bball IQ. Frankly, he understands the game VERY well.   Randle does not have a bball iq problem - his problem is he just tries too do too much. Very similar to Russell Westbrook in this respect. The difference is that Russ has a better skill set. So when Randle tries to get fancy and loses the ball, it looks ""stupid"" but I am sure it has been working out for him in practice. Also similar to Russ in that people want him to be what they want him to be. People thought Russ was shit before realizing how good he actually was. They wanted him to be the side kick - he thought he was the best player in the world. He has proven so many people wrong.   Additionally, your example of Randle not passing to Lonzo is dead wrong. Fuck the announcers as well. They dont like Randle. Anyway, Randle drives and side steps the defender and gets exactly where he wants to be: at the rim! He just misses the layup. That is all! He just didn't finish.  But it is a great move. He should not pass to Lonzo ""Lemme throw up this brick real quick"" Ball in that situation. He knows he has a much better chance of making the layup than Lonzo does of hitting a jumper. It is the correct shot.   You fail to discuss how for a stretch there, Randle either scored or assisted on 10-12 Lakers points in a row. When Brook made back to back threes? Randle assists. Randle even gets the board, starts the break, eyes Brook, sets a screen for him while dribbling to create space as he passes to Brook, continues his spacing to allow Brook to shoot. He recognizes the hot man and makes sure to get it to him.   I need yall to start watching Randle's movement. He knows how to pick and roll and pick and fade very well now. He floats to spots like someone who knows what he is doing.   There were absolutely no low IQ plays by Randle. Just a guy trying to do too much sometimes and nothing else. FUck this ""low IQ"" bullshit. It is insulting. Especially when Kuz came in and set a pick then made a good pass and Stu was like ""Such a high IQ play!!"" when Randle was doing that shit all night.   Randle is one of the best Lakers right now. He works harder than anyone else on the court, he gets physical, he moves very well without the ball while people like Kuz usually stand still or just try and get open, he plays good defense, he takes initiative on the break, he is scared of no one, and he can put the ball in the hoop.   The Randle slander has to fucking stop. This is a good, smart player on the verge of breaking out.  "

"Ok let’s put it this way, hes rostered as a 2, he lines up as a 2, he’s smaller than Wiggins, and he handles the ball more than Wiggins. All of those are traits of SG v SF  Going through our schedule so far the only time butler has guarded a bigger player than Wiggins is against the 6ers he took Simmons, against the Bucks he took Giannis, and against the Cavs he took LeBron.  For the other 39 games Wiggins has guarded the opposing sf while jimmy has guarded the opposing SG or Russell Westbrook."

PG: Steph Curry/Russell Westbrook  SG: James Harden/Klay Thompson  SF: Durant  PF: Serge Ibaka  C: Draymond Green  Everyone can shoot, everyone can move the ball, and everyone can play defence well (at least, when they're motivated).  If you don't like Ibaka in there (due to his ball movement not being at the same level as the rest, despite the great defense and ability to shoot the three), then move Durant up to PF, rotate Westbrook/Harden/Thompson through the SG and SF roles, and you've got yourself a remake of the Death Lineup.  ----  Or the all-Harden team for that matter.  PG: CP3/Westbrook  SG: Harden  SF: Durant  PF: Ibaka  C: Dwight Howard  ----  Ooo, Jimmy Buckets is an interesting one too, with what his team could become in a couple years as Wiggins and KAT grow.

There is a reason no team has done this to roberson. If the center is sagging back roberson will just set an screen for Paul George or Russell Westbrook. If they switch that center will get torched on the perimiter. If the center doesnt step up on the screen PG and Westbrook will have open shots all game. That only worked with the tony allen because the grizzlies attacked in the low post and only had 1 good shot creator. The thunder will just keep screening until they have a big man on russell or PG.

"Yes. It’s a lot easier to show off your speed on hardwood floors without pads on. You have a guy like Calvin Johnson who was 6’5 and ran a 4.3 40 with a 42.5 inch vertical. To put that in perspective James Harden only had a 37 inch vertical at the same height. That’s only one player. It’s a lot easier to be lean and quick then it is to get bulky explosive and quick. Many NFL players are freight trains. Russell Westbrook is 6’3 with a 36.5 inch vertical Julio Jones is the same height yet he has a 38.5 inch vertical.   Don’t even get me started on Tyreek Hill or Derrick Henry.    I’ll add another, Odell Beckham Jr. 5’11 with a 38.5 inch vertical while weighing 200lbs. "

"I think the idea is that you want to find the best offensive pg that plays no defense, which would be Russell Westbrook, even though Steph Curry is better offensively and defensively.  KD and LeBron are the best offensive SFs, but they play good defense, so the best offensive SFs that doesnt play good defense would probably be Wiggins.  Same thing for no offense. Obviously they can't buy a bucket because they are no offense, however, they are good defenders.  Also I think that the idea is that you want to beat the Warriors, so you dont want to pick a Warriors player"
That's Russell Westbrook for you
You should have put in Russell Westbrook or James Harden at the guard position. This team doesn't have a superstar or enough offensive depth to get past the Warriors.
"Malone was mr. consistent. A physical specimen and a scoring/rebounding machine. vicious dunker, great midrange game(Turn around jumper was water from 15 feet) and at times, dirty as hell.   With that said, Barkley was way more exciting on/off the court. He was  the russell westbrook, in terms of playing mad, of his time. I can't find the video, but the ball was on the floor in the paint and all the post players of both teams were scrambling on the floor tryna get it back. Barkley was also in the scrum, gets the ball and tries to lay it up and misses. He rebounds his own miss amongst the 7footers, gathers and bangs on ALL OF THEM.  edit: PPL forget he is roughly westbrooks height https://youtu.be/RKXlG_f1Cw0  Just pure hustle, irrational anger and persistence. That was barkley.  Can't go wrong with either tbh"

He doesn't pass, he doesn't rebound, he doesn't defend, and none of those things have changed from his first year in the league.  And above all of that he's an awful scorer. THe only thing he's supposed to be good at, and somehow he has a **50% TS THIS YEAR**.  For reference league average last year was 55%, and ""chuckers"" like Russell Westbrook shot 55% last year while averaging 30 points.  50% is fucking awful, especially when you consider he does nothing else well.

"Russell ""Shammgod"" Westbrook"
"The anti-Kyrie as a MVP candidate arguments are almost comical in there level of hate. I'm not suggesting that Kyrie should be MVP - nobody is - but he's unquestionably a legitimate top 5 candidate. The main thing the anti-Kyrie as a MVP candidate crowd seem to forget is this: THE BOSTON CELTICS LOST ALL-STAR F GORDON HAYWARD LESS THAN 6 MINUTES INTO THE SEASON. Coming into the season, the Celtics were projected to finish #1 or #2 in the East (#4 or #5 overall). Again, that was WITH ALL-STAR F GORDON HAYWARD. Once Hayward went down, most predicted that the Celtics would be lucky to finish .500. In light of that, consider that the Celtics are currently:  * First place in the East, and #2 overall, despite playing an insanely front-loaded schedule that has seen them play as many as 5 more games than other teams over the same period of time (and, remember, they played the very first game of the 2017-2018 season).  * On pace to win 63 games, which would be tied for the 4th most in franchise history.  * Owners of the longest win-streak in the NBA this season, 16 games, which is tied for the 9th longest in NBA history.  * Owners of wins over the other top six teams in the NBA: the Warriors (#1); the Raptors (#3), the Rockets (#4), the Spurs (#5), the Cavs (#6), and the Timberwolves (#7).  How many other teams could lose their second best player - many even consider Hayward the Celtics' best player (which would bolster Kyrie's MVP case even more!) - and actually exceed preseason expectations that were already elite to begin with? (Maybe the Warriors, who would still be the favorites to win the NBA Championship even if either KD or Steph were lost for the season.)  Further bolstering the case for Kyrie as a MVP candidate is the fact that, rather than being the defensive liability that everyone said he'd be, he's actually playing, arguably, the best defense of his career. In fact, he's helped Boston become the top rated defense - both in terms of DRtg and in Points Allowed. Again, this matters because, coming into this season, many - especially here on /r/nba - argued confidently that Kyrie was ""the worst defender in the NBA"" (and, even if he wasn't the worst, he was second or third to only to IT and Dame). Importantly, the Celtics have a DRtg of 101.3 when Kyrie is on the floor, which - not only ranks ahead of their DRtg with Horford on the floor (101.8) - but would also still rank #1 in the NBA. It should also be noted that Kyrie has consistently been at his best defensively during ""crunch time,"" making key deflections, steals, and blocks (yes, even blocks!).  Kyrie's value becomes most apparent once you consider that Hayward's value was primarily supposed to be on the offensive end (Hayward has been an average defender, at best, throughout his career). A big reason why Hayward was recruited so heavily to Boston was because they needed a second player who could create offense to pair with IT. His loss becomes clear when you look at the Celtics ORtg when Kyrie is off the court: 98.7, which would rank dead last in the entire NBA by almost 5 points per 100 possessions! (Russell Westbrook is the only other viable MVP candidate whose team has an offense that bad when he is off the court). Compare that to the Celtics' ORtg when Kyrie is on the court (108.1) or their overall ORtg on the season (107.2) and Kyrie's value becomes unambiguous. Without Kyrie, even with the improvement on defense, they'd be that .500 team that everyone said they'd be lucky to be at this point. Even if you prefer the ""eye test,"" it is inarguable that Kyrie is the only Celtic player that can consistently and reliably create his own shot or create a high quality shot for others.  Finally, Kyrie is leading one of the youngest and least experienced teams in the entire NBA. And that doesn't even account for the significant roster turnover they experienced this summer. Boston wasn't coming into this season as some All-Star laden well-oiled machine full of grizzled veterans that had experience playoff success together; Boston is a team relying heavily on (7) rookies (Tatum, Ojeleye, Theis, Nader, Yabusele - as well as Bird and Allen, who are rookies on two-way contracts), a second year player who came off the bench as a rookie (Brown), young career role players (Smart, Rozier, and Larkin), and players with minimal to no playoff experience (Morris has played in 4 career playoff games; Baynes has averaged 8mpg in 26 playoff games).  Should Brad Stevens get some credit for Boston's success? Absolutely! He should be the frontrunner for COY. But let's not forget that his career record without IT/Horford/Kyrie is 65-99 (.396), it's 113-133 (.459) without Horford/Kyrie, and it's 166-162 without Kyrie (.506). In fact, Stevens has never won more than 53 games in a season as a NBA head coach (last season), a feat he will exceed if the Celtics win just over half (.512) of their remaining games (Stevens career W% is .536). Again, Brad Stevens should be the 2018 COY, but everyone pretending as if he turns role players into playoff teams is exaggerating his coaching genius just a tad.  Again, I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT KYRIE IRVING SHOULD OR WILL WIN THE 2018 MAURICE PODOLOFF TROPHY FOR NBA MVP. What I am arguing - and I'm confident persuasively - is that Kyrie Irving has been a legitimate top 5 MVP candidate so far this season.  #hungry+humble  "

"Apparently Carmelo Anthony convinced Russell Westbrook he was picked last by LeBron, which may have had something to do with his dominant performance last night.  After the game a reporter informed Westbrook the names were listed in alphabetical order, and Westbrook immediately yelled at Melo, ""See, I told you man! Alphabetical order, man!""

"Is that a percentage of shots that he _does_ contest at all? In that case I would not be surprised, especially in the more strict definition where they track if the player closes out etc.  What I meant is that _when_ he's on you, it's relatively tough to act, compared to most point guards. NBA.com shows that people shoot 43% when Westbrook is near, and that is good number.   But I meant to distinguish specifically that he's not always around when a better defender would be. His style has good aspects which is reflected in many steals (good thing), deflections, loose balls recovered - he's among league leaders in all of it. And number of steals probably influences his win shares and RPM most. But there's also negative aspect of his approach that he's not the most regularly engaged, so to speak. Still, worth noting that's became typical to many ""superstars"" in regular season. (I guess they contest, but them boys get ""lazy"" in many other ways).  Part of it is surely desire to conserve energy for offense, part is the deathly effectiveness of Russell Westbrook quick break, part is surely desire to ""average triple-double"" and be called better than Curry because of it (and those are connected things, for example because when Westbrook rebounds, the attack can start much faster).  I don't think you should be downvoted, it's a normal point you make, although I think it rather agrees with what I wrote, not disagrees."
Lots of people hate Russell Westbrook.
If you want to check out a bit more of his crazy outfits.  http://www.craveonline.com/style/1224965-russell-westbrook-fashion-hero 
"I think he's ok. His style of defense makes him more likely to get steals, deflections, loose balls recovered, well-contested shots and all these things counted at NBA.com. He's stronger and faster than most point guards. What these numbers say less about is when he's not somewhere but should be.  The number I find telling is that OKC's defensive rating is 97 when Westbrook plays with Roberson, and 108 when Westbrook plays without Roberson. Team average is 103. 103 is good, but kinda every lineup without Roberson is having Cavaliersian def rating. Roberson plays like 92% of his minutes with Westbrook, so there's main reason for your ""defense is better with Russell"" thing. Should be remembered that Roberson is the one doing all the hardest stuff so Westbrook can run around a bit, and act a bit of a wild card. He's doing well at blocking passing lanes and like in everything - seems to be very smart in some ways, even if oblivious in others.  For a ""superstar"" it's relatively good, I think, pretty good. But should be noted that the whole team and his position make it not so demanding as some other players have it."
FG % From the floor  LeBron James is 54.9 James Harden is 44.7 Russell Westbrook is 44.4  From 3 LeBron James is 36.2 James Harden is 39.6 Russell Westbrook is 30.8  FT % LeBron James is 74.5 James Harden is 86.3 Russell Westbrook is 70.8%  Westbrook is the least efficient of the group but he’s no way “pretty damn bad”

"You are literally making shit up.  In your world, only Russell Westbrook can answer questions from reporters, and only Russell Westbrook can be a disparaging A hole about it and not be called an A hole without YOU crying about it.  "
"Top 3 finish? As in, OKC is a top 3 team in the league?   Russ is so unbelievably overrated. Has any player been made better by playing with Russell Westbrook?"
"Followup to video at https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/956739986404945921  [Young] Russell Westbrook asked his thoughts about being picked on LeBron’s team, thought he was the last pick. Informed it was just an alphabetical list, he made sure to correct Melo who was heckling nearby.   "
I want to see more of this Russell Westbrook haha Joking around and having fun. 
One year ago today Russell Westbrook scored his 14000th point. https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5q8gqy/nba_milestones_january_25_2017/   Spooky.

Russell Westbrook is an NBA player he's faster than Usain Bolt wtf
"Just came here to say Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, and Kevin Love all played in the 2008 Final Four. And guess who was the best player on the court?  CHRIS DOUGLAS-ROBERTS"
I wonder what would happen if russell westbrook snorted a huge line of coke 
"When Russell Westbrook is your backup, your team is probably OP as fuck."
Shit remember Eric Maynor (i think) vs Russell Westbrook lol 
He ain’t Russell Westbrook he don’t have huge beef with him. The Kyrie pick was more surprising.
"I like how you ignored the part about Jrue Holiday. Also I mentioned the video because it was an example that you were probably aware of. I never said ""remember that video? it is proof that Lauri is the goat perimeter defender"".  I agree Simmons is a better playmaker, just not by the margin you think he is.   You need to be more careful with your choice of words. What you meant was that Ben Simmons averages more rebounds. As Russell Westbrook shows us, it is very easy to average more rebounds and not be a better rebounder.  Simmons guards opposing ball handlers most of the time, so having more steals is no surprise. He is scoring more, but on more minutes and with an amazing teammate in Embiid. I'm going to need statistics otherwise the rest are all just unsubstantiated assertions. I'm not really sure what ""someone who has only up to go when it comes to shooting"" is suppose to mean since it is very clear that he could be shooting worse than he does. Also not sure why you're trying to undersell shooting when it's of huge value to a player who is 7'0"" and can move as well as he does "
"TNT gets involved with The Craig Sager Memorial award for fashionable boldness. Given to the losing team, where they have to wear outrageous sager-esque suits designed by the winning team or the inside crew for a couple pregame and postgame interviews, sort of like LeBron and Wade's world series uniform bet. Russell Westbrook would probably be unfazed by this, however."
"Robes defence leads to more fastbreak opportunities, which are the best kind of offensive possession. [Roberson and George together force more turnovers than any other two man pairing,](https://stats.nba.com/lineups/four-factors/?GroupQuantity=2&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=1&amp;sort=OPP_TOV_PCT) [64% of which are live ball turnovers](http://global.nba.com/news/one-team-one-stat-russell-westbrook-opts-take-inside-arc/?cid=trafficdriver:nbacom:homepage). So having an elite defender does have a positive effect on offence, just like elite offensive players can improve defence by limiting fastbreak opportunities.  There's also the fact that Roberson plays as a 4 on offence, as other people mentioned, and he's a good cutter with the athleticism to quickly get to the rim and dunk off backdoor cuts. His lack of shooting doesn't hurt as much when you have PG13 and Melo on the wings."
"He's a fierce teammate. He punches at whomever gets in the way of him and his team succeeding, irrespective of direction. But hey man if you have the self-assurance to call someone like Russell Westbrook an ""insecure loser,"" more power to you I guess."
"Here's how the NBA would look  **West (Based on Current Standings)**  Golden State: Lose Steph Curry   Houston: Lose James Harden   San Antonio: Lose Kawhi Leonard  Minnesota: Lose Jimmy Butler  Oklahoma City: Lose Russell Westbrook  New Orleans: Lose Anthony Davis  Portland: Lose Damian Lillard  Denver: Lose Nikola Jokic  LA Clippers: Lose Blake Griffin  Utah: Lose Rudy Gobert (Donovan Mitchell could be soon...)  LA Lakers: Lose Brandon Ingram (tough call...between him, Lonzo, and Kuzma)  Memphis: Lose Marc Gasol (tough call between him and Mike Conley)  Phoenix: Lose Devin Booker  Dallas: Lose Harrison Barnes  Sacramento: Lose Willie Cauley-Stein (tough call, lotta guys getting 20-30 minutes)  **East (Based on current standings)**  Boston: Lose Kyrie Irving (Horford has a case too, honorable mention Hayward)  Toronto: Lose DeMar DeRozan (Lowry honorable mention)  Cleveland: Lose LeBron James  Miami: Lose Hassan Whiteside  Washington: Lose John Wall  Indiana: Lose Victor Oladipo  Philadelphia: Lose Joel Embiid (Honorable Mention: Ben Simmons)  Milwaukee: Lose Giannis Antetokounmpo  Detroit: Lose Andre Drummond  New York: Lose Kristaps Porzingis  Charlotte: Lose Kemba Walker  Chicago: Lose Zach LaVine (tough call between him, Markkanen, and Mirotic)  Brooklyn: Lose D'Angelo Russell  Atlanta: Lose Dennis Schroder   Orlando: Lose Nikola Vucevic (honorable mention: Aaron Gordon)  _____________________________________  Assuming literally everyone else on the team is healthy except the one star (examples: Jabari Parker on the Bucks becomes available to play, Dante Exum on the Jazz, etc.) here's what I think the standings would be.  **WEST**  1. Golden State: Still have KD, Draymond, Klay...plus strong bench  2. San Antonio: Literally the #3 seed right now without Kawhi  3. Houston: CP3 is good enough to keep them decent  4. Oklahoma City: Westbrook is valuable, but PG13 and Melo would provide enough offensive firepower to keep them decent. They've both proven they are capable of leading teams to the playoffs as the primary option(s).  5. Denver: Jokic is valuable but they also get Millsap back in this scenario. Very deep squad  6. LA Clippers: Played quite a bit of this season without Blake Griffin. Beverley, Gallo, and Rivers are healthy in this scenario. Lou Will is nice.  7. Portland: Still have CJ McCollum to score the ball a lot, and Shabazz Napier isn't the worst replacement for Lillard. Pretty deep team  8. Minnesota: Watch the T-Wolves quite a bit, Jimmy Buckets is the reason this team wins. Wiggins and KAT put up stats but Jimmy is the engine that grinds out wins with his 2-way play. Bench is questionable, Thibs rotations would kill Wiggins and KAT in the long run too.  9. Utah: Played without Gobert quite a bit this year, Donovan Mitchell is the truth  10. New Orleans: They are the Kings from a couple years ago without AD. Solomon Hill comes back in this scenario, but AD is a tough piece to lose, they don't have a ton of depth.  11. LA Lakers: Don't have a true star player which helps in this scenario. Lotta solid role players  12. Memphis: They lose Gasol but get Mike Conley back which makes it a near wash  13. Dallas: Bottom of the standings are pretty much the same, they have a bunch of decent backcourt players to give them occasional wins+Dirk.  14. Sacramento: Pretty deep team with no true star. Pretty young tho  15. Phoenix: Devin Booker is a stud, they are bad with him, but without him they might be the worst team in the West  **EAST**  1. Boston: Lose Kyrie get Hayward back. Brad Stevens is a top 3 coach  2. Toronto: Losing DeRozan hurts, but Lowry is a capable scorer and the team is pretty solid this year  3. Miami: Erik Spolestra can make a good team with anybody, they have a lot of solid pieces as well  4. Washington: Losing Wall would hurt a lot, hopefully Porter and Beal step up  5. Indiana: Myles Turner would need to step up in scoring the ball without Oladipo  6. Philadelphia: Joel Embiid already sits out quite a few games. Ben Simmons can carry them to a low seed in this scenario, plus Fultz gets back in this scenario...don't know how good he is after his frozen shoulder issue.  7. Cleveland: Terrible defensively, but maybe they get prime Kevin Love back  8. Chicago: They've been pretty decent since Mirotic got back, and they've played well without LaVine this year. Very solid pieces  9. Milwaukee: Giannis is a top 10 player in this league and losing him hurts, but remember they also get back 20 PPG scorer Jabari Parker in this scenario  10. Detroit: Tobias Harris is capable of keeping this team from the bottom of the standings without Drummond  11. New York Knicks: Beasley goes OFF and shows the world he's a top 2 pick for a reason  12. Brooklyn: Already played most of the year without D-Lo  13. Charlotte: Dwight Howard gets all the post touches he wants finally in this scenario  14. Orlando: Vucevic has missed a lot of the year already. Jonathan Isaac becomes healthy in this scenario among others  15. Atlanta Hawks: Losing Schroder would suck         "
"Honestly, the free throws bother me most. There are ways to work around his inability to shoot, such as putting him in the screening position as an offensive 4. (Which we've been doing more of lately.) It's tough to cheat the free throws, though.  One way you can cheat it, though, is by playing Roberson only early in quarters. If they hack him, they don't realize they're putting a team helmed by Russell Westbrook into the bonus early and often. Come playoffs, I'd try and make sure Roberson was playing from 12:00-6:00 in the 2nd and 4th quarters to game the system."
You trade them for PG to convince Russell Westbrook to stay. You know how bad it would look if KD and Westbrook had left?

KD and Westbrook throwing lobs again. Kyrie and LeBron running PNR. Klay Thompson and Steph going back and forth jacking up threes against each other. Anthony Davis and Greek in PNR."
"Pasting the article here since it's behind paywall. My bad, guys.    The NBA will not televise the NBA All-Star draft. Initially, that decision makes you wonder why even have it at all. The whole point is the drama of picking and choosing, the politics and the pettiness. That’s the riveting part, not the East and West being mixed.  But the more I think about it, the more I come to see why the NBA is passing on the playground-style draft. Because it could go like this:  Commissioner Adam Silver: LeBron James, you have the first pick. Stephen Curry, you pick second.  LeBron: Gimmie KD.  Kevin Durant: That’s right. No. 1!  LeBron: You were supposed to go to the Warrriors and squash the Under Armour empire by now. But somehow, the Curry 4s are selling and not on sale at Ross.  Durant: But …  LeBron: You had one job.  Durant: You don’t understand the spell he has on 13-year-olds, man.  LeBron: That’s why I’m picking you first. I’m bequeathing you the throne so you can take over middle schools across the land.  KD: Bequeathing? I took that, homie.  Curry: Maaaaaan. Fu … dge Nike. Give me Klay Thompson.  LeBron: See, I knew that was coming. I’m a student of the game.  Curry: Klay … Klay! What are you doing???  Klay: I can’t find my lighter.  Curry: Man, come over here. I picked you.  Silver: Klay Thompson is not eligible for the first round. You must choose from the pool of starters that were voted in.  Draymond Green: (*through gritted teeth*) Steph! That’s not the plan!  Green nods his head twice to the right.  Curry: Oh yeah! My bad. You know me. I lose focus sometimes.  Ron Adams: Yeah, we know!  Curry: Give me Anthony Davis.  Davis: Niiiiice!  Kyrie Irving: Hol’ up … hol’ up … I see what’s happening here.  LeBron: Y’all doing this again???  Curry: What? I’m picking players just like you. Why is it a problem when I select a player???  LeBron: Nah. It’s cool, Steph. It’s cool. I’m ready this time.  Whadduya say Ky! Down for one more run together?  Kyrie: Respectful requests usually come with a please.  LeBron: I’m the King!! I don’t say please to nobody. What I look like?!?!  Draymond: Don’t let him talk to you like that Ky!  Kyrie: See, this is why I left.  LeBron: I don’t care! I’m taking James Harden!  KD: (*whispers in Bron’s ear*) You ain’t supposed to pick him. He with adidas.  Bron: WE RUN NIKE! And Kyrie acting funny again! I’m through with him!  Kyrie: Control is but an illusion. The truly free are those who surrender to the reality of having no control.  Curry: I’ll take Kyrie. My bad, James. You were my next pick.  LeBron: We need some size. Lemme see. … Give me Joel Embiid.  Embiid: Finally. You guys were taking too long to trust the process. I should have been the first pick.  LeBron: Don’t trip, bro. I’ll make sure Rihanna holla at you as a bonus.  Embiid: I told everybody I’m off her now. She didn’t want me then, I don’t want her.  Harden: You say that now. You know you wanna see her nakey nakey naked.  Curry: Yes! Give me Giannis!  Draymond: Told you we’d get him too! This chess. This ain’t checkers!  Cousins: You betta pick me, Bron! I ain’t no last pick!  Davis: You not last. You see all these cats out here?  Cousins: Last of the first round! I ain’t last at nothing. Bron, don’t play me out here like this.  LeBron: Cuz, I already got Joel. I can’t have two centers.  Cousins: I ain’t just a center fool! Stop tryna play me! I play the four and I can run the point. My 3 is better than yours!  Durant: Pick Cuz, man. You know he gone blow a gasket if you don’t. Let him live.  LeBron: C’mon Cuz. You know I got you.  Cousins: That’s what I thought!  Thompson: Here it is! Found my lighter!  Curry: Let’s go DeMar DeRozan. You know I love The Six.  DeRozan: Right on. Right on. Let’s have some fun.  Drake: Somebody said The Six?  Durant: Don’t nobody give a damn about no Drake night!  Silver: This is a closed meeting, Aubrey.  Drake: I’m with DeMar. He said I can get one of his stints.  Silver: That’s not allowed under the CBA.  Drake: But I’m designing the uniforms.  Russell Westbrook: No you ain’t! I already set up a designer from Milan to make 'em!  Drake: But I’m making a soundtrack.  Damian Lillard: Too late. I’m already on it.  Drake: Can I at least perform at halftime?  Victor Oladipo: I could use another background singer. You a tenor, right?  Silver: So the starting lineups go as follows:  Team LeBron James consists of himself, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid and DeMarcus Cousins.  Team Stephen Curry consists of himself, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, Giannis Antetokounmpo and DeMar DeRozan.  Now for the reserves. LeBron, since you had the first pick in the first round, Steph you get the first pick of the second round.  Curry: My brother of Splash. Klay Thompson.  Thompson: So, I’m set right? That’s all you need from me?  Draymond: Klay, where is you going bro???  Thompson: Um … I’m just … about to make sure Rocco is still safe outside.  Cousins: I’m coming witchu.  Silver: To check on Rocco?  Cousins: Um … yeah. It’s like he both our dog. We just keep him at Klay house.  Silver: You two are not checking on Rocco without me. Stay here. LeBron, your pick.  LeBron: Let’s go Russ!  Westbrook: Hell nah! I ain’t playing with him!  LeBron: Oh, so you gone play for Steph???  Westbrook: I don’t play for nobody! I play for myself! Because why not!  KD: Brodie calm down with all that. Just play basketball, man. Cut the act.  Curry: I ain’t picking him. I wanna win.  Westbrook: What you say!?! I’ll play you 1-on-1 right now!  LeBron: Chill y’all! Damn! Russ. Let’s go Brodie. We hooping.  Silver: Curry, your next pick, please.  Thompson: Sucks. It’s a beautiful, sunny day outside and I’m stuck in here.  Curry: Draymond.  LeBron: I’ll take Jimmy Butler.  Curry: Karl-Anthony Towns.  LeBron: Kristaps Porzingis.  Curry: Victor Oladipo.  Draymond: Oh, we about to destroy y’all!  KD: Bet a rack.  Draymond: Bet 5 racks.  KD: Done. Easy money.  LeBron: D-Wade. Where D-Wade at?  Silver: You are only allowed to select from the current crop of All-Stars.  LeBron: What?! I’m the King! I can pick my brother if I want!  Chris Paul: Well actually, Bron, as the president of the players association, I can confirm that the agreement was only current All-Stars.  LeBron: Why would you even agree to that? You know I gotta have my guys with me.  CP: That’s not true. I believe in you bro. You can do anything.  Curry: It’s you can do ALL things. If you gone steal my slogan, at least get it right.  Kyrie: But didn’t you steal it from the Bible, though?  Curry: It’s not stealing if it’s from the Bible.  Silver: LeBron, please make your next selection.  LeBron: John Wall.  Curry: This one for The Town. Give me Dame.  LeBron: Giiiiiive meeeee … LA.  Kyrie: See! I knew you was going to the Lakers!  Paul George: Let’s goooooooooooo!  LeBron: Chill out! I meant give me LaMarcus Aldridge! Geez.  Curry: Bradley Beal.  LeBron: I see what you’re doing. Trying to load up on shooters?  Curry: (*whispers*) And a little light recruiting.  LeBron: Kyle Lowry.  Curry: OK, last pick. Hmmmm. This is tough.  I’ma close my eyes and throw my mouthpiece. Whoever I hit is my pick.  Embiid: But I thought you only threw it at refs and fans.  Draymond: You’re not allowed to talk until you make the playoffs.  Curry: It was a joke. Relax. Give me Kev … no, give me Al Horford.  Kevin Love: Dammit, Steph! C’mon bro! I promise I won’t lock you up on the perimeter ever again.  Wall to Beal: Look at Kyrie over there cracking up.  Beal: Hilarious.  Wall: I bet he’s so glad he’s out of that mess.  Beal: Must feel good. Tops in the East. Free from his ball-dominant co-star who tries to control everything. He’s living the life.  Wall: Riiiight … wait, what you trying to say???  LeBron: Give me CP. I ain’t taking K-Love.  Silver: Again, you can only pick current All-Stars.  LeBron: HE’S THE GREATEST POINT GUARD EVER. How is he not an All-Star this year???  CP: It’s cool. Me, Trevor Ariza and Gerald Green got somewhere to go anyway.  Blake Griffin: You sure you don’t want a go-to guy like Lou Williams?  Curry: Let him have CP. He is All-Star worthy.  Silver: The coaches did not vote him in. I can’t allow it.  LeBron: Not surprised. I never get any calls in this league anymore.  Curry: All right, I’ll take Kevin Love as my final pick.  LeBron: You can have him. Al Horford, let’s go.  Horford: Great. I’m on the top seed in the East and the last pick? Do I get a prize or something?  Harden: You get to win. Look at our squad.  Thompson: We about to light it up. We’ve got the best shooters on the globe.  Kyrie: Well, actually, it’s not a …  Butler: Let it go, Ky. Just let it go.  "
"Don’t worry I got you. 1. But regardless, that doesn’t matter.   Truth is, Russell Westbrook is a better all around player than Damian Lillard will ever be, and you arguing against that is entirely too much comedy for my Thursday morning.   Have fun getting bounced in the playoffs! :) "

Russell “Crowe” Westbrook.  Who wouldn’t wanna re-sign with the Gladiator.  I am very much entertained.
If y’all were fair you would give Russell Westbrook more than 7 damn freethrows a game.

So statpadding is cool if LeBron does it but not if Russell Westbrook does it I guess
Googles to see if Russell Westbrook has a neck
"Oh god look at the ballots that get released eveyr year and see who some of these voters nominate for All NBA defense or DPOY. I believe Andre Drummond and Russell Westbrook both got votes for DPOY last season; most voters have no clue what they are doing when it comes to evaluating defense. I bet the vast majority dont even realize stats like deflections exist. What a ton of people do is just ask scouts and people they know around the league who to vote for; depending on how good those sources are for them and how well they choose them that influences their votes.   The whole thing is just a farce.   But yeah for as much data that is available publicly for offense, it's just not the same defensively. Just basic stuff like how much player X spent guarding each player on the opponent in a game would help a ton. No idea why Synergy can come up with all this individual player defensive data(that's mostly useless) and things like ""how many shots a player contests"" but not list something as simple as this. "

"People who watch the Pelicans, why don't these stats translate to having a better team?   Is he on a Russell Westbrook stat binge or is it because their perimeter defense is god awful?"
"He's the model of what you want in a point guard. He drops 20 points per game, gets 10 assists per game, is disruptive on defense getting lots of steals, and plays overall some good defense. He's a facilitator but can take the shot as well. He's not ball-dominant the same way Westbrook is, but instead he can fit right in with just about anyone you surround him with.  Is he a superstar? Borderline. Superstar is a relative term without a clear definition. I don't think he's a superstar because he doesn't transcend the NBA. If you say Russell Westbrook, James Harden, or Steph Curry to people who don't follow the NBA closely, they know those guys. People who follow the NBA of course know John Wall, but those who are more casual fans aren't going to know him as well.  I think he's one of the best ""stars"" that doesn't quite cross in to the ""superstar"" category."
"Idc about any articles that explain that specific moment but [this article](https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/4xzq49/russell-westbrook-the-legacy-of-khelcey-barrs) explains a lot about Khelcey Barrs III, Westbrook's best childhood friend. It's really apparent how much his passing affects WB. If you pay attention to his in-game attire, WB sometimes wears things to memorialize Khelcey like [his shoes](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1CBxYeUUAAlJb9.jpg) or [wristbands](http://jocksandstilettojill.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Russ-KB3.jpeg)"
"The stoppable force met the movable object and the stoppable force won by a lot. That's all I need to say about the Cavs' D.  I hate talking about the Cavs in January because there is just no point whatsoever. Their defensive rotations are abysmal, they look like they don't really want to play basketball, and JR Smith looks like he belongs in Lithuania. Does this mean they won't flip a switch? Probably not. But the point is that this is a pretty disgusting midseason product regardless of any flip switching that may occur.   Lowe has talked and written about this a lot, but basically, when the Cavs have been hitting that extra playoff I care now gear, they've always had a decent launching point. Going from middle of the pack to roughly top 10ish defensively is enough for them in the playoffs. The East has been laughable enough for them to get by with that. This year though, going from basically last or just ahead of Sacramento (defensive juggernaut) to middle of the pack might not cut it. Boston is no joke this year and Toronto looks resurgent with their 21st century offense. I'm not going to bet against Lebron because that's dumb and I like to think that I'm not dumb but this could be the year. Who knows. It's January.   As for the game itself, I thought DJ did an incredible job of playing within himself. He did everything he's really good at (layups and rebounding) and stayed away from the things he sucks at (shooting and forcing the issue). It seems like if you combine Tony Parker off the bench and DJ you basically get Russell Westbrook. I think they combined for 33/10/9 on 15/27. I like this a lot and want to see more of it in the future.    LA feasted down low, which he's been so good at this year. His low-post seal is so powerful and he's not fading away when he's 2 feet from the hoop. I think that's been the key to his success this year. Cavs just gave up on the TP/LA PnR and gave up countless open midrange shots. It's easy to say ""hurr durr statistically ineffecient"" but those 2 dude are not to be left open. It's basically a layup.     Kyle Anderson is a stud. He is going to get paid this offseason and I hope we keep him. He's such a valuable rotation player because he does everything so well even if he doesn't excel at one particular skill. He uses his slow motion to his advantage lulling guys to sleep and stopping for easy floaters. When he gets beat because he moves like a snail he's mastered the [Kawhi school of length](https://youtu.be/AECuWJBq2CU?t=23s) and recovers so well with his spider limbs.    Bertans passed up some shots which I've never seen him do but he looked comfortable in extended minutes. His PnR D is still pretty shaky but that will hopefully improve with more reps. Joffrey Lauvergne still kinda sucks but oh well that's life.   Cavs really need to go bowling or some shit because this is just not fun to watch. They have too many national TV games to keep pushing out these lackluster performances. "

"It's the epitome of armchair analysis. Oh, Robertson average a triple double for a full season? He must be just like Westbrook! If you actually [watch highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZLW004GMp0) of Robertson playing, you'd see he plays nothing like Westbrook. Less athleticism and speed.   The argument the guy I replied to is making isn't adjusting for era. ""Wilt and Russell played against several hall of fame centers."" Most of those HOF players, perhaps with the exception of the freak athletes who completely dominated the era (Wilt, Russell), would likely not be hall of famers if their skills carried into present day, because ""freak athleticism"" then is just NBA athleticism now."
"Am I the only one that sees Westbrook laying this up over 2 Nets defenders *despite* the moving screen-tackles...and knows that there was nothing anyone could do to stop Russell Westbrook, POINT GOD?"
If it’s so easy to rack up assists on that team and even you could average 5 assists per game I don’t understand how Klay averages only half that with 2.5 assists while still turning the ball over roughly 2 times per game (compared to Iguodala who averages more assists and less turnovers off the bench).   As for Draymond not creating for himself it’s not like Klay’s creating for himself either. He’s doing the same thing except his only job is to shoot threes. Klay Thompson isn’t going to iso to get a bucket he’s spotting up in the corner so Curry or Green can find him open.   As for your final point that 32% is terrible: he is shooting better than the reigning MVP Russell Westbrook (shooting 30%) and shooting 1% worst than Eric Gordon (shooting 33% this season) so his percentage is on par with player seen to be good shooters.   And again I have nothing against Klay I think he’s an amazing player (offensively and defensively) but in MY opinion I think Draymond Green is better.
"You know whats funny? You actually embody the actual Thunder as a whole haha. You see, Russell Westbrook has always had great stats and Kevin Durant was phenomenal as well along with harden and ibaka. But they could never win it. You can blame injuries and whatever but its not. The spurs, mavs, and warriors went to win titles. Its because they get the most out of their players. See you may be right, if draymond is on another team, he could be Tyler Hasborough for all we know. But the thing is, he is playing at an all star level on the warriors. And to say, “oh of course, because he’s playing with other great players he should be better”- Oladipo is now an all star because he’s not part of westbrook and kanter is balling out"
"For the season, their best FT shooter is Jordan Clarkson, at 76.6%, which is approximately 93rd out of 158 in the NBA for qualifying players (at least 71 FTs shot, or ~1.5 FTA/game).  That's followed by KCP, who, after this game, is probably out of the top 100.  He's followed by Kuzma, BroLo, Randle, BI, and LNJ, who are (were) all between 123rd and 147th (out of 158!), not including the most recent game.

Russell Westbrook is 125th out of 158 with a 70.7%, lower than Kuzma and BroLo, but higher than the other three.  Young players are pretty bad at FTs. Josh Jackson, Ben Simmons, DeAaron Fox, DSJ are all 121st or lower.  On the other end, Courtney Lee, a career 85.8% FT shooter, is 96.5% on the season. He is followed by Redick, Jamal Murray, Belinelli, Lillard, CP3, Curry, Lou, and Dirk, all of whom are 90%+.  Edit: I jinxed it. Courtney Lee went 2-4 today from the charity stripe. Now he's at 94.4%, just a hair below Redick."

"I mean just looking at the names on paper, will people really think these two groups of players are not pretty close:  Group A: Lebron, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Giannis  Group B: Michael Jordan, Barkley, Olajuwon, Pippen, Stockton, Malone, Drexler, Shaq, Grant Hill, Payton, David Robinson  The era that MJ dominated was pretty damn stacked even matched up to today's talent. "
"For all the stupid narratives on r/NBA and the ESPN hot take zone, the ""players don't want to play with Russ"" is pretty much the stupidest of them all. I don't see a dude in the NBA that gets more ""I love this dude, I'll go to war for this dude, I'll sacrifice for this dude"" from teammates than Westbrook. Even for all KD's snakeness, he'll STILL put his neck out there for Westbrook and defend him even if Westbrook shits on him constantly. And did it his entire time in OKC when the media was pretty much begging him to throw Russ under the bus. Dudes like Oladipo and Kanter leave and talk about how much they valued their relationship with him. I don't know what the fuck more r/NBA need to stop with the stupid ""Russ is a bad teammate"" narrative when literally a grand total of ZERO actual Russell Westbrook teammates seem to believe that and have given any evidence that they do."
"Mate are you serious. Take Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook, I politely ask you to go watch highlight clips of both players and not tell me that they are playing in two radically different games. I’m not saying Robertson wasn’t an amazing player who pushed the game forward but it’d be laughable to think you could move that same player into today’s game and he’d somehow dominate when everything is ridiculously 100x faster and more skilled then when he played."
"&gt;We know this thanks to a little-noticed stat on the NBA’s stats site called Player Impact Estimate, or PIE. PIE is the share of all box score activity in a game (so points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks) with deductions for negative stats (turnovers, missed shots, personal fouls). The average for a player should be about 103, and the average for a team about 50.4 It’s an especially useful stat when used in tandem with net rating, because you can then see both how well a player is doing individually (the PIE rating) as well as how well the team is performing overall (the net rating).5   &gt;   &gt;Anyway, Westbrook’s PIE in crunch time is 40.3, meaning he accounts for about 40 percent of both teams’ combined activity all on his own — a greater share of game stats in his clutch minutes than five teams6 collect as a whole. The Thunder as a team has a 61.4 PIE in crunch time, fourth in the league, which tracks more or less with its 19.9 net rating, which ranks second overall.      https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/"
i agree with russell westbrook on this topic. 
"How is this take upvoted?  Wilt and Russell played against several hall-of-fame centers.  When there are only a few teams in the league, talent is concentrated.  Jerry West would be brilliant now, Elgin Baylor would be also brilliant now, Wilt would still be unstoppable now, Robertson now would be close to having another Westbrook, and Russell would be by far the best defensive player in the league."

"Look at this clip and you'll see why Russ gets shit on for his defense. It's impossible to play defense like that every possession against the caliber of players the NBA has today. There are very few superstars who are able to completely take another superstar off of their game and Russell Westbrook is one of them. He lacks defensive discipline, his footwork is atrocious, and 75% of the time he is chasing the opposing player, but when it comes down to it, his heart allows him to make plays that blow our minds and ask why he does not do it more often.

"Honest question. In what world would somebody else be in a position to have to try to score that many points? Because a very specific set of circumstances has to happen for a point total like that to happen. A player has to be willing to shoot a lot. Like a lot a lot. They’ve gotta somehow do it without making the players around them better too, because if you’re producing well and you’re getting your teammates easy buckets then you should have such a big league that you sit late and your point total is limited. Then you also have to play bad enough defense to allow the other team to stay in the game.  Do you get what I’m saying? It’s not that other players haven’t tried to score a lot, it’s that for most other good players if you’re scoring that well then the game is over by halftime and there’s no reason to play the end of the game. If Bron, Curry, KD, or just about anybody else was on pace for 80 points chances are they’d be sitting the back half of the game.  The only player I can think of who would have the gall and the inefficiency required to do that would be Russell Westbrook, although his team’s defense would probably put the game away early too."

Russell Westbrook - sports journalist
"1) east has been weak for sure but he's still had to contend with good teams near the top, its more the depth of the east thats a problem.  2) and wanting to play with other players isnt a problem  3) kd manipulated the system just as much, much worse to be honest considering after game 7 of the playoffs draymond called kd and left a team that was just as good as the warriors but lost a 3-1 lead which he was partially responsible for with shooting woes (42% from the field and 28% from three).  4) He hasn't always manipulated the system, cleveland never built around him, they never managed to get him a proper all star. Mo Williams was mostly considered an all star because he was a solid starter who was playing with LeBron not actually strong enough to be an all star and frequently appears on terrible all star selection lists. Moreover, the other all star he played with was Zydrunas Ilgauskas but the thing with that was Ilgauskas was declining as LeBron entered his prime and was more an all star for his rebounding and defensive abilities opposed to his offensive ones.  after he had enough of cleveland not giving him a great second option he left, got 2 championships and returned and gave cleveland the championship the city deserved. It wasn't surprising to see LeBron return because the bad blood was gone since while he left on bad terms it was more because of the owners fault then LeBron's and considering that LeBron wasn't mad at him anymore it made more sense for it to happen. On the other hand with KD he had the world on his team, within two years of him getting drafted his team had himself, James Harden, Russell Westbrook &amp; Serge Ibaka. After his team had gone 3-1 and they lost, he left, he wanted to win a ring and couldn't do it with Russell Westbrook &amp; Serge Ibaka, if Lebron had that kind of help and left it would look really bad on his part but because he never had a deserved all star on his team I have a lot more understanding for lebron than I do KD."
Judging by that last sentence the adventures Russell Westbrook and Steven Adams is where the real money is at
"His favorite player is Russell Westbrook, “Why not” is his slogan, he uses it a lot in social media and branding "

"I think you're severely underestimating the impact Westbrook had on the floor and the historical level he played at. I would argue it's not comparable to other circumstances. And if you honestly believe that his 2016-2017 season was mediocre I really don't know what to tell you.  EDIT: And to add, there were voters that said they voted for Russell because of his value, not his triple doubles. I'll take their words over yours."
"Man I wish we could keep this guy home. I really think he's gonna be one of those guys that will end up top 3 in redrafts and people are gonna say stuff like ""how did this guy fly under the radar when his talent is so obvious""  [Just to give you an idea of what we're working with here](http://www.tankathon.com/players/compare?players=collin-sexton--russell-westbrook)"

Finals LeBron is severely overrated and is all too similar to Russell Westbrook
TIL: Russell Westbrook = lacking elite basketball talent
"Holy shit. This is it right here, folks!  My god the ignorance ppl spew in this sub is just embarrassing.  So generational talents don’t have their flaws?

Yeah rignt”  Your post is just cancer to this sub."

"Well there's other stats that back up MJ being more efficient, TS% basically elevates volume shooters who shoot good from the FT line, If 5 stats say you're inefficient and one says you're just above the league average it's not enough to convince me.   Russell Westbrook shot the league average in TS%  and he's the poster boy for inefficiency. "

Note that Westbrook and Curry are 29 and Harden is 28.  I was surprised Durant missed the top ten but he did lose time due to injuries.  He's number 11 on the list.  Shaq was 25 in 1998, so he lost a year of his prime.  Even so, he's number 12 on the list."
"Russell Westbrook, Stockton, Nash, West, Kidd, Isiah Thomas, Curry, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Payton, CP3, Walt Frazier, Lenny Wilkens, Nate Archibald, Cousy, Dave Bing, Tim Hardaway, Chauncey Billups, Earl Monroe, Dame, Kyrie, Kevin Johnson, John Wall are all people i would take before him. Not sure if i would take him after Penny , Rose, (both because of injuries) Dennis Johnson, Mark Jakson, Baron Davis. People are going to say no because it's easy to hate but he very well me right on the cusp of top 30 all time. I think he's just a step below... the list gets a bit longer if we start to consider guys like LBJ and Harden who aren't listed as a PG but basically serve as one. "
Damian Lillard is not better than  Russell Westbrook
[Serious] Is Russell Westbrook the worst player in the NBA?
"Well what do you expect? You have an entire season of letting Westbrook dominate the ball all game...do you expect a cohesive second unit to come on and have a balanced, healthy attack? That team was probably the worst case scenario for any player not named Russell Westbrook.  Have you ever played basketball? If so, have you ever tried playing where you don't touch the ball most possessions or are not involved in the offense? Have you played with someone who tried to play hero ball every possession? Its hard to get into a rhythm or be an effective player in that scenario. I'm not sure what you'd expect players to do while playing in that system honestly. Just to be able to turn it on when RW decides to take a few minute breather, then go back to standing around when he comes back in?  Did you watch that series and think to yourself ""This is high quality basketball I am watching""? I am honestly curious, because I remember watching that series vividly, and me and my friends (who played college ball) agreed that was very low quality of basketball. It was awful."
Russell Westbrook is not easy to play with. 
"The league average? I'm sorry are we comparing Kobe to the average of the league or to other goats? Russell Westbrook shot the league average in TS% are we gonna sit here and say he's efficient now?   that's a skewed stat which heavily favours FT%, and he's still not elite at TS%. His best season of TS% is literally below lebrons average TS% for his career, who are the type of people he's getting put ahead of by Kobe fans. Michael Jordan had a 7 year stretch where he *averaged* more than kobes best season.   "
Pop is the russell Westbrook of coaches when it comes to media. Or the other way around
Russell Westbrook
" &gt; “I love that we were the first sports league to participate in the New York Pride Parade,” Collins said. “But we don’t have any active NBA players participating in the parade. I’d like to see someone like Russell Westbrook or Devin Booker standing alongside and being that ally.”   He trying to out these guys?  "
"Why Giannis over Durant? Giannis has been averaging 27.2/10.0/4.8 on 60.3 ts % and he has played 73 games (will play 77 games, if he finishes the season out healthy). Durant has been averaging 26.5/6.9/5.4 on 64.3 ts% and he has played 64 games (will play 68 games, if he finishes season out healthy). Giannis is statistically having a better season and he has played nearly 10 more games, so I think he deserves the nod over Durant.  Why Westbrook over Lillard? Westbrook is averaging 25.6/9.9/10.1 compared to Lillard’s 26.7/4.5/6.6.   !st team: G: Russell Westbrook G: James Harden F: LeBron James F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Anthony Davis. I feel like AD getting listed at center this year and him getting voted into all nba first team, would be most fair, if he got the center ballot.  2nd team: G: Damian Lillard G: DeMar DeRozan F: Kevin Durant  F:  LaMarcus Aldridge C: Karl Anthony-Towns. Have KAT at the 2nd team, because he is on track to play all 82 games and he has been averaging 21.2/12.3 a game.  3rd-team: G: Ben Simmons. This was very tricky to pick, but Simmons is averaging 15.8/8.1/8.1 on 53% shooting from the field and he is on track to play 80 games this season. I feel like his high level of play and durability, should be awarded with an all nba selection. His team is also on the brink of a 3rd seed, if they beat Cleveland and finish the season out strong. He has also had to lead his team, as Embiid will miss 19 games on the season. Curry, Kyrie, CP3, and Butler would all be getting all team selections, but Butler has played 55 games, Curry 51 games, Kyrie 60 games, and CP3 55 games. They haven’t played enough, to get on an all nba team in my opinion. G: Bradley Beal. He’s having a great year. Beal is averaging 22.7/4.4/4.5 and he is on track to play all 82 games.  F: Paul George F: Khris Middleton. Underrated year. Since the forward position has been plagued with injuries to Hayward, Kawhi, Porzingis, and Draymond, I feel that Middletown deserves the nod due to his averages of 20.2/5.3/4 a game and he is on track to play all 82 games. C: Nikola Jokic. Had to leave Embiid and Cousins off this list, due to their missed games. Cousins only played 48 games and Embiid only will play 63 games on the year. Jokic is on track to play 75 games (12 more games than Embiid) and he is averaging a cool 18.3/10.5/6 a game."
"""Welcome to your Kodak moment!""  ""Curry shoots a corner 3... I'm being corrected, it was actually Russell Westbrook with a dunk!"""
Russell Westbrook will turn 30 this year.
&gt; Russell Westbrook is the best player not on a top-two team  hnnnnnnhgggggg
"Since ~~Paul George competed in the 3 point contest during~~ the ASB, ~~notoriously-terrible 3-point shooter~~ Russell Westbrook is shooting better from 3 than Paul George."
Don't tell this to /u/Laggo  &gt;  basically only ever passes to or receives passes from Russell Westbrook out on the perimeter.
Russell westbrook is a perfect example of this
"I definitely noticed this with Milos this year too. He's an absolutely great passer and encourages the team to share the ball more but he'd have SO many more assists if he was a threat to get to the basket at all (esp in half court). You see sort of the opposite with Russell Westbrook, he's not the most natural passer but he creates such wide open passing lanes with how easily he can dunk on you it ends up getting him assists."
"&gt; Russell Westbrook shouldn't have won the MVP last year  &gt; I agree with this, WB deserved it"
Russell Westbrook shouldn't have won the MVP last year
"That's subjective, just like it's subjective that James Harden has been better than LeBron James this year, or that Russell Westbrook was better than both last year.  Both Simmons and Mitchell are deserving of winning ROY, but Co-Roy is statistically nearly impossible to happen. Simmons will probably win this year and good for him, he does deserve it. Sixers fans need some sort of hardware payoff for years of tanking.  Edit: Used the wrong adjective. Updated arbitrary to subjective."
The Russell Westbrook hate on this sub is ridiculous. You kids do know that efficient shooting isn't the only thing that makes a player great? There's more to winning games than efficient statistics.

Can you guys not be Russell Westbrook stans for 3 seconds and let people look at the statistics? I was interested in this and so are many other people obviously...just because your favorite player doesn't have great efficiency doesn't mean you should just whine about it.
Listen to the interview Woj had with Oladipo. He says that he'd NEVER have the season he's having in Indy if it wasn't for playing with Russell Westbrook. It guess it doesn't fit the narrative that you're dug into.

"Haha for real, just reading ""6'10"" Russell Westbrook"" gave me nightmares of getting jammed on"
"Its not his fault, he plays with Russell Westbrook.   We saw this same inconsistency last year with Oladipo. It's just a product of his team that many have had to deal with."
I was so much happier last year sitting back and just enjoying the Russell Westbrook show. This year we somehow manage to be worse and way less entertaining
Russell Westbrook was the only reason this game was close
"I actually don't mind when a player has that non-stop ""I'm the best at what I do"" mentality. It worked great for MJ, Kobe, Russell Westbrook, even other sports like Richard Sherman or Novak Djokovic.  What bothers me about LeBron is that he tries to have his cake and eat it too, like he wants to be seen as humble but also wants all the praise. That fake humility is off-putting and belongs in high school. KD is kinda similar but he gets way more hate for it."
"Well if we look at win shares, Jrue is clearly below the rest.

"I want Russell Westbrook to average a triple double again this year so badly so that we can expose whoever voted for him last year and not this year. Last year was embarrassing. The “he needs a better cast” argument is useless now that he got PG13 and Melo and the Thunder will win probably 2 more games. I’m really curious to see how many people vote for him this year, probably nobody. "
[Woj] Sources: Armed Guards will be in attendance tonight and Commissioner Adam Silver has granted the Thunder use of armed guards to protect Russell Westbrook at all times.  
Why are you being ugly? I just asked when KD ever said he didn't like playing with Russ. I was open to agree if you or DubCity could provide a source. Last thing I remember seeing him ever say was when he said he didn't like Donovan or the OKC roster outside of Russ.

"He is, unquestionably, the best player in the NBA. He's having one of his best-ever statistical seasons at age 33, on a team in total flux (having to trade away Kyrie, IT, Kevin Love missing time, acquiring basically a whole new bench), and is still leading his team to 3rd seed in the East. Most impressively, has not missed a game yet. Would be curious to see a comparison of man-games lost to injury between CLE and HOU.  If the counter-argument is that James' defense has declined, in response I can say that Harden never played much to begin with, and is being treated as a sure-fire MVP.  If the counter-argument is that James' team record isn't good enough, look at Russell Westbrook LAST YEAR."
"21 yr old vs 21 yr old is rather arbitrary.   21 yr old Ben Simmons is playing his 1st rookie year. 21 yr old Westbrook is in his 2nd year.

"It doesn’t make sense.  KD was a top seven (salary and endorsements) in the world in yearly earnings while playing in a smaller market in Oklahoma City. He’s now fifth playing for GS, so only a marginal improvement. This is for all athletes, not just the NBA.  Same for Russell Westbrook who is currently the 13th highest paid athlete and will likely enter the top ten when his new contact goes into effect next season. Damian Lillard is currently the 15th highest athlete in the world playing in another small market. This is based on 2017.  So why hasn’t earning potential impacted those players, but somehow it is impacting Kawhi?"

"For me personally it would matter how healthy the teams he beat and which teams they were. Beating a full strength Rockets, Warriors and Cavs would be incredibly impressive and assuming he continues his career trajectory would probably end up too 4/5. At the same time though I feel that with a point guard whose game had more portability like Paul or Stockton or Curry or pretty much any great PG not named Russell Westbrook or Allen Iverson this roster would have won 55+ games and be considered a legit contender "

"&gt; People always say that him chasing triple doubles hurts the team but there’s never a concrete argument supplemented with it  How about the time when Russell ""What's defence? it's better to camp in the paint and get rebounds for triple doubles"" Westbrook decided to leave Beverley wide open in crunchtime of game 2 in NBA playoffs ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6cLI34jBpo  Or how about the fact that Deandre Jordan was contesting more 3pt shots last season than Westbrook ?"

"Because Durant never took over games at all while at OKC? Or even Paul George this season before he was slumping?   Do you dudes even watch basketball from season to season or just stay on reddit and spew out nonsense c'mon lol. We've seen the bad of Russell Westbrook, no doubt. But even in that spurs game they some sets in the final 2 minutes to get open looks for both Melo and Brewer who also missed their shots. It's not like he shot every single possession to end the game."
"Defense is hard to quantify based purely on stats because they all only tell part of the story.  It's like having a player on offense who's really active without the ball and keeps rotating around the floor to help space it, screen, or be in position for the open shot. If that player didn't end up shooting or passing the ball to make the basket, he gets 0 statistical value for the play, however, his movement was still vitally important to the result of that play he just didn't get a stat for it. Ricky's defense (while certainly not nearly as important as Gobert's) has certainly been part of the reason for Westbrook's struggles.  But, because he's Ricky Rubio and the other guy is Russell Westbrook, the narrative will always be that Westbrook is struggling, not that Ricky is playing good defense."
Okay. The way Russell Westbrook has played on the court for his entire career has fallen far more in line with a player interested in playing hero ball and filling up a stat sheet than a player interested in doing everything he can to put his team in position to win a championship.  Is that sanitized enough for you? 
"But OP, Russell Westbrook *is* a mental midget compared to the rest of his colleagues."
"Its hard to swallow this argument because its not simple cause and effect.   He shot poorly not JUST because hes a poor shooter but because he takes poor shots.   Russell has never been much of a rhythem shooter and has like at least one terrible leg kick 3 to draw a foul per game, but if he played more efficiently and OKC had a more reliable offense other than high pick and roll Westbrook would probably be a fairly reliable floor spacer."
LeBron James Jr. was almost as big as Russell Westbrook when Russ was messing around guarding him at the all star game this year
"Sure, I'll elaborate.  Russell Westbrook is clearly one of the ten most physically gifted players in the NBA. His combination of speed, athleticism, and footwork means that he can win his team a game on any given night against any opponent, and there aren't ten players you can say that about in the NBA.  However, Westbrook's inconsistent effort, shot selection, tunnel vision, and poor shooting mean that he can also have some really crushing stretches that make it difficult to build around him or feel confident when he's on the floor against quality competition (Like the Jazz).   So while Westbrook is a top ten talent and could probably beat most all-stars in a one-on-one competition, I'm not certain that I would call him a top ten player since I don't think he'd be a top ten pick if I were starting a team for even one season."
"*For the first game without KD, Russell Westbrook takes center court with a microphone*  Russell: This is my yard now. *drops mic and raises arms*"
"As a Melo and NY fan who rooted for PG during the Pacers vs Heat days, and has been rooting for Russell Westbrook since KD left, fuck me"
"Here's how I look at it:  Russell Westbrook has the athleticism and raw talent that demands he must be a top 10 player.  But if I had to win a game tomorrow or start a franchise, I would pick at least ten players ahead of Westbrook, including three point guards. "
russell westbrook has turned into the roman reigns of the nba
"Yes, the answer is yes. Russell Westbrook is a top 10 player."
"&gt; You're going against basically every basketball analyst watching this series.  I do not need confirmation bias.   &gt;  Russ is not a jump shooter   He can an elite pull up jumper. He has an elite athletism, which helps him get where ever he wants on the court.  &gt; He simply cannot drive against Gobert  He can, but would you rather take a 12-18 ft open pull up jumper or take your chances with a guy who can touch the rim with his feet on the ground. Westbrook chooses the former, but the latter can get Gobert in foul trouble.   &gt; He also thrives in the pick-and-roll with Adams, which also simply does not work against Gobert.   It just isn't Gobert, it is the way the Jazz are defending it. They are stringing it out horizontally and recovering, so Russell or PG cannot get going down hill. The Jazz are helping and recovering and the guards are going under the screen. This gives Westbrook a fairly open 12-18 jumper. With PG they are helping a bit harder, but PG has a fair amount of good looks from range.  &gt; Gobert alone basically neutralizes our most potent offensive weapons.   So, if this is the case - what do you do? Attack and try to get him in foul trouble. What is frustrating as a basketball fan (taking off the homer cap), is how many jump shots the thunder are taking. Sure you can blame Gobert and Favors, but they have nothing to do with jacking up bad shots. After the first quarter in game 4, I thought the Jazz were in trouble. The Jazz were in the penalty with 6 or so minutes left in the quarter and shooting FT's on every possession. In the second quarter the Jazz were in the penalty again, but the Thunder stopped attacking and getting to the line - which lead to a Jazz run. When the jazz made the run in the third, the thunder rather than fighting through - decided to just start jacking up contested shots. If the thunder realize that they can get the Jazz in foul trouble, then they can come back in this series. On the defensive side of the ball, I have 0 idea why the Thunder do not leave Crowder wide open and dare him to shoot the ball on every possession. They should play him like Kobe played (on of my favorite Jazz players) Ronnie Brewer. Let him shoot. I would also leave Favors open in the corner and let Rubio shoot all of the 3's that he wants that are not in the corner. Pack it in and double Mitchell, then let some of the lessor players try to beat you. Rotate the Ingles on the 3 hard, Rotate the roll of Gobert/Favors, and leave Rubio, Crowder, Favors to beat you with open shots. The Thunder need to pick their poison, which they have not done on the defensive side of the ball.  "
"Perhaps the NBA will indeed use this incident to lay down rules for what is expected of players checking in.   Also, I too was annoyed that the current rules weren't readily available.  edit: [Looks like an after-the-fact T and a fine for WB.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-playoffs-russell-westbrook-fined-10k-issued-technical-for-game-4-incident-will-not-be-suspended/) Shouldn't make a difference, since it doesn't look like they're making it out of the first round."
"Russell Westbrook is a bad player. People are being dumbed down by the stats. If in a game that there is only 5 players in a team, and there is a guy dominating the stat sheet, like in todays NBA, something is very wrong. In that case, Basketball is a simple game: if you're able to win, then you're good; if you're not, then you're bad. ""basketball fans"" can't judge people playing anymore, they're just idolizing statistics..."
"It's like Mike Singletary said ""I won't tolerate players who think it's about them when it's about the team .... it is more about them than it is about the team, can not play with them, can not win with them, can not coach with them, can't do it"".  Pretty much Russell Westbrook in a nutshell."
BREAKING NEWS: Russell Westbrook demanded an immediate trade to the Spurs after he heard that Spurs players don't have to deal with reporters and their dumb questions.
Damn. This must be quite hard for Russell Westbrook and OKC fans to swallow
"The examples he pulled may be flawed, but you have to admit there's an emerging correlation that's hard as shit to ignore. This volume of examples and this pattern of leaving and improving has to leave one wondering where the thunder are going wrong.  * It clearly isnt the GM. Sam Presti has done a consistently solid job of putting talent on the floor and his drafts arent horrible either. They've been one of the 5 best ""on paper,"" teams in the NBA for the better part of a decade sans-2017.  * It clearly isnt their scouting department. 3 guys theyve drafted in the past 10 years are perennial all stars (only team that matches that is GSW). Theyve also had plenty of young guys they've drafted not name Durant, Harden, or WB have solid as shit openings to their career. Even getting past Adams and Ibaka, they've drafted guys like Eric Bledsoe, Roddy Beaubois, hell even tank Commander Cam Payne was a solid backup before being traded to Chicago  * Is it player development? They've had young guys perform to a B/C level while they're here and then leave and blossom elsewhere so it's debatable.  * Is it the coaching? Well, maybe..? Theyve had 2 separate coaches achieve like results with similar talent levels to work with. You want to say they underperform in relation; they feel like they have more talent then their opposition in a good portion of games. So why dont they win? I feel like the most reliable answer is...  * It's the centerpiece. Russell Westbrook as a player is all ham all the time. Which is a solid mentality. He's never discouraged and never going to stop being Russell. But you also see him have games or stretches like this series against Utah and really wish he'd pull back a bit. He entirely reminds me personally of Pre-Miami LeBron just from a burden perspective because he imposes this burden on himself to be *the man* and to do it all... When the teams he's had (again sans-2017) haven't needed that.   At this point you watch russ play and it feels like there's this cemented mental block that the entire show has to run through him at all times. He needs to grab defensive boards to push offensive tempo, he needs to initiate the offense in the half court, he needs to play ~40 mpg because his back ups have been trash since Reggie Jackson left, he needs to make all the plays in the offense, etc. This late into a career you rarely see such sharp 180 degree pivots, but thats what Russ's mentality really needs"
"We've also won more championships than Russell Westbrook, and James Harden combined."
I really think that literally any team in the NBA would hear out a package that involved Russell Westbrook.   Now consider the interest of a team that went under .500 last year.
"Young] Russell Westbrook has been fined $10,000 and assessed a technical foul for an altercation with Rudy Gobert in Game 4. He will not face any further discipline."
"how anyone hates on KD the most with Russell out there dumbfounds me. he is literally the most selfish, loser of a fucking ego poorly dressed fucking bum of a player. he just has long arms and good work ethic which leads a typical high assist/point guard to also get rebounds so he's heralded as some amazing player for his triple doubles but no, he's a fucking loser.   no wonder KD wanted to get out of that toxic situation, said shit on twitter, etc. granted KD took the easy way out, but winning isn't easy even with a super team, with injuries, etc, and when i compared these two, what KD brings in basketball appreciation and IQ compared to this asshole, fucking hell. even KD gives better interviews, this guy won't even interview without being a fucking asshole.

"The difference is that Westbrook was on the floor as a substitute.  From the [NBA's press release](http://www.nba.com/article/2018/04/24/thunder-russell-westbrook-fined-postgame-technical-foul):  &gt; Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook has been fined $10,000 and assessed a postgame technical foul for initiating a confrontation with Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert, it was announced Tuesday by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations. &gt;  &gt; ***The incident occurred after Westbrook came onto the court as a substitution following a stoppage in play due to a foul*** with 7:55 remaining in the fourth quarter of the Thunder’s 113-96 loss to the Jazz on Monday, April 23 at Vivint Smart Home Arena."
"Correct.  When Russell plays against teams who get back on defense, who don't turn the ball over....  ... (which lets face it all teams in the playoffs are already good on these two metrics, and teams don't take plays off in the playoffs) ...  ... and especially when Russell plays against teams who get back &amp; have low TO, with rim protectors, his already bad efficiency gets way worse, and he feels helpless.  This is just a bad matchup for OKC's style.  They would have much better success against say, Portland.  Paul George &amp; Adams can't make up for how much the Jazz have taken away Russ's only high percentage paint shots.  And Melo is essential Kurt Thomas at this point with worse rebounding.  Plus Westbrook and Melo, mentally, don't play their best from behind.  Psychologically, they're frontrunners, who get very discouraged and start pointing fingers when they get behind, and feel bad about the game/series/season's prospects."

"There was a somewhat short, but quite fair, overarching look at Westbrook and OKC's issue with surrounding personnel and some other stuff at the start of the year on the ringer and I don't think much has changed. [This](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/11/27/16702738/nba-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-problem) might be it but can't check right now.   After the last few years, it's pretty undeniable that he's certainly played a significant part in OKC's problems. It doesn't help that he basically had the keys to the team even at the tail end of KD's time there and now they're stuck with him and he doesn't have much incentive to change. The problem in these discussions is that normally they arise only when he's on a poor streak or the team is utterly shitting the bed so people overplay his bad qualities and are dismissive of his strengths. "
"I can see the headlines ""Since the ringer article Russell Westbrook has shot 60/40/90 while leading his team to 3 straight victories"" "
"&gt;George Hill was way worse. Look at the playoff stats for Ricky Rubio:  What the....  So let's just be clear. You discount Donovan Mitchell's playoff stats as a comparison to Gordon Hayward's because it's only been 4 games. Then you want to use Ricky Rubio's playoff stats in comparison to George Hill's to make some kind of idiotic argument that, because Ricky Rubio has balled out in these games, George Hill sucked last season?  That is preposterous. Just absolute cherry-picked hogshit.  You have no idea what kind of contributions Hill made to our team last year. You have absolutely zero idea what you're talking about. And Rubio being great in these playoffs so far has no relationship at all to Hill's contributions to our team last year.  This is the craziest shit.  &gt;Do you have any proof that Mitchell is a: better leader, better scorer, or that he's more clutch?  100%. Watch the games. No one who watched a majority of Hayward's games last year and Mitchell's this year would reach any other conclusion.   Unfortunately, you haven't, and you won't.  And because you haven't, you have no basis for comparison.   &gt;Stats can't tell you because it's made up, and completely subjective.  It's subjective to some degree, but it's not made up. It's a thing that exists, a thing that can be observed and absorbed, if not quantified. Like, if you watch *any* Donovan Mitchell game and don't come away with the absolute certain knowledge that he can do a whole bunch of things that Gordon Hayward can't do, then you didn't understand what you were watching.  If you watch Donovan Mitchell and the way he's talking to his teammates on the court during timeouts and deadballs, the way these guys are talking to each other and encouraging each other, and you *don't* think that's better leadership than Hayward displayed? Then it's because you either aren't informed enough about this team to know the difference, or you're incapable of recognizing what leadership looks like. Because you think it's imaginary.  Clutch can certainly be quantified.  For example, in the playoffs last season, across 11 games, in the 4th quarter Hayward scored 6.2 PPG on 42.5% shooting. In the final two minutes, Hayward made 33% of his shots  In the 4th quarter of these playoffs, Mitchell is averaging 9.0 PPG on 52% shooting, hitting 100% of his shots in the final two minutes, and over the past 3 games Donovan Mitchell by himself has outscored Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, and Russell Westbrook COMBINED in 4th quarter scoring.  &gt;Don't bring that kinda nonsense up in a post and act like it's evidence of anything.  It's not nonsense. It's just the difference between what Jazz fans know, and what you know. Because we've watched the games, and you haven't. We are intimately familiar with what went on with our team last year compared to now, and you aren't.  &gt;Don't forget how much Hayward meant to the Jazz.  I haven't. I don't think there are many of us who have. He was the best small forward we ever had, and would have been a legend in Salt Lake City, and the cornerstone of our franchise had he stayed, and I personally was hugely invested in him. I loved him to pieces.  &gt;Many Jazz fans are bitter about Hayward and have short memories. This whole thread is evidence of that.  Not at all. What it's evidence of is that people like you, who have no real knowledge of a subject, will think nothing of rejecting the information given to you by people who have years of knowledge and an intimate understanding of it, because what they're telling you doesn't mesh with the incorrect, ill-informed alternative story that you would prefer to believe.

Sniper Russell Westbrook shooting 29% from deep 
"I don't think it's fair to characterize the vast majority of his NBA games as cold stretches, or characterize him as merely streaky because he went through one or two stretches where he looked competent. Everyone shoots faster and more confidently in the midst of a hot streak, but that's still all it was. Russell Westbrook catches the occasional hot streak too, but that's not indicative that he'll one day be a solid three point shooter.  The other aspects of Lonzo's game that are indicative of shooting potential - midrange and free throws - are equally dismal. I'm not saying he won't improve, but if you're looking for even a 36% shooter I think that's a bit optimistic. "

I just point to the fact that the Thunder are about to lose in the 1st round -- again -- with elite abilities on their team -- again, and laugh as they try to say that a team with Steven Adams, Russell Westbrook, and Paul George just doesn't have enough talent."

"With some deflective bs. Something along the lines of ""all players had been summoned in. Perhaps Steven Adams was distracted by what was taking place on the court and didn't realize he and Russell Westbrook had been summoned in. I'm not really sure, you would have to ask Mr Adams why he hadn't entered the court yet but i can tell you that all players had been summoned in at that point."""
"Not sure if it's even worth debating with you if you're going to use 50 wins as your benchmark of top 5 PGs lol. No disrespect to the Raptors either, they took care of their business, but the East was not as good as the West this year.      Just look at the side by side comparison and really tell me you'd pick Lowry over Westbrook.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Kyle+Lowry&amp;player_id1_select=Kyle+Lowry&amp;player_id1=lowryky01&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id2_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;y2=2018    "
"Alot of people don't realize since December, he's sacrificed a lot and [taken up the 3rd role on this team](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22545271/oklahoma-city-thunder-star-carmelo-anthony-learning-accept-new-role).   I do agree he should come off the bench, but it would ultimately make little difference, as PPat has been pretty useless throughout the year and Jerami Grant would give spacing issues (which would kill them this particular series with Gobert packing the paint). If anything they should stagger his minutes so he plays most of it with the bench, but outright starting him by itself isn't why the Thunder are losing. This team wins or loses by Russell Westbrook. "
"&gt;It's not as close as you think. Mitchell has a chance to be as good as year 7 Hayward when he's in year 3  LOL. Okay, I'm beginning to see what's going on here.  &gt;Hayward got to the line over 2x more than Mitchell, shot 33% better on threes (I don't mean his % was 33 percentage points higher), and did better in pretty much every statistical category when looking at per 36 or per 100.  Oh, so now stats are important? Interesting. You turned around fast on that position.  &gt;He also has the advantage of playing with a MUCH better PG; George Hill is washed, and Rubio has been excellent.  Oh my god this is hilarious.   So, look, here's the situation. You don't know what you're talking about. You signed Hayward, and got yourselves all hyperbolic about his greatness. Now you're looking for ways to diminish what Mitchell is doing because you don't like anybody saying Mitchell is just as good.  George Hill was good last year. He didn't play washed up, he made great contributions to our team.  Ricky Rubio is also playing great for us. Ricky Rubio being good for us now doesn't mean that George Hill played last year like he was washed up; he didn't. That is simply untrue. Something you conjured up from your imagination.  We are a better team this year than we were last year. We finished the last 35 games of the season at an 84% win percentage, (a 68 game win-pace). In 7 years with Hayward, we never had a stretch of games that approached anything like that. Mitchell is helping us accomplish this in a variety of ways. He's a better leader than Hayward was. He's a better scorer than Hayward was; he's more clutch. He takes over in the fourth quarter. He compels us to wins single-handedly at times doing things Hayward simply can't do. Those are a few examples of things stats can't tell you. You almost certainly wouldn't know these things unless you were a Jazz fan, but all of these things are true.  Now, as a rookie, Mitchell is having a bigger impact on games than Hayward did, breaking records, and doing things that a rookie hasn't done since *Michael Jordan*.  He's in a series right now against Russell Westbrook and Paul George, and he's clearly the best player on the court.  That is not ""maybe he'll be as good as Hayward in year 3"" good.  It is starting to become laughable that other people think they know more about Gordon Hayward's game, and better understand the impact he has on the court, than Jazz fans do. When did everybody start to think that Gordon Hayward was flawless and that it was crazy to think other players were at his level? Gordon Hayward is a great player. Arguably a top 5 SF in the league. And we loved having him. And you're going to love having him. We were devastated to see him go.  He's not Kevin Durant. He's not Lebron James. And by this time next season it will be clear to everyone: he's not Donovan Mitchell.  "

Russell Westbrook deserves to live 
"Okay. Put it this way then. Darren Collison was the season leader in FG%. Russell Westbrook is a similar slashing Point Guard like Rose.  Rose has double their makes in half their attempts.   Nobody is saying ""Rose is the 2nd best three-point shooter in the league because of his playoff stats."" We're simply stating, ""Wow, Rose has played very well in this super important playoff series against the best team in the NBA."""
**BREAKING TRADE NEWS**  *OKC trades Russell Westbrook to OKC for Kyle Singler and cash considerations* 
"When has Russell Westbrook ever shown any inclination to listen to any coach trying to change his play style? As in, ever?"
"I-it's not like I want to get out of the first round or anything, baka! - Russell Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook is the only star that I can remember of recently that doesn’t work on his game to get better. His play style can be easy to plan against. He hasn’t really added anything to his game. He’s still a terrible 3 point shooter. I can think of the last 3 years and haven’t really seen any improvement game wise from him. 
Russell Westbrook is like the basketball version of Brett Farve and Lamar Jackson.
"Russell Westbrook for Kyle Singler, WHO SAYS NO?"
ruSSeLL westbrOOk
"Personally I don't hate Thunder fans, but I am actively rooting against Russell Westbrook simply because he's without question the most unlikeable star in the game right now. He's petulant, entitled, surly, rude, a showboat, a sore winner and a sore loser. There's virtually nothing about him to like unless he's playing for your team (although even then I'm guessing it must be hella conflicting for y'all).   If anyone in the NBA needs a harsh dose of humility, it's Westbrook. So I want to see him fall flat on his face over and over until he is humbled into being a decent person. If he remains an entitled ass for his whole career, then I'll root against him for his whole career. He acts like everyone owes him something, his teammates, his coach, his GM, the refs, the fans, us, everyone. And we don't. So fuck that guy, and fuck the team he plays for."
"He gets more assists, but every game I watch of the Thunder I see plenty of good passes he should make that he looks off because he sees a potential assist in trying to dump it into Adams or something, often resulting in a turnover.   And for a starting PG I'd prioritize 3 point shooting over rebounding. Especially when those rebounding stats are inflated a bit. Russ is still probably the best rebounding guard in the league, I just don't think that necessarily translates to winning basketball games because it's outweighed by his often questionable shot selection and decision making. I have nothing against Russell Westbrook, I just witness him take bad shots in big games time after time trying to carry his team."
"Yes, Jrue Holiday is a better player than Russell Westbrook."
"&gt;A player isn't actually better than another if you wouldn't rather have him on your team  That's just not true. Russell Westbrook is a better talent than Cp3 but I would much rather start my team with Cp3 because he's a better facilitor, defender, and leads to winning basketball, unlike WB. If I have a team of shooters who can space the floor like no other, I'd rather have Klay Thompson over DeRozan even though imo DeRozan is the better player. See what I mean?"
"Because just like when KD left Russ and his ball hoggery for a team with a system where they move the ball and share, PG playing in the Lakers system would let him shine more than OKC has. He'd be an actual part of a *team*, not just a bit player in The Russell Westbrook Show. In such a system his good play would actually help the team win, rather than end up having people like yourself be unaware that he's playing well because the rest of the team is stinking up the joint."
"He just walked straight to Gobert just to talk shit, which is completely very Russell Westbrook."
WB is the least rational set of initials to give Russell Westbrook. Do people actually use this? I hate everything about it
"Are the Thunders better without Russell Westbrook?  We've seen it happen with KD, John Wall, and LeBron fucking James. I can almost guarantee someone will make this thread, and if nobody does, I will."
"Russell westbrook’s stubbornness, poor shot selection, selfish style of play, poor shooting, and general lack of bbiq. I don’t blame coaching because I’m not sure there’s a single person on planet earth who can fix Westbrook "
"i dont think the city would be able to sustain a rebuild and trading away russ. the mayor named every day ""russell westbrook day""... it is just not the right place for it "
"Don't want to turn this into a Kobe thread, but this is just one thing that I wish Kobe stopped endorsing. He's the one that kept on saying ""you gotta let Westbrook be Westbrook, dont try to cage him."" He did this when Carmelo was in the MVP race a few years back too. This 'keep shooting, even when you're off' mentality has to die now. I'm convinced nothing is going to change Westbrook, no coach will get to him because it's already ingrained in his head that he's playing the right way.   edit: (kobe quote) ""You can’t just pigeon-hole him and say, ‘Oh, he needs to be John Stockton.’ He’s not John Stockton. He’s not (Chris Paul). He’s Russell. So you have to let him be him, not put him in a cage. You have to unleash him and help him understand how to be him in a way that benefits the group."""

"They’re not gonna suspend Russell Westbrook. Even though they should, they won’t because he gets supserstar treatment."
"It's totally fair to say the Melo trade was a loss for the Thunder, but the PG trade was a win for both teams. The Thunder got a skilled two way player that had a complementary skill set to Russell Westbrook that would help them make a playoff run, as opposed to Oladipo, who despite his level of play has a skill set that is almost redundant to Westbrook's and was forced to play a role he couldn't thrive in, and Sabonis, who didn't really fit the Thunder's timeline and was also forced to play as a stretch four even though that wasn't his best suited role. However these two players fit great in Indy as they are both young and because Dipo is able to be the primary ball handler and play to his strengths, and Sabonis is playing a more natural role."
"Russell ""Rooked"" Westbrook"
He seems to have a pathetic amount of hatred for Russell Westbrook.  Easy ignore.
And your first reply missed the whole point of my comment: only a fucking weirdo would rather a dumb ass rule be enforced than see Russell Westbrook play in an elimination game.
"He would be a top 3 player in the NBA if he improved his defense, focused exclusively on driving and facilitating on offense, and stopped shooting 3s. He's perfectly capable of being a good NBA defender if he didn't waste so much energy chasing meaningless rebounds, and you will never convince me that there is any scenario short of being completely wide open and in rhythm where a Westbrook 3 is the best offensive option on any possession. He's the best slasher in the entire league and he takes way too many jump shots. He's a career 31% 3pt shooter and I honestly don't even think he's THAT good. Let PG take the off the dribble 3s. He can get that shot anytime he wants and he's way better at it. NOBODY can get to the basket like Russell Westbrook. That's his thing, and he needs to do more of it."
‪Russell Westbrook is the only superstar I know that can’t carry a team. You have 2 other stars with you and are about to be bounced in the first round. Keep your triple doubles. Doesn’t mean anything if you don’t have playoff success 
&gt; anyone can break down film  apparently except for Russell Westbrook
"I feel like at this point it's been so long since the Thunder big 3 broke up that you can get a gauge on who became who. Like for example  I feel like they're the Yardbirds of the NBA because the Yardbirds had three legendary guitarists at one point or another in their history. If I had to compare them I'd say:  Kevin Durant- Eric Clapton (Most successful one, arguably the most talented.)  James Harden- Jimmy Page (Joined up with one of the best PGs of all time just like Page joined up with one of the best singers)  Russell Westbrook- Jeff Beck (Out of the three they're both the most exciting ones and they love being in control musically or basketball-wise)"
There is nothing more naive than saying Westbrook doesn’t dictate how his teams play.   You think Billy Donovan wants Russ to make an entry pass and then go stand at half court? Fuck no. What about Russ forcing up a bad shot or passing to a teammate and making him force a bad shot? Fuck no  The thunder are incompetent and it is obviously because Russell doesn’t know how to play as the best player.   Westbrook has immense influence on that offense and it’s trash because he plays like a psycho and dominates the ball more than anyone in the nba
"Thanks a lot for the link! Much appreciate it.  I think the problem with Melo is that he is not that athletic anymore. In the Thunder offensive system, he has to generate all his shots via iso situations. That's the main problem with OKC, they don't move the ball enough to generate optimal situations for their shooters. And for that, I think Russell Westbrook is to blame. He just doesn't contribute without the ball in his hands.  He is the main reason the Jazz are steamrolling the Thunder. Of course, coach Billy Donovan has a major role in this, but it looks like coaches are afraid of Westbrook."
" It really broke down in that series against Golden State. For four or five games, Donovan's vision was executed the way he saw fit. KD and WB were co-existing, sharing the ball, playing D, looking like the fully realised OKC people had expected them to be for years.  Then... adversity hit. GS won a few, and Russell stopped believing. He regressed to all his worst instincts. Hero ball, dribbling to about 8 or 9 on the shot clock, or rushing up and throwing up a brick with 18 left on the clock...  You could see KD begging for the ball. You could see it slowly dawning on him that things would never change. That this was as close as they would ever get with Westbrook running the show. He left, WB reverted fully back to his stat stuffing form, and Billy lost control of the team. Without a shake up, they'll just go through the motions every year; 50ish wins, great stats for WB, pose a threat to no one in the playoffs.  It's a damn shame. Adams is an amazing dude. Would love to see him in Celtics green "

"Well, it's not like it's all Sam Presti's fault. He did have a great off-season, and everyone knew the risks. Also this was most likely done to reassure Management's got Brodie's back and making him sign into a Max extension, so at least your future isn't totally lost for the next few years.   It's unfortunate that Melo was injured and PG had droughts of offense, along with Brodie's own mishaps. It's similar to what happened with the Nets and 2012-13 Lakers. Lakers had to deal with the Nash injury and Dwight not being used to a fast paced system, with it ending up Kobe's career, whereas the Nets were just too old and past their primes to be dominating the league (but they had some hope with Joe Johnson and Paul Pierce being clutch at times). It's all about the risks. The good thing to know is that Russell Westbrook is in Thunder's future, and the Thunder can still build up from that."
"""I stand by nothing""  -Russell Westbrook"
"I’m undecided on Bamba but I think Trae’s second half of the season is a better indicator of the player he is than the great first half he had.   I watched a lot of B12 CBB this year and he was playing awful in conference play especially against competitive teams. Once the gameplan was out on him, he was shut down. I remember one game where the first possession he immediately shot a 3 and had it swatted and played awful the rest of the game.   I’d describe it as the worst version of Russell Westbrook. He’d regularly drive wildly and lose the ball, he shot under 40% from the field and 32% from 3, routinely had his shot blocked, and yeah he would make deep step back shots, but I’d chalk that up to the pure volume he’d take. His assist to TO ratio was nearly even too. Almost 7 TOs a game is abysmal.   Those are just his conference averages, and they were getting worse and worse over the course of conference play. In February he played 8 games and shot 24% from 3 and just 36% from the field. In away games over the whole year, he shot 34% from the field, which is awful.   On top of all of his offensive struggles, he played awful defense, often times gambling for a steal and overplaying his man. He also was easily overpowered by stronger guards.   Overall I think the best basketball Trae Young has ever played was that 15 game stretch to open up the season. After that he turned into a really bad high volume shooter who rarely involved his teammates. Again my closest comparison to him would be the bad side of Westbrook. He could prove me wrong, but I think he’ll be a big bust. "
No Russell Westbrook will not win a title as the best player/first option on his team until or unless he adds something new to his game

Yeah it’s pretty scary if your the Rockets with a 15 point lead knowing Donovan Mitchell could go off at any moment for 20. If Russell Westbrook is having a bad game you’re still scared he might explode for 20.

"This feels like a Russell Westbrook vs CP3 argument. If I’m a lottery team, give me the primary scoring option (Nash/Westbrook), but if I already have another elite scorer who isn’t thrive in transition, give me the better defender and facilitator.   That being said, Nash would absolutely kill it on this Rockets team. I think they might be able to beat the Warriors with prime Nash over CP3. "

I’m speaking in terms of a thread a few days ago ranking the top players in the league.  Russell Westbrook is also valued more highly according to basically every statistical analysis ever compiled on the matter. There’s not a major publication that ranks CP above Westbrook. Westbrook produces way more for only $3m more a year.
If counting stats are the criteria then Oscar Robertson is the GOAT Point Guard and Russell Westbrook is currently the best Point Guard in the league.
Russell Westbrook sits... on his couch and watches the second round 
"I was in the the same high school league as Russell Westbrook, and yes, his team was average by Southern California standards, his junior year at least. Just looked up Leuzinger's record his Junior year because you had me curious, they were 12-13. And  they didn't have a super difficult schedule. So yes, they were about average.   I was at work and typing fast, I actually meant spacial coordination, not depth perception. A different reddit user actually messaged me about mistakenly saying depth perception."
Mostly I miss him because Silver is actually pretty tall so it doesn’t look weird when he’s on stage at the draft. Stern was out there making Russell Westbrook look like Dwight Howard.
what a combo player that'd be. holy shit.  insane offensive output of Westbrook with the insane defense and rebounding of Russell.
Bill Russell Westbrook
"Men have better depth perception than women, this is a fact. If you want to get triggered by biological differences between men and women go for it I guess.   And no they would not get smoked, considering a middle of the road high school team would be bigger, faster, stronger. Maybe my definition of an average high school basketball team is a little different than yours. I am comparing to average teams in the LA area 10 years ago. Russell Westbrook played for a pretty average Leuzinger High team, for context. "

"You don't get it, this isnt about talent or ability to win games. It's about the kind of person Russell is. He's incredibly low BBIQ at times, but he's a gladiator. He won't go down without going supernova first. If I'm getting gunned down you better believe I'm gonna empty my clip first. That's Russell westbrook, and history has shown it is not Durant"
"Know yourself, know your worth Kevin. Kevin knows that he's not a leader of men like Russell Westbrook, which is why he had to join a team ready-made for a championship. Deep down he is jealous of many traits that Russell has- the DGAF attitude and the supreme confidence- and his prickly new media persona is simply his way of overcompensating for playing the nice guy role for many years. You were never true to yourself all those years and you still aren't Kevin. You know you are not a natural leader and you had to go to a place where ball movement was paramount and the talent was already top level. You knew that you wouldnt have to carry at Golden State.  Let's go back to free agency, why didn't Kevin go to Washington, where there was a winning structure in place? If Kevin had signed to play with John Wall and Brad Beal, the assumption for fans and the media would have been that he was following in Lebron's footsteps and trying to win one for his hometown team. But Kevin knows that he couldn't stand the expectation and the criticisms that would possibly come with failing as the alpha male. It's just not a part of who he is. The GS move was probably the best indication of Kevin acknowledging who he truly is.  We all know youre a nice guy and a good person who took the easy road because you're not a leader at heart. So just go get rings and understand that as a man you have to make peace with the decisions you've made and move forward with your career. Or you'll never find happiness and satisfaction in life, and you'll be arguing on burner accounts well after retirement"
[Can] the Thunder trade Russell Westbrook? That contract is no joke.
This is why I hate people's infatuations with numbers that end in 0 or 5. So stupid. They had no incentive to win that game. Now Casey is gonna get canned for it and deservedly so. Glad Russell Westbrook is sitting at home too after he captured his precious double digits.

Russell Westbrook is more enjoyable to watch than both those guys combined. Plus he wins more than them so that negates your points.
"[Pompey] ~~Kevin Durant~~ Michael Rubin tells me it was a ""total accident"" that he liked a comment on Instagram about ~~Russell Westbrook~~ Brett Brown. Was just an honest mistake."
Yes. Because win shares is the end all be all of stats.  KAT is equal to LBJ both had 14 WS this year. Russell Westbrook is worse than both by a fair margin. Andre Drummond is the 10th best player in the league.
"Well, for just a single example, he was number 10 in Bill Simmons' basketball book which came out in 2010. And Bill Simmons fucking hates Russell Westbrook now, so I don't think it had anything to do with a triple-double fetish."

"Russell Westbrook: Wei Dude —&gt; 威少 Wei Shao This means Young We(stbrook) When Russ &amp; KD were in both OKC, we call them “two youths of Thunder”.  Kobe Bryant: Snail Shell 蜗壳 (wo ke) This is similar to the pronunciation of “My Kobe” in Mandarin  Charles Barkley: The Flying Pig  Michael Jordan: Gang Boss 帮主 Its similar to GOAT, as the leader of NBA.  Giannis Antetokounmpo: Letters Bro 字母哥 Cos his last name is literally a bunch of letters to Chinese fans.  Dirk Nowitzki: The German Panzer Tank 德国战车 They also use this nickname for German football team.  Scottie Pippen: Second Best Under Heaven Klay Thompson: The Buddha 佛祖 Because his haircut looks like Buddha , and he always makes the clutch shot. Some says he has no expression   Shaquille O'Neal: The Giant Shark  Kevin Durant: Schoolbag Du 书包杜 Back in time, KD wore backpack a lot and they give him this nickname. "
"I know it'll be an unpopular opinion, but I think Russ will be better in his 30s than his 20s when his athleticism goes a bit. Not enough to totally fuck him up, but just enough to force him to think about the game more. Russ by all accounts (even Zach Lowe said it), is a smarter PG than people give him credit for, but he's so confident in his athleticism he constantly thinks ""I can do this (whether it be get to an impossible steal or get to the rim and finish over a DPOTY guy contesting)"". Once he slows down and just uses his mind, he'll stop being a 28-11-10 and start being a 21-12-5 but that can actually control the game. As someone who's played PG all his life (obviously not at nearly the same level as Westbrook), one of the most important parts of playing the position is using gears of speed instead of just slow and fast. Russ still thinks he can just beat people with slow to fast and that's the source of most of his problems.      The only change OKC needs is a coach. Going from Scott Brooks to college Scott Brooks doesn't count. Listening to Presti's press conference, it's clear that he hired Donovan because of his personality and the way he represents the team in terms of being a mild-mannered, straight up good guy. That also describes Scott Brooks to a t. The problem is that is the worse kind of coach you can give Russell Westbrook. Give him to Pat Riley and you'll get something entirely different. Matter of fact, trade him to the Heat and see how different all of this looks."

"Kyle Anderson - 人类蠕动精华 ""Human Peristalsis"" - Because he plays so slowly  Boogie Cousins - 表妹 ""Younger Female Cousin"" - They directly translated his last name into Chinese, but went with the most effeminate version possible.  Gordon Hayward is 九妹 (""The Ninth Sister"") since he was the 9th pick in the draft.  Pau Gasol is 家嫂 (jia sao, ""Sister-in-Law"") since it sounds a bit like ""Gasol."" - Sometimes the Chinese give people feminized nicknames if they think they are too soft or do not conform to masculine stereotypes.  Andre Miller - 莫文蔚 ""Karen Mok"" - Because people think he looks like Hong Kong actress and pop star Karen Mok  Tristan Thompson - 八贤王 ""The King of Eights"" - Thompson held out of training camp in 2015 and received a contract worth more than 80 million, despite averaging only 8 points and 8 rebounds in 2014-2015. ""The King of Eights"" was a nickname for several historical Chinese rulers.  Anthony Davis - 浓眉 ""The Thick Brow""  Hakeem Olajuwon was known as ""The Dream"" in English, but this got upgraded to 大夢 (""The Big Dream"") in Chinese.  Tim Duncan - 石佛 ""The Stone Buddha"" - Due to his perceived unemotional nature  Joel Embiid - 大帝 ""The Great One"" - ""Da di,"" meaning ""great emperor"" is the title used in Chinese for rulers who are called ""the Great,"" as in ""Alexander the Great""  Steve Nash - 风之子 ""Son of the Wind"" - *likely because of his hair whipping around like the wind*  Stephon Marbury - 马政委 ""Marburyist Political Commissar"" - This is a pun on ""Marxist Political Commissar,"" since in Chinese both ""Marbury"" and ""Marx"" are spelled with the same first character ""ma"" (""horse"").  Kevin Garnett - 狼王 ""King of the Wolves"" - Leftover from his time with the Minnesota Timberwolves  Dwyane Wade - 典韋 ""Dian Wei"" - Dian Wei was a mighty warrior from the ancient Three Kingdoms Period who was a loyal sidekick of the general Cao Cao. He famously died covering for Cao Cao's retreat when they were ambushed by a rebel army. His name also sounds like ""Dwyane Wade.""  Scottie Pippen - 天下第二人 ""Second Best Under Heaven""  James Harden - 大胡子 ""The Big Beard""  Paul Pierce - 真理 ""The Truth""  Allen Iverson - 答案 ""The Answer""  Gary Patyon - 手套 ""The Glove""  Kawhi Leonard - 可愛 - means ""cute"" but sounds like ""Kawhi""  Dr. J - got turned into J博士 (""J, Ph.D."")  Steve Francis's nickname ""The Franchise"" was badly translated into 特权 (""Special Rights"")  Dirk Nowitzki is 德国战车, ""The German Panzer Tank""  Tony Parker is 法国小跑车, ""The Little French Sports Car""  Michael Jordon - 帮主 ""Gang Boss"" - Jordan's ordinary name in Chinese is 乔丹 (qiao dan), but Qiao is also the surname of Qiao Feng, the leader of the ""Beggars' Sect"" in popular wuxia martial arts novels, often known simply as ""Gang Boss Qiao"" (乔帮主).  Charles Barkley - 飞猪 ""The Flying Pig""  Kevin Durant - 书包杜 ""Schoolbag Du"" - Because he used to often wear a backpack to press conferences (""Du"" is short for ""Durant"")  Carmelo Anthony - 甜瓜 ""Melon"" - Because his English nickname ""Melo"" sounds like the English word ""melon"" which they then translated into Chinese (pronounced tian gua).  Shaquille O'Neal - 大鲨鱼 ""The Giant Shark"" - Derives from the fact that the first sound in the Chinese word for ""shark"" (shayu) sounds like the first sound in ""Shaquille."" Toward the end of his career, he was frequently called ""O'Fat"" (奥胖) - a play on ""O'Neal.""  Manu Ginobili - 妖刀 ""The Demon Blade"" - Perhaps the coolest nickname of them all, Ginobili earned this moniker for his ability to slash to the hoop using tricky footwork like the Eurostep.  Kobe Bryant - 蜗壳 ""Snail Shell"" - Kobe is ""Snail Shell"" because it rhymes with ""My [guy] Kobe."" When he was young they called him 小飞侠 or “Peter Pan” (literally ""Little Flying Warrior"") and at the end he became 唠嗑 (“Chatterbox, Gossip""), which rhymes with ""Old Kobe.""  Giannis Antetokounmpo - 字母哥 ""Letters Bro"" - Because his last name has...so...many...letters!  Steph Curry - 库昊 ""fucks the sky"" - This is an extremely elaborate pun. One of Curry's phonetic names is 库里 (ku li) and the second character is a combination of the characters 日 (""sun"") and 土 (""ground""). But 日 is also slang for ""fuck."" Given Curry's penchant for launching shots into the sky, Chinese netizens apparently felt it would be more apropos to name him ""fucks the sky"" instead of ""fucks the ground,"" so they replaced ""earth"" (土) with ""sky"" (天) in the second character. Other common nicknames for Steph Curry include ""Sprout God"" (萌神) and ""The Elementary School Student"" (小学生), both playing on his diminutive stature.   Russell Westbrook - 威少 ""Wei Dude"" - Russ's phonetic name in Chinese (衛斯特布魯克 wei si te bu lu ke) is really long so they shortened it to ""Wei Dude."" They also upgraded the ""wei"" from ""guarding"" (衛) to ""dominating"" (威).  Lebron James - 小皇帝 ""The Little Emperor"" - A play on the English ""King James"" that is also a slang term for a ""spoiled only child"" under China's ""One Child Policy""Used more when Lebron was young but now mostly by Lebron haters. His fans prefer 詹皇 (Zhan Wang or ""King James"").  "

"ok, let me actually read this one  full quote:  &gt;“There’s an increasing number of people around the League who think the Thunder should look at trading [Russell] Westbrook.  &gt;“To be clear, not a report. Not Thunder sources think they should do this.  &gt;“Just in spitballing ideas with teams around the League, there’s a number of people who have heard, ‘It’s time for something to change here.’”  &gt;My reaction is (Zach Lowe) that no one should touch that contract with a 10 foot pole"
Some More:   Lebron the guy who attends networking events but only to pitch their business venture idea and not interested in actually getting to know the other dude.  Steven Adams: works at PetCo and owns several large pets that you think are dogs but might actually be wolves.  Russell Westbrook: Unpaid intern who comes in on weekends.
Russell Westbrook- In anger management classes
"I understand the frustration there, but which coach in the world would have more authority than MVP Russell Westbrook? Or a step further, more authority than 2 time college champ Billy Donovan? As much as I love some of these rising assistants, they don't have juice like that."
"He had the reputation for being a choke artist. And he didn't choke on the big stage in 2011?? Dude disappeared. Jordan has never disappeared.   Retardedness isn't a word. I laughed at your usage of the word. And you're not establishing your own bs facts based off your own bias? You're not biased at all here?  Pippen is the greatest perimeter defender *ever*? Metrics? Stats? Evidence? There's another claim you've made and established as fact with no proof.   &gt;You can’t ask someone to prove claims and then say things like Lebron is a choke artist without any evidence.    I'm just following your logic of establishing my own facts. Just make a claim that's either unquantifiable or just blurt something out with no backing. You gotta back up your claims man.    &gt;Also Pippen avg more rebounds and assists, and is the best perimeter defender ever... I shouldn’t have to point out obvious shit   Also here's another problem with your logic: so bc Pippen averaged more assists and rebounds than Jordan during that time, you're saying Pippen is a better player in passing and rebounding and then is also a better overall player than Jordan.   Well Russell Westbrook averages both more assists and rebounds than Lebron James. He has for two consistent seasons now. According to your logic, I guess that means WB is better than Lebron.   Edit: I honestly have no horse in this race. I respect and admire both players. I've just seen both play and I see Jordan as the better player in that there was nothing you could do to stop Jordan. He was unguardable. "

"1) He is a better shooter today. As he gets older, he will likely play more and more off ball. Simmons picks up the slack here.   2) Embiid is shooting 33% over his career and has had a significantly worse shooting year compared to last year.  He has a nice form, and his 78% free throw shooting over his career shows he is a better shooter than his % suggests. This is also his first off-season fully healthy and shooting will likely be one of the main targets.   3) Ben Simmons has a clear target on things he should improve on. If Blake Griffin, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, Russell Westbrook, have all become decent shooters, why wouldn't Ben?    4) The Sixers have a young core which is going to progress. They would likely be the best defensive team in the league with LeBron. They will get better as he gets older. A historic franchise that hasn't been relevant in a long time. What team presents him with a better opportunity in terms of young talent and narrative? "
Russell Westbrook turns 30 next season.   Also Terry Rozier is 5 years older than Fultz (24 and 19).
Harden is a shit player who needs Jedi mind tricks to fool the refs into giving him calls. Period. Stop circlejerking over this fraud.    Edit: lol downvoted by salty Rockets fans who are just jealous of how much better Russell Westbrook is without resorting to cheap tricks and fraud play
"LeBron, Kevin Love, Kyrie, Al Horford, Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall, Bradley Beal,  Giannis, Kemba Walker, Embiid, Blake Griffin, Drummond, Oladipo, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Steven Adams, Paul George, LaMarcus Aldridge, Chris Paul, James Harden, Karl Anthony-Towns, Jimmy Butler, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Rudy Gobert, Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Devin Booker.   That's over 30+ definitively better right here and I could list 15 more that would be controversial."
"Imagine five 6'8"" 250lb Russell Westbrooks running downcourt on the fast break. Oh you think Westbrook is trying to destroy the rim now?! Give him 4"" and 50lbs more and multiply that by 5. Now, put a guy 4"" shorter than him.   I'll take 5 Lebron sized Westbrooks"
"Harden is a great player in almost every aspect of the game.      He's also great at ""manufacturing fouls"" and does it a **ton**.      Rank|Player|FFA 2017-2018 season :--|:--:|--:    1.|	James Harden |	727 2.|	Giannis Antetokounmpo |	641 3.|	Anthony Davis |	598 4.|	Dwight Howard |	582 5.|	Russell Westbrook |	566 6.|	DeMar DeRozan |	559 7.|	Damian Lillard |	538 8.|	LeBron James |	531 9.|	Lou Williams |	491 10.|	Joel Embiid |	467 11.|	Julius Randle |	425 12.|Jimmy Butler |	425 13.|	Kemba Walker|	420 14.|	Paul George |	412 15.|	Kevin Durant |	404 16.|	Karl-Anthony Towns |	402 17.|	LaMarcus Aldridge |	399 18.|	Andre Drummond |	395 19.|	DeMarcus Cousins |	394 20.|	Bradley Beal |	368      From what I can tell, he has *earned* his reputation. One of his most exceptional skills just happens to be really annoying. Slow-mo replays have caught him red handed enough, that people are ready to believe that he's guilty every time... because he's guilty so much of the time.            "
Going to try this with my GF tomorrow. Will try to remember to update this. She played basketball in High school but really doesn't care enough to watch it.  Edit:   Current players:  LeBron   Steph curry   James harden   Russell Westbrook   Really tall dude with a tiny wife (she meant Boban)  KD  Snake guy (Dwight Howard)  Steven Adams     Former players:  Shaq  Michel Jordan   Reggie Miller   Magic   Larry Bird   Kobe  Charles Barkley     She did much worse than I anticipated. Don't know how much longer this relationship will last.
"&gt; Curry, Harden, Paul, Westbrook, Wall, Lillard, Irving, Conley, Kemba, Lowry  If anything, you're showing me how weak of a list this is.  &gt;Rank them top to bottom and I think the current lot of points CRUSHES the 1996 guys.  If the NBA is so great and stuff why do we need super teams then? Why do so many players for them now?  &gt;Which is why you rank Bill Russell #1 all time, right?  Top 10.  Lebron, top 15, but if he bails on the Cavs again, top 50.  There's no excuse for a 3-5 Finals record. If he beats the Rockets then top 5."
"&gt; The NBA is the weakest its been in decades and its due to super teams.  Nah, the talent pool is deeper than it's ever been.  Let's take point guards, for example.  Right now you have Curry, Harden, Paul, Westbrook, Wall, Lillard, Irving, Conley, Kemba, Lowry.  Whoever the worst guy there, let's call him the 10th best point in the NBA.  Now let's go back to 1996.  Who are the best pointguards?   Payton, Stockton, Hardaway (Tim + Penny), KJ, van Exel, Abdul-Rauf, Mookie ... I can't even get to ten good point guards.   I guess Kidd if you're scraping for rookies (but he wasn't that good then, and if you're doing that then players like Ben Simmons come online for the current group).  Rank them top to bottom and I think the current lot of points CRUSHES the 1996 guys.  &gt; If Lebron is the best, he'd be the best.  Which is why you rank Bill Russell #1 all time, right?  "
"Russell Westbrook: one NBA Finals appearance, four Western Conference Finals appearances  Chris Paul: no NBA Finals appearances, no Western Conference Finals appearances (for now)"
"""Stop asking for the ball bitch"" - Russell Westbrook"
I went and looked on basketball reference. The FTAs match-up so I'm positive I'm looking at the right time frame.   Anyways this is games played by each player in the same period  James Harden: 467  Russell Westbrook: 436  Demar DeRozan: 453  Demarcus Cousins: 390 (although he didn't start 1 game if that matters)  LeBron James: 454  So yeah you're right. Although there is 0 chance any of these guys matched Harden's free throw attempts even if they played the same number of games.
Russell Westbrook
"https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2018/04/30/commentary-its-sad-but-russell-westbrook-is-right-about-some-jazz-fans/  Oh man, I’m really sorry that I couldn’t find one from a publication that isn’t so obviously biased against the jazz.... oh wait  And that’s just the first one I found after googling. Lemme know if you’d like another!"
"1\) Yeah that's fair. I didnt phrase it very well what I meant to get at is you have to have a lineup where there is nobody GSW can help off. If that's DeAndre Jordan instead of a 3 point shooter then sure no problem  2\) Id also say the goal if you play 5 out is 5 guys who are capable of shooting 3s not necessarily 5 guys who always park out on the 3 point line. This does bring up two things though I would say  a\) You have to be very very caerful about how all you go on the offensive boards against a team like GSW who does what they do in transition.  b\) This was the lineup that killed GSW in 2016: Ibaka/Durant as the front line  [http://nbawowy.com/n7iwtzdqgx#/n7iwtzdqgx](http://nbawowy.com/n7iwtzdqgx#/n7iwtzdqgx)  Note their offensive rebounding rate was only 24&amp;#37; which in 2016 was an average rate. Where they did their damage was they got 80&amp;#37; of defensive boards which is what you need.  [http://nbawowy.com/yb5qchvdamr](http://nbawowy.com/yb5qchvdamr)  When Adams was on teh court they got tons of offensive rebounds.......but their defense also wasnt great those minutes that series. And hence only a \+2 net rating. Again the idea of just ""how much is too much for crashing the offensive boards when it comes to getting back on D?""   Where the market inefficiency is comes to wings and guard rebounding. That's really where OKC sustained it's advantage vs GSW: Andre Roberson and Russell Westbrook types who are quality rebounders for guards. Rebounding isnt just a big proposition.......all 5 guys are what matter to sustaining that edge."
Or he scores 40 because he has to due to teammates not scoring. Russell Westbrook syndrome.
"Huh, I didn't know an awful team could beat Russell Westbrook in the playoffs"
I think its what we call the russell westbrook
Put Russell Westbrook on his team and it becomes a lot easier.
Russell Westbrook and Melo.
Russell Westbrook would do his press conferences in that second one 
"Unless your name is Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, Kawhi Leonard, Shane Larkin.. don’t even bother. "
"MJ was like a Kawhi leanord 2 way player, with a russell westbrook type motor.  Also MJ was more skilled than either of them. If russ can average a 30pt triple double, imagine what MJ could do."
"I'll take a stab at explaining it - LeBron will always be the most valuable player in the playoffs, but he regularly will not be the most valuable player during the regular season. If you look at win shares and value over replacement player, LeBron doesn't always top the charts.   * 2008-2009 LeBron Jame MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2009-2010 LeBron James MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2010-2011 Derrick Rose MVP: ....LeBron led the league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2011-2012 LeBron James MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2012-2013 LeBron James MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2013-2014 Kevin Durrant MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2014-2015 Steph Curry MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2015-2016 Steph Curry MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2016-2017 Russell Westbrook MVP: Led league in value over replacement player. (Durrant led the league in win shares per 48).  Notice a trend? If you provide more value than the next closest player in the league you pretty much get Most *VALUABLE* Player. The only exceptions to that rule in the last 10 years are Kobe Bryant in 2007-2008 mostly due to name recognition and the Lakers receiving the #1 seed in the West. And Derrick Rose in 2010-2011 mostly due to voter fatigue.   In all reality, I think the only years LeBron deserved MVP over the winner was in '07-'08 and '10-'11. But Durrant, Curry, and Westbrook definitely put the work in during the regular season to earn that honor; whereas, LeBron just turns it on in the post season.  Edit: Formatting "
"He would have beaten Russell Westbrook last year, Curry in 2016, and maybe KD in 2014. That would give him 7 out of the last 8 which is a more accurate depiction of his domination of the ""best player in the world"" discussion for that time."
"I think this is an unpopular opinion but I don't think that Rondo had such a great game against the Warriors. Yes, the assists are great, but you had to watch the game to realize that the Warriors just were very sloppy with rotations. To me it seemed like they just wanted to concede game 3. I expect them to be much more focused for game 4.  Also, he was basically the only one passing so it's obvious that he was going to get the most assists. The Warriors are impressive when they get 30 assists. They don't need a single point guard to get all of them, as long as everybody moves the ball, and Curry, Durant, Draymond each get 8 assists.  To me it's the same as Russell Westbrook getting 20 rebounds. That sounds great, but it doesn't mean he had a monster game fighting all rebounds. It sounds like his teammates just allow him to get most rebounds uncontested."
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there. Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy."" My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."

You implied that people don’t hate Draymond for a real reason. But people don’t like him because he plays reckless and definitely jeopardizes players health.  [7 times he kicked people](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/12/draymond-green-kicks-james-harden-warriors-rockets)   [here he is tripping a player](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/05/draymond-green-enes-kanter-russell-westbrook-trips-intentional-or-not-thunder-warriors)   Acting like Draymond is misunderstood and hating Rondo is obviously hypocritical

"Yes and it would be warranted, because Russell only plays good defense in a fraction of games each season. KD is known for being good on defense, so he gets to hold other guys accountable. Westbrook OTOH is not a good defender, so if he yaps after someone makes a mistake, it looks hypocritical."

"What? That is not why it’s used.  I quote OKC GM here “No team ever loses eight players in a game, via foul or injury, but even if that was the case, that’s a reason to expand the active list, not restrict it with required inactives.” Your point about injuries literally supports the opposite of what your saying. Injuries and having to cut players is not the reason they use it since it actually restricts those things even more.   Quote from OKC GM:  “I have no idea why the dress-only-13 was ever implemented. It makes no sense. It’s not a money saver. The players all travel on road trips anyway. It’s not a bench-space saver. The players all sit on the bench. Most, like the Thunder, have the players sit on the front row, though I’ve seen a few teams put their inactives on the second row. It can’t be a computer-program saver. If the software only allows 13 players to be registered for stat-keeping, switch out the computer program. It can’t be a competitive balance saver. No team ever loses eight players in a game, via foul or injury, but even if that was the case, that’s a reason to expand the active list, not restrict it. It can’t be a fashion statement. It’s interesting to see what NBA players wear on the bench, but it’s not like Russell Westbrook, James Harden or Serge Ibaka are being deactivated. It makes no sense”"
"No you were just reasonable instead of being a dumb pile-on cunt.  A team with Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, and a great bench lost badly in the first round to a team nobody thought would make the playoffs and nobody says shit about it.  The pettiness people still have about KD is so ridiculously offputting."
"""Best player"" is very subjective so I'm going off yahoo player rankings for this season. It's worth noting that this team would also be taking players and coaches from other contenders, thus weakening our opponents.  PG: Devin Booker. SG: Klay Thompson. SF: Khris Middleton. PF: Draymond Green. C: Al Horford.   Bench: Donovan Mitchell.  Ben Simmons. Gary Harris. Marc Gasol. CJ McCollum.  JJ Reddick. Rudy Gobert. Jayson Tatum. Joel Embiid. Tobias Harris. Jaylen Brown.

Assistant Coachs: Brad Stevens and Steve Kerr.  GM: Me obviously."
"Imo best passers: 1. Wall, 2. Paul, 3. Rondo, 4. LeBron, 5. Harden, 6. Simmons, 7. Westbrook, 8. Lowry, 9. Lonzo, 10. Rubio, 11. Teague, 12. Lillard, 13. Curry, 14. Jokic, 15. Russell, 16. Holiday, 17. Lin, 18. Kemba, 19. Schroder, 20. "
"Draymond is versatile, he's an incredible switching small ball center. That is not the same as a shutdown wing defender.  Jordan got up to 216 post baseball. Look at his body post baseball vs before. He came into the league like 190, was still a 195-200 pound high flyer for most of the Pistons serieses, maybe like 205-210 by 91 when they won.  There was a post about 278 pound Miami LeBron just a few months ago. Look it up. Malone and Hakeem and David Robinson were smaller cuz they didn't have access to the 30 years of advances in weight training and nutritional science that LeBron does.  You are delusional. Calling Klay and Durant and Jayson Tatum athletic compared to LeBron, but guys like DJ, Dumars, Rodman frail compared to young Jordan. Insisting Jordan had 30 pounds on defenders and LeBron doesn't.  Young Jordan was like Russell Westbrook, not some 220 pound Mark Jackson posting up John Stocktons. He became a back you down, turnaround guy in the second threepeat.  Moncrief was a 2-time DPOY, as was Rodman. Payton won one too. Jordan faced them and tons of All Defense guys, including athletic muscular ones his size like Moncrief and DJ.  Yes the rules changed, but not from day one, when Jordan was still giving everyone 35/7/7 by himself. And the rule changes have been more than offset by the proliferation of the 3 ball spacing the shit out of the court, plus the pace and small ball movements. We are living in an unprecedented offensive stat explosion, yet you think Jordan was the one who had it easier?"
What does it take to make a good team for Russell Westbrook? Just upgrade his roster
PG: Russell Westbrook  Wings: Paul George and two of Avery Bradley / Danny Green / PJ Tucker / Robert Covington / Josh Richardson / Tony Snell  C: Steven Adams
"That's not a correct question. The right one has to be: ""Can you build a Championship Level Team Around Russell Westbrook without it exploding at the seams because of him?"""
"&gt; When the 6-foot-10 point guard was told the Rookie of the Year race appears to be a two-man show, he buried his head down and proceeded to chuckle. Asked what rookies have caught his attention this year, he didn't mince words. ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  "
"Russell Westbrook  Klay Thompson  Joe Ingles Draymond Green Steven Adams  Hey, look, there's a team that gives Russ shooters to pass to and spacing for him to drive, none of them demanding the ball, and all playing great defense. Isn't even that unrealistic for them to have put this team together, if they'd made a few different decisions in the past."
Why...I like the guy but him and Russell aren't working. You can say it's Russell's fault all you want but it's not like we are trading a talent like Westbrook. So we have to accommodate around him.
Thanks Russell Westbrook. 
"That although i would rather have curry on my team if filled with other stars (better spacing, not too ball dominant, can score with only catch and shoot if need be), I personally think Russell Westbrook is better and its not close either. What Westbrook did during the 16-17 season with not just the triple doubles, but WINNING 50+ GAMES WITH SCRUBS was incredible. I think only lebron and jordan are the other guys that can win that many games with so many sucky players. Steph would never be able.   Give me the downvotes you turds."
1- PJ Tucker   2- Joe Ingles   3- Russell Westbrook   4- Sabonis   5- Marcus Morris   6- Marcus Smart   7- Jaylen Brown   8- JJ Reddick   9- Khris Middleton   10 - LaMarcus Aldridge 
"My top 5:   1. Lebron James-Carried a mediocre Cavs team to the Finals. He was just dominant as always in his 15th season 2. Jayson Tatum- The Celtics have a star and now have to figure out how to play him, Brown and Hayward 3. Jrue Holiday- Torched the Blazers and had some great games against the Warriors. Also, he realized his calling as a shooting guard  4.Rajon Rondo-He really took off in the playoffs and showed how valuable he can be 5. Anthony Davis-Disrupted the Blazers offense and got his first playoff series win. When healthy, solidified his standing as the 3rd best player   Disappointments in the playoffs:  1. Russell Westbrook  2. The entire Toronto Raptors team 3. The entire Portland Trailblazers team 4. Karl Anthony Towns 5. The entire Washington Wizards team"

Remember when Kobe actually did this with Westbrook and Durant?    Maybe we should blame Kobe for the Warriors.  http://www.lakersnation.com/kobe-bryant-tried-to-get-a-competitive-edge-over-russell-westbrook-kevin-durant/2015/12/10/
Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant Russell Westbrook

Russell Westbrook never wins a ring.

Do Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook doesn't get tired
"DeMarcus Cousins can be a prominent player on a championship team, the way the Rockets play is boring and is the only thing going on that actually could lead to ruining basketball, Andrew Wiggins is a bust, Russell Westbrook is impossible to play with, Kawhi will be a Spur next year, and uhhhhh.....FUCK THE CELTICS "
Russell Westbrook 
"Russell Westbrook is an overrated NBA player. I don't believe there is a ""right"" way to play basketball, but I do believe he plays it the wrong way. "
"&gt; The Warriors are Deebo from Friday. In particular, Deebo before he caught the brick to the face. Golden State, in the Kevin Durant era, has yet to catch a brick to the face. The Warriors have dominated basketball since the 2014-15 season with a gluttonous display of ball sharing, offensive onslaughts and free-agent acquisitions that have crippled an entire league.  &gt; The fact remains, though, the Warriors are on the brink of having that invincibility shattered. It’s Golden State’s third Game 7 in this era. The first two? A victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder, led then by Durant and Russell Westbrook. And a dramatic Game 7 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals. Both of the games were in Oakland. The level of difficulty increases tenfold on the road. The rims are a little stiffer. The lights a lot brighter. The crowd is bloodthirsty."
Russell Westbrook is an absolute dog but will never win a ring. 
"They should trade Russell Westbrook to Houston, so Russell plays second scorer to Harden."
Hello Russell Westbrook
"Kevin Durant, second best player in the league, is better than Russell Westbrook. Hot take here."
"""You gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers!"" - Russell Westbrook"
as a rockets fan this is so true. I'm not saying the refs were great. I thought they gave kevin durant way too many gifts in the 2nd but the rockets blew that game in the 3rd.  Harden went full russell westbrook and stopped trusting his teammates. He's supposed to be smarter than Westbrook. I think he had like 10 straight possessions with no pass.
"Colin Cowherd tomorrow:  ""KD is a 7'0 version of Russell Westbrook."""
What the NBA doesn't want you to know is that Russell Westbrook isn't even a top 50 player
Russell Westbrook Ahahahahag
"I'm almost 24 - so I'm not old at all - but I feel like a lot of this sub didn't live through the impossible to watch era of high scoring low efficiency ball hogs in the early-mid 2000s.  Even in that incredibly selfish era, Russell Westbrook is still worse than all of those guys...by far."
Fun fact: Russell Westbrook is better than AI at every aspect of the game
"Player  Russell Westbrook  Michael Jordan*  LeBron James  David Robinson*  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar*  Julius Erving*  Chris Paul  Stephen Curry  Kevin Garnett  Dwyane Wade  Shaquille O'Neal*  Charles Barkley*  James Harden  Larry Bird*  Tracy McGrady*  Magic Johnson*  Kevin Durant  Hakeem Olajuwon*  Bob Lanier*  Tim Duncan  Grant Hill*  Karl Malone*  Gary Payton*  Andrei Kirilenko  Scottie Pippen*  Kevin Love  Clyde Drexler*  Kobe Bryant  The above is a ranked list by VORP (Value over Replacement Player), an advanced stat that gives an excellent view of actual player strength.  Kobe's peak season vs other's peak season puts him around 29th all time after you de-duplicate the list.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/vorp_season.html    "
Russell Westbrook as well
Jordan’s hero growing up was Russell Westbrook. 
&gt;it's time to get a little Russell Westbrook in you  he already playing like Russ with all those threes he's bricking
"&gt; Steph was content with not saying a word about his small contract in public, none when Kerr omitted his name during the Finals parade, nothing when KD went on an Uber commercial with LeBron talking about top-2 players, and perpetually happy with standing in the corner while the team runs motion offense. Throw everything out. It’s time to get a little Russell Westbrook in you, a smattering of Kobe Bryant, and even some Chris Paul. It’s Steph’s franchise, his legacy on the line, and his turn to take this team to the NBA Finals."
I dont think Russell Westbrook is a top 10 NBA player right now. He is too inefficient for me
NBA should make a Animated Cartoon called The NBA SuperFriends! Some Episode Ideas i came up with:  Episode 2\-   K.D keeps on switching teams while playing a 1 on 1 pick\-up basketball game   Episode 3\-   Russell Westbrook surgically implants a Basketball on his hand so that he never has to pass the ball  Episode 4\- Steph Curry moonlights as a crimestopper. Shoots a net from 3 to stop a robber. Shoots bananas from 3 to stop obesity.
"Is he saying he doesn’t like LeBron? I mean, has he met other basketball players?   I would say Steph, Klay, Richard Jefferson are nicer but that’s about it.  I guess Steven Adams seems nice, but I feel like if Russell Westbrook told him to attack you, he would do it without even hearing your side of the story!"
"VORP is trash, Dwyane Wade didn't have a VORP over 1 in 2011? Scottie Pippen outplayed Jordan *twice* in the playoffs? Steve Francis was the best player in the NBA in 2001? Russell Westbrook had the best NBA season of all time *by far* in 2017? Give me a break."
OF COURSE IT IS... that doesn't mean that it hasn't been a massive factor in MVP voting... no MVP came from a team with worse than the 4th best record in the league from the time span of Moses Malone until Russell Westbrook.
"James harden, Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were once all teammates."
"You really don't know what you're talking about, do you? Searchign up career head2head doesn't matter because CP3 is not KD's primary defender! I think the fact that Russell Westbrook of all people is even around (and above) Durant in efficiency when it comes to playing against CP3 teams goes to show how much he destroys CP3"
So is james harden and russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook sitting back laughing 
"[CP3 vs Russell](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/h2h_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;player_id1_hint=chris+paul&amp;player_id1_select=Chris+Paul&amp;player_id1=paulch01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;idx=players)  [CP3 vs KD](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/h2h_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Chris+Paul&amp;player_id1_select=Chris+Paul&amp;player_id1=paulch01&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players)  Are we memeing? I'd much rather have KD over Russell vs CP3. Also before these last two games, KD was more efficient than Russell. The OP waited for this moment to post it, even though likely after next game KD will be above Russell again in efficiency."
"People probably haven’t looked this guy up, but Russell Westbrook and Daniel Orton. I mean cmon he’s clearly Russ’ older brother."
"1. OKC got beat by a team who played Chris Bosh at the 5.   2. [Durant signed his rookie max in 2010](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/kevin-durant-2717/cash-earnings/) In fact he fought for more money from the team after the new CBA made him eligible for the ""Rose rule"".   3. [Westbrook signed his 5-year max rookie extension in 2011](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/russell-westbrook-6141/cash-earnings/)  4. Because of those two deals Harden wasn't eligible for the 5-year max, OKC was only able to offer him a 4 year max available to every other team. They didn't even offer him that. What are these pay cuts you're talking about?   5. James Harden would help the Thunder win more games than Kendrick Perkins. This last one is more of an opinion, but in hindsight it's obviously true. And at the time it was still pretty clear.   6. If the owners of the Thunder didn't want to deal with small market problems, they shouldn't have moved the team away from a big market. The Sonics would probably have two more titles by now. But the Thunder don't have any because Oklahoma City is in the middle of nowhere. "
"Kevin ""Russell Westbrook"" Durant"
"This is poor logic; we're not discussing John Wall nor Russell Westbrook.  For your argument to be even slightly appropriate, you would need to cite the drives per game, etc.  And even that is an irrelevantly small statistical sample.  We are discussing Jayson Tatum.     You seem irrationally biased; it would be more interesting if you'd post why you dislike him, rather than resort to illogic. "
Does his name start with a Russell and end with a Westbrook
"this was throwing me off, here are the 2x mvp's   Bob Cousy, Julius Erving, Isiah Thomas, Magic Johnson, Karl Malone, Allen Iverson, and Russell Westbrook   "
"No, Harden-Soul, I don't want to bet. Point is, he is not MVP. He might be, but Russell Westbrook is still reigning MVP."
"Russell Westbrook courtside with a ""Houston Strong"" shirt for Game 6 confirmed."
Russell Westbrook. 
Harden/Paul and Durant turned this into a version of What if Russell Westbrook played for both the Rockets and Warriors.   That Westbrook gunk must be hard to get of Durant and Harden. 
KD came to the Warriors because they play much smarter basketball than Russell Westbrook did. Unfortunately he brought too much of the OKC offense with him. 
"Kevin ""Russell Westbrook"" Durant"
KD don't pass to anyone no more putting his best Russell Westbrook impersonation 
"Russell Westbrook, Allen Iverson, Derrick Rose, David Robinson, Bill Walton, Bob McAdoo, Dave Cowens, and Wes Unseld all won MVPs and there's no credible argument to be made that any of them are top 25 all time. "
Somewhere Russell Westbrook is slightly less angry.
Russell Westbrook must be smiling like a mofo watching James and Durant shit the bed 
I think we can all agree Russell Westbrook is the best of the OK3.
Russell Westbrook sucks btw
"The lineup  - Russell Westbrook: I don't like his game and I don't like watching him  - Devin Booker: I think he's overrated, cocky, and dirty  - Can't think of any SFs  - Kevin Love: came off pretty douchey with that Jay Williams story  - Joel Embiid: This dude is just annoying as fuck"
I feel like guys who you can argue for this  - Reggie Miller  - Russell Westbrook  - Kobe Bryant (and he's one of my favorite players all time)  - Kyrie Irving?
"&gt;Kneeling doesn't equal hating your country , it means you don't agree with the direction it's going.   Well it is apparently pretty offensive to a large number of Americans.  Whether it should or shouldn't be offensive is not necessarily the point.    Like, if I say/do something that greatly offends someone (even though I meant no offense), I'm going to try to figure out why they feel that way and whether or not I should change my behavior.  It's like that discussion we had about the commentator saying Russell Westbrook was ""out of his cotton-picking mind"".  A lot of people were reasonably suggesting that the phrase was not meant to be racially charged, and yet there were a lot of people offended, especially those who were not familiar with the origins of the term.  So I don't think you can just declare what is or isn't offensive, it's a pretty subjective phenomenon."
"Why , because of 1-2 meaningless extra rebounds per game? The triple double is an arbitrary achievement ..  Russell had the narrative in his favor and deserved MVP no doubt (the award isn’t about who’s the best player) , but I still thought Harden was a better player than Westbrook last year and has been for some time - mainly bc he’s so much more efficient and skilled offensively   "
How has Russell Westbrook not been mentioned yet? His whole career is full of these moments. Especially his shot against the Warriors fadeaway 3 in the corner a few years ago where he could've passed it to KD but instead said fuck it and took the shot. The embodiment of no\-no\-yes.  
Russell Westbrook
"There's a difference between having a lot of rebounds and being a good rebounder. Love is a far better rebounder than, say, Russell Westbrook, even though they had close to the same rebounds per game this past season.  He also spreads the floor well, and even though he has had his ups and downs in scoring recently, part of that is him having those ups."
This was Zach Lowe's all NBA team from earlier this year  First team  G: James Harden G: Damian Lillard F: LeBron James F: Giannis Antetokounmpo C: Anthony Davis  Second team  G: Russell Westbrook G: Victor Oladipo F: Kevin Durant F: LaMarcus Aldridge C: Joel Embiid  Third team  G: Stephen Curry G: Chris Paul F: Ben Simmons F: Jimmy Butler C: Nikola Jokic  
"Kyrie wasnt even the most deserving guard who had injuries to get left off the team\(CP3 was\).  For guard you had to pick 6 from the following: Russell Westbrook Dame Lillard Steph Curry DeMar DeRozan James Harden Chris Paul Victor Oladipo Kyrie Irving.  Two were getting off that's just reality. Some fan base was always going to be upset. The fact Steph Curry, arguably the 2nd best player in the NBA, only got 3rd team because of time missed tells you how much voters cared about that. "
"Russell Westbrook can get lazy and roam. When engaged he's a great defender. Lillard at his best, when he's trying, is a big negative defender."
"Russell ""can't do it himself"" Westbrook finally has some help!!! Look at Paul ""Playoff P"" George on the NBA third team!"
"All\-NBA teams:    First: LeBron James, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kevin Durant.  Second: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Russell Westbrook, Joel Embiid, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan.  Third: Stephen Curry, Victor Oladipo, Karl\-Anthony Towns, Jimmy Butler, Paul George."

"I never said anything about tiers  Two of the best =/= top 3  Are Chris Paul, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook not 3 of the best players in the NBA despite not being on the same tier as Durant or LeBron?"
"Russell ""I still lead the team in Usage Rate despite having a four-time scoring champion next to me"" Westbrook "
"these guys shouldn't be hated on for the simple fact that they have weaknesses, because there isn't a commentator out there that doesn't have weaknesses. The reason why their weaknesses are notable, is because they have distinct and unique weaknesses. Stephen A, has the problem with the fact that he's style over substance when it comes to any sport. Not just basketball. Cowherd has the weakenss that he's clearly a football guy, who knows a decent amount about football, but he spends the NFL offseasons awkwardly stalling until he can get to his bread and butter again. He has to constantly repeat himself about how ""you do realize that my former employer helped tom hanks get divorced at a starbucks in silicone valley...and that speaks to the fact that Russell Westbrook is a cunt"" "
"WUSSELL RESTBROOK IS PLAYING OUT OF CONTROL, Marv!  A *wild* 3 pointer from Russell Westbrook, and the foul. Now they're saying it's a 2 pointer; Durant good for 2, Oklahoma City"

"Not what I'm trying to say.  More like of the 2 players OKC couldn't retain, they would have titles on another team with other all stars.  If Russell Westbrook was top 10, they should've won a title when all 3 were together or at least when it was just down to Durant.  If Harden and Durant win titles on other teams it poses the question of if Westbrook was the cancer."
Damian Lillard Will Barton Russell Westbrook   Take away these peoples votes it’s so fucking stupid
I think their worse defenders tend to do worse in DRPM   Tony Parker 82nd out of 102 guards and Patty Mills is 90th  Davis Bertans and Joffrey Lauvergne also have below average DRPMs for their position   Key also is to understand the Spurs are really good at using guys properly on D not asking them to do things they can't and hiding them when needed. This will help their on off ratings   For example Pau Gasol has concrete feet and is total barbecue chicken on the perimeter: so they never ask him to venture outside the paint and let him do what he can do well which is protect the rim   Other guys like Danny Green and Kyle Anderson they are careful with shay match ups they give them. Danny Greens weakness is quicker guards: as a result they tend to not ask him to guard true point guards often. Russell westbrook( who he historically does well against) and Reggie Jackson were the only true 1s he was really asked to guard for a lot of poss this year.   Kyle Anderson and Danny Green they are very good at knowing who they can and can't guard well and assigning the right matchup accordingly
[Dust this baby off](https://giphy.com/gifs/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-thunder-12OYYarAi8vi8)
"Yeah, that is true.  But his playmaking became better within the better offense under Kerr as he entered his prime, he just had more playmakers around him.  Curry this past season averaged [1.13 PPP as a PnR ball handler.](http://stats.nba.com/players/ball-handler/#!?sort=PPP&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=PlayerFirstName*E*stephen)  Westbrook averaged [0.85 PPP](http://stats.nba.com/players/ball-handler/#!?sort=PPP&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=PlayerFirstName*E*russell)  Curry averaged [1.05 PPP on isos.](http://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=PlayerFirstName*E*stephen)  Westbrook averaged [0.82 PPP on isos](http://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=PlayerFirstName*E*russell).  Curry is just so much better at creating his own shot.    And Westbrook gets more assists, but that is mostly a product of how ball dominant he is.  [Westbrook](http://stats.nba.com/players/drives/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=DRIVES&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*russell) passes on a lower percentage his drives than [Curry](http://stats.nba.com/players/drives/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=DRIVES&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*stephen) does, but still scores on a much smaller percentage of his drives.  Westbrook does get assists on more of his drives, but he also gets TOs on more of his drives.  Curry can playmake for himself and others.  Westbrook's ferocity can create easy looks for others, but he doesn't create efficient looks for himself like Curry does.  And it is easy to construct an elite offense around Curry's brand of playmaking, while Westbrook's brand of playmaking makes building an offense difficult, since any offense that counts on Westbrook as lead playmaker will be heavily iso based."
And FIVE second team votes  That means six people voted Russell Westbrook to the All Defensive team
How does Russell Westbrook (7) get more votes than Danny Green (6)?
"I'm not really sure whether Russell ""4 turnovers in the last 2 minutes of game 6 of the 2016 WCF"" Westbrook understands that either."

I love how there will probably be more Houston fans in a thread named “Russell Westbrook” than this game thread. 
"&gt; Who cares if say John Wall is standing still if he's guarding a Russel Westbrook also standing at the top of the key?  Over the course of a single game, sure. Wall getting six points in one game isn't an indicator of how well he can score in other games. But Wall isn't averaging six points a game and he's not guarding stationary Russell 82 games a year either.  And there really isn't anything such as ""empty movement."" If you're moving, the dude who's guarding you is moving as well, or having to switch or doing SOMETHING. Being stationary only works necessarily for corner three-point shooters, which isn't Wall's role in the offense."

"It's not really just a generation issue there will always be preference amongst casual fans media members former players etc to the guy who ""has the balls to take the last shot"" etc. it's just easier to appreciate.   It's why many people see someone like Russell Westbrook as having the ""will to win"" a ""guy you want to go down with"" ""a guy who just wants it more"" etc.   This is a big part of why it took people a while to come around on LeBron and realize his method of ""always making the right basketball play"" was correct. And it's why many still are skeptical of it and why even last year in game 3 he got flak for not taking a contested floater and instead passing to a wide open Kyle Korver for a corner 3.   The idea that ""taking the last shot no matter what"" in and of itself is the most desirable trait is always something that will be part of how many view basketball including former players. People just hate the idea of role players taking wide open shots over stars taking poor looks in key moments that's all there really is to it..,..we can certainly debate the merits of it but that's really what it is"
"Jordan/KD vs kobe is easy to answer.  Despite leading the league in attempts for many, many years, kobe only managed to win the scoring title 2x. KD won the scoring title 4x before turning 30, and he did it with Russell Westbrook, a known chucker, as his teammate. Jordan won the scoring title 10x.  The usual excuses from kobe kids is that kobe had trash teammates. But if that were the case, then kobe wouldn't have had any problems winning the scoring title when he had Shaq, Pau and Lamar as teammates.   The truth is, kobe is just an incredibly overrated and inefficient scorer. "

"No. But he missed The playoffs multiple times in his prime when there were only 8 teams in the league, he wasn't efficient, and his greatest accomplishment (averaging a TD) has been done twice by Russell fucking WestBrook. Also the pace of play and number of shot attempts was much higher in his era, so his stats were inflated a hell of a lot. "
"Im actually not being disingenuous about this. That was the narrative. It seems like it might die because KD ""wants to be happy, why you gotta hate that"", which isn't what we hate. We hate that his happiness didn't involve sticking things out and fighting for a championship with a team that wasn't already nearly impossible to defeat.

Lebron isn't ending his career playing with Russell Westbrook 
"I'm not sure if you're being serious or not, but it drives me insane when people try to compare the situations they were in.  The Cavs completely failed to put talent around LeBron.  The teams he played with his first run in Cleveland were GARBAGE.  He didn't become ""LeGM"" until the actual GM proved he had no fucking idea what he was doing.  He teamed up with Wade and Bosh in Miami creating a Super Team.  Then he went back to Cleveland when they had Kyrie and brought in Love to create another Super Team.  Durant was drafted by an incredibly competent organization.  He didn't just have pieces around him; he also had a Hall of Fame level teammate.  In KD's 5th year in the league, he went to the finals on a team with one of the best defensive bigs in the NBA, the runaway 6th man of the year, and Russell Westbrook.  In LeBron's fifth year, his best teammate was Zydrunas Ilgauskas."
I got Bill Russell Westbrook. 
"Everyone knew that big three Celtics team wasn't gonna last long. Paul pierce and Kevin garnett were both old as fuck by that point. And *everyone* knew they were going to win championships dude. That's why that Mavericks championship was such a surprise. How are you just gonna rewrite history like that?  And what? It's Kevin Durants fault that okc couldn't get their shit together? Paul George, Russell Westbrook, and Carmelo Anthony should have been better. The Celtics would have probably knocked the cavs out of the east if they were healthy. And kawhi got hurt. But somehow all that's Kevin Durants fault?"
"Lol. When Durant plays hero ball just like Wrestbrook it hurts his teams. That's what happened in the OKC vs GSW series. I was there. Ya gotta short memory?

Russell Westbrook doesn’t “play harder than anyone in the NBA”. He only goes hard when he has the ball on offense. 3/4s of his rebounds are given to him and he’s an incredibly lazy defender.
"Last year something happened that many people overlooked. Oscar Robertson had his record broken. Suddenly one of the NBA's most legendary players had his plaques removed, his accolades ripped down from the rafters of his house, and all of his local Italian restaurant commercial deals forcefully taken away, given instead to Kings legends like Buddy Hield and Vince Carter. This was largely due to Russell Westbrook accomplishing that same triple double feat he had years before, but there was a bigger culprit to blame; Lebron James.  Whenever something bad happens in basketball you can blame him. Lebron is just so influential now he's responsible for everything in the league. The Warriors form a super team? Lebron James. Players coasting in the regular season? Lebron James. Cavs can't make the finals? Lebron James. So it goes without saying that as Oscar Robertson sulked amidst his cluttered one bedroom apartment filled with more rage than Steve Kerr and a broken clipboard that his eyes slowly came to rest on the beaming face of one Lebron James, shortly after a 91-89 Cavalier win in early February, after months of brooding. It was time for revenge.  What many of you may not be immediately familiar with is Oscar Robertson was #1. Like, his jersey, though also arguably #1 in the league at his time. In order to make his plan work, Robertson needed a man on the inside - so he had two of his most beloved soldiers act on his behalf, forcing former #1 player Derrick Rose to the Utah Jazz while #1 Rodney Hood came to Cleveland. #1 Lance Stephenson was already in place in Indiana, so now all Robertson had to do was ensure that every remaining game in the schedule went exactly as he planned in order to ensure that Lebron faced the Pacers as the 3rd seed vs the 6th.  Too easy. By April 25th, Cleveland was down 1 in the series, playing at home, and Oscar had Lebron exactly where he wanted him. Hood suggested Oladipo was ""weak in the paint"" and ""ripe for a prime time block"". Stephenson egged 'Bron on, taunting him at every point possible, confiding in him late in the second quarter that ""you were supposed to restore balance to the East... instead you went to Miami."" And by the time Lebron had that controversial block, later ruled a goaltend, towards the end of the 4th quarter, Oscar was absolutely filled to the brim with excitement. His plan was coming to fruition.  April 27th. Mayor Joe Hogsett - who took office January -1st-, 2016, and while is credited as being born November 2nd was actually secretly born November -1st- at 11:59 - signs executive order #1, outlawing goaltending in the city of Indianapolis. The referees, fat and complacent thanks to Robertson's bribes of signed memorabilia and vintage basketball cards, prepare to make the biggest call of their lives. Police officers surround the arena, ready to arrest the person who might be the world's most notable athlete. And Oscar Robertson sat waiting for his plan to come unhatched...  But it didn't.  I'd devoted decades of my life to this project, and when my expectations were shattered I was at an utter loss.  Lebron wasn't arrested?  So... what was Oscar's real ulterior motive?    It's simple: to get Lebron James to join the Kings.  Joining forces with the next Steph Curry would only be more incredible if the Kings managed to get the 1st overall pick, a trend in my theory - and plot twist, they will.  Phoenix is absolutely enthralled by Iman Shumpert.  They look at him as the second-coming of Jason Kapono, except without the three point shooting, and it's hard to blame them: this is a guy who learned from one of the best distributors in the game, Carmelo Anthony.  So when Phoenix ships the 1st pick to Sacramento for the 2nd and Iman, my theory will finally come together: Sacramento will draft the amazingly talented Trae Young 1st, Lebron will shatter free agency rules by declaring his intent on joining Sacramento July 1st, and Sacramento will win it's first ever NBA championship by June 1st of 2019.    You heard it here first folks.  This isn't a conspiracy theory - this is reality.  "
no particular order  Russell Westbrook  Kevin Durant  Paul George  James Harden  Serge Ibaka/Steven Adams
"&gt; He didn't have to go to a 73-win team.  But why wouldn't he???  I hate this bullshit narrative about Kevin Durant going somewhere else. There's no player in the NBA that wouldn't have gone to Golden State in his position. Maybe Russell Westbrook, because he's that in love with himself, but that's about it.  A team where you have other players to back you up. A team where the coaching staff will make you a better player. A team where you have a chance to win multiple championships. A team that clearly has a ton of fun playing basketball.  What player in his right mind wouldn't go there?"
"Paul George, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Demar Derozan, Kyle Lowry - all of them had the chance to beat LeBron in the conference finals or finals, but couldn't. We would be adding KD to that list if he didn't join a 73-win team."
“Russell Westbrook sends his regards”
I.e. Russell Westbrook 
"LeBron to OKC -- hear me out --  Russell Westbrook is a freak, but he's not a court General, and that team sucked because dispite all that talent, they had no leadership. But LeBron running shit frees up Westbrook and takes the pressure off of PG-13 to come and go as needed (a la Clay Thompson). Plus, Steven Adams can out-goon Draymond (side-note -- Adams is my favorite players lately and I have no idea why), and if Melo wants to stick around he's more than welcome to.  The obvious concern with OKC versus a team like the Spurs is court discipline/'basketball IQ,' and I'm just spitballing so I don't know even know if it's feasible with OKC's cap situation... but how big of a 'fuck you' would that be to KD to go to OKC and bring home the ring that he couldn't?!?"
"I don't think there's any argument about the best overall player of this generation and it's Lebron. Everyone else is jockeying for second and everyone knows it. THAT is why teams got in arms races for rings. They want to carve out their niche because there's not a lot of breathing room between, say, Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul. Hell KD by virtue of being on this Warriors team got way more eyes on him in more postseason games than he might have had elsewhere and look what it's doing for him: A lot of people are starting to make the argument he's the best scoring player in the league and might be the second best player. The ring argument is one we made ourselves but it's not even the largest bed we gotta make. It's that casual fan who watches maybe 5 games in the regular season but a bunch of the postseason that's proving to be a real reason about the opinion on these players' legacies."
- Steve Kerr succumbs to diabetes caused by 23rd Gatorade shower.  - Chris Paul murdered in players union revolt after returning team mate's nail clippers in an unacceptable condition.  - James Harden buried alive after feigning death. Makes both free throws.  - Carmelo Anthony consumes Russell Westbrook in an attempt to preserve his aging game. Averages a triple-single but is swept by the Rio Grande Valley Vipers in the first round.  - Paul George and Gordon Hayward impaled by each other's protruding femurs after a needlessly athletic tip-off in game 1 of the season.   - Kyrie Irving successfully lobbies for official NBA basketball to become a flat leather disc but is gunned down by chairman of the Ultimate Frisbee League moments before winning the taco bell skills challenge.  - Greg Popovich self-immolates in protest at a no-call. AT&amp;T center becomes pilgrimage site for Texan Buddhists.  - Zach LaVine gored after Benny the Bull replaced with actual bull. United Center becomes pilgrimage site for Texan rodeo fans. 
[This article](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/12/16/16784664/joel-embiid-wave-russell-westbrook-beef) sums up my favourite part. Russ' face as he waves goodbye is too good.
"Uh... both.  When is the last time Paul George has been in an MVP discussion, if ever?  ---  Edit - I'll even answer my own question.  Answer is once.  Russell Westbrook MVP votes:  * 11-12: 12th place  * 12-13: 9th place  * 14-15: 4th place  * 15-16: 4th place  * 16-17: 1st place  Paul George MVP votes:  * 13-14: 9th place  ---   So... yeah.  Looks like a pretty big gap to me."
"Any team that likes to run in transition and spaces the floor should go Westbrook, imo.  That's when he's most dangerous.  Don't know which teams on the list that is though.  Edit - Also any team that doesn't have a superstar.  If you think it's a debate on if the Heat would rather have Paul George or Russell Westbrook you're an idiot. "
I'd rather have Hasheem Thabeet than Russell Westbrook
"That is very fair. I still feel that he's an excellent manager, but he doubled down on Russell Westbrook and I assume that he did this because he felt that Russ was a player similar to Kobe in his ability to will success to a team.  All the other stuff are legitimate gripes though; acquiring Melo was Presti's worst move by far (I don't count the Harden trade because it was imposed upon him). "
"Games played in the last 10 years, playoffs included:  * LeBron James   945 * Russell Westbrook   841 * 3 players tied   831  That's right, LeBron has played in **104** more games than any other player in the last decade.   He has a right to show a little fatigue.  [source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;year_min=2009&amp;year_max=2018&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;order_by=mp)"
"Both Granger and Ellis averaged more ppg at 24 than 28. So I don't think the prime argument really fits there.   It does fit with KG and Wade though. However, at 30 years old Wade scored his 2nd lowest ppg of his career at 22.1 during Lebron's first season in Miami. Garnett saw an even worse drop off going from 22/13 to 18/9 from Minnesota to Boston (30 years old to 31 years old).  With that being said, I think what KD is referencing (at least how I interpreted it) was usage rate. Your stats take a hit when you play with better players because your usage rate goes down. Other examples include James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Steph Curry after they got CP3, PG13, and KD respectively.   (Also, thank you for actually responding with a discussion friendly comment instead of downvoting). "
Wasn't Russell Westbrook a mediocre prospect?
"No, because his second best player was Lamar Odom, not fucking MVP Russell Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook.
"My logic is that the Thunder aren't close to being a better team and it was a fluke.  Flukes are flukes, they are unlikely for a reason.    You saying they would be favorites the next year is ludicrous.    And my personal opinion is that you cannot win a championship with Russell Westbrook on your team (since he's naturally an insane usage player he wouldn't take a smaller role). "
"Spoken like someone who doesn't understand context and just goes to basketball reference. There is no possible NBA analyst who would ever compare Bird's passing ability to Kobe's. Not a single one. Russell Westbrook averages more assists than LeBron, but no one would ever claim that he's a better passer than LeBron. You have no idea what you're talking about. "
"Boston, Philly, San Antonio, etc. Enough teams have these multi-demsnional players that OKC not having them was inexcusable. Especially given the fact that their foundational piece, Durant, is a generational talent.   To draft Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka, yet have nothing to show if, reflects incompetence imo. "
&gt; [OKC] Russell Westbrook  Possibly the only other player in the NBA that comes close to that number of great-passes-that-led-to-bricks
Russell Westbrook 
"For the sake of an argument, it could be claimed that LeBron is equally responsible for stopping Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah, DeMar DeRozan, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Al Horford, and Isaiah Thomas. (He also defeated Kawhi, Duncan, Parker, Ginobili, Steph, Klay, Durant, and Dray, at different points but eventually lost to each of them as well).  I'm not sure where those guys will rank in terms of legacy in 20 years, especially compared to Clyde, Magic, Chuck, Payton, Stockton, and Malone. But it's worth the argument I think. Personally I'm not ready to claim LeBron better than MJ, but I will fight that theres a valid argument for either over the other."
"Really overcame the adversity of playing on the Oklahoma City Thunder with bums like Russell Westbrook and James Harden to lead a team of unknowns like Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Nick Young, Javale McGee and a relatively unknown coach in Steve Kerr to multiple Championships.  Really shows the tenacity and character of a man who stepped up when all the odds were against him."
NO LEBRON IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME! HE CARRIED THE CAVS OUT OF SHEER WILL AND DETERMINATION! HIS TEAMMATES LET HIM DOWN AND THEY WERE HORRIBLE! HE IS 3-8 IN THE FINALS AND THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME!! RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS A STAT WHORE BUT LEBRON IS DIFFERENT!
Russell westbrook
Russell Westbrook
Kevin is a sell out. The Thunder were extremely talented and had the best regular season basketball team on the ropes and they choked so Kevin sold out on Oklahoma City and Russell Westbrook. Took the “If you can’t beat them join them” too literally.
I know I'll be getting downvotes but he made a great choice.. He would never get rings playing with Russell Westbrook.
"It's not ""hard"" to argue. It's pretty easy. The cornerstone of the Warriors is Curry. Without him the offense doesn't work as well as it does, because the defensive rotation puts a lot of emphasis on guarding him, giving his teammates easier shots.  Given basically the same scoring production between KD and Curry, Curry was my MVP. I'm certain KD will say something about this is in a podcast.  I'm not calling it a robbery or anything crazy like that. I'm just saying that this is one of those awards that people like to base solely on points scored and percentages, without looking at the bigger picture. This award is like giving the MVP to Russell Westbrook solely on statistics, which again shows that voters are dumb."
"Steph was double teamed on 59 possessions in Game 3. He had only 2 TOs, and made a lot of smart passes out of the trap which resulted in 4 on 3s and great looks at the rim for Draymond, McGee, etc.  It was still a bad game, and Durant deserved FMVP, but it absolutely was not one of the worst performances in NBA history. Last year in Rockets vs Spurs Game 2, James Harden shot 3-17 for 13 points. In Game 6 he shot 2-11 for 10 points, fouled out, and the Rockets lost the series.  In Game 3 against the Jazz this year, Russell Westbrook shot 5-17 for 14 points with 8 turnovers (missed a triple double by one assist though!). Then in Game 6 (elimination game), Paul George shot 2-16 for 5 points (!!). Durant and Westbrook were also pretty bad on high volume in the 2016 WCF, which left the door open for the Warriors comeback.  My point is not to bash these guys but to point out that bad games aren't rare in the playoffs, especially if the defense's strategy is to not give you anything and make your teammates beat them."
"Its just amazing KD has survived his incredibly difficult and trying one thus far.  I can’t fathom how he played with Russell Westbrook and James Harden at one point, only to go to play with Steph Curry and Klay Thompson on his next team.  The dude seriously INVITES difficulty and challenge, looks it in the eye, and says “let’s dance”.  Love it!"
LeBron has convinced me that rings don't matter as much as I thought they mattered. Russell Westbrook only adds to that narrative. It's fun to watch regular season basketball. I say we remove win/loss records and just play ball.  
"3 time Finals MVP Kevin Durant and James Harden are leading OKC. Meanwhile, Russell Westbrook is somewhere else. "
DiAngelo Russell Westbrook 2019 MVP?
The only man i've seen this miserable losing is... Russell Westbrook.   Maybe these guys should link up? Just a thought...
#RUSSELL WESTBROOK &gt; KD  #WHERE MY OKC FANS AT
"Nick Young gets a ring before James Harden, CP3, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis and Cedi Osman. Let that sink in."
I think it says enough when Kevin Durant shoots a lower percentage from three than Russell Westbrook.

"Question for any OKC fans.  Would you guys, the city, Russell Westbrook,  the ownership,  accept KD back if he tried to come back, like LeBron did Cleveland?  Or did he burn that bridge to bad? "
Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double for two straight seasons.
If your answer isn't Russell Westbrook you're either being a contrarian for the sake of being a contrarian or just wrong.
"You make an actual point, the funny thing is if you were asking about Russell Westbrook, you would get upvotes but since its Bron r/nba will defend their man"
How about Russell Westbrook having the same stats as LeBron's?
Finals Russell Westbrook
"In the first 4 games of 2012 finals, the 23 year old point guard Russell Westbrook averaged 29/7/7 on 48% FG and 81% FT. Magic was wrong and obviously exaggerating."
"Russell Westbrook because everyone hates on him, he's averaged a triple double twice and while yes sometimes he slouches on defense from time to time, he destroys the rim and defenders on offense. For the love of god, LeBron come help the brodie out!"
"Technically, neither Kevin Durant nor Russell Westbrook were drafted by the Oklahoma City Thunder."
Russell Westbrook because I’m tired of people talking about him like he’s some scrub that can’t hold his own against the other superstars in the league.
"Everyone in here is comparing them at 19. There is no guarantee that Oden would have continued to become a better player the way Durant did.  Durant went from 20 ppg, to 25 ppg, to 30 ppg, to 50/40/90 and 5 assists per game all while maintaining 28 ppg on 60++ TS% all while improving his defensive game by the time he was 25 years old.  Just because Oden was a better *prospect* doesn't mean he would have reached his potential in a way that Durant has.   Durant has basically reached his absolute ceiling in a way that only a handful of top 5 prospects in any given year ever have (I mean seriously... the list is basically MJ, Hakeem, Duncan, Shaq, LeBron, Bird, Magic, Wilt, Russell, West, Robertson, Dr. J, CP3, David Robinson, AD and KD. Maybe Westbrook or Iverson, but KD is a better player than both. It's that short.)  There is *no* guarantee that Oden, even healthy as a horse, would have joined that list. If you factor in injury concerns, I don't think saying 1 out of 100 is a long shot. Again, this is the chances of him being *as good as or better than David Robinson*.  Even a guy like Anthony Davis that was HUGELY touted as a surefire all-star was not expected to be *this* good *this* early.  If you *assume* that Oden was healthy I think it is still somewhere around a 1 in 10 chance that he would have been a top 25-30 player of all time.   Circling back, this:  &gt; if Oden were playing TODAY and had never been injured and had all those microfractures, he would be one of the top 10 big men of all time. He would be better than KD.  is an overreaction..."
"The same OKC team which also featured future MVP Russell Westbrook and probable future MVP Harden? Read beyond the stated example and see what the bigger point is: In totality, KD has had better teammates than LBJ in their finals matchups."
When you have an all time great like Duncan it’s easy to stay on a team with him. Russell Westbrook? He’s the total opposite teammate.
"I am not saying the Mavs weren't good, the talent was simply not comparable to normal contending teams. There are many who would say that the 2011 Lakers did choke given their performances, but also that coming off 3 straight Finals 99 tines out of 100 will lose early in the next season due to fatigue and collapse. The Lakers were expected to beat the Hornets in 4 the first round, but ended up doing it in 6. Anyone with the right basketball mind should honestly not favor a team with Russell Westbrook and that garbage ""system"" full of iso-ball to beat a well-coached team no matter how good they appear in the regular season. Talent for talent, the Miami Heat were one of the most stacked teams in NBA history. That brand new team won 60 something games that year and demolished Rose and the Bulls. Why else would they be favored to win the Finals? They were elite.  This years Cav's team still has Love foor a second star and Rodney Hood who put up 17 ppg in the west on a playoff team. It has talent, anyone who thinks its Lebron just carrying a bunch of bums are swallowing this stupid narrative created by Lebron nuthuggers."
"Even if he would be, I don't see Russell Westbrook playing very well off the ball. Do you?"
"If there is one player that I can say would definitely have trouble fitting with LeBron, it would be Russell Westbrook."

Except Durant didn't have the luxury of a Draymond suspension or Bogut/Iggy injury.      Obviously you could say Durant's teammates were better defenders, but I'd counter and say the Warriors offense was just as good in both series vs OKC(106.1 ppg, 107.8 ORT) and vs CLE(99.9 ppg, 108.5 ORTG)    You could also say LeBron was the reason his teammates statically outplayed KD due to his playmaking opening things up for them, but that would then contradict the current narrative that the Cavs are currently losing because LeBron's teammates are playing like trash. Because if he is to be held accountable for his teammates playing well, then he must be held accountable for them playing poorly as well.      You could say that LeBron's defense was the difference, but when analyzing that it falls apart as well. LeBron guarded [Green](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/6/9/11893824/lebron-james-draymond-green-nba-finals-2016-warriors-cavaliers-game-3) and Barnes and averaged 2 blocks and 2 steals per game. Green averaged 17/10/6 62 TS% in the Finals and Barnes averaged 9/4/2 43 TS%. Durant guarded Green for the majority of the WCF but also guarded Barnes at times and averaged 2 blocks and 2 steals per game. Green averaged 11/9/4 44 TS% and Barnes averaged 9/4/1 59 TS%.    Funny that Durant is somehow lightyears away yet if Klay Thompson doesn't have the best game of his entire 101 game playoff career, he knocks out the 73 win Warriors in less games getting similar production from his teammates and not needing a Draymond suspension or Bogut &amp; Iguodala injury.       Oh and if you decide to talk about Westbrook's assists, the vast majority of them were on contested jumpers Durant made thus of little value because the shot earned the assist. As for the rest of those, they're already shown by his teammates TS% which is inflated and would be lower without said assists. Aka his teammates played even worse than is already shown with the exception of Westbrook   "

The players are picked *mostly* based on the total Win Share (WS) for that team. For a player to become an icon for the team, I think he should (1) win games and (2) played many seasons. Total Win Share [(an advanced metrics assigning wins to players according to their contribution)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win_Shares) covers both parameters.  Please note that my focus is on **CITY**. In other words, if a team was relocated, e.g. Cincinnati Royals &gt; Sacramento Kings, only players who has played for the current city will be eligible. In this case, legend Oscar Robertson, despite have 3x WS over Peja Stojakovic, cannot make the list. I make these adjustments because it feels wrong to, say, put Gary Payton as the icon of OKC.  Another adjustment is made for up-and-coming players who are 95% likely to become the most WS player (e.g. Stephen Curry 93.3 vs Wilt Chamberlain 112.4)  The above two adjustments and a few more subjective deviations are discussed below:  - Atlanta: **Bob Pettit** is 1st but played for St. Louis. Dominique is 2nd. - Brooklyn: **Buck Williams**, Jason Kidd, Julis Erving and Richard Jefferson have better WS, but played for New Jersey/New York. Brook is 5th. - Charlotte: Kemba Walker (41.2) is now 3rd, but will likely pass Muggsy Bogues (44.8) and **Gerald Wallace** (45.9) next year. - Golden State: Stephen Curry (93.3) is now 3rd, but will likely pass Paul Arizin (108.8) and **Wilt Chamberlain** (112.4) in 2-3 years.  - LA Clippers: DeAndre Jordan (76.3) will likely pass Chris Paul (78.2) next year, but Chris Paul was the leader during their golden era, so I picked him. - Milwaukee: **Kareem Abdul-Jabbar** (114.7) is way ahead of Sidney Moncrief (88.5). However, I believe everyone remember Jabbar as a Laker (and his WS with Lakers is 158.7!). I don't think it is appropriate to put him as the icon for the Bucks, so I pick Sidney Moncrief instead. FYI Antetokounmpo (38.9) still need 5+ winning years to catch Moncrief. - New Orleans: Anthony Davis (62.5) is now 2nd, but will likely pass Chris Paul (76.4) in 1-2 years. - Oklahoma City: **Gary Payton** is 1st (123.8) but played for Seattle. **Kevin Durant** is 2nd (107.9). Westbrook is 3rd (90.1) and will likely pass Durant in 2 years. - Philapelphia: **Dolph Schayes** is 1st but played for Syracuse (except final year). Dr.J is 2nd and much more iconic. (Iverson is only 6th, behind Barkley, Hal Greer and Maurice Cheeks.) - Phoenix: I *subjectively* picked Nash, who is 3rd for Phoenix (82.7), over **Shawn Marion** (1st at 93.2) and **Kevin Johnson** (2nd at 90.9). I think Nash &gt; Marion because Nash was the leader of that team. I pick Nash over KJ just because *I* think Nash is more iconic. (Barkley is 11th) - Sacramento: Oscar Robertson (154.2) and Jack Twyman (75) played for Cincinnati. Bobby Wanzer played for Rochester. Peja Stojakovic is 4th (59.8). (Mitch Richmond is 8th and Chris Webber is 11th) - Toronto: Chris Bosh is 1st (61.8). **Kyle Lowry** (56.3) and **DeMar DeRozan** (54.0) are close behind. I'm not sure if Toronto will keep both during this offseason, so I stay with Bosh for now. If both Lowry and DeRozan plays one more year (and if I ever made an updated version) I would make an exception and use a photo of Lowry and DeRozan hugging each other. **Vince Carter** would have been more iconic, but he's 4th (47.7).  ^(BTW I just randomly pick photos from Google.

"I understand. I just fundamentally disagree.   First, KLove is averaging 20 and 12 against the Warriors, with 2 assists and a steal to go with. He doesn't match up well against the Celtics, but he's been killing it against the Warriors.   Secondly, if a player can't handle less touches, then that's soley on the shoulders of that player. Every player has less touches when they join better teams. LeBron got less touches in Miami then when he was the only good player on the Cavs, so he developed a slash to the basket, off the ball game. Curry gets less touches with KD on the Warriors, and now he just drains more catch-and-shoot threes. Players that require touches to not blow have two options; be good enough to lead a championship caliber team (Kobe), or never win a championship (DeRozan). Which one does KLove resemble more?   Thirdly, the Warriors elevate role players in *the exact same way* that LeBron teams have elevated role players in the past. Remember Mozgov? Birdman? Delly? Mike Miller? They succeeded because LeBron gave them the opportunity to succeed. JaVale McGee is eating off his open looks. Jordan Bell is eating. Kevon Looney is eating. If JR Smith or George Hill or Kevin Love can't eat because they need more touches, then that's not on LeBron. That's on them.   LeBron is not Russell fucking Westbrook. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.   Also, LeBron would fucking destroy the world on the Warriors. Thousand year dynasty, cancel the NBA, hide yo kids hide yo wife levels of rape."

"lol they just see him listed at 6-9 and decided that he would be crap today, ignored some truly outstanding undersized rebounders like Barkley, Westbrook and Rodman.  Also, whoever claimed Russell wouldn't even be in the league today are really just spouting some nonsense. Russell was one of the greatest blocker and rebounder, and was so quick he would chase other fast and smaller players like Baylor. Imagine smaller Durant/Giannis decided to defend like LeBron in his DPOY material seasons...and averaged 3 blocks a game. That's Bill Russell."
"Ah, yes, Russell Westbrook, confirmed role-player and all around trash bag."

"Personally I care most about competitive basketball. Being from Western Canada I don't have a major investment in any team in the league. I just want to watch good basketball with interesting playoff stories, which we get until the finals now. My point is that KD could have still been super successful on OKC, but he took the easy way out. Russell gets crap sure, but he also gets a ton of respect. The guy won the MVP award last year. Westbrook also wouldn't need to be such a ball hog with a player like KD on his team. I get what your saying, and I can understand KDs decision, but that doesn't make it okay. The guy is still a snake in my book. Just because KD did it, doesn't mean LBJ should do it. I respect LBJ for requesting being paid what he's worth. "

The closest is Russell Westbrook (who is obviously bigger and more durable).

"Said this earlier but it's like saying the Mavs should have traded Dirk in 2008.  2 seasons removed from MVP,  2 first round exits.  You never trade the face of the franchise unless they ask you to.    Can't believe you are mentioning this on Russell Westbrook day in OKC.  "
"It’s just not a good decision for the franchise to trade Westbrook now. Maybe for long-term value in winning games it could have a chance of being better, but Russell Westbrook IS the Thunder right now. He’s an Oklahoma icon and it would be bad business for the Thunder to part ways with him."

"any team that has been dying to land a star. For starters:  Orlando, Knicks, Suns, Nets, Hawks  Or teams on the brink, like:  Bucks, Raptors, Wizards, Blazers  It's Russell Westbrook. They put him on the market, there will be 3-4 solid offers right away.  "
"Sources close to me tell me Lebron wants to join Paul George and Russell Westbrook in OKC. However, the issue is financial due to Carmelo Anthony as well as Steven Adams contract. "
"Nah. Doesn't compute.  ""Russell Westbrook cares more about triple doubles than winning.""  ""Russell Westbrook is a low IQ chucker.""  ""Russell Westbrook didn't deserve his MVP.""  ""Russell Westbrook's man purse looks stupid.""  You know, stuff like that.  "
Russell Westbrook is better than James Harden and deserved last year's MVP and this year's MVP over him. 
Russell Westbrook is a glorified Raymond Felton
"This is a team that had/has: Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Serge Ibaka,Victor Oladipo, Steven Adams.. and no championship? That’s an embarrassment. Poor execution by the players while they were in OKC and a poor front office for letting so much talent go for nothing. If they had just one championship, I wouldn’t feel like this but they have none. And when you have that kind of talent on your roster over the last 10 years, theirs no excuse. "
"&gt;With Russell Westbrook, or... uhh.. Lonzo Ball?  FTFY"
Russell Westbrook got so fat
"Wrong. He is not better or greater than Jordan. The words you are looking for are ""more talented"". Just like how Russell Westbrook is ""more talented"" than Stephen Curry but not necessarily a better player."
"Just for giggles I dropped all the numbers by one just to see what it looked like.    18.5 ppg, 10.2 apg, and 6.2 rpg   |||||||Crit||||Tota||||||||||||||||||||Shoo|||||| |-:|:-|:-|-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|Season|Age|Tm|Lg|PTS|AST|TRB|WS|G|GS|MP|FG|FGA|2P|2PA|3P|3PA|FT|FTA|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PF|PTS|FG%|2P%|3P%|eFG%|FT%|TS%| |1|Oscar Robertson|1963-64|25|CIN|NBA|31.4|11.0|9.9|20.6|79||3559|840|1740|840|1740|||800|938|||783|868||||280|2480|.483|.483||.483|.853|.576| |2|Oscar Robertson|1964-65|26|CIN|NBA|30.4|11.5|9.0|17.0|75||3421|807|1681|807|1681|||665|793|||674|861||||205|2279|.480|.480||.480|.839|.561| |3|Oscar Robertson|1965-66|27|CIN|NBA|31.3|11.1|7.7|16.9|76||3493|818|1723|818|1723|||742|881|||586|847||||227|2378|.475|.475||.475|.842|.563| |4|Magic Johnson|1989-90|30|LAL|NBA|22.3|11.5|6.6|16.5|79|79|2937|546|1138|440|862|106|276|567|637|128|394|522|907|132|34|289|167|1765|.480|.510|.384|.526|.890|.622| |5|Magic Johnson|1988-89|29|LAL|NBA|22.5|12.8|7.9|16.1|77|77|2886|579|1137|520|949|59|188|513|563|111|496|607|988|138|22|312|172|1730|.509|.548|.314|.535|.911|.625| |6|Magic Johnson|1986-87|27|LAL|NBA|23.9|12.2|6.3|15.9|80|80|2904|683|1308|675|1269|8|39|535|631|122|382|504|977|138|36|300|168|1909|.522|.532|.205|.525|.848|.602| |7|Oscar Robertson|1961-62|23|CIN|NBA|30.8|11.4|12.5|15.6|79||3503|866|1810|866|1810|||700|872|||985|899||||258|2432|.478|.478||.478|.803|.554| |8|Magic Johnson|1990-91|31|LAL|NBA|19.4|12.5|7.0|15.4|79|79|2933|466|976|386|726|80|250|519|573|105|446|551|989|102|17|314|150|1531|.477|.532|.320|.518|.906|.623| |9|James Harden|2016-17|27|HOU|NBA|29.1|11.2|8.1|15.0|81|81|2947|674|1533|412|777|262|756|746|881|95|564|659|907|121|38|464|215|2356|.440|.530|.347|.525|.847|.613| |10|Russell Westbrook|2015-16|27|OKC|NBA|23.5|10.4|7.8|14.0|80|80|2750|656|1444|555|1103|101|341|465|573|145|481|626|834|163|20|342|200|1878|.454|.503|.296|.489|.812|.554| |11|Russell Westbrook|2016-17|28|OKC|NBA|31.6|10.4|10.7|13.1|81|81|2802|824|1941|624|1358|200|583|710|840|137|727|864|840|132|31|438|190|2558|.425|.459|.343|.476|.845|.554| |12|Magic Johnson|1987-88|28|LAL|NBA|19.6|11.9|6.2|10.9|72|70|2637|490|996|479|940|11|56|417|489|88|361|449|858|114|13|269|147|1408|.492|.510|.196|.497|.853|.581| |13|Russell Westbrook|2017-18|29|OKC|NBA|25.4|10.3|10.1|10.1|80|80|2914|757|1687|660|1361|97|326|417|566|152|652|804|820|147|20|381|200|2028|.449|.485|.298|.477|.737|.524|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts_per_g&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=18.5&amp;c2stat=ast_per_g&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=10.2&amp;c3stat=trb_per_g&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=6.2&amp;order_by=ws&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#stats) Generated "
Presti is the exception. And not many small market teams have a Russell Westbrook and can sell sustained excellence.
Jimmy Butler should be on this team. This dude hustles his ass off on every play like it’s the last play he will ever play     Russell Westbrook should absolutely as well 
Russell Westbrook has gotta be on this list.  The guy is on the floor more than anybody.

"DWade told him not to regret the decision he makes the moment he makes it.  What would he regret more: not putting on a Lakers jersey, something he has dreamed of his whole life?  Or upsetting Russell Westbrook?  Doesn't mean he is coming to LA, but i think the choice there is obvious."
"I dunno man. I think there was a strong case for AD to win MVP this year, and if he keeps it up I think he deserves it. Obviously at the end of the day you could just say LeBron most years and while Harden was amazing this year, I think both LBJ and AD should've won the MVP. This is coming from a guy who loves Harden. I think a big reason he won was because of the anomaly that was Russell Westbrook last season taking it away.  I'm not trying to take away anything from Embiid. The guy is incredible, but I don't know if I personally would be ready to put him into the top 3 candidates for MVP next year. If he keeps doing what he's doing and keeps improving, I'm sure he will win at least 1 in his career though."

"Winning championships is more than just skill and hunger, it’s about being fully locked into the mental aspect of the game. Knowing the tendencies and understanding the scouting report of each team you face plus being able to make the right reads at the right time, being disciplined is also a huge factor( Lebron and wade have talked about this). These are all things that Russell Westbrook severely lacks, he is talented but he simply makes too many boneheaded plays that really hurt his team. This was readily apparent in game 6 WCF 2016. "

Young wrote he was attempting to convey the general feelings of Westbrook and others who met with Durant earlier this summer after teams pitched the four-time NBA scoring champion.   &gt; Essentially, he put words in Durant's mouth.  &gt; Young said in the podcast that Durant told Westbrook, ""Hey, I'm coming back, man. Don't worry about it.'"""
we’ve gone through Revelations like changes in our organization.  2012:  Saint:    “The Prophet” Demon:  Russell Westbrook  2018:  Saint:     Russell “Jesus Christ” Westbrook  Demon: “The Snake”
That would be some Kobe level shit.  Reminds me of Kobe trying to mindgame Russell Westbrook during USA basketball to try to create a rift between him and KD JUST IN CASE the lakers were able to make on more run.

But he wants to be second fiddle.  I think what he really wants is playing with someone like Russell westbrook who would take the brunt of the media and not provide massive championship aspirations (Kawhi plus Russ isn't nearly enough) while still being LA

"1. The idea that LeBron is ""ball dominant"" is not borne out by the evidence. His USG&amp;#37; since his first Cleveland stint, when he WAS the offense, has averaged 31.2 for the last 8 seasons. Relative to how many points he scores and how many assists he gets that *uber*\-efficient. Compare LeBron's USG&amp;#37; over the last 8 years to somebody like James Harden or Russell Westbrook or prime-Kobe or NY Carmelo, and you'll see the difference. 2. Klay Thompson's ppg has not significantly decreased because he does the same thing he's always been doing: shooting 3's, long 2's, and layups. He's taking what are the most efficient shots for him AND what are the most efficient shots for the Warrior's offense overall. 3. The reason why Bosh and Love's ppg dropped was because they were versatile scorers: they could play in the post and shoot. Since post touches aren't really efficient ways for a team to score, even though they may be very efficient way for **players** to score, Bosh and Love had to give up an entire aspect of their game when they played with LeBron. If Klay was a post-player instead of a shooter, you can guarantee he would never get post touches on a team with Durant and Curry."

"You know what's up. This is the right move. Right now Steven Adams with Russell Westbrook should be the foundation of the Thunder. These two play with so much chemistry is insane. Adams and Westbrook is one of the best pick and roll duos which enables either Westbrook or Adams to get in the paint easy. If you surround them with great 3 point sharp shooters like a JR, Korver and teach Adams how to pass out of the paint if needed, to open players, which Westbrook already knows how to do then this team will be great."
"Russell Westbrook has gone down a series of unfortunate events. The Thunder have drafted Kevin Durant in 2007, drafted Russell Westbrook in 2008, and James Harden in 2009. The 3 made it to the NBA Finals in 2012 and well Lebron James happened. At the end of 2012-13 season James Harden left for money. Russell Westbrook got in a serious injury in 2014. Kevin Durant got injured in 2015. The Thunder bounced back and made it to 3-1 in the 2015-16 Western conference finals to the Warriors and lost. Kevin Durant left in 2016.  Westbrook is left alone. Westbrook gets all the blame but Westbrook won MVP in 2017. Thunder gives Westbrook the keys to the team by giving him a supermax contract.  Westbrook has tried all that he could to save this organization. I really don't think this team got enough time to gel and things happened really quickly. It's a bit unfair for all the flack Westbrook gets though."

"Damn. That’s dope. I never thought about Russell Westbrook from that perspective but it completely makes sense now that I think about it.  I always considered him to be the ignorant idgaf-type, but I never considered how empowering and alien that could be in a place like Oklahoma."
"Yea. I have a high pain tolerance and determination.   But what struck me after watching the game tape is how I received zero medical attention and the other player wasnt kicked out of the game. It was a small town in Oklahoma that wasn't very fond of me regardless of how good I was at basketball.  I was a Filipino kid from out of town (Cali) and this was near the  Arkansas border. Some games I would only play a few minutes when I could probably take on that whole team, and ours, 1-on-everybody. So it could have been a cultural prejudice thing, or it could have been a cultural behind-the-times on player safety thing, but regardless, it did feel like some sort of hit was put on me, and the coaches should have pulled me out of the game because I was limping all game (but playing well) and for some reason this was the only game where I got a ton of minutes..   And this is exactly why I ride or die Russell Westbrook. He represents an outside culture that that side of the state completely despises and will forever refuse acceptance of. Russell's success is bigger than basketball in that state. I can see why he would never want to play anywhere else just to open doors for those Oklahoma kids who are ""different"" in the state of Oklahoma. His fashion and attitude are a big iconic ""fuck you"" to uber-conservative values."

If KD wins a ring for the Supersonics he will certainly rank #1 on my all-time-traveling list regardless of other accomplishments.  If he goes back to OKC and wins another one I will be amazed that they traded Russell Westbrook after all the loyalty he delivered to their mailboxes.

a) Let's not pretend like players vote is any kind of gospel. They voted Harden for MVP in 2015. Look at their all star ballots when they were given a vote in 2017 etc   b) Let's acutally look at the players quoted here   1) Jared Sullinger his former teammate   2) Portland's back court. You know who Bradley actually has good defensive data against? Portland. Vs Dame Lillard from 2015-17 here's how he faired   167 poss 173 points Boston allowed on those poss held Dame to 13/39 FG 38 points 6 TO    3) Devin Booker. Look how he faired against him this year: forced him to 7 TOs and only 4 shot attempts when matched up   https://on.nba.com/2tOgQae  4) Evan Fournier: Look at how he faired defending Fournier that season vs him. Held him to 2/10 shooting   https://on.nba.com/2yYxFoL  So yes if Avery Bradley played defense against everybody in the NBA like he did those guys he would be a true top defender who makes a major impact. Against those guys he played true top defense who are commenting.   Problem is that's not always the case at all. Go ask guys like Russell Westbrook who he torched that year what they think of his defense.   
"How does it give more investment opportunities? Just because tech companies thrive there? Also, can we break this illusion that the Bay Area is this magical place ripe with zillions of investment ideas. There are a shit-load of companies out of Seattle, Portland, New York, Atlanta, etc.  I still have seen ZERO factual evidence that pro athletes benefit from investment opportunities simply by playing for a team in the Bay Area.  I am quite sure, for example, Russell Westbrook and his $30mm/year has the same opportunities to invest in Bay Area tech start ups as anyone on the Warriors roster.  Because technology executives go to games that means these dudes have opportunities to invest in their companies? All I ask, please show me some proof that these Warriors players have ""way more"" investment opportunities than any other mega-stars with millions of dollars? Outside of the fact that Steph Curry and Andre Igoudala lead the PLAYERS Technology Summit. This is not something at all affiliated with the NBA, it is something they chose to do on their own.  Now, if you said that they have more interest in tech because being in the Bay Area, sure, I might believe that."

Its his nickname, stop trying to give it to others.  - Gortat: The Polish Hammer: I don't think he's good enough for it. He peaked as a nice starter, that nickname sounds badass  Ones I wish caught on  - DeMarcus Cousins: Bun-DMC: I made this up, its a combinatin of initials and him being a big man.  - Dennis Smith Jr.: Leading up to the 2017 draft everyone refered to him as DSJ so I thought it would be funny to refer to him as a random combination of words starting with D, S, and J everytime."

Autocorrect changed Russell Westbrook to Russert Westworld and I didn't bother correcting it but I just thought you should know.
All I'm saying is pick on someone your own size. Why not cite evidence against his last game against a similar aged/frame Jalen Brunson? Oh wait. Because that doesn't fit your narrative as Jalen Brunson abused him in the post. Picking on smaller dudes ain't gonna work in a league full with men like John Wall and Russell Westbrook. 
PG - Russell Westbrook SG - Jimmy Butler SF - Kawhi Leonard PF - Giannis Alphabet C - Karl-Anthony Towns  Bench:  PG - Damien Lillard SG - Bradley Beal SF - Paul George PF - Lamarcus Aldridge C - DeAndre Jordan  Will that beat the warriors? please lmao
"Give me Rose as the best athlete, it’s a shame that he got injured and a lot of young fans didn’t get to see the athleticism at its peak  Rose had a higher vertical than Russell by 4 inches.........   Was faster with or without the ball And I would say equal strength, maybe Russell by a hair  But from just the eye test, Rose had all the measurables but from an asthetic standpoint he just seemed much more graceful  I always tell people the Derrick Rose was Westbrook athleticism with Kyries grace"
His ceiling is a better shooting and defending Russell Westbrook. 
"""Here's OKC's other MVP Russell Westbrook, after he got traded to the Clippers, a mere 3 years after winning the MVP, back in his first game in Oklahoma, as he finishes with a triple double"" "
"Your daily reminder - Derrick Favors is 26 right now (will hit 27 next month). He is younger than John Wall, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry (just examples). "
"You should look at [538's CARM-Elo projections](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/dennis-smith-jr/). They're based on how similar players careers played out.   DSJ is most similar to:  - Emmanuel Mudiay  - Brandon Jennings  - D'angelo Russell  - Russell Westbrook  - Brandon Knight  - Stephon Marbury  - Sebastian Telfair  - Dajuan Wagner  - Mike Conley  - Tyreke Evans  In other words, there's a massive range of outcomes still in play. And while I'd like to believe he's the next Westbrook or Marbury, Knight and Evans looked really special for a while as well. So who knows? I'd rather not set us up with expectations that he'll be MVP."
Mark Cuban doesn't like this comparison since Russell Westbrook isn't a superstar
Interesting. How was Russell westbrook in terms of trouble in okc?
Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook
CMV: Kyle Singler is a better player than Russell Westbrook
I remember Hollinger that year saying that Russell Westbrook was the closest to Derrick Rose in terms of their game and not being taken seriously. 
"Chris, Kyrie, Russell  Alternatively, Irving, Paul, Westbrook."
"Every big city is like that and i think NY has lower output uf you factor in population than a lot of cities. James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Kawhi Leonard  and Demar DeRozen are examples of players playing right now in the NBA from LA. you have to go back to Bob Cousey as an example on why NY is a basketball mecca. lol also Mark Jackson really.  "
The inverse is possible too.  The triple double went from being extraordinary to somewhat unremarkable in the 2 years Russell Westbrook averaged one.
"Giannis, Embiid, John Wall, Russell Westbrook ..."
Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook = Paul Pogba.  Both are elite players who get tons of unnecessary hate &amp; criticism, and make a lot of flashy plays and are very fun to watch. "
"Ahah, i'm happy you pointed this out. I intentionally didn't include Wilt and Russell because:  Wilt is perhaps the most egregious stat padder of all time and didn't make his teammates better until much later in his career.   The idea that Wilt was just WAY more talented than Russell and that if they each swapped teams, people would say Wilt is the GOAT is actually just bs. I was talking to someone else about this and I said that in terms of ability, no accolades or anything, I STILL don't consider Wilt Top 20 all time due to how disgustingly not team oriented his play style was. I'll try and find it actually.   "" Eh. He's a glorified Draymond Green. Excellent defender, good playmaker but awful scorer ( Draymond isn't even a bad scorer mind you). I don't know if that skillset would be enough to make you Top 20 in ability for me considering the importance of scoring.  That being said, I do think he's better than Wilt, which seems like a massive contradiction, but Wilt was the original Westbrook in regards to overratedness. He was probably the most egregious stat padder in sports history and is the definition of Empty Calorie Stats. Didn't elevate his teammates play for years, but people look back at his stats and faun over them whilst saying Russell's team had X Hall of Famer's, whilst ignoring that Wilt's team was stacked af as well.  1. People criticize Russell for playing against worse competition, but seem to forget that Wilt played against the same competition he did ._. so I'm not sure how you could criticise Russell but not Wilt. Not you personally of course, just people in general.  2. I know that this phrase is usually said alot by dumbasses who want an excuse to criticise an individual on a bad team, but in this instance it would be accurate to say that his play style just didn't convert to meaningful wins for a lot of his career. So whilst his ability may be better than Russell's in vacuum / one on one scenario, it just wasn't very conducive to success.  3. A lot of his statistical achievements were the result of extreeeeeme, ludicrous amounts of stat padding, and a ridiculously fast pace. When you look at his pace adjusted stats, ( which were 27/12 on 58% shooting I believe, for the regular season) AND take into account the much much weaker era he played in, AND take into account the fact he padded his stats, AND that everything took a huge dip in the playoffs, I'm not quite sure he's better than Russell to be honest. ""  That's why I said in regards to my analysis I said "" context, and a grain of salt "" earlier haha. This one of the few instances in which rings can straight up be used in a comparison due to the massive amount of help that each player was given, but the lack of success one had relative to the other.   Rings are evidence of you being a good team player but are still diluted by a variety of other factors. For example, has there ever been a situation in NBA history where the best player on the best team in his prime can repeat with 2FMVP's, and STILL not be considered the best player in the world? Despite the fact that KD has beaten Lebron back to back, most people are aware of the fact that outside of Lebron his Cleveland team is complete and utter garbage compared to KD's, and that him winning a championship means nothing. Similarly, Larry Bird won 3 BACK TO BACK MVP's during the middle of the Showtime Lakers dominance, whilst Magic didn't win an MVP until after the 3rd championship. What does that tell you? That  despite the team success, no one thought Magic was better than Bird whilst they were playing together. Despite the fact that Magic had a better team and was in the easier conference, and that Bird was a better scorer, a better rebounded and a better defender, people somehow magically put ( lol pun wasn't even intented ) Magic over Bird solely due to championships, despite the fact that Bird is definitely better individually and has an argument for being the better team player too.  Basically to me, rings are often more about opportunity than they are ability / team playerness. If Garnett and Duncan traded draft scenarios, Garnett is now the GOAT PF in most people's minds. If Lebron and Kobe swap drafting situations, Lebron is probably the undisputed GOAT in most people's minds.   Apologies for the length btw, don't know how these end up so long."
I used to hate Westbrook because of his demeanor. But a few years ago I saw some special on ESPN about his friendship with his childhood bff that was suppose to go to UCLA with him. The friend passed away and Russell wears a wristband with his name or number(can’t remember. Will look it up when not on mobile) still to this day. Those interviews really showed a lot about him as a person. 
Paul George wanted to stay because of his relationship with Russell Westbrook. Had little to do with LeBron. J.R. has majorly declined. He got plenty of looks next to LeBron and Kyrie yet sucked the last two years. Tristan hasn’t evolved his game much. 
Honestlyo the way I think about it is the 10th best player in the league is like giannis or Anthony Davis Russell westbrook level. Like you got kawhi curry harden durant giannis davis westbrook cp3. I'd say the difference between Durant and #7 of those guys is less than the difference between Durant and bron. More of a statement that there are another really good 6-7 guys and bron is still clearly ahead of Durant
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there. Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy."" My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."
"The move was all about showing Russell Westbrook they will do whatever it takes to win after coming so close.  Has nothing to do with people’s personal opinion, because we ALL know hindsight is 20/20."
"2nd best grizzlies player who was the leader / heart of the team, decent offensive player as a 2nd option, decent defender, good distributor, and he got his contract in the year of the cap spike, and the grizzlies team felt like they needed to overpay to keep him because his production (at the time) wasn't easily replaced.  He threatened to leave probably so I'd believe it if they needed to keep him and chose to max him so that he wouldn't look elsewhere. (It worked out for him because he got hurt and the market space for aging, short, not-chris-paul-or-russell-westbrook-or-steph-curry pointguards is waning very, very quickly.)"
Russell Westbrook averages a Triple Double for a 3rd season in a row. 
imagine thinking this  **Top 10:**  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. James Harden  5. Anthony Davis  6. Kawhi Leonard  7. Russell Westbrook  8. Giannis Antetokunmpo   9. Joel Embiid  10. Chris Paul
whatever he has shit knees - https://www.si.com/nba/point-forward/2013/12/27/russell-westbrook-knee-surgery-injury-update-oklahoma-city-thunder-all-star - at some point hes going to become a 40M per year albatross of a contract 
"I like to imagine Russell Westbrook driving up to the MidFirst Bank drive thru in Edmond and the teller asking him if he’d like to deposit his handwritten $35 million check from Clay Bennett into his checking or his savings, or if he’d like it cashed in $20 bills."
"This narrative is new. Prior to KD leaving the critique was about his decision making and BBall-IQ, I think people forget OKC had to turn him from a defensive combo-guard into a ball handler and decision maker who could run an offense, he didn't come out of school like that.  His Draft profile is literally: &gt;A gym rat, really works hard to improve Has a great attitude, extremely coach-able  Every single year OKC did a review they highlighted his coachability. And how he was adapting into more of a passer/ball handler.  Every single coach/assistant coach he's ever had has talked about how coach-able he is.  Most articles prior to 2015 talk about coachability as a strength point :  &gt;COACHABILITY  &gt; Much to the disbelief of many of his critics, Westbrook is extremely coachable. Being coachable in the day and age of professional prima donnas is something quite rare. Coach Brooks has taken up for Westbrook in the past, stating that, ""Russell is a very passionate player."" [source](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1133858-5-reasons-that-russell-westbrook-is-the-real-mvp-of-the-oklahoma-city-thunder)  &gt; Brooks, a former NBA point guard, sees Westbrook's rise as more of a long-term endeavor. Westbrook didn't even play the point during his two seasons at UCLA, but made the switch after he was drafted fourth overall in 2008. He took over as the starting point guard on a team that was on pace for the worst record in NBA history and ended up leading the league in turnovers, only to develop within two years into an All-Star and the Thunder's go-to guy behind Durant. ""It's not fair to him,"" Brooks said. ""It's really not fair to him. ... He gets criticized for every bad game. He's not the only player that has a bad game. He's not going to be the only player in the future that has bad games.""The only thing that I can say about that: Russell knows what he needs to do, and we talk to him and he's coachable and he wants to get better. He controls his improvement."" [Source](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-criticism-and-stardom-for-thunders-westbrook-2011may04-story.html)     "

I’m pretty sure Russell Westbrook wears whatever the fuck he wants. 
Props to Russell Westbrook and James Harden for being loyal
"When high draft picks struggle initially and become free agents for the first time, some folks around the league refer to this as their “second draft.” The hope is that a new team can unlock the potential that once made them top picks. Over these last few weeks, we have examined players who fall into that category.  Today: Zach LaVine, by contributors Steve Jones Jr. and Jordan Brenner.  In January of 2016 Sam Mitchell, then the coach of the Timberwolves, gave an interview to MinnPost about the challenges of coaching his young team. He spent a significant amount of time talking about Zach LaVine, the team’s second-year guard who was still having trouble learning fundamental NBA concepts. The mistakes Mitchell referenced were so basic that it seemed impossible that an NBA guard would struggle in these areas: understanding how to set up his man to get open on a cut; realizing that he should have thrown a lob pass instead of a bounce pass when the 6-foot-11 Gorgui Dieng was being guarded by 6-foot Jameer Nelson; dribbling immediately after catching the ball and then picking the ball up, rather than starting in triple-threat position.  But LaVine was just 20 at the time. He’d played a season and a half of NBA basketball and just one year in college—where he came off the bench for UCLA. Mitchell realized that LaVine had never received the coaching that would have instilled these habits within him, and thus it was Mitchell’s responsibility to teach the young guard:  Now people will say, “He should know that.” Well, we can’t take for granted that he does, because he showed last night that he don’t. So we have to teach everything. If we forget one thing, it bites us in the ass. If we forget telling our guy not to walk up but to step in and now break and get open, then we don’t get open.  More than two years later, though, it is still unclear whether LaVine is capable of growing his game to the point where these basic responsibilities become second nature. He was always regarded as an exceptional athlete; some folks compared him to another explosive guard from UCLA, Russell Westbrook. The question was whether he had the skill and basketball IQ to go along with his athletic talents.  In Minnesota, the development plan seemed to be working to a certain degree. By LaVine’s third season, his efficiency had climbed considerably, in part because the Wolves didn’t put the ball in his hands as much: His usage rate was a career-low. Midway through that season, LaVine was averaging 18.9 ppg on a 54.4% effective field goal percentage, while posting a career-low turnover rate.  However, LaVine didn’t contribute to winning basketball. The Wolves were worse when he played than when he sat—sometimes markedly so—in each of his three seasons. Minnesota’s turnovers went up when LaVine was in the game, and the team’s defense got considerably weaker.  There were enough positive signs that even after LaVine tore his ACL in February of 2017, the Bulls made him a key part of their trade of Jimmy Butler. But in Chicago this past season, the old LaVine reemerged. His usage rate skyrocketed to the 96th percentile for wing players and his efficiency plummeted, reflected in his 44.3 effective field goal percentage. Perhaps his recovery from the injury was a factor, or perhaps that offensive burden was too much for him to carry at this stage of his career. Regardless, those struggles didn’t stop the Sacramento Kings from lavishing a four-year, $80 million offer sheet on him, nor the Bulls from matching it. As he heads into his fifth season, then, the question remains: Is LaVine simply the type of player who puts up empty numbers on bad teams, or can he really drive wins?  The signs aren’t particularly promising. For one, he hasn’t shown any indication that he can be a true playmaker—someone who can create offense both for himself and for others. He tends to be a ball-stopper who needs to hold the ball to isolate, and when he does attack, he can’t pick the defense apart with passes. The film doesn’t lie on this front.  Watch, for example, this clip from late this past season. LaVine comes off the pick and gets into the paint. But notice how Jarrell Martin sells out stop the drive, and how open Paul Zipser ends up in the corner. LaVine draws a foul, but he doesn’t make the right play.  Toggle slow motion in the video using the “SLOW” button. Jump back in the clip using the button. In the next play, against the Clippers, LaVine doesn’t wait for Cristiano Felicio to arrive for the pick-and-roll, and instead tries to drive as soon as he gets the ball. He gathers and comes off the second attempt at a screen, but DeAndre Jordan traps him. The best players in the game can’t be trapped on a pick-and-roll because they will punish defenses with the pass. But LaVine, who has Felicio on the roll and Bobby Portis cutting to the wing, instead tries to throw a skip pass to Kris Dunn that is easily intercepted.  Toggle slow motion in the video using the “SLOW” button. Jump back in the clip using the button. In the final clip of this sequence, LaVine attacks in transition and correctly reads that when Aron Baynes, the Celtics’ big man, steps up, he’ll have Baynes’ man open. But he doesn’t read the second-line of defense, Shane Larkin, coming in to take that away, and he ends up throwing a bounce pass that is easily swiped.  Toggle slow motion in the video using the “SLOW” button. Jump back in the clip using the button. Each of these plays shows a significant lack of basketball IQ and feel for the game. And those weaknesses show up in all sorts of areas, like not setting up his man off the ball. Here, he starts his cut early without creating space by first taking a step away from where he wants to go. Look at the lack of air space when LaVine comes off Portis’ screen and gets the handoff from Robin Lopez. That makes it easy for his man, Dillon Brooks, to recover, so the rest of the defense doesn’t have to help.  Toggle slow motion in the video using the “SLOW” button. Jump back in the clip using the button. Also notice how LaVine hesitates on the handoff, which gives Brooks even more time and allows Marc Gasol to get back to Lopez. And that, at the end of the play, when Lopez looks like he is going to set another pick for LaVine, LaVine is already driving before Lopez is set. That puts no pressure on Brooks or Gasol, and the result is a turnover.  That same habit shows up against Charlotte as well, when LaVine again fails to set up his man and goes right into a contested jumper.  Toggle slow motion in the video using the “SLOW” button. Jump back in the clip using the button. And in the next clip, LaVine screws up the timing of a play designed for him to set a screen before receiving a screen. He sets the flare screen for Portis early, so that he ends up trying to curl off a down screen that hasn’t yet been set. That ruins the spacing of the play, overloading one side of the court and giving him no room to operate. From there, LaVine goes into ball-stopper mode and commits an offensive foul.  Toggle slow motion in the video using the “SLOW” button. Jump back in the clip using the button. If you’re playing along at home, let’s go back to the problems Mitchell highlighted. Not setting up his man before a cut? Ding. Throwing a bounce pass when he should have thrown a lob or passed to someone else? Ding ding. Going too soon instead of waiting for a play to develop? Ding ding ding.  LaVine has certainly improved since his time under Sam Mitchell. But he remains behind the curve when it comes to both the little things as well as his big picture understanding of the game. And this is all without focusing on his defense, one of his most glaring weaknesses. So even though LaVine has the physical tools to put up big scoring numbers, he hasn’t shown much promise in being able to round out his game with a style that meshes with teammates and actually makes them better. And when you’re paying someone $20 million a year, that’s the type of impact you expect.  Steve Jones Jr. is a former assistant coach with the Brooklyn Nets and video coordinator with the Memphis Grizzlies. He played basketball at UNLV. You can find his breakdowns, video and lukewarm takes on Twitter @stevejones20."
I can’t stop smiling now thinking about Kevin Love singing Now I do what I want like Russell Westbrook 
"I don't see it happening. On top of Guards like Curry,Harden,Lillard,Westbrook,Butler,Derozan overshadowing. You got young guys like Booker,Beal,Mccollum,Simmons,Irving,Mitchell,Jamal Murray, and whoever else comes through the draft clearly overshadowing him. I'd say (and this is obviously just my opinion so don't put to much weight into it) Russell has a 10% chance at best of being an All-Star.  "
Westbrook is playing for his stats only. [Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYKolm75h8Y&amp;t=49s) and he doesn't even try on defense. &gt;James Harden has more than twice as many shots contested as Russell Westbrook this season   I don't undertand how Harden gets more hate than WB. Westbrook is even one of the biggest cry babys in the league. For real. 
"I mean, Michael Jordan at best would make the all-star team in this era  MJ hasn’t faced any of these ballers in his era: •LeBron James •Kevin Durant •Steph Curry •Kawhi Leonard •Giannis Antetokounmpo •Kyrie Irving •Anthony Davis •Kristaps Porzingis •James Harden •Russell Westbrook •Chris Paul •Paul George •Damian Lillard •Klay Thompson *etc.  Also, Steve Kerr told a reporter during the finals that he himself wouldn’t stand a chance in today’s basketball ~&gt; that says a lot because Steve Kerr was a key piece to the 95-96 Bulls who were known as the best team in history before the Warriors took the NBA by storm  That’s my 2 cents, this 1’s for free "
Same can be said about Russell Westbrook. 
"&gt; bricks open threes   so does russell westbrook, why don't we cut him"
"I don’t agree with that.  Russell Westbrook is a great player, who is not known for having a great basketball iq regularly gets 10 assists. Tim Duncan who I think averages almost exactly 20 and 10 for his career, is one the highest bball iq players of all time.  Yes, I know those are sorta extreme examples and can be countered by using two different players so maybe not the best example but just trying to show my thinking.  “How you’re used” is exactly right tho. The 10 assist player could be a very average passer/high turnover player who just has an extremely high usage.  Feel like I’m dragging this on so my bad, just don’t agree with the assists show iq idea tho. "
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook and Magic Johnson would be the best anything ever.
"“People love you at the beginning,"" Embiid explains. ""But at some point they're gonna start hating you. LeBron. Russell Westbrook. All the superstars. Even Steph. He's so likable. He does nothing wrong, but some people still hate him. It just comes with the nature of it. I've seen it. I feel like I'm about to go through it. I think it's coming. People always want something new."""
"Yeah totally, as soon as OKC got him I was worried PG would stay. I’d be scared if Kawhi went to a good franchise, but Kyle Lowry is over the hill and Demar is a third rate faux-superstar.  You don’t have a Russell Westbrook.  Leonard’s not gonna stick around to play with those serial chokers.  Plus you’d have to unload all your depth to get him so I’d cry tears of joy if he went to Toronto.  If he went to Boston, or Philly, or even a team like Milwaukee I’d be shaking in my boots because there would be a real chance they could build something there.  "
"Bro just look at Loves and Boshs rebounding alone. Westbrook gets more assists and it's still hard for guys to coexist with him. All numbers aren't equal. Wily averaged like 50 and 25 and still loses to Russell. Wilt wasnt a winner and wasn't a team player but still led the league in assists which is something lebron has never done. Meanwhile Russell could have been putting up much better stats but knew it was a team game and let his teammates shine. Looking at the numbers like you people would think Wilt must have won all the titles. It's play on the court game by game for what's needed to win, not paper stats"
I don’t think I’ve ever seen any fan base overhype the fuck out of someone who doesn’t deserve like our fan base does with Rodrigue Beaubois. He was basically a shitty version of Russell Westbrook. 
Seattle/OKC  PG: Gary Payton  SG: Russell Westbrook  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Rashard Lewis  C: Jack Sikma  OKC only:  PG: Russell Westbrook  SG: James Harden  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Serge Ibaka  C: Nick Collison
"""Russ, no doubt. I do not see steph getting much better than he is now. He is phenomenal right now though and no disrespect, but I think he has the lowest ceiling of the three. Kyrie still has a lot of developing to do, so I think he is a close second. Russell Westbrook is by far the best athlete of those three, and he can do everything. His jumpshot is getting much better, his assists are pretty good and is one of the best rebounding point guards. I feel like his ceiling is limitless.   Another thing is Russell is like a mini lebron in that he just doesn't get hurt *knock on wood*. Curry has ankle problems and Kyrie has missed a lot of games this year. Troubling trend. ""  DAMN!"
"https://youtu.be/YVitzGz9g2s  Now, I know coach Nick has a hate boner for Westbrook, but his defensive criticism has always been valid. Westbrook has *awful* defensive awareness, is too instinctive for his own good (often times would rather chance a steal than stay in position) and has a pathetic engagement level for a player of his athletic gifts.   But do show me your hard evidence of great defender Russell Westbrook. He’s no better than Harden."

"I’ve been to a few WNBA games. It was fun enough for free tickets. No amount of marketing money is going to make me spend more of my limited entertainment budget on the WNBA though, when I can watch superhumans dunk from outside the paint and throw 60mph bullet passes to guys who hit a jumper from 27 feet away off with a hand in their face. Would you rather watch a WNBA player’s excellent handle as she sprints to the basket for a layup in traffic, or watch Russell Westbrook flinging bodies aside like a freight train and then tomahawk dunking over some dude and then staring him down like a predatory animal? I know which one I find more exciting."
"This one is fun:  &gt; Russ, no doubt. I do not see steph getting much better than he is now. He is phenomenal right now though and no disrespect, but I think he has the lowest ceiling of the three. Kyrie still has a lot of developing to do, so I think he is a close second. Russell Westbrook is by far the best athlete of those three, and he can do everything. His jumpshot is getting much better, his assists are pretty good and is one of the best rebounding point guards. I feel like his ceiling is limitless.  &gt; Another thing is Russell is like a mini lebron in that he just doesn't get hurt knock on wood. Curry has ankle problems and Kyrie has missed a lot of games this year. Troubling trend. "
**Russell Westbrook**: He's a straight up beast and could protect me from any predators. He'd probably be willing to do all the dangerous stuff too. It might seem like he's gonna go off the deep end but you know his heart is in the right place and he's got your back. He knows everything about snakes too and could trap them for easy nutrition and poison for the next guy I'd bring....   **Zach Randolph**: If things sadly don't work out and we're desperate we can kill him and eat him because he's one *thicc boi*.  **Klay Thompson**: He would keep us all sane and it would be like we never left the normal life. Probably because he's completely oblivious to the severity of the situation.
"I think you're undervaluing the how good he was during the 19 seasons he was in the league. Averaged a double-double, all-time steals and assist leader (Records that may NEVER be broken), making the playoffs in each of those years. If I was starting a franchise and I had the choice between John Stockton and Russell Westbrook I'd choose Stockton every time. He makes plays that win you games. "
"Joel Embiid - Dude is huge can be valuable, and will bring laughter in tough times.   Ben Simmons - He's also jacked, and has the vision of an eagle. I can see him throwing spears to catch prey to cook  Russell Westbrook - I think this man would genuinely fight a bear, and wouldn't back down, I'm not saying he'll beat the bear... but he's definitely a fox hole guy."
yeah when he just got drafted  https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=russell+westbrook+supersonics&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB710GB711&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiay7C4sJrcAhUxMuwKHY3NCUwQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=799#imgrc=YVAT6RddExd38M:
"He was just wrong for saying every teammate. That was my main issue. It’s just not true. Kyrie didn’t like LeBron for off and on court reasons. It’s an example that’s been in everyone’s face for two years now.  Find me examples of people having issues with their super star teammates. No one actually complains about Anthony Davis, James Harden, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Giannis, Kyrie, etc.  It’s not about having majority support. It’s a flag that multiple people are unwilling to play with you. I’m not saying he’s cancerous or bad. He’s a fucking legend. He’s just a guy who has had his system and it revolves around him (because he’s great) and it comes at the expense of people around him. I’m not even saying that’s selfish or wrong for him to do, because it literally gets him to the finals every year. It may be what’s best for the team, but in the end, it doesn’t make other players overall games better."

Russell Westbrook with the greatest alley oop dunk of the past decade.      [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEg7Kx7ln2w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEg7Kx7ln2w)
"He'd be even more athletic today. People criticize all the past greats for their level of competition, especially Jordan cuz of the LeBron debate and Wilt/Russell cuz 60s milkmen. But if they were playing modern competition, they'd also have access to the modern advances in weight training, nutrition, shooting coaching, etc that make today's players better across the board. And the multimillion dollar therapies they use to stave off aging, and the minutes and games restrictions that give them more rest.  Jordan would've been like a cross between Westbrook and Rose. Dr J would've been a LeBron-esque combo of size and leaping, albeit leaner. Wilt would've been like a 7'1 300+ pound LeBron or Dwight, he was a monster specimen back in the 60s and early 70s. Like 310 and chiseled in his Lakers days, ran a sub-50 second 400 meters back in high school, when track world records were way slower than they are today.  Barkley, Hakeem, Rodman, Karl Malone, etc would all be freakier too, and some of them would thrive even more in this positionless, skilled, shooting dominated era than they did their own. And many of them probably could've had some LeBron/Duncan/Dirk-esque longevity, have primes that last til ~33, play effectively til they're 40."
Russell Westbrook could design us clothing and furniture.   Steven Adams could chase down wild hogs.  Kevin Durant because he would be arguing with 17 year olds online and that would help us get rescued.
"Player tracking shows that Curry isn't far behind Westbrook in distance traveled per game. He's constantly scrambling around the court off ball while most players get their rest, and gets insane amounts of attention and physicality from the defense while doing so. When Russell doesn't have the ball, he's standing around. Just because Russ has a high usage rate doesn't mean he's physically exerting himself much more dramatically than Curry is. There's a difference between the two, but it's close.   Embiid is a massive, out of shape center. Not at all comparable. And bringing up Harden's playoff decline is pretty rich considering Westbrook's playoff decline is even worse.   Further, Curry is spectacular at opening up the floor for non-shooters, probably better than Westbrook is. Guys like Livingston, Iggy, McGee, and Dray get comically open dunks all the time because Steph commands so much attention in transition and off of any kind of screen.   Westbrook is able to create in the half court by exploding to the basket and creating seams, but Curry can do the same thing without being as explosive because defenders can't sag off him on the perimeter.   Again, I'm just not sure what this ""Westbrook is better with a bad team"" theory is based on other than his ridiculous volume stats, which come from a historically high level of usage.  "
Russell Westbrook because he'll try to do everything himself so I can just kick back and relax.  Klay because he'd be really chill and his accuracy will help with spearing fish and stuff.  Kevin Durant because if a ship passes by he'll be the first one to hop on and I can follow him. Also he can grab stuff out of trees for me.
"&gt; But Horford picked a four-year, $113 million deal with the Celtics over the Thunder, reportedly wanting assurances he couldn't get from Durant and Russell Westbrook that they'd be around long term.  &gt;Thunder general manager Sam Presti confirmed Horford was ""really, really interested"" in the Thunder.  Yes they would, as they have signed OG to his deal."
"The issue at hand is that the Thunder changed very dramatically over Durant's time there. He was a consensus top-2 player, between him and LeBron, before he got hurt and Westbrook became the player we know him as today. He hasn't been the same since the injury, though in KD's case that puts him as ""only"" a top-6 player rather than the record-shattering pace he projected to before that.  Westbrook's rise led to a lot of KD vs. Westbrook debate, with the consensus towards the end of the year beginning [to trend in Westbrook's direction](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-wasnt-supposed-to-get-better-than-kevin-durant/). It wasn't until Westbrook's later playoff failures that it shifted back. I used the MVP vote simply as a proxy for showing where the majority of media members were placing him at the time that KD left for a Finals-losing team.  I was incorrect to use ""outside of 2013"" rather than ""after 2013"", but to pretend that the KD who went to Golden State is the same player who won the MVP is disingenuous. It's the kind of argument used by people who form their opinions from Reddit circlejerks rather than any sort of actual analysis, because he hasn't been a consensus top-2 player for *years* now."
LeBron James  .  .  .  .   .   .    Kevin Durant  Stephen Curry  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Giannis Antetokounmpo   Russell Westbrook  Kyrie Irving  Paul George  DeMarcus Cousins  (Kawhi top 5 if not injured)
"[This one's better.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-wasnt-supposed-to-get-better-than-kevin-durant/) I'm not sure why the MVP voting doesn't count as consensus here, but there's plenty that was written that season placing Westbrook over Durant, no matter how butthurt people want to be in hindsight."
"[You're changing history to fit your narrative. This was a common belief at the time.](https://newsok.com/article/5480937/oklahoma-city-thunder-whos-better-kevin-durant-or-russell-westbrook)  If Durant were considered the 2nd best player at the time, he would've actually made top-3 MVP voting at some point outside of 2013. What you're saying is not what happened, and being dismissive doesn't change that."
"TBF, UCLA was his school of choice since his older brother was there and they wanted him and strongly encouraged him to walk on.  Racism was likely still the main culprit, but the problem was that their guards were all too good to give Lin a chance and they had just given a scholarship to a different under-recruited big/long combo guard named Russell Westbrook and they weren't about to risk him over an Asian guy."
Russell Westbrook. 
"PG is staying in OKC because of Russell Westbrook. Furthermore, if you think Kawhi is going to play in another country over going to LA with Lebron, when he's already said he wants to return home, I have ocean front property to sell you in Kansas."
"So what if his offensive game was reliant on his athleticism. Russell Westbrook game relies heavily on his athleticism as well, are we really going to say he's not an elite offensive talent. Same thing with Shaq, he's not the Shaq we know without his size and strength. That shouldn't be a knock against his overall game.   The fact is prime, Dwight got buckets on very good efficiency and wasn't spoon fed buckets the way a guy like Deandre was playing with CP3. The best guard he played with was Jameer Nelson, who was no doubt a good player but wasn't an elite playmaker by any stretch. That Magic team that went to the finals was built around Dwight's offensive and defensive abilities, so yeah I think it's fair to say he's an elite 2 way player"

"yeah California All State is a huge deal, it's the US's most populous state (40 million compared to 2nd place Texas at 30 million) and they love basketball (Lakers, Warriors, Kings, UCLA, etc).

"You can't really answer that question because there are players in the NBA right now that are probably top-20 like KD, Curry and CP3 but are not given their due because they are still active. The older you are, the more legendary you become and hence ranked higher. How is Oscar Robertson better than Russell Westbrook? No one has watched him yet he is ranked in the top-10 almost unanimously. "
"Russell Westbrook willing his team to the L, going 4-15 in the fourth quarter in a playoff game. "
I thought that was a quote from Russell Westbrook. He said something like that before.
Good for Russell Westbrook. He already looks like a TMNT
"People forget cause that's not true.  LaMarcus Aldridge was never a top ten player for a season.   EDIT: Am I crazy?

Not for me at all.   1) You can see the impact Luc has on a teams defense   2016-17:   Clippers def rating with CP3 DeAndre Jordan and no Luc Mbah Moute: 105.3   Clippers Def rating with CP3 DAJ and Luc together: 96.0   Rockets last year:   Hou defensive rating with Harden+ Luc Mbah Moute+ CP3: 95.0  Hou defensive rating with Harden+ CP3 but no Luc: 108.5   2) I looked this up but per matchup data the past 3-4 years on over 1700 poss when guarding Russell Westbrook/LeBron/Giannis/Paul George/Jimmy Butler/Dame Lillard/Gordon Hayward/Kawhi Leonard/Kevin Durant he held them collectively to 39% shooting. LeBron and Dame in particular he held to 31% and 21% shooting in &gt;120 poss each.   Overall an extremely versatile and hounding on ball defender.   3) Not only has he shot 36-37% from 3 the past 2 years combined he's a very good slasher on close outs. Shot 32nd out of 180 qualifiers on drives last year   https://on.nba.com/2KPN4NC  
Thunderstruck II: LeBron James and Russell Westbrook swap bodies. LeBron's BBIQ in Westbrook's body makes the Thunder threepeat who says no
That moment you remember Russell Westbrook was the Pac-10 defensive player of the year in 2007-08. Random but all the comments about his defense just reminded me of that. 
"Never had a problem with the Warriors or even Boogie who supposedly didn't even get a call and made the best decision for him. Kevin Durant. That's the guy that I have an issue with. Not because he left but because he went to the Warriors. You went to the team that you should have beaten but instead choked it away. And the worst part is, he left Russell Westbrook as the sole scapegoat, however valid the criticisms against him or not. Russ gets the large bulk of the blame for the way that series ended but last I remember, KD played too. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth that he mostly gets a free pass for how that series turned out because blaming Russ is so easy. That doesn't sit well with me at all. "
"Impressive, but isn't the consensus around here that triple-doubles don't equal wins - i.e. Russell Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook is loyal af and plays harder than every other player every night. 
"Russell Westbrook and Young Thug.  Fashion icons, very polarizing, a Russ chaotic fastbreak is like a piece of flawed but brilliant art just like Young Thug's adlibs and harmonizing. "
"""The most tired trope of the offseason: ""Oh, the Thunder re-signed Paul George? How cute. Enjoy losing in the first round!""  What were they supposed to do? Let George walk because they aren't as good as the Warriors and Rockets, and re-enter single-star purgatory until the inevitable Russell Westbrook trade?""  Thaaaaaank you Zach"

this time. but 9/10 times it will result in an easy bucket for the opponents.

You were able to slip it in, but unfortunately your little sidekick went limp before the job was done, and you puttered out with no victory in the end.  Kristaps Porzingis: That long-legged volleyball chick you couldn’t close on because she was so tall you couldn't nibble on her neck while dancing at the club.

MARKELLE FULTZ: She’s the cutie who laughs at everything you do while you play guitar hero in your buddy’s living room at midnight. When her friend makes a comment that she’s underage, your heart sinks knowing it will be a couple years before anything happens.  DRAYMOND GREEN: The first girl you did anal with. She took you on a 45 minute cab ride from the bar to her place, leads you to her room, puts it in for you, and after 4 or 5 thrusts you realize your in brown town. You wake up the next morning an hour away from home, your wallet's missing, and only your weed dealer is willing to make the drive to pick you up. He’s got a lit joint waiting for you when he arrives.  MICHAEL JORDAN: In your dreams."
Westbrook did that same type of stuff with harden and durant on the team.   You dont remember magic johnson saying westbrook played the worst point in nba finals history for freezing out teammates and jacking up too many shots in 2012?

I made a somewhat hotly contested but no upvoted post about Russell Westbrook being the best individual player in the league with stats to back it the season before he averaged a triple double and won mvp. I'm not saying his brand of basketball wins championships or is even sustainable but by the numbers he has been the most dominant individual player in the league the last two years imo.

JAMES HARDEN: She’s the cheerleader you hooked up with in the dorms who never shaved her privates. You went down on her, but fatigue set in quickly, as you’d never navigated such dense bush before. You were able to slip it in, but unfortunately your little sidekick went limp before the job was done, and you puttered out with no victory in the end.  Kristaps Porzingis: That long-legged volleyball chick you couldn’t close on because she was so tall you couldn't nibble on her neck while dancing at the club. And neck-kissing at the club is the only move you've got.  JOEL EMBIID: She posted your dick pick on twitter after you dumped her. The next day she posts a photo of a bigger one captioned ""I found a better slant.""  MARKELLE FULTZ: She’s the cutie who laughs at everything you do while you play guitar hero in your buddy’s living room at midnight. When her friend makes a comment that she’s underage, your heart sinks knowing it will be a couple years before anything happens.  DRAYMOND GREEN: The first girl you did anal with. She took you on a 45 minute cab ride from the bar to her place, leads you to her room, puts it in for you, and after 4 or 5 thrusts you realize your in brown town. You wake up the next morning an hour away from home, your wallet's missing, and only your weed dealer is willing to make the drive to pick you up. He’s got a lit joint waiting for you when he arrives.  MICHAEL JORDAN: In your dreams."
This is absolutely true. I named my dog after Russell Westbrook but I think I love Steven Adams more

I was on IG and was seeing people say Russell Westbrook deserved a 99 overall in 2K.   Like Not even Lebron gets a 99.

You just described Russell Westbrook
"Oscar Robertson came very close in 1962 by being only half rebound behind teammate Wayne Embry.  Fat Lever led the Denver Nuggets in rebounding in 1989/1990 and Magic Johnson also led his Los Angeles Lakers in rebounding for two seasons in 1982/1983.  I checked Oscar, Magic and Fat because those are the three best rebounders at the PG position that I could think of outside of Russell Westbrook.  "
"Besides the King of the Boards, Russell Westbrook, who’s another backcourt player who led his team in rebounding ?"
Can they grab more rebounds than Russell Westbrook ?
Those guys doesn’t even have more rebounds than Russell Westbrook
But can they grab more rebounds than Russell Westbrook ?
"‪Bruh relaaaaax, chill out...‬  ‪I’m not lying lol he led the league in fourth quarter points, he‬ led the league in points in the clutch, he hit game-winner after game-winner ([link in case you wanna relive some](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/4/11/15261172/russell-westbrook-clutch-highlights-buzzer-beater-mvp)) and idk if there’s numbers for this, but the amount of double-digit fourth quarter comebacks he single-handedly lead that season was absurd.   I’m not a huge numbers guy in the first place and I don’t get why people are, but since you seem to be, in the clutch:  You realize that Russ had a net rating of +21.7 (116.7 ORTG and 95.0 DRTG) in the clutch that year? That is just absurd for a player who played at such a high usage rate in the clutch.  Idk if you just don’t know the game that well or not but, those shooting percentages mean jack shit in terms of how good of a player u were, especially in the clutch where good shots are harder to come by and offense becomes iso-heavy.  ie:  - Kobe shot .397 FG and .282 3PT  - Pierce shot .387 FG and .326 3PT - Mr. Big Shot himself shot .388 FG and .327 3PT - T-Mac shot .373 FG and .268 3PT  Would you call me a liar if I said any of them were clutch?    I’m not an awful fan or a liar lol, I just know what I see and that shit was special.  "
"But someone will think I'd be statpadding if I used statistics.  1. The opposing teams cheered MVP for him. These people (@Brooklyn and @Orlando) go to games to watch Russ for that reason ALONE.  2. He plays with his heart and soul EVERY POSSESSION.  3. He grabs rebounds to start fast breaks. Fast breaks help your team win. And the Thunder win 80% of their games when Russell gets a triple double. They'd actually go 65-17 if Westbrook collected one every game.   4. George, Adams, Noel, and Schroder all said they loved Russ and really wanted to play with him (longer)  5. James Harden, claims he was one of the best teammates he's ever had.  I know, I know. They're not ""numbers"", but they're FACTS. "
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Russell Westbrook. His game is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of his plays will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Russ’ nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the Eddic poem Hárbarðsljóð for  instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of his plays, to realise that they're not just exciting- they show us something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Russ truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the beauty in Russ’ favorite play “shoot an ill-advised three from deep” which itself is a cryptic reference to Nietzche’s Aphorism 146. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Billy Donovan’s genius strategy unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂  And yes, by the way, i DO have a Spalding tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎"
"Embiid's rare style of play makes for better highlights, artificially raising his stature, and the storyline of Philly both the notorious part of the tanking/Hinkie era and the big time rise to a top team have dramatically enlarged his spotlight. But the truth is right now KAT is probably a more *effective* player because Embiid has a *major* turnover problem and because Towns has nearly unprecedented efficiency at his scoring volume.   It's hard to make center comparisons for them, but you might say Towns is the James Harden of centers. He can punish you from anywhere on the court, but his defense is forgettable. Embiid is more like Russell Westbrook in that he makes incredibly plays but doesn't always make the best play and seems to hunt highlights, costing his team quite a bit. This comp isn't as good since Embiid is also a clearly dominant defensive force while RWB, despite seeming like he *could* be a great defender, hasn't ever had the consistent focus required to be even above average.  Which one you think is better depends on how much you value the large divides both on offense (favoring Towns) and defense (favoring Embiid)."

russell westbrook is a superstar  y'all are going to put some respect on his name.
You’re a fan of Russell Westbrook. Probably the most arrogant player in the league. 
"If anyone watches all of Ben Simmons triple Doubles, they come pretty naturally in the flow of the game. He’s 7 feet tall with PG handle/passing, he should be a a triple double machine. Bunch of games where Simmons is one reb/ast away, with a good chunk of time left and doesn’t get it. Russell Westbrook meanwhile is hounding for rebounds at all times, sometimes to the detriment of his defense.   "
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Russell Westbrook."
"&gt; His turnover rate is astronomical at 3.9.  His turn over rate was 15%. I have no idea what you are referring to with 3.9.   &gt;comparing the turnover rate of a centre with point guards is just dumb dude.   No, it isn't. Compare him to players with similar usage rates. Comparing him to centers that just catch lobs is asinine. Look at KAT. His usage rate is 22.9 and his turn over rate is 10.5. Embiid has a usage rate of 33.4 and a turnover rate of 15.6. Both are nearly exactly 50% larger. Turns out, the more you touch the ball, the more opportunities you have to turn the ball over.  Here are all the players that turned the ball over 3 or more times per game last season: Cousins, Westbrook, Harden, LeBron, Harden, Wall, Embiid, Booker, Simmons, Russell, Curry, Giannis, Lou Williams, Durant, and Isaiah Thomas. What do they all have in common? A high usage rate.  "
Russell Westbrook is my favorite player
"For the millionth time, you can't just pick up a player and drop him into another era. You have to assume they grew up in that era. Russell Westbrook would have a completely different game, skillset, body, and athleticism if he grew up in the 40s and 50s. Just as Jerry West would if he grew up in the 90s/00s."
"That Russell Westbrook is a big liability to the team. Russel Westbrook is the NBA equivalent of Master Yi, either he goes off for 40 or the Thunder lose."
Probably because Russell Westbrook and Paul George are over Donovan Mitchell
"&gt; yeah when ~~*95%*~~ you think ~~RUSSELL WESTBROOK~~ KYRIE IRVING is better than ~~kyrie~~ russ, something is definitely fucking wrong ~~here~~ with you Lol &gt;   FTFY"
I think Russell Westbrook can and will lead a team to a championship in his career.
"yeah when 95% think RUSSELL WESTBROOK is better than kyrie, something is definitely fucking wrong here Lol"
The basketball cheats on Russell Westbrook with Paul George and it splits the lockeroom.
* Demar Derozan * Paul George to an extent(has games where he does *very* bad) * Russell Westbrook same thing as PG * Kevin Love * Carmelo Anthony   I listed some of the “stars” that struck me the most. Any of these 5 I would not want on my team if we were to compete. I predicted before last season that OKC would shit the bed because I didn’t believe any of their players were playoff winning material. 
Russell Westbrook will never even have the chance to make it to the finals again in his career. 
"Russell Westbrook could win another MVP this year especially with reports stating that he is working on his 3 point shot. I also think him, Roberson, PG, and Adams may take the thunder to the WCF this year. Yes I know I’m somewhat biased."
"I fucking hate Russell Westbrook and the OKC Thunder. I think he is the most over rated player in the NBA, he will never win a title, he will finish his career like Carmelo, being foisted from team to team, refusing to change how he plays or his role. After he leaves OKC, or is ditched by them, OKC with become worse than the Magic or Hawks, until eventually being relocated. Come @ me. (Also just picturing this in my head makes me smile like the first time I saw real boobs in person)"
Russell Westbrook does not contribute to winning team basketball and I would take Kris Dunn over him if I was starting a team.
"The Oklahoma City Thunder suffered the second worst screwjob in the past twenty years in the NBA, just behind the Kings in the 2002 WCF game 6.  When the Rose rule was implemented, Kevin Durant's max contract was retroactively increased to 30% of the cap rather than 25% of the cap. This difference was approximately $3 million per year. The league's ""compensation"" was permitting the Thunder to sign Russell Westbrook to a contract that didn't pay designated player money but did permit the 5th year and later a one time payment of $15 million to cover the difference in salary.  That's all fine and dandy until you think for a moment and realize that the Thunder's offer to James Harden for a contract extension was short of the max by less than $3 million, mostly due to trying to avoid the salary cap tax in the first year of his contract. The repeater tax would have been nearly impossible to avoid and the team wasn't ready for that yet.  I believe the Rose rule and retroactive increase in Kevin Durant's salary was the primary driver between splitting up one of the best drafted trios of all time. Technically KD and his agent had a hand in it by pushing for that 30%, but I can't blame them for negotiating the best possible wage. It does mean KD taking less money for the Warriors is more irritating than it would first seem, but again, that one is a decision he absolutely has a right to make.  What the league could have done is permit a temporary tax credit. While the Thunder could have been held to operating under the tax line via trades and acquisitions, the $3 million per year could simply have been waved off when calculating taxes for the duration of Durant's contract. That would have left the Thunder in a spot where paying Harden may have left cap flexibility a bit stiff, but the tax wouldn't loom so large.  The really unpopular part is that I consider this worse than ""Basketball Reasons"" vetoing the CP3 trade. Yes, that veto was questionable at best, but the fact that the Hornets were owned by the league at the time meant that it wasn't unthinkable for the commissioner, head of the league and therefore head of the team owners, would have an opinion on the trade and the position to stop it. It wasn't the right move for any team involved and the Hornets suffered as much if not more so than the Lakers, but it was a bad move, not an illegitimate one.  Nothing is likely to top the fact that the NBA never did a thing about refs who clearly fixed an important playoff game that deflated the Kings so much they still haven't recovered and even today leaves lingering doubts about the integrity of the game at times, particularly given the recent deal with Las Vegas. Still, messing with the financial situation of the Thunder was completely uncalled for and caused the team significant and measurable harm over the long term.  Peculiarly enough, not risking the tax for Harden still wasn't the Thunder's worst move. The worst was when they took the advice of the team physician and believed Tyson Chandler's sprained ankle was sufficient to retract a trade in 2009. That's the same Tyson Chandler who was a top-5 center for a few years after that point. That one was the team's own fault and not really an unpopular opinion at all."
Russell Westbrook is a much better defender than he is given credit for.
"To clarify before someone here does a space jam level reach to defend Brodie: I love Russell Westbrook.   That being said the reason why people hate on Russells triple double production is because a lot of his feel artificial due to the way the thunder play. Its easy to mistake the Thunders strategy of having bigs box out so that Russ can start the break as Russ making his teammates let him statpad.   The Thunder believe theyre at their best when Westbrook can start the break but the casual fan doesnt see that. Comparatively Ben Simmons is like 6'10, when he jumps up there with the other bigs and grabs a board it LOOKS more authentic.   Westbrook also does care about breaking records, whether you think he should or shouldnt is up to you. So often times he overcompensates in certain areas for that.   So imo its understandable why people criticize him. Not necessarily right but i at least see where people are coming from. "
Russell Westbrook is better than Kawhi Leonard 
"Russell Westbrook is an upgraded version of Stephon Marbury. He's a better rebounder but his numbers are a bit inflated because he ""cheats"" on defense occasionally and sags off to put himself in a better position for a rebound. When he's locked in on defense, he's pretty much a lockdown defender but he doesn't consistently for the entire game. He also gambles a lot for steals which leads to steals, but can also cost him. Offensively, Westbrook is just a super athletic Steph: can't shoot from deep and relies on penetrating. Terrible teammate IMO with a me first attitude and looking to get his. And just like Steph, your team isn't going to make much noise in the playoffs with him as your #1 option. "
"I really think Russell Westbrook isn’t that good at basketball. Moreover, I think if he joined a contender like the lakers anytime soon he would make the team worse, not better "
"I don’t think Russell Westbrook will ever win a championship. It’s not that I don’t think he is a good player, or a good teammate. I just think his play style is not conducive to being on a championship team. To be effective he needs the ball in his hands, but even then his decision making is mostly forced.    He may be able to change my mind if he becomes better off ball, which in my opinion could really add a lot of depth to his already great game. Or if he is able to let the game come to him more rather than so many iso plays."
Russell Westbrook is the most overrated player of all time
"I was watching [this video](https://youtu.be/KN_h7s53s2c?t=2m) about our new draft pick, and he says he models his game after Russell Westbrook, **Kawhi Leonard** and **Demar Derozan**.  Not as crazy as this, but I found it ~~funny~~ interesting nonetheless. "
"I truly believe Russell Westbrook will figure out how to will his way to a championship. His athleticism will decline here in the next few years and I think it will change his mentality on how he approaches the game. He won't see success with it right away, but it will help his teammates grow into their roles and then they can actually capitalize on open looks and playing their role. If it happens while KD is still on the Warriors though, I think they will have to be a man down for it to happen."
Only bit I’ve ever liked of his is when he did that Russell Westbrook bedtime story that basically was just “Steph better”
Russell Westbrook is a top 4 player  lol who paid money for this
A hill I will die on: Paul George is better than Russell Westbrook 
Twisted Insane - Russell Westbrook  He’s just _so fast_
"To answer your question, Stephen Curry is a better basketball player than Russell Westbrook"
"He doesn't depend on his athleticism, he's not Derrick Rose or Russell Westbrook. He can still be elite at 34-35."
Is there an argument that Paul George is better than Russell Westbrook? 
"Does Norm Powell understand how to go around screens?  Mofo drops behind the screen repeatedly and Russell clowned him everytime. Also: no bigs, makes Westbrook look like a god."
"Why? He put up similar stats to Russell Westbrook in a worse era, and he never had much playoff success apart from playing with Kareem."
"California, and it’s not even close.  Los Angeles alone could field a team of:  - James Harden - Kawhi Leonard - Russell Westbrook - Paul George - DeMar DeRozan - Klay Thompson - Jrue Holiday - Kevin Love  Edit: Listed the next best states below. This tournament would be so much fun lol"
"Russell Westbrook should have been, defensively "
"Yao Ming second, that’s who and Russell Westbrook, and also Melo "
"but you said ""its like everyone is a great scorer when no one is really playing defense"" as if somebody talked about how good a scorer the people in the video are  the post title is ""Rico Hines UCLA Run starring Russell Westbrook and featuring many NBA players"" and the video title is ""Russell Westbrook at Rico Hines UCLA Run""  I just don't see what prompted you to type out a seemingly salty comment lol, that's all"
I'll never forget where I was when Kevin Durant leg dropped Russell Westbrook at Summer Bash '16 and unleashed the Silicon Valley Durant era. 
You don't have to be Russell Westbrook to do that 
 Russell Westbrook
"&gt; People say Russell Westbrook is really selfish  Colin Cowherd. Kobe would have loved to play with him.   &gt; I actually don't mind feeding them and taking less of a role, as long as I know they're doing better than I could.   Until you start losing. When you start losing things change. "
Reasonable O/U would be like 51.5 wins. 49-55 wins seams like a realistic range for their win total. A WCF appearance is a success. A first round exit is a disappointment.   I personally wouldn't take Andre Roberson returning and being his 100% self health wise for granted as some sure thing though. Losing Melo obviously addition by subtraction. Steven Adams capable of showing some more improvement. Not impossible Russell Westbrook starts to show a bit of decline hitting his age 30 season with his athletic gifts. Maybe Patrick Patterson also looks better now a year removed from that surgery which he never seemed right last year from 
"How many of those 9 championship appearances did LeBron play alongside a teammate as elite as prime shaq or pau? The answer is 4 (those heat teams). He went 2 and 2 in that span. One of those losses was to a bona fide dynasty (spurs) and the other was against video game dirk (the same dirk that beat kobe, pau and bynum earlier in that playoff run; swept them coming off back to back titles in fact). The other two he beat said dynasty and then beat a team with both KD and Russell Westbrook. It's dumb as hell basing an argument about a single player's greatness on his team achievements but if you're going to do so you probably ought to consider digging a bit deeper than ""did he win the last game of the season?"" Also, I will give you that he has been an overrated defender for much of his career but I'd hardly call his defense bad. Those chase down blocks are impressive but they still only save one basket per block."

Shoutout to one Russell Westbrook. And the Dubs gave the win-streak record their best shot 
I think Russell Westbrook deserved the 2017 MVP and was right to take 43 shots against the Jazz in game six. 
This and I'm not even wearing my Russell Westbrook flair.
"It's actually insane how much talent Presti acquired in his time with that organization.  * Kevin Durant drafted 2nd in 2007: All-Star, All-NBA, 2014 MVP * Russell Westbrook drafted 4th in 2008: All-Star, All-NBA, 2017 MVP * James Harden drafted 3rd in 2009: All-Star, All-NBA, 2018 MVP * Victor Oladipo acquired in trade in 2016: All-Star, All-NBA, 2018 MIP * Paul George acquired in trade in 2017: All-Star, All-NBA, 2013 MIP  Five guys who are or were on the Thunder who became All-Stars and made All-NBA teams. Thunder draftees became MVPs as well."
Russell Westbrook  Paul George  Steven Adams  Andre Roberson   Dennis Schroeder  Jerami Grant  Nerlens Noel  Patrick Patterson  Abrines  Edit: Ferguson
Don’t remember Russell Westbrook being in the MVP conversation as a 22 year old. The difference is also not that Russ got much better the difference is the fact that rose’s career was derailed by injuries and Westbrook’s was not. 
"When comparing him to a role player sure, but he's pretty inefficient when compared to almost every other first and second option and  on top teams.   The top 5 teams in each conference this year were TOR, BOS, PHI, CLE, IND, HOU, GSW, POR, OKC, and UTA.  Here's the TS% for first and second options on each team.   Kevin Durant 64% (Steph Curry was easily the most efficient player this year at 67.5%)  LeBron James 62.1% //// Kevin Love was at 61.4%  James Harden 61.9% //// Chris Paul was at 60.4%  Anthony Davis 61.2% //// DeMarcus Cousins was at 58.3%  Kyrie Irving 61% //// Jaylen Brown was at 56.2%  Giannis Antetokounmpo 59.8% //// Kris Middleton was at  57.7%  Damian Lillard 59.4% //// CJ was only at 53.6%  Jimmy Butler 59% //// Karl-Anthony Towns was at 64.6%  Victor Oladipo 57.7% //// Bogdanovic was at 60.5%  Joel Embiid 57.3% //// Redick was at 61.4%  LaMarcus Aldridge 57% //// Rudy Gay was at 54.5%  DeMar DeRozan 55.5% //// Kyle Lowry was at 59.8%  Donovan Mitchell 54.1% //// Ricky Rubio was at 53.7%  Russell Westbrook 52.4% //// Paul George was at 57%  The only first options on those teams that were less efficient were Westbrook and Mitchell.  Westbrook gets shit for his efficiency as well, but a lot of people ignore it because of his boxscore stats. Mitchell was a rookie.  **Keep in mind as well that even with DeRozan being this inefficient it was still the most efficient year of his entire career!**  For Westbrook it was his least efficient season since 09-10.      "
"Going by matchup data there were only a few guys in the NBA who truly could guard high level opponents 1-5 as the primary defender(note not switching onto them but as the primary defender there's a key difference).   Justise Winlsow was one of them. Note time spent on anybody from KAT to Kemba Walker https://on.nba.com/2K1CBdh  Jeff Green(yes that Jeff Green) was another. Note time spent on anybody from Jusuf Nurkic to Kemba as the primary defender   https://on.nba.com/2OtqhVJ  And then there was Ben Simmons. Anybody from Russell Westbrook to Al Horford when needed.   https://on.nba.com/2Ou2apU  Those were the 3 most versatile defenders in the reg season probably. Come postseason time the Warriors let Kevin Durant and Draymond Green spend more time on guards so they can enter the convo as well. LeBron James same thing probably as well.   There a number of guys in the NBA who can guard 1-3 and even depending on matchup 1-4(when the 4's are like Giannis, Harrison Barnes etc). Wes Matthews, Josh Richardson, Robert Covington, Jonathan Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leoanrd, Andre Roberson, Jimmy Butler, Marcus Smart, Andre Iguodala, Trevor Ariza, Luc Mbah Moute and others Im not listing off the top of my head. But in terms of guarding 1-5 truly, Simmons is up there with probably only like a half dozen players.     "
"Russell Westbrook on Enes Kanter: ""15 minutes after the game, Kanter phoned and said to me 'Do you still love me?' I said '*What?* Bro, what are you talking about man?' KP said 'Russ, I was scored on so bad' He didn't want to let anyone down, and he felt like he let me down."""
"Russell Westbrook, LeBron, DRose"
A lot of it has to do with the type of muscle they are carrying. Fast twitch muscle fatigues much more quickly than slow twitch.    Then you have freaks like Russell Westbrook.

"It's incredible how people just parrot the same thing over and over again, especially regarding Lonzo's talent. Kuzma can create offense by himself, but he is not a point guard. Lonzo cannot shoot. You have to take the player that can give you instant offense, like Kuzma, and not the guy who is a prospect.  People who defend Lonzo always parrot his potential, ""he has a great upside, above average rebounding, and is a good defender"". He gets easy rebounds, like Russell Westbrook does. And people say Lonzo is a great defender, almost talking about him like he was a new Kawhi. Stop it. He put some effort in his first season, which is nice, but the Lakers still lost a ton of games.

"I can’t believe “Russell Westbrook sucks” is an actual take here. Westbrook makes his teammates so, so much better. On no other team would people be arguing that Andre fucking Roberson was the difference between the Thunder winning a championship and losing in the first round or that Steven Adams is a top 5 center. It’s amazing how he’s turned bad players into legitimate starters by virtue of playing next to them."

"Counter point -- Seven guards who are better finishers: Donovan Mitchell, Demar DeRozan, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, Kyrie Irving, John Wall."
Let's not lose sight of the fact that Kenny Smith said the two best two-way players in the league are Kawhi Leonard and Russell Westbrook.
"But only 2 FMVPS for those 6 rings, and also while all those accolades came in arguably the weakest competitive era of basketball; certainly the weakest for his position. Kareem won one of those MVPs with a losing record missing if you didn't know; imagine the thought of that today when people on here still religiously crucify Westbrook for winning MVP as the 6th seed. Winning MVP while missing the playoffs entirely would cause an outright meltdown on here now lol.  Also personally not a fan of the Magic and Bill Russell disrespect/neglect on this sub; don't think anyone has anywhere near a consensus hold on the position besides MJ. After that there's a whole host of debate on who belongs below him if you look outside the narrow confines of ""debate"" on here. "

"It's misleading because you intentionally leave off measures that show overall impact, and both favor Westbrook rather well.  What about them?  Giannis played worse teams and using a 5-10 game sample isn't as meaningful as 82.  Actually it was, preseason:  https://newsok.com/article/5565193/thunder-russell-westbrook-gets-prp-injection-in-left-knee  And him with the KT tape was widely covered  The Celtics were good.  Utah literally had the best net rating in the NBA from January on.  And Prunty is worse, that doesn't make OKC's coaching any good either."
Oscar Robertson is the one that gets booted from this list. He’s the Russell Westbrook of his generation and no one is even mentioning him.
“Is russell westbrook a top 10 player” was a post earlier today/yday
Russell Westbrook? I was reading the other thread then this. I guess him.
"Joe Ingles, Steven Adams, Swaggy P, and Russell Westbrook.    Like three dudes just chilling and shooting the shit, then Russ being all serious about his job and getting pissed at all the clowning around.  I dunno, looks like it'd be hilarious to watch."
So I’m guessing you like Russell Westbrook?
Are you russell westbrook
"No not really.  Russell Westbrook is one player, who happens to play for OKC.  Were this about OKC as a team, you might have a point."
Do you consider Russell Westbrook a top 60 player?
"I *really* like watching Russell Westbrook dunk basketballs, so I’m wrong guy to ask. "
Russell Westbrook 
Um yeah.. I only wanted to point out that one thing that I think makes Russell Westbrook so unique lol  All I was saying is that there's no (superstar) player that can elevate just as high off of 2 vs. 1 like Westbrook
ESPN: Is Russell Westbrook a teammate killer?!
"its not necessarily about the triple doubles, the fact that he can carry an entire team on his back and will them to win, back to back triple double seasons are unheard of, WB is already a hall of fame lock.   westbrook puts up ridiculous numbers, is a terror in transition and at the rim, and when he's hitting his jumper theres no stopping him.  kyrie is a basketball genius, wizard around the rim, and a fantastic shooter and scorer, but he flat out can't do the things westbrook can do.  and you can't name anyone in the nba who is ""way"" better than russell westbrook."
He’s for sure not a top ten [dresser](https://media.gq.com/photos/56797e9c6aec210a6d1e13ba/master/pass/russell-westbrook-style-2015-fashion.jpg) 
"shut up, y'all do this everyday and it disgusts me  russell westbrook is easily one of the best ten players in the league."
"Agreed on the technique for jumping ability, but there’s just so much more Lebron was equipped with than Westbrook.  Again no knock on Russell, it’s just insane to think about how much an athletic monster young Lebron was."
You’re really underrating Steven Adams as a passer. The ball travels faster than Russell Westbrook or any other player. And Wall is better in the fastbreak that Westbrook anyways 
"Because other coaches don’t have Russell Westbrook on their roster. And hell, they don’t have Stephen Adams either, who is great at many things but starting an offensive transition is not high on that list"
Russell Westbrook and LeBron James
No offense to Russell Westbrook but I think the ease with which CP3 and Harden wear the freshest clothes is only matched by like 2-3 other players.

"A female will never be able to do what Russell Westbrook does. We’re just not physically capable of it and that’s okay. If you watch the WNBA and expect it to look like the NBA, then of course you will be disappointed. "
"That's going too far. Melo does SO much for various communities (and a lot of times, he's the most forward/engaged/possibly ""controversial"" about it, in the way so many older politically active athletes like Kareem and Russell were), and so many teammates seem to love him, even if it's more off the court (example: Paul George and Westbrook really liked him, even if the former admitted it didn't work out on the court)."
Russell Westbrook could totally be an outside for volleyball.   
"I grew up a few hours away from Orlando so it felt like the natural fit.   Watched them from Heart and Hustle through about 2010 watching every game I could on Fox and SunSports.   Loved the way Russell Westbrook played so started following OKC as a second team after they moved. I flipped over completely after Orlando brought back Turkoglu. Bad person, worse player, and the organization has been absolutely loathsome since. Isaac and Bamba give me some hope but I'll be OKC until Russell retires. "

"In arguing how the team plays without him onnthe court, youre not making the argument that russell didnt choke, but that his bench is ass (which it admitredly is). My issue with russ is his inability to produce efficiently high scoring games at the playoff level, i believe in my initial post i said he had 3 that were good in the last two tears. It may seem unfair but pretty much every other superstar does it except him and it angers me that he escapes a choker label simply because he'll continue to shoot until he gets high point totals.  Edit: ive already argued this with someone else so im gonna copy and paste my post from back then. Its long though.  Russell in attempt(made) format:   23 shots(6)-11 threes(3)-8 Ft(7)*22 points L  43 shots(17)-11 threes(2)-18 Ft(17)* 51 points L  24 shots(11)-1 three(0)-14 ft(10)* 32 points W  28 shots(10)-8 threes(3)-13 ft(12)* 35 points L  34 shots(15)-18 threes(5)-17 ft(12)* 47 points L  Do you think its a coincidence game three is the only one they took a win in? The game where the westbrook took the second least shots for himself out of the series and shot the least amount of threes he saq his team take a win.  Now lets look at the jazz series.  25 shots(10)-4 threes(0)-9 Ft(9)- 29 points W  19 shots(7)-3 threes(2)-4 ft(3)- 19 points L  17 shots(5)-4 threes(1)-4 ft(3)- 14 points L  18 shots(7)-3 threes(0)-11 ft(9)- 23 points L  39 shots(17)-9 threes(5)-6 ff(6)- 45 points W  43 shots(18)-19 threes(7)-6 ft(3)- 46 points L  This series comes with new data as westbrook now plays with pg13 whos a proven scorer and great player in the league. We see westbrook's shot attempts take a decline from the previous year but he remains unable to put up hugh scoring games in the playoffs without having a fga # thats very close to the number of points.

"**Speaking about the West,**  Lebron is locked in for a spot  Boogie is clearly out  **Questionable/Competitive for spots:**  Draymond green  Paul George  Lamarcus Aldridge  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Karl-Anthony Towns  **Some new guys who may make the cut:**  Donovan Mitchell  Chris Paul  Nikola Jokic  DeMar DeToronto  **Fairly safe list:**  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Lebron James  Klay Thompson  **Definitely not going to make the cut:**  Melo  A lot of these spots depend on team standing as well as individual numbers. The MVP players(James, Curry, Durant, Westbrook, Harden) can coast in based on reputation even if they are having a rough season."

"Context matters. Russell Westbrook was injured for the majority of KD’s MVP season, and his 2nd best player was a decent Serge Ibaka. Yet they still managed to grab the 1st seed in the West. Harden had a substantially better supporting cast in his best offensive year than KD did. "
"I think it's fair to say he's one of the best offensive guards in history. But I think you're excluding a lot of people from the competition. Russell Westbrook for example. I feel like if you're going JUST off stats, he's got to be in the conversation hands down. 2016-2017 Season he averaged:  **10.7 Rebounds**  **10.4 Assists**   **1.6 Steals**  **31.6 PPG**"
"He averaged 34/9.1/9 in the last playoffs.  Players who've averaged 30/8/8 in the playoffs all time:  * 2015 LeBron * 1962 Oscar Robertson * 2017 Russell Westbrook  Robertson played 12 games that playoffs, Westbrook played 5. LeBron played 20 in both runs.  Idk why you're acting like people were like any individual game was the singular reason it was impressive and not the fact he literally carried an entire team to the finals and sustained that level of performance. It's the 5th highest rated playoffs WS of all time - 2nd and 4th on that list are the Heatles back-to-back."

Nice strawman. Mitchell is 2 years older than Tatum... big woop. Mitchell just led his team as a rookie against Russell Westbrook and Paul George. Went toe to toe with a MVP as a 21 year old rookie. Just as athletic as Tatum. Can pretty much do anything he can. 
"Russell Westbrook comes off on a person that lets his pride get in the way of a lot. I remember their last playoff series against Utah, OKC was the team that needed to be poised and focus to spark a turnaround in the series but it just never happened. It was just odd seeing  Russell Westbrook who’s supposed to be a veteran leader and a top 5 player getting in the face of players on the other team confrontationally while Donovan Mitchell was a 20 year old trying to be peacemaker whenever Joe Ingles or Jae Crowder started yapping"
what would you say makes Russell Westbrook very immature to you?
Mature young players: Ben Simmons  Immature Vets: Russell Westbrook
"Y'all sleeping on Mitchell.   This kid is going to be sooooo good. We're talking a athletic, bouncy, agile 6'3” shooting guard who can slash to the rim, rebound, can be an elite defender, and doesn't have any mental/craziness/laziness issues.  The only other players that have that similar a description are Hall of Fame level players.  The kid is only 21 still. And he just averaged 29/7/3 against Russell Westbrook in the playoffs.  This kid has sooo much potential it's crazy. Everyone is going to be shocked when they see how good he can be."
Russell Westbrook: Fuck em all  Based on a fucking fashionable story 
" Dikembe Mutombo,  Dennis Rodman , Carmelo Anthony , Ray Allen,  Russell Westbrook.  I be taking the rest of the ten dollars for myself thank you very much"
Led the league in AST% too at 46.4%. (For reference Russell Westbrook just led the league in AST% last season with 49.8%)
"December 2014 - Motor City Casino  At the cashier, buying in for poker, and Russell Westbrook is on my left. He's exhanging $5k, and I put $800 on the counter. The max buy-in for any game that night was $2k. I was confused why he would have so much (and I wanted to spark a conversation), so I asked, ""What game are you playing?""  Russ: ""Whatever game you're playing.""  Me: ""uhhhh...I'm about to sit at 2/5. On the list for 5/10.""  Russ: ""I'll be coming after that little money of yours.""  I never got the chance to play with him, but Kendrick Perkins was at my table for a few hours. His legs were way too long for a poker table. Kept accidently kicking people and apologizing.  "
"I once saw Russell Westbrook in a Foot Locker in LA. This was like 2010, when he was in the league but not as well known as he is now. I was too shy to say anything"
"First of all. My guy...   &gt;Demar DeRozan  &gt;Russell Westbrook  &gt;John Wall  Those are not the types of players he was talking about. Those are bonafide All-Stars, opposing teams have to create their whole game plan around stopping them.    Lowe’s comment moreso refers to players like Tim Hardaway Jr and Lance who are known for having an inconsistent skillset"
"Just google ""russell westbrook gif"" and pick any of 100 different ones. They're all exquisite. "
"&gt; KD responding to criticism about him is insecure because it shows he feels a need to defend himself.   How? A lot of athletes have defended themselves from criticism. LeBron, Draymond Green, Carmelo Anthony, Russell Westbrook, Lillard, etc. have all done it.  They defend themselves because they are human. Not because they are insecure."
"Russell ""why would i shout out another man's name like that"" Westbrook did this too"

"The eye test for fans is overrated because we aren’t as good at analyzing the game as we think we are. I think advanced analytics are the most reliable way to judge players, though they have outliers, it starts to become decently accurate when you incorporate multiple factors... The eye test shouldn’t be completely ignored but it’s not as important as many people claim it is in my opinion cause a lot of people like to act like their eye test is more reliable than every other factor when it clearly isn’t... The eye test may be better to see potential but not straight up production.   Edit: FWIW I made a stat combining multiple advanced stats together that had the most accurate looking league leaderboards and I think it came out pretty decently:  1. James Harden 11.12  2. Stephen Curry 9.69  3. LeBron James 9.61  4. Anthony Davis 9.11  5. Damian Lillard 8.68  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 8.15  7. Jimmy Butler 7.99  8. Chris Paul 7.73  9. Karl-Anthony Towns 7.53  10. Kevin Durant 7.02  11. Nikola Jokić 6.93  12. Kyrie Irving 6.75  13. Russell Westbrook 6.47  14. LaMarcus Aldridge 6.41  15. Victor Oladipo 5.65  16. Kyle Lowry 5.14  17. Clint Capela 4.96  18. Kemba Walker 4.87  19. Kevin Love 4.73  20. Rudy Gobert 4.68  It’s definitely not perfect but I think it has a better leaderboard than any singular advanced stat does... I’m not sure what I could do to improve it but it seems to favor low usage centers too much and hurts centers with high turnover rates and not-elite efficiency."

"I'm tired of the excuses, he lost to a team led by Al Horford that didn't even have their 2 best players.

If we’re basing our arguments on basic statistics then Russell Westbrook might be the most well rounded player of all time and is undoubtedly better than LeBron

"What is stupid about him saying ""Granted, his percentages were low, but you all think Russell Westbrook can shoot, and he's got the same three-point percentage."" He's 100% right with what he's saying. Or are you saying it's stupid because everyone acknowledges that Lonzo shot slightly better from 3 last year than Westbrook does? Because if so, I call bullshit on that, it seems to be a big surprise to most people when they hear that."
" *he is an impactful player maybe not all-star level but borderline Allstar.*      He plays point guard. We are in the golden age of point guards. Mr. Rose is in the western conference. Here are the western conference all stars Mr. Rose plays the same position as:     \- Steph Curry   \- Russell Westbrook   \- Damien Lillard     This is not counting Mr. Harden (we all know the reasons why) and you will also notice Mr. Chris Paul is not listed     In what magical world is 18 points a game with a sub 50% shooting percentage and 4 assists per game just below the above mentioned players?     Also, that's not counting the fact those stats are a year removed. He's only getting plenty of playing time these days because he's the one person in the world Tom Thibodeau can't seem to break anymore than he already has."
"Any list of point guards that doesn’t start with:  1. Steph Curry 2. Russell Westbrook   Doesn’t make much sense to me. Hate on Westbrook all you want, and you can say he’s overrated in general, but I don’t think that there’s a plausible argument that CP3 or Kyrie are better as of today. I can see Kyrie potentially taking the spot for second by the end of this season, but we still haven’t seen him in the playoffs as the best player on his team.   Also, I don’t see how Dame could be below Kyle Lowry and John Wall’s too high as of right now, but this could change if he has a nice comeback season."
"My ranking is controversial and I get that, but here it is anyway:  1) LeBron James  2) Kawhi Leonard  3) Kevin Durant  4) Stephen Curry  5) James Harden  6) Anthony Davis  7) Russell Westbrook  8) Giannis Antetokounmpo  9) Jimmy Butler  10) Paul George   "
I'm in favor of the sciences but if any metric is going to tell me that russell westbrook isn't one of the best players in the NBA then I think the metric is flawed
Can you make me a Russell Westbrook one please? 😍⚡️
"A worse player who put up the same numbers as Gordon did his lone All Star season while playing with Russell Westbrook, the stat pad king himself lol"
"Because Russell was clutch and smacked Wilt in the playoffs, look at those game 7s and see how much Russell won by. There's a reason the dude won on every level Highschool, NCAA (X2), NBA 11/13 - regardless of who had around him, he could get that W. Your comparison is really unfair to Russell.     A better comparison would be people saying Westbrook &gt; Curry - that's a more apt example of the Wilt &gt; Russell debate not Curry &gt; LeBron."
Russell Westbrook is really good despite what you nerds with calculators have to say
Everyone on instagram agrees that Russell Westbrook is way better than Stephen Curry.  Makes my eyes bleed. 
I once read an essay on here where this guy’s grand thesis was “Russell Westbrook would be a better player if he dunked more and shot less jumpers.” and just spouted off a bunch of efficiency numbers.  Makes sense. Why doesn’t he just dunk more?

"&gt; Magic averaged 3.9 turnovers a game for his career. That's a ton! Much more than Chris Paul, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, and John Stockton who averaged less than 3 a game. The only all-time great point guard who I could find who averages more turnovers a game than Magic is Russell Westbrook, who is criticized heavily for hogging the ball and making poor decisions.  The reason the guys you mentioned get criticized is because they weren't winning. Magic won 5 rings in 12 seasons with that style of play. Isiah Thomas averaged 3.7 TOs and lead his team to 2 rings. These TO's don't mean anything.   &gt; 2) Magic's career was cut extremely short from HIV. This is a huge knock on his career that rarely anyone brings up  Magic was forced to retire when he was playing arguably his best basketball. How is this a huge knock on his career exactly? He would've had a greater career if it weren't for the HIV.  &gt; 4) He was an average defender.  He was.  &gt; 5) He had terrible moments in the finals  He fucked up '84 finals. That's it. This is like someone saying LBJ is overrated for fucking up 2011 finals.   &gt; 3) Magic had great teammates his entire career  Playing with Kareem was huge for him early on. Kareem was 35+ in the mid 80s though and playing with Magic elongated his career.   So no, Magic wasn't overrated in the slightest.      "
Check out the young version of JR Smith around like 2007 and from maybe the 2005-09 stretch in general. Was a true freak.   Top 10 is arbitrary as hell nobody has any good way of ranking the top 10 athletes from a decade ago no less but he would probably be in the convo for that if you made such a list.   JR Smith his rookie year had 49 dunks as a role player not playing a prominent role. For perspective excluding Ben Simmons here were the top 3 leaders in dunks from the guard spot last year    Victor Oladipo 61   Russell Westbrook 57   Jaylen Brown 54(and you could easily not call him a guard)   A guard getting off that many dunks starting only 56 games and playing only 24 mpg is quite impressive.

"&gt;Best defensive guard except for all the guards that have made the all-defensive team over him the last few years.  Smart gets snubbed because he's coming off the bench most games (even though he plays starter minutes). Using the awards to determine a player's quality will lead you to some obvious wrong conclusions (For example, Russell Westbrook has an MVP award. Is he better than AD, who has no MVP awards? Is Dame Lillard better than Steph Curry? He got first team all-nba over him this past season).   &gt; I would rather have talent than hustle in a playoff game  Can you explain what you mean when you say Wiggins has more ""talent"" than Smart? I'm glad we agree that Smart hustles more than him. "
Yeah because in this video he's on a farm with Russell Westbrook
“I’ve been in prison for 9 years. Is Russell Westbrook good?”
I say Russell Westbrook is closer to Psycho Mantis

Russell Westbrook was the best player on the Thunder during the 2016 playoff run
[Westbrook](http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Russell+Westbrook+Blake+Griffin+Los+Angeles+ialNX_P8Xb5x.jpg)
Russell Westbrook is still the second best point guard in the league /s
"No they should've picked Harden over Ibaka, it's crazy how you're comparing Russell Westbrook to monta Ellis, lol c'mon man"
"It’ll be easier for you to get into 2019 basketball and as the season starts, let the details come in. I’ll give u a quick rundown of who’s who in the NBA and a brief backstory.   Lebron James: One of the best if not the best conditioned players in the NBA, never gets injured and is on a 7/8 year streak of going to the finals.  Stephen Curry: Revolutionized the game by shooting three point shots at a high ass rate, extremely popular with the kids because u can relate to him being short and not a super athlete.  Kevin Durant: great player for the warriors who Steph also plays for, he left his hometown team to join them after they beat him in the playoffs after they got the best regular season record of all time.  Demarcus Cousins: another stud who joined the warriors this year. He got traded from his hometown team 2 years ago, went to a franchise with another top 3 big man and they did pretty okay. He tore his Achilles and took a large large large paycut to play for the warriors for one season so he could rehab appropriately and get a ring.  Kyrie Irving: used to play with Lebron, requested a trade to lead his own franchise, got traded to the Celtics for their star player. Has one of the best handles of all time, Celtics have great coach and would be clear favorites if the warriors weren’t at an all time level.  James Harden and Russell Westbrook: Triple double machines, they have taken the last 2 MVPs and a lot of people are now questioning the significance of getting at least 10 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in one game. Top tier players Kawhi Leonard: forced a trade out of his hometown team but didn’t say anything about anything to anyone and this made people mad, plays for now top 3 team in the east The 76ers: controversial team because they have young stars this season and they purposely lost games to make sure they got good young players. Fun team to watch though.  No bias here tho: watch the Celtics for a fun ride tho  There’s ur players who I think will be important to the storyline for the nba season"
Russell Westbrook could be an (internet) fashion guru or model imo
"Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Zaza Pachulia, Blake Griffin, Jamal Murray, Willie Caley-Stein"
"Because if the metric you are using to rate the value of a player in a given team is win shares, Russell Westbrook was, in fact, fifth in the 2012 OKC Thunder.  However, Thunder management retained him, instead cheaping out on a player who would lead the league in win shares three out of four years. Six years later, with the departure of Nick Collison, he is now the ONLY member of that team the Thunder have retained."
"*sighs* No.  Russell Westbrook is an excellent player. He is, currently and actually pretty much always, great.  However, he was not the best player on that team. If you want to argue the merit of Win Shares as a metric - which is possible, but, kind of not the point of what I was saying - he was nonetheless the fifth-most valuable.  I'm not saying OKC should have traded Westbrook - that would have been very nearly as stupid as what they did do.  If OKC noticed that James Harden is not, in fact, a small forward, they could have been running staggered lineups in which their point guard was always either Westbrook or Harden, with Durant on the floor any time one of them sat, and Durant's rest taking place at times when Westbrook had the point and Harden had SG, and been set to hold their own or better with any other team's starting lineup and torch any opponent's bench so long as they were careful to ensure that every other player on the roster had a pulse."
"It's an argument, I guess? Personally I think that they could have won a few, especially if they got a decent coach who, for example, notices that Harden isn't best used at SF.  Russell Westbrook is a great point guard if you can put the right team around him. James Harden is also a great point guard, who doubles as an amazing shooting guard. You could easily stagger lineups so that you always have either Westbrook or Harden at the point, and have Durant on the floor when Harden or Westbrook sit and sit Durant when both Harden and Westbrook are on.  Fill out the rest of that roster with players that are at least *adequate* and that's a borderline-unstoppable attack."
&gt; tl;dr: The Thunder made the finals in 2012. Russell Westbrook was the fifth-best player on that team.  ...and we're done here.  Thanks for putting that upfront. 
"No, just suggesting that KD shot badly because he'd quit on the team is kind of stupid.  Russell Westbrook also shot badly, does that mean he quit on the team too?  That's my point. Alongside: ""that dude never gives less than a hundred"". Russell Westbrook is all in, every game, but sometimes shooters go cold and that is *a thing that happens*."
The biggest issue with okc is that nobody will ever win anything with russell westbrook on their team and Billy Donovan has no offensive scheme or really any game plan at all and it's just because what's the point when you just got rwb out there doing whatever
Russell Westbrook is overrated here
Russell Westbrook plays in today's league. Case closed.
Bu...but wheres you're MVP Mr.Triple Double? Russell Westbrook has this magical way of not being given MVP expectations yet considered an MVP.
"I’m not comparing the League MVP to a role guy? I’m comparing All-NBA defense (with virtually no offense vs. All-NBA 1st Guy (who virtually plays no defense). You’re literally proving my point. An elite offensive player is your MVP. An elite defense player is a role guy.  I can get downvotes all day, but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s true. Stephen Curry? Extreme offensive talent, mediocre defense. John Wall, elite defensively and pretty good offensively. Who are you taking? [MDJ has a great video explaining this](https://youtu.be/eKLCiUkAFmk) and debunking this phenomenon. LeBron was the best player in the world last year because of his offense, not his defense. Kawhi Leonard became a superstar talent because of offense. There is no chance that you would take Ben Wallace over KAT today, much less in his prime. I’ll take Nikola Jokic over Gobert any day of the week. The better players are the ones who are better offensively. It’s quite simple if you really break it down. Obviously defense is important but it’s more like a 65/35 split.   Edit: A better comparison could be Draymond Green vs. James Harden or Russell Westbrook. Both parties are dominant at their side of the ball, who would you consider the better player?"
"hmmm, probably because I watched literally every game.   But how about letting [Kevin Durant say it?](https://newsok.com/article/3809699/okc-thunder-kevin-durant-says-thunder-misses-russell-westbrook)   you think Westbrook didn't lead OKC in 2013?! they had the 1 seed locked up that year....you think he didn't lead them in 2016? when the narrative formed that with Durant out, it was clearly Russ's team, even after KD came back?   di....did you watch Thunder basketball? The 2010 series against the Lakers? the 2012 playoffs? Every single game the tone is set by Westbrook. Westbrook IS the Thunder. Holy shit man. "
Russell Westbrook was the second-best player on playoff teams that went to a Finals once and the West Finals four other times.  He arguably outplayed Durant in the 2016 playoff run.  Those are things that happened.  They didn't fade out of existence after Durant left.
"When you have Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Steven Adams, yes your team is going to be in the luxury tax. "
"Kevin Love is Slim Charles. Kept his cool through all the drama surrounding him and finally got his in the end when everyone else was gone.  Demarcus Cousins is Cheese. Talks a big game but willing to sell out his dignity when convenient.   Harden is Stringer Bell. Cold, calculated and not concerned about the unspoken rules of the game or clout because success is the bottom line.  Westbrook is McNulty. Bold, brazen, might not do the cleanest job, but he gets results dammit.  Nick Young is Bubbles.  D'Angelo Russell is Naymond. "
"So you're only gonna include the wins? What about the 4 losses?  Westbrook averaged 23.5/6/11/3 on 47 TS%. Also both Curry and Klay opposing guards) averaged more than him in those 4 games.   Both KD and him played bad considering how good they are but that's credit to the Warriors defense.  BUT at least KD showed up in game 7 being his usual efficient self 27 points on 65 TS%. Russell hogged the ball a lot that game while also taking the most shots that game, he got his 19 (42 TS%) and 13 assists though it's a good game for him and his fans.   But the biggest difference is the +- and ORTG and DRTG that game since you wanna bring advanced stats up.   Both KD and Russ played 45 mins that game. And they were both together for almost the whole time.   Somehow when KD was on the floor, the team scored 124 at ORTG and 109 at DRTG while with WB on it went down to 97 ORTG and 107 DRTG. KD was a -4 that game (playing 45 mins in a loss does that) but Westbrook was a -14!!  It was clear to KD and anyone who watched that Westbrook's style of play will never lead a team to a championship. KD is/was a better player but Westbrook wanted to takeover every game regardless.  That's what made KD want to leave and I expected it. Didn't expect him to join the Warriors tho LOL"
Mine would be  Pg: Russell Westbrook  Sg: Jimmy Butler Sf: Lebron James  Pf: Anthony Davis  C: Dwight Howard 
"Or as we r/nba likes to call it, 'Russell westbrook' foods "
"year but neither was KD and Russell Westbrook combo, especially with GS. plus there were issues between the two of them, so it really doesn't make sense to say that the OKC team was a championship caliber team"
"you're coming on to this here internet, logging on, and then trying to tell us that Damian Lillard is more skilled and a better basketball player (whatever the difference between those two is is surely pedantic) than Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook AND Giannis Antetokounmpo? ok then "
Name me anybody on that Cavs team half as good as Russell Westbrook or 6moy James Harden then
Russell Westbrook avg ANOTHER triple double
Russell Westbrook is a horrible defender.  Him being a good defender is literally just manufactured perspective. He's probably a worse defender than even Harden.
"&gt; So my entire argument is invalid because I said unanimous. Got it.  Not at all. I'll grant that there will never be a 100% consensus, so by ""unanimous,"" I assume you meant ""At least 80% of people think this way."" I still think you're wrong. I don't think 80% of people primarily use the Eye Test and discount a player's accomplishments and accolades. I don't think 80% of people would still call Lebron clearly the best player if he hadn't won the last four ECCs, especially after the seasons that Durant and Curry have had. If Lebron losst to the Raptors in the playoffs 4 years in a row, and Durant won back-to-back championships, the split would be more like 60% James to 40% Durant.  &gt; I did not say no one would care if he never won a playoff game. I said based on the eye test Lebron is the best basketball player in the world (IMO). Notice that sentence doesn't mention wins, accolades, accomplishments, etc.  You clearly stated that his accolades have nothing to do with why you think Lebron is the best and that you only use the Eye Test. Your exact words were ""**Accolades are not why Lebron is the best basketball player in the world.** Watching him play night-in and night-out is. **Accolades are a by-product**""  &gt; Is it your opinion that whoever is the best must have impressive accolades? And if they do not have impressive accomplishments by default they cannot be considered the best?  Yes. Obviously. Wins (especially in the playoffs) are necessary (but not sufficient) to being considered the best player. The best player is the player who contributes the most toward winning. If they've never won, it's difficult to argue that they contributed the most towards winning. The Eye Test tells a lot of people that Russell Westbrook and Demarcus Cousins are the best players at their respective positions. Their resumes suggest otherwise. This is not controversial."
Everybody’s playoff stats take a dive when the playoffs come. The only exception to that is LeBron James. Russell Westbrook isn’t an exception so I’m not sure how this proves anything.
"The question is when he was considered the best, not when he was actually the best player.  Magic also won the MVP in 89 and 90.   Up until 1991 MJ was just seen as a superstar with massive stats who couldn't lead his team past a round or two in the playoffs, much like Anthony Davis or Russell Westbrook today, or KG in his prime. Amazing hall of fame player? yes. Best in the league? no."
lol Russell Westbrook did not dominate against the spurs in 2016. You literally did not watch that series.
"you're right. 28 year old, mvp winning, in his prime russell westbrook got just as far as 23 year old james harden. good for him, and good for you.  "
"Text just in case you're behind a paywall  &gt; okyo &gt;  &gt; Nanae Yamano, a 43-year-old stay-at-home mother in the Tokyo suburbs, was bored doing laundry one morning a few years ago when she turned on her television and found herself oddly transfixed by the NBA. &gt;  &gt; It was by pure serendipity that she tuned into this 2012 playoff game between the San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder. She was not an NBA fan. In fact she knew pretty much nothing about the NBA. Which is why her attention gravitated toward the one player who was unlike anyone else on the court in such an obvious way that even she could see it. Yamano was captivated by Russell Westbrook. &gt;  &gt; “I saw Westbrook play for the first time and thought: What a weird guy,” she said through a translator recently before adding in English: “Isn’t he weird? So weird!” &gt;  &gt; He was so weird that she hasn’t been able to stop thinking about him since. Westbrook and the Thunder have become Nanae Yamano’s obsession. &gt;  &gt; Nanae Yamono is a 43-year-old stay-at-home mother in the Tokyo suburbs. &gt; Nanae Yamono is a 43-year-old stay-at-home mother in the Tokyo suburbs.

She has never been to Oklahoma City. Or the United States. Or anywhere outside Japan. “I don’t even have a passport,” Yamano said. &gt;  &gt; Fans gather to watch NBA games at Ball Tongue in Tokyo. &gt; Fans gather to watch NBA games at Ball Tongue in Tokyo. PHOTO: BEN COHEN / THE WALL STREET JOURNAL &gt; But she has NBA League Pass, Twitter and Instagram accounts and so much time for basketball that she doesn’t have to bother clearing her schedule. “Actually,” Yamano said, “I have no schedule.” She sends her son to school, and then she watches the Thunder. &gt;  &gt; She went from not knowing anything about the NBA to knowing everything there was to know about the Thunder. By the 2016 season, she was beginning to suffer the miserable anxiety of caring way too much about sports. Like other fans, she worried about the possibility of Kevin Durant leaving Oklahoma City. Unlike other fans, she coped by inventing a universe in which Durant and Westbrook could peacefully coexist. &gt;  &gt; “I couldn’t write, because I’m not a writer,” she said, “so I started drawing.” &gt;  &gt; Her depictions of Durant and Westbrook were delightfully absurd. Each one was a tiny burst of unexpected and sometimes inexplicable joy. &gt;  &gt; But things didn’t work out the way she hoped. The Thunder lost to the Warriors in the playoffs that season and lost Durant to the Warriors that summer. &gt;  &gt; Yamano was always going to take Westbrook’s side in the breakup. He is her muse. His manic style of play inspires her for the same reason it once intrigued her. “He seems really unstable,” Yamano said, “but that’s actually his stable state.” That is what she adores about him and why she can’t help but feel protective of him. &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; PHOTOS: COURTESY OF NANAE YAMONO(2) &gt; He matured into the NBA’s Most Valuable Player, and she expressed herself through her art. Yamano chronicled Oklahoma City’s season by releasing a sketch after every game—color for wins, black and white for losses—and what happened next is the kind of thing that happens when artists create something unlike anything else that already exists. &gt;  &gt; She was discovered. People started paying attention to her work. Some of those people happened to play for the Thunder. &gt;  &gt; Oklahoma City center Steven Adams thought her sketches were funny enough that he made sure they spread around the locker room. “Sent them over to the lads,” Adams said. “It’s quite unique what she’s doing.” &gt;  &gt; Adams isn’t the only player who feels that way. Domantas Sabonis once tweeted a Yamano—he’s holding Westbrook’s hand—which is one of the reasons she was bummed when he was traded not long afterward. “I really miss Sabonis,” Yamano said. But the basketball fan in her understood that Oklahoma City’s roster needed an upgrade. She was so proud of Thunder general manager Sam Presti’s ninja efforts in the off-season that she honored him with his own illustration. &gt;  &gt; Her fans ask Yamano how they can buy her work and where she lives in Oklahoma. She responds by saying it’s not for sale. And she lives in Japan. &gt;  &gt; Adams had no idea. He was extremely pleased. &gt;  &gt; “Oh, amaaaaaaazing,” he said. &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Yamano says she actually prefers watching the Thunder from the other side of the world. She doesn’t think she can handle the NBA in person. “Too much,” she said through a translator, Reo Onishi, who runs a website called Bulls Fan in Japan. “I’m already crazy as is just by watching them through League Pass. If I go to a game, I don’t know what would happen to myself.” &gt;  &gt; There was one recent Saturday night game—or Sunday morning game—that was bound to stir those emotions in Yamano. She organized a small party in Tokyo anyway. Which is how she found herself inside a basketball cafe here called Ball Tongue to watch the Thunder play the Warriors. &gt;  &gt; The bar was like an NBA fever dream come to life. There were posters of Rasheed Wallace and Latrell Sprewell on the ceiling, a Westbrook jersey in the window, a pennant of Rocky the Denver Nuggets’ mascot on the wall, a life-size cutout of Penny Hardaway in the corner and a Dream Team windbreaker on the exposed pipes. The menu of mixed drinks included “The Greek Freak” (ouzo) and “Trust the Process” (vodka). &gt;  &gt; Nanae Yamano recently organized a small watch party at Ball Tongue in Tokyo. &gt; Nanae Yamano recently organized a small watch party at Ball Tongue in Tokyo. PHOTO: BEN COHEN / THE WALL STREET JOURNAL &gt; Yamano had advertised the event on Twitter, and she was surrounded by NBA die-hards eating their brunch of soup, potatoes and curry. She talked to herself and others throughout the game. (Her normal conversations about Westbrook and the Thunder are “usually her doing the talking and me listening,” said her husband, Ken, in an email.) She cackled when Draymond Green missed a shot. She howled during a frantic Oklahoma City possession. “Arigato gozaimasu!” she cheered for an offensive rebound leading to an open Adams jumper. &gt;  &gt; When the game was finally, mercifully over—the Warriors beat the Thunder by 32 points, Oklahoma City’s worst loss of the season—it was time for Yamano to become Picasso. &gt;  &gt; She turned her iPad into a sketchpad and only realized what she was drawing as she began to doodle with her Apple Pencil. Her take on the blowout: Paul George burying his head next to a brooding Westbrook. She applied the meticulous finishing touches, right down to confirming the style of their sneakers, and it was soon ready for display on social media. The whole process took precisely 20 minutes. &gt;  &gt; The ensuing avalanche of likes from her fans was still a little surreal to Yamano. She’s astonished that anyone—let alone the Thunder players themselves—knows who she is. &gt;  &gt; “I grew up in the countryside,” she said. “I’ve never really had a community that I belonged in. I was just a weird person—always, always.” And then she found other NBA fans online. She no longer felt alone. “It’s just a bunch of weird people like myself,” Yamano said."

"I'd disagree. Wholeheartedly. Otherwise you wouldn't have Stephen Curry so obviously the greatest shooter ever over guys that also practiced millions of times to be some of the greatest shooters ever. Ray Allen and Reggie Miller....JJ Redick and Kyle Korver, Drazen Petrovich and Larry Bird, Klay Thompson.....you don't think Curry has ANY natural shooting talent that helped him there? Or you just think he somehow is also the hardest working shooter out of all of those guys...?    His natural shooting talents are his hand eye coordination, and the flexibility in his wrist and arms. And just his natural sense of balance and touch. Things that don't come natural to Russel Westbrook. Things that can be trained....yes. Just like athleticism. But things that have a personal limit as well....just like athleticism. No matter how hard Russell Westbrook trained for his shot he would never be a good as Curry. I'm not CONFLATING anything. You are IGNORING Curry's natural talent that he has taken advantage of. And you are basically saying ANYONE could be as good as Stephen if they practiced the same amount. Which is obviously not true as I just gave you examples of the greatest shooters to ever play...one his teammate.....a guy who practices with him every day for years now....still not being close to as good.   Edit: You aren't completely wrong....you are just trying to waaayy oversimplify things. "
"  &gt; 7.5 assists in 1970-71.  Next closest on team is JoJo White at 4.8.  We are strictly talking about his time as a 6th man.   If I want to talk about his prime or career I mention it    &gt; 23.2% in 1969-70.  Manu's peak was 30.6 and career average was 24.5.   So huge fucking edge for Manu, lol.   &gt; Russell Westbrook was 57.3 in 2016-17 and his career average is 42.4, so I guess his ""far, far"" higher percentage means he is a super duper playmaker compared to Manu or something.  Well, yes.   Russell Westbrook is a one of the best slashers in basketball while playing in an era of three point shooting. He can collapse than the floor at will and kick out to shooters outside for east threes.  I could probably argue that assist percentage doesn’t do Russell Westbrook justice to how impactful it is.   RW’s playmaking is incredibly suited for current era. "
"&gt;John was NEVER the main playmaker on his team,   7.5 assists in 1970-71.  Next closest on team is JoJo White at 4.8.  &gt;Assist percentage, even during his prime, is far far lower than Manu's.   23.2% in 1969-70.  Manu's peak was 30.6 and career average was 24.5.  Russell Westbrook was 57.3 in 2016-17 and his career average is 42.4, so I guess his ""far, far"" higher percentage means he is a super duper playmaker compared to Manu or something."
"Of course, my three favorite point guards: Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, and Antonio Blakeney"

"Well, there is more that goes into a player then just shooting 3's (or shooting in general) in terms of value.    And I would actually argue that it's easier to shoot 3's as 3rd/4th option because you have Westbrook and George attracting a lot of attention meaning you have a lesser defender on you as well as them creating mismatches and switches that leave you open.    What used to make Melo great was his volume scoring, which very few people could do at his relative efficiency.  And there is still an argument that's the best way to use him.  But let's be serious.  Melo was never going to be a volume scorer on a team with Russell Westbrook and he's not going to be one on a team with James Harden.  IMO his best option is coming off the bench because on a bench unit not only would be more efficient (against lesser opponents) but he would get more volume without wasting Harden possessions which are some of the most efficient in the league (regular season at least).  "
Russell Westbrook 
2017 NBA MVP Russell Westbrook did.
"just because it isnt unpredictable doesnt make it not incredible, using the connotation of the word in this contezt  you could predict that westbrook was going to avg a triple double as the season winded down — was still incredible, no?  you could predict that russell would win as many rings as he did as his career winded down — was still incredible, no? "

Allen Iverson put up 48 points."
"I don't think so. Honestly, a 6'6"" Hakeem would probably play more like some of the great post-up guards we've seen. I'm not saying he'd be late Kobe or MJ, but in that style. I don't see him playing Barkley style. The shorter Barkley comparison is Russell Westbrook."
"I still don’t buy it. Steph just put up the highest TS% ever (higher than 15-16) and was outstanding in the playoffs. Kawhi basically hasn’t played in a year. It’s a ridiculously brazen prediction to have him even in the top 5. It assumes no rust. Give me Steph, Harden, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook all over Kawhi’s ceiling next year."
By that logic Russell Westbrook is far and away the best player in earth.  Why isn't he considered the best when he has the best stats? Why is Russell higher than Chamberlain when Chamberlain' s stats blow Bill Russell out the water?

"I can't stand Russell Westbrook.  From the stat padding, to his shitty outfits that everyone seems to think look cool and that annoying smile."
"I live close to the area and got an email from “Russell Westbrook” when I was car shopping. The email is obviously written by some 50 year old used car sales guy but I can’t help but read it in Russ’s voice      Hi ——,    I’m Russell Westbrook and I’d like to thank you for your interest in 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport.   I believe that your vehicle purchase experience should be just the beginning of your relationship with us. Therefore, rest assured that my team and I will go to great lengths to make this experience enjoyable before, during, and long after your purchase!   It is my goal to make this process easy and transparent. A member of my team will be reaching out to you shortly to provide you more details regarding your inquiry. Remember, there is no reason to settle for less in an automotive dealership when Huntington Beach Hyundai is prepared to exceed your expectations.    Sincerely,    Russell Westbrook"
"The yell, along with the cannon dunk, the crowd erupting, and the commentator yelling ""RUSSELL WESTBROOK!"" is such an eargasm. My favourite dunk from WB."
I so badly want this to be Russell Westbrook instead of Nance in the near future. 
I think Russell Westbrook is going to go all out and win MVP this season.
"In 25 years:  DID YOU KNOW? Famous car dealership guy Russell Westbrook, known for his intense tv commercials, used to play basketball in the NBA!"
"You're reaching hard.   Singler is mainly recruited for his 3-pt shooting and ability to stretch the floor. That's why his FG% is even lower than it already is since half his shots are 3-pointers. We look at his Detroit seasons, including TOT, where he averaged 37-41% from 3-pt range and dropped to 31 and 19% on OKC. Hey at the very least in favor of your viewpoint, he went 2/5 in his 12 games last season. Lmao.   For example, Reggie has the same TS% on FAR higher volume but you conveniently took that out of context. Kanter reached his peak percentage leaving OKC and increased it from 54% to 59% which is an astronomical leap on same volume.  Oladipo made some vague comments about Westbrook's work ethics and you think that's why he jumped to becoming the most improved player in the league? Lmao.   Oladipo and Harden NEVER would have reached MVP caliber playing alongside Westbrook. That's simply a statistical fact because there's no way you can shoot enough to even score 25+ points when the guy next to you has a historically high 42% usage rate. Unless of course your name is Kevin Durant and you have the authority to take as many, if not more, shots than Westbrook. And yet even Durant improved when he went to Golden State. Yes he benefits from the tremendous gravity from Klay and Curry but several reports illustrate Durant's complaints about OKC offense - in particular Westbrook's - is why he wanted to leave OKC in the first place.   https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/12/13/16770062/victor-oladipo-russell-westbrook-okc-effect    This site should end any debate on the matter.

"By taking that many shots he is a selfish player like Russell Westbrook. He doesn't get his teammates shots and involved enough. How can you chucking up 25-30 shots plus per game at sub optimal shooting percentages.  He was like that especially the first 3/4 of his career.  If he gave up being a ball hog and let Dwight and Nash do their thing they would have dominated. It comes down to ego, pride, money.  He had Dwight and Nash and he couldn't play the 3rd man of a Big 3, and lost the  chance for a Championship with that team.  While I understand why some people like him, he would never make my starting 10 on a team.  The team always comes before the player, not the other way around.  Westbrook is hopefully learning this.  "
Russell Westbrook shoots 80% on 3s from 2 steps past halfcourt at the end of the fourth
"Lol, that's not discrediting Harden at all. It's praising Russell. Westbrook was more clutch that year. Not just on buzzer beating. But 4th quarters in general.   Westbrook was even better than IT in the 4th/clutch in 2017 as well, and he was ridiculous that year."

"I hear what your saying but the man is not small. Lol. I think people get confused because his game is more finesse than anything. He’s not a banger like Westbrook and you don’t see him drive as much as Kyrie. Defenses took “advantage” of that because it disrupts timing when running off screens and that’s for anybody, like a Korver or a Reddick. That’s simply what you do. Not because a player is small.  I miss read, Curry is 10lbs less the Russell Westbrook but the same height. Chris Paul is 6’0 175lbs."
ANSWER: RUSSELL WESTBROOK
Imagine guarding a speed demon like Russell Westbrook who is also bigger than you and can pick apart your teams defense with an easy assist if one of your teammates decides to step in for help.  Russ reminds me of Kobe but with a non-stop full-court transition sprint.
This is what Russell Westbrook and Steven Adams would look like if neither of them were clumbsy with the ball
"Much like Russell Westbrook in a 3 OT game just fucking dunking on NBA players, like where is your energy from bro????"
"Lots of things to say about this one...  Does that mean the Golden State Warriors are Death Eaters?  *Avada Iguodala!*  Draymond Green.  Green is Slytherin's color.  Is Boogie actually Peter Pettigrew since they both betrayed hope and the good side to join the evil side.   This means that Russell Westbrook is Albus Dumbledore, the only wizard  Voldemort is afraid of.  "
"Some of my personal reasons why I don’t like Russ as a player:  1. Stat Padding/Personal Selfishness. He seems more concerned about himself and his overall state line than the team as a whole. Yeah those triple doubles are going to look real nice once he retires, but that doesn’t translate to championships. OKC’s series against the Jazz is a great example of that I think 2. Low Basketball IQ. He just takes some unnecessary shots and makes plays that are really stupid. It’s like he has a one track mind or tunnel vision a lot on the floor. He also turns the ball over a fuck ton, mostly when he’s in transition and only careening for the basket. 3. Defensive Liability. Russ is ass on defense. I remember once he laughed at Steph’s defense at a presser but he’s is actually *worse* than Curry’s, who is a somewhat passable/decent enough defender.  I’m not saying that I hate Russell Westbrook, because I don’t. To me, he’s the third best PG in the league behind Curry and Kyrie, but I have more dislikes than likes for him as player"
Here are some other facts:  &amp;#x200B;  Wiggins led the league in contested 3 pointers in the 2016-2017 season and was 2nd in 2017-2018.   Russell Westbrook had a 79 uncontested REB % and James Harden had a 76.5 uncontested REB%.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;
"He's great player and seems like great locker room guy. But he's having extremely low basketball IQ. Harden atleast trying on defense now, Westbrook is the worst defense player in the league.  &gt;Last season, Russell Westbrook contested the fewest number of shots per game out of NBA players who played at least 30 MPG"
How many does Russell Westbrook have?
T-Mac  Lebron   Russell Westbrook 
I mean...I wouldn’t try to beat the warriors on the back of Russell Westbrook ISO’s. If I have KD and Harden as better options

"I hope my take on the topic make sense.  In my opinion, LeBron James is the best NBA player of all time. His mix of scoring, rebounding, and passing is unmatched by any other. Although Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook also possess similar abilities, James’ physical dominance along with his knowledge of the game paces him far ahead of those two.  However, I believe Michael Jeffery Jordan is the greatest NBA player of all time. No one will debate his drive and will, along with his freakish athleticism against anyone else that ever played the game. His accomplishment is amazing; he led the league in scoring 10 times, 6-6 Finals record, Defensive Player of the Year, 9 times All Defensive 1st Team, and much more."
Answer as of now? Russell Westbrook. Always take the younger star.

"You can't win the ring every fucking year like Bill Russell  OKC probably goes all the way in 2013 if Westbrook doesn't get injured by Beverly, or 2015 if they both weren't injured"
Do you understand how important offensive rebounds are on a team with Russell Westbrook and (for last year at least) Carmelo Anthony?
"I wonder if Russell Westbrook manages to average 50/40/90, the media will suddenly brush it off saying that ""those are just arbitrary numbers"" like they did when he averaged a triple double for a season after years of the media putting Oscar Robertson on a pedestal for doing the same exact thing. They will disregard his achievement by saying, ""oh, he was TRYING to make every shot on purpose. Just going out of his way to be efficient."""
"These are fucking sick. As a Warriors fan and white person who cares about indigenous issues, I would legit cast aside my need to constantly blast Russell Westbrook and pull for the Thunder (so far as they're not playing us)."
"By your logic, Russell Westbrook is better than Lebron James. Get real."
Russell Westbrook. That's all I will say.
"According to the first one, LeBron James, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook were the 3 best players in the league last year. Pretty crazy.  I agree advanced stats can be finnicky and thrown off by some noise, though. Care to elaborate on what Wiggins does well that doesn't show up in the box score? (Why is this stat specifically unfair to Wiggins compared to other players?)  &gt;You advanced stats nerds are some fucking weirdos  I think it's weirder to claim Wiggins is a good basketball player with literally nothing to back it up.   Also, the stat doesn't mean Zaza is better than Wiggins. Cody Zeller shot better from 3 than Curry last year. Do you think that means he's a better shooter than Curry?  Wiggins is a more talented player than Zaza; that doesn't mean he helps his team more than Zaza helps his. "
"&gt; Leonard and his traveling companions noticed other All-Stars — notably Oklahoma City point guard Russell Westbrook — were using private luxury cars to get around, instead of the standard transportation provided by the NBA.

No way in hell is Russell Westbrook better than CP3.  People are too obsessed with box score watching.
"Honestly, the hire of Billy Donovan was not at the correct time for our club. He was a virgin NBA coach. However, his time at Florida shows he can evaluate talent, and coach championship caliber talent. I know it wasn’t NBA playoffs, but he did very well in his time there.  If he can coach a great record, and a deep playoff run. I think he will keep his job. Paul George and Russell Westbrook obviously like him. They also believe in him too. So, maybe we should see a couple more years and decide."
"That Russell Westbrook once averaged a triple double twice and shot 50/40/90, had zero turnovers in his career and never stole rebounds from anyone"
James Harden is better than Russell Westbrook

Here's one for shit's and giggles:  Russell Westbrook  James Harden
"Paul George, Russell Westbrook"
Paul George and Russell Westbrook
"&gt; I hate to use the ""you didn't watch the games"" argument but statements like this make me wonder how much Boston Celtics basketball you watched last season. Kyrie did more to draw defensive attention, more to beat it, and was a better shooter from every distance compared to Rozier.   You're missing the point. The point wasn't that Rozier is a better player than Kyrie, he isn't. The point is that Kyrie's offensive impact is overrated. We've seen now two different teams be able to make up his absence offensively. Boston suffered more than the Cavs in this case because they were a below average offensive team even with Kyrie there, while the Cavs have LeBron who only needs a smart PG to offset a lot of that.   But if Kyrie was this monster offensively then his absence would be felt a lot more. You take LeBron off the Cavs they fell apart completely to the point of being one of the worst offenses in the league. Kyrie with Love couldn't do shit in the games LeBron missed. In Boston last year, despite them being young and raw, they had enough talent to have a better offense there with Kyrie, Horford, Brown, Tatum etc. but they really struggled at times. Fucking Kemba Walker did a better job with Charlotte. And i think Kyrie last year was the best he has ever been in his whole career in the games he played. In Cleveland he wasn't scoring as efficiently, which is important because that's his main value to the team.  &gt; This is a completely different discussion (though I think Kyrie still has more room to grow while we've seen the best of Lowry, and I still think Kyrie is better than Lowry).   We're talking about overrated players. Lowry is better than Kyrie. Better playmaker, way better defender, and historically more efficient than Kyrie as a scorer (tho he seems to struggle in the postseason admittedly). We can be hypothetical here, but fact of the matter is Kyrie hasn't shown anything to warrant putting him above Lowry. Also, Lowry never played with the amount of talent Kyrie has. Imagine Lowry playing in conjunction with LeBron with Love and shooters on the perimeter.   &gt;  It's borderline disingenuous to use APG as conclusive evidence that one player is a better passer than another. Is Russell Westbrook the best passer in the NBA? How could he not be, by your logic?   It's not about apg, it's about the fact that Kyrie naturally isn't a playmaker. He's a scorer. He looks to score, first, second and third. Every guard who plays +30 minutes and has the ball a lot in his hands can basically sleepwalk into 5 apg. Rozier who's also a score-first PG and replaced Kyrie came in averaging 5 apg easily.   Westbrook and Harden are guys who are both scorers and passers. A lot of their stats are somewhat inflated due to them having historically high usage on their teams,  but when you watch them play you see they have stretches when they're either in scoring or assisting mode. Westbrook doesn't have the greatest vision and decision making out there, that's obvious, but when you're unstoppable going to the rim you just need to make a simple pass most of the time. You think Kyrie could feed Adams the way Westbrook does? No way. "
"&gt;Kyrie went out and Boston didn't miss much. They had little problem replacing his scoring through other players, and whatever responsibility he had in facilitating was relocated mainly to Horford, who in many ways is a smarter, craftier playmaker and more team-orientated player than Kyrie.  I hate to use the ""you didn't watch the games"" argument but statements like this make me wonder how much Boston Celtics basketball you watched last season. Kyrie did more to draw defensive attention, more to beat it, and was a better shooter from every distance compared to Rozier.  &gt;This still doesn't make Kyrie a better player than someone like Lowry tho.  This is a completely different discussion (though I think Kyrie still has more room to grow while we've seen the best of Lowry, and I still think Kyrie is better than Lowry).  &gt;He averages 5 apg as the point and lead ball-handler on a team. That's not good. He's not a point.  It's borderline disingenuous to use APG as conclusive evidence that one player is a better passer than another. Is Russell Westbrook the best passer in the NBA? How could he not be, by your logic? "

Russell Westbrook can lead a team to a championship. 
The team was practically the players who left weren’t even that good. The coach wasn’t no world class hall of famer. That coach went to LA with kobe and how good were they? The players that were on that team how many Hofers? How many allstars selections. Compare the supporting cast of lebron and KD the year before they left 2010 vs 2016. Mo William vs Russell Westbrook?  Really Antwan and shaq was well last their prime. Lebron literally carried that team. Also most of the players that left were there at the start of the season and then they were traded. So that’s no excuse either. Are you tell me lebron supporting cast was good enough to actually make the playoffs?

I like your list OP. I thought I'd throw out one of my own:  **FIRST TEAM**  **F:** LeBron James **F:** Giannis Antetokounmpo **G:** James Harden **G:** Kyrie Irving **C:** Joel Embiid  **SECOND TEAM**  **F:** Kevin Durant **F:** Kawhi Leonard **G:** Chris Paul **G:** Russell Westbrook **C:** Anthony Davis  **THIRD TEAM**  **F:** Paul George**F:** Gordon Hayward **G:** Damian Lillard **G:** John Wall **C:** Rudy Gobert
Russell Westbrook has never been tired in his life.
"Russell Westbrook is better than almost anyone. Like, he's probably Top 7.  But having Russell Westbrook on your team won't win you more basketball games than all but 6 guys in the league."
1. Lebron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Stephen Curry  4. James Harden  5. Kawhi Leonard  6. Anthony Davis  7. Russell Westbrook  8. Giannis Antetokounmpo  9. Kyrie Irving  10. Joel Embiid  11. Chris Paul  12. Damian Lillard  13. Jimmy Butler  14. DeMarcus Cousins  15. Paul George  16. DeMar DeRozan  17. Karl Anthony Towns  18. John Wall  19. Klay Thompson  20. Nikola Jokic  21. Draymond Green  22. Kemba Walker  23. LaMarcus Aldridge  24. Kristaps Porzingis  25. Victor Oladipo  Don’t mind the order but what do you think of the list?
Russell Westbrook 
"Thats still from a team based championship or bust viewpoint though. If you win more with one player leading than the other how is he not better? I think a lot of it comes from too much blowback against ball dominance, and a weird belief here that being more dynamic on ball has diminishing returns for 2nd or 3rd options. It very rarely does.    If you stretch this logic enough you can argue klay thompson is better than Russell Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook has the same MVP's and scoring titles as Kobe Bryant
"Westbrook lobs it to Anthony Davis, DAVIS LOBS IT BACK TO WESTBROOK BUCKLE UP FOR RUSSELL WESTBROOK WOW"
Mate if assists are all there is to passing then Russell Westbrook is one of the best passers in the NBA
"[Westbrook and Lillard, both listed at 6'3""](https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fripcityproject.com%2Ffiles%2F2015%2F02%2Fdamian-lillard-russell-westbrook-nba-all-star-game.jpg&amp;c=sc&amp;w=850&amp;h=560)"
No Russell Westbrook in a Sonics hat on draft night?
"So?? 2-2 doesn’t mean shit. We were 2-2 with the Cavs in 2016, who in their right mind picked us to win in 7? Everyone had the Clippers winning that series. Neither Damian Lillard nor Russell Westbrook have beaten a fully healthy playoff team as an outright primary option. Russell, however, has dropped 40 in a finals game. Also, Russell has never been swept as a primary option. See how words can be manipulated to prove a point? "
"Friendly reminder that Kenny Smith believes Russell Westbrook is one of the premiere two-way players in the league, and Chuck has repeatedly stated that jump shooting teams can't win championships."
"I love all of the links between different eras of the NBA. Especially on a team-by-team basis when a player has been there for different eras. Kobe and Duncan are well known examples. Some others:   Andrei Kirilenko's first couple years with the Jazz was with Stockton, Malone, Byron Russell, etc. His last year with the Jazz was with Deron Williams, Al Jefferson, and Paul Millsap.  Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem on the Miami Heat have been on the Heat for 15 years:  Early 2000s: Eddie Jones, Brian Grant, Caron Butler, Rasual Butler era Mid 2000s: Shaq era (also Zo's second era) Late 2000s: Beasley era Early 2010s: Bosh, LeBron, and Ray era Mid 2010s: Dragic, Whiteside, Waiters, Winslow, era  Jeff Foster on the Pacers: Started his career with the Reggie Miller, Jalen Rose, Dale Davis, Mark Jackson, Rik Smits Finished his career with Paul George, Danny Granger, Roy Hibbert  Nick Collison: Started his career with the Ray Allen Supersonics. Finished his career with the Westbrook Thunder.  These guys all played regular minutes with classic stars of the 80s/90s era, and with the stars of today."
People now only donating $0 to the Russell Westbrook foundation smh
"Russell accomplished something we thought we’d never see again, twice. dame dolla I’d go with Russell Westbrook, although I believe dame is a lot more clutch than Westbrook "
Russell Westbrook because a Russell Westbrook led team wouldn't get swept as the higher seed   And for better or worse WB would never average 18ppg as the sole All Star on his squad in a playoff series 
I mean he was still winning you games just not that many lmao.   This will be demarcus cousins first playoffs and hes extremely talented.   Ad has had years where he couldnt make it to the playoffs.   Russell Westbrook barely made it in before pg13 got their.    I mean.. Taking your team to the playoffs is really fucking hard. It takes more than a good player. 
Assists and rebounds are more a sign of Westbrook’s role and how the thunder play. He’s not an elite passer and high rebounding from guards is usually because the bigs box out and allow it.    Bottom line:  You swap out kyrie Irving with Russell Westbrook and the Celtics get worse.  Inefficient and overrated.  
"Hmmmm...  * Lebron James  * Kevin Durant  * Kyrie Irving  * Paul George  * Russell Westbrook  * Carmelo Anthony  * Giannis Antetokounmpo  * Ben Simmons  * Dirk Nowitzki  * Tristan Thompson  * Al Horford  * Rudy Gobert  * Marc + Pau Gasol  * Bradley Beal   * Devin Booker   * Demarcus Cousins  * Anthony Davis  * Draymond Green  * Andre Igoudala  * Tobias Harris  * DeAndre Jordan  * Paul Milsap  * J. J. Redick  * D'Angelo Russell  Oh, and let's not forget...  * Michael Jordan  * Kobe Bryant  * Paul Pierce  * Manu Ginobli  * Amar'e Stoudemire  * Vince Carter  * Tayshaun Prince  There are about 50 other NBA players that are endorsed by Nike but I think you probably get the picture.   Nike is in the NBA's DNA. It shouldn't surprise you we're talking about them."
Russell Westbrook.
"Copied from an identical post, I once saw Russell Westbrook at UCLA during the summer of 2014, and before I knew what was happening I saw my body running at him yelling ""RRRUUUUUUSSS"" and he gave me a fist bump and was hella cool about it.  I also ""met"" Paul Pierce, in that I was at a Clippers game sitting around Row 5, and I kept calling his name until he finally looked at me. When he did, I wasn't sure what to say, so I continued to yell his own name to his face. He thought that was funny."
"Russell Westbrook was so excited to say ""custom alerts"""
But you’ll also see that Nikola Jokic and Anthony Davis have the same career DBPM or that Russell Westbrook is far above Klay Thompson.
"\-Team: A coach who can manage the team and draw up plays other than ""put the ball in Westbrook's hands""  \-League: Ability to challenge a call in the last two minutes  \-Twitter: A live video feed of Russell Westbrook as KD &amp; Warriors are given their rings on opening night."
Kyrie transcends market size. Russell Westbrook is an international star and he plays in Oklahoma.
"Russell Westbrook was a top 10 player when he played with KD, so he definitely had help. Also OKC had Roberson, Waiters, Adams, Kanter and Ibaka. Those are high level contributors with Roberson being one of the best perimeter defenders in the league and Adams being a top 10 Center. OKC was arguably the most talented team in the league that year"
yea..behind russell westbrook.... come on use some context my man
It’s more people just thinking it’s hilarious that Rubio got Russ to huff and puff his chest and make a big public showing that he was gonna put the clamps down on noted scorer Ricky Rubio and in doing so hurting his team by playing garbage team defense because he felt that threatened by Ricky freaking Rubio. It’s the Russell Westbrook experience I’ve come to know and love 😂
Russell ”A Good Player” Westbrook.
"Yes. In the NBA it's a whole different ball game because of the athleticism of the players. Wade and James are good defenders and great athletes, so it would be a good thing to have them trap the ball. Rotating in the NBA is easy because most everyone has size and speed and can move quickly to cover the roll. If the rotation is slow though, the offensive player is well versed in what to do...find the man guarding two guys and exploit it with the pass or the drive. Lower level kids haven't always developed that kind of IQ yet so they end up getting opportunities and not always capitalizing because they get excited and their brain is going too fast. Sometimes it's 50/50 on a bad rotation that the offense still turns it over trying to make the wrong pass.  I'm very confused by defense like this when there's a lot of youth and athleticism on the Rockets, a great rim defender, and when the Rockets have Morey in the front office. Harden should be aggressively pushing people off the 3 point line and closing out hard, even at the risk of being blown by. There are so many more options to help a player trying to penetrate from 20~ feet out than a player catching and shooting, I don't understand how this persisted so late into the season and wasn't rectified in some manner. Seriously, you can over-commit at the 3 point line, it at least gives the rest of your team a chance to help, and even just crowding a shooter is a better option that doesn't take significant effort.  Now that Harden is on the Rockets he can no longer switch off the opposing team's best offensive player with Russell Westbrook and cover their shitty point guard. Now his point guard is Jeremy Lin who may even be worse defensively than Harden. I'm excited to see this year if Houston is going to run a pure fast break offense. Let Harden, Lin and Parsons leak out when a shot goes up, rely on Howard and Asik to rebound/block everything and you could have a really solid fastbreak lineup. Harden was actually ranked pretty highly in defending isolation (0.72ppp, 73rd in the league), but I think that was merely an instance of synergy defensive stats being flawed. Harden gets blown by a lot on D, but he has one of the league's best defensive centres in Omer Asik to cover up for his mistakes. This missed Durant layup is a prime example of what I'm talking about- Durant easily gets by Harden along the baseline, but Asik shows us what a great defensive presence he is by meeting him at the ring to contest the shot. However, this counts as Harden defending an isolation, resulting in a miss, when really it was just bad defence on his part.  Okay, so Harden helps one pass away and gets out of position a lot. That's not too bad, right? Heaps of players do that. Well, check out this sequence. Once again, Harden is guarding Thabo, and he's on the left wing. Just notice where they both are at the start of the play. Thabo cuts along the baseline to make the spacing a bit better, and Harden is busy staring at the ball and uselessly swiping at Durant. In the time it takes Durant to swing the ball, then the ball to get thrown cross court to Sefelosha in the corner, Harden still isn't able to get him in time, and he gifts Thabo another wide open shot. James Harden is not a good defender, he deserves the reputation. But fortunately for him, helping one pass away, being out of position, losing his man, those are all things that can be fixed without hard physical work. That's just about reviewing film and working on team defensive philosophies at practice. As for guarding isolations and not being beat off the dribble, if he's improved like he said he has, then maybe we could see a new and improved defensive player in the coming season. He has the ideal body for a great on-ball defender, he just needs the effort. Of course, if it were such an easy decision, Leonard would have spearheaded the Spurs' defensive game plan against Harden in the opener. With all due respect to Green, a very good defender in his own right, the reason it makes sense to assign Leonard to one of the Rockets' role players is the risk of fatigue with him carrying such a heavy offensive burden."

"Why is he the last person you would challenge? You wouldn't challenge him over other elite players that are better? You walk onto a court and you have to beat one of these guys or you'll die - DeMarcus Cousins, LeBron, Russell Westbrook, or Scal. You're not choosing Scal?   I totally get that it's dumb to think you can beat any nba player, but it doesn't make sense that Scal is the *last* guy you'd challenge. "
"he has had the best team in the East since 2011 and has never been back to back 1 seed. He still leads every stat because his team plays his system where he is the primary ball handler and first scoring option, deservedly but that doesnt mean you are getting the best out of your team. Russell Westbrook also leads OKC in rebounds assists and points and yall dont go crazy over that"
How about the person who has done it... Russell Westbrook lol
Kyle Kuzma = Couscous  Robert Covington = Roller Coaster  Russell Westbrook = Bussel Bestbook  Stephen Curry = Curry Cuh-ray  LeBron James (only when he makes a play of sorts. Doesn’t even have to be a highlight)   = *incoherent yelling* 
"i think there’s some nuance required here.   steph curry is a shooter, but he’s also an exceptional scorer. russell westbrook is a great scorer and a terrible shooter. "
"We should start a militia to protect Russell Westbrook.  We can see the frustration possibly even impotence Russell Westbrook and other celebrities feel when being hounded and harassed by haters. Obviously your average person who respond the same way if put under the same conditions of disrespect so why is nothing done about this?  I propose a non-profit activist group to drive home the message that this kind of thing won’t be tolerated anymore, We have to protect Brodie at all costs. We cannot lose a fashion genius to these despicable people.  This is a call to action for a non-violent volunteer street team to keep a border zone between Russell Westbrook and the haters. "
"One of the things that I think people forget to consider about basketball is the sheer size of those guys. I'm 6'5"" 220lbs and I can outplay 99% of people at a pickup game because I played as a shooting guard/small forward my whole life. Russell Westbrook and Matthew Dellavedova are roughly the same size as me and considered ""small"" in the NBA, you can teach lots of skills in the NBA, but you cannot teach 6'10""  To have the size and skills to play in the NBA is such a rare combination, that's why there is the gap at each level."
"1. The fact that people have legitimately argued that Kobe Bryant is better than MJ despite there being little to no evidence for this tells me that Kobe Stans are the worst. At least Kareem Abdul Jabbar is the All Time Leading Scorer, 6x Champion and a 6xMVP, and at least LeBron is the All Time Leading Playoff Scorer, All Time NBA Team Member, a statistical god and most importantly, a completely different player from MJ, but Kobe is literally just MJ but worse. He plays the same position, has the same pure scoring role, had the exact same coach and ran the exact same system, but individually performed WORSE. Saying that Lebron is better than MJ, whilst I don't agree with, is like saying that an Orange is better than an Apple. Saying that Kobe is better than MJ is like saying a Mouldy Apple is better than an Apple. It takes an extreme amount of willful ignorance to even believe, much more so than any other kind of Stan. I'm not saying that you believe this btw, but the fact people say this kinda bullshit for Kobe shows that he has the most bias and delusional fanbase. Celtics fans don't argue that Bird is better than MJ. Spurs fans don't argue Duncan is better than MJ. Lakers fans don't even argue that MAGIC, who is more accomplished than Kobe, is better than MJ. Only Kobe Stans do.  2. "" Kobe spent his best years on a team with practically no help "". Irrelevant. Excluding injury, Kobe shot 34% from 3 on 4 attempts per game for his career. Durant is shooting 38% on 4.8 attempts per game for his career. Granted, 1999-2005 was the toughest defensive era in basketball, so if we take that away to make that more even, Kobe still shoots 34% but on 4.4 attempts. So that's a lower percentage than Durant and on less volume. Kobe's best years were from 06-07, when he was on a bad team. Unless you're claiming that Prime Kobe + "" good spacing "" would shoot such a ridiculously high percentage from 3 that his two best seasons would now increase his career average to over 38%, then Kobe's best years are irrelevant, as he'd still be a worse shooter than Durant.  3. ""KD had Westbrook regardless of how much we shit on him "". Also irrelevant. In 2009 when in the same era defensively in terms of difficulty, Kobe had Pau Gasol scoring 19 PPG on 57% shooting, his future All NBA teammate Andrew Bynum scoring 14 PPG on 56% shooting, and the 3rd best offence in the NBA. Despite this he only shot 35% from 3 on 4 attempts. Durant however in 2009 had the 2nd best scorer on the team rookie Russell Westbrook scoring 15ppg on 39% shooting, and had the 29th best offence in the league, yet Durant shot 42% from 3 on 3 attempts.  Unless you're arguing that relatively shitty rookie Westbrook and the 29th best offence in the league provided more offensive attention and spacing for Durant than the 3rd best offence in the league and All Star teammates did for Kobe, then Westbrook is irrelevant.   and for what it's worth even though the difference is smaller, Kobe is also a worse 3 point shooter than Durant in the playoffs :P so yeah. Saying you jumped the gun was right. "
"Ben could definitely already shoot between 15-25% from 3 which is why he doesn't take them. Ben getting a shot means hitting 30+, which is better than Russell Westbrook last season. The idea isn't just that Ben needs a long range game though, it's that any sort of jumper could allow him one more option, and even the slightest adjustment by a defense to guard up on him could change passing lanes or his ability to drive.  To your first point, Ben was facilitating a lot more during those runs until Brad Stevens made adjustments to close in on the passing lanes and force him to try to score. That's why there were such big swings. Also, as you said, Ben and Joel did make some poor choices but pretty much everyone except for TJ McConnell looked nervous and did something dumb towards the end. It was Stevens shaking them up by making the adjustments to stifle them and C's players (particularly Scary Terry) going absolutely nuts with clutch shots that just wore us down."
"Russell Westbrook, Tony Parker, Ben Simmons if he ends up good. I'm sure there are more "
Of course efficiency matters. Especially since they play in the same era.  If not then Russell Westbrook is the better scorer than BOTH OF THEM the last 2 years.  
"Participating in a dynasty style fantasy league this year and while I don't know the draft order yet, my top 10 are: AD, Giannis, LeBron, KD, Harden, Steph, Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook &amp; KAT"
Russell Westbrook is still alive.
"""Klay and Harden are asked to do two different things on drastically different rosters."" - So are Embiid and KAT   ""But if we’re being honest, yeah I think Klay is one of the best players in the league and performs his duties beautifully."" - Irrelevant. No one said he wasn't.  ""And you’re right, efficiency isn’t everything. But in this particular instance, we’re talking about two guys with comparable measurements who are both the best players on their respective rosters"" - Not really relevant but it's highly questionable whether Towns is the best player on his roster.  ""who are asked to do similar things."" - No they arent. They play in very different offenses that use them in very different ways.  ""It’s not a negligible difference, either. I mean, one guy shoots 40% from 3 and the other shoots 10 percentage points below that."" - We are back to you basing your entire argument around efficiency.  Let's play that game one more time. Kyle Lowry shot 39.9% from three. Russell Westbrook shot 29.8%. THAT'S 10 % POINTS BELOW THAT!!! So by your line of reasoning Lowry is the better offensive player than Russ?  ""And if we are going to attack KAT’s defense and bring other factors like passing into the equation,""  - 1: I haven't attacked his defense 2: Passing is part of offense..which is what we are discussing   ""then I think it’s fair to bring up the fact that KAT hasn’t missed a game since entering the league. Embiid couldn’t get out of bed for the first two years of his professional career."" - I think you agree that this is completely irrelevant to what we were discussing and shows that you are maybe way too emotionally invested to have an objective view point here. For the record I am not a Sixers fan and I have no particular preference for either of the players over the other  ""Imagine a 7 footer who averaged 50/40/90"" - KAT hasn't gotten into the 50/40/90 club yet let's not get carried away ""splits putting up 23 ppg That would be a top 5 player in the league."" - Embiid is currently at 22.8 on .483, lets not act like he is Ish Smith. The hole in his offensive game right now is the bad three pointers and he could very well average 28 a game when he cuts those out.   ""If you’re seriously trying to argue they’re even in the same stratosphere offensively, you’re being willfully ignorant and I don’t know what else to tell you."" - this right here. I know we as fans get emotionally invested in these players but come the phuck on. You're acting like I just said Zaza Pachulia is a better player than KAT. Wow really? Like it's insane to even contemplate that Embiid is on Kat's level offensively huh? Because Embiid's 3pt % on 3 attempts per game is 10 % points less than KAT that means Embiid is ""not in the same stratosphere""?"
"Everything resets, team philosophies don’t matter, based off of their performances in the last few years, assuming 100% healthy, and longevity:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. Anthony Davis  6. James Harden  7. Russell Westbrook  8. Chris Paul  9. Giannis Antetokounmpo   10. Kyrie Irving  11. John Wall  12. Paul George  13. Damian Lillard  14.

Steven Adams  After about 7 it got really hard to put people in spots..   "
Russell Westbrook is a lock HOF and he just shot an awful 28% from 3pt last season 
Lebron as Thanos is too engraved in my brain for me to see anything different. Russell Westbrook and Thor is kinda perfect though.
Im not disagreeing with that but thats literally how the award is voted on. Russell Westbrook was an extreme case and a historic exception to the unwritten rule that the MVP goes to a top 3 seed and even a 3rd seed is a stretch most years
"I thought what he said at the time was pretty reasonable. It was Westbrook who did the ""Who?"" stuff when asked about him and Adams in his book that said the team basically forgot about him immediately after he left. That seems like real petty stuff on the side of OKC.   What did Jackson do? Believe he was better than a backup point guard? He never at any point suggested he should be starting over Russell Westbrook. He just accepted OKC wasn't going to be the team he would have the opportunity to start at point guard on, and intended to try and find a different situation in RFA.   Westbrook isn't about people who aren't about OKC though, so the moment Reggie said something like “I'm just trying to play my role while I’m here.” WB makes him the bad guy.  That's one criticism I have about westbrook off the floor. Half the people who leave his team he makes it seem to the media like they are traitors and the media eats that up because they are easy headlines. When he says stuff like ""Who?"" when asked about Reggie Jackson it just fuels the fire. He knows what he's doing when he does stuff like that, which I don't like. He's trying to turn people against the other guy because he's the more popular player."
I thought it was Kawhi...and Paul George.....and Kevin Durant....and Russell Westbrook. 
"Only the first post you cited had any upvotes.  There is a tendency to overrate younger players based on potential.  Giannis Antetokounmpo was 23 last year, so there's an assumption he'll get better.  Russell Westbrook was 29 last year and declined from when he was 28, so some people assume he'll get a little worse this year, not better.  Even though he declined last year and may decline again, I still rate Westbrook ahead of Antetokounmpo.  And maybe that is a slightly unpopular opinion."
"Russell Westbrook is better than Giannis .  Giannis score more than Westbrook on better efficiency than Westbrook for 1 year and suddenly he is better .  Giannis also defends better than Westbrook , but that's the only thing he has done better than Westbrook consistently ."
"Anthony Davis will not win the MVP this year I dont know why this is such a popular opinion here. The Pelicans are not good enough to grab a top 3 seed and most likely not even top 4. Russell Westbrook winning as a 6th seed was a major outlier due to a historic season with an actual baseline for it to be judged on, the triple double average. I dont see AD suddenly becoming a 35 ppg scorer and making history in that way and anything else just isnt good enough"
Russell Westbrook
“Carmelo will be good on the Rockets”  “Russell Westbrook is overrated due to stat padding”  “LeBron &gt; MJ”  “I defend KD and don’t resent his move to GS”  “Not many of today’s players would last in the ‘90s”  “Allen Iverson is overrated”  “Lavar Ball is a good dad and a good guy”
"I did it once because I was on travel for work and wanted to see Russell Westbrook clinch the triple double season.  It's not weird, if you aren't comfortable with yourself then how can you be comfortable with anyone else. "
"Although I 100% believe it was the right basketball move, I think Milwaukee already has one strike with Giannis in his book for the Jason Kidd firing.   &gt; ""[Giannis] called me and said, 'Coach, this isn't right what they're about to do, but [they] are gonna let you go,'"" Kidd told ESPN. Kidd said he replied, ""I had a feeling that was gonna take place.""  &gt; To which Antetokounmpo responded, ""'What can I do? I'll call the owners, I'll call my agent.""  I can't think of a time when there was such a strong response by a player to save an NBA coach's job in recent memory... I believe Giannis still holds it against the Bucks organization for compley letting go of his main guy that oversaw his development into a superstar.   Honestly I don't see why the Bucks didn't just keep Kidd as an assistant coach or something like the [Mo Cheeks and Westbrook kind of situation](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24587782/the-unique-relationship-russell-westbrook-hall-famer-maurice-cheeks-nba). "
"Fucking love Baron Davis. His highlight reels are criminally underrated.   However, Robert Pack, Derrick Rose, Stevie Franchise, Russell Westbrook, etc."
"If not more.  Each year in the NFL combine roughly 13 players record a standing vertical of 40 or more inches.  No player has ever recorded a 40+ inch standing vertical at the NBA combine.  Russell Westbrook, who many consider a top-tier NBA athlete, only recorded a 30.0 inch standing vertical. "
Julio Jones (WR) benched 225 lbs 17 times.  Russell Westbrook benched 185 lbs 12 times  NFL players are **much** stronger than NBA players. It isn't even close
"Baron Davis was sick, but Russell Westbrook is a better dunker... Also Derrick Rose before he passed away."
"Smith's statistical comps are hilarious if you look at them. They range from Russell Westbrook to guys who were out of the league in a few years. Like literally, his rookie year might as well not have existed in terms of its predictive value.  Here they are, from ESPN's Carmelo projections https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/dennis-smith-jr/"
If you're Russell Westbrook it's like 2 weeks lol.
Let me introduce you to Russell Westbrook. 
"maybe not ever, but this has been a situation for quite a while now.   MVP| Year| Seed ---|----|---- James Harden|2018|1st Russell Westbrook|2017|6th Stephen Curry|2016|1st Stephen Curry|2015|1st Kevin Durant| 2014| 2nd LeBron James| 2013| 1st LeBron James| 2012| 2nd Derick Rose| 2011| 1st LeBron James| 2010| 1st LeBron James| 2009| 1st Kobe Bryant| 2008| 1st Dirk Nowitzki| 2007| 1st Steve Nash| 2006| 2nd Steve Nash| 2005| 1st Kevin Garnett| 2004| 1st Tim Duncan| 2003| 1st Tim Duncan| 2002| 2nd Allen Iverson| 2001| 1st Shaquille O'neal| 2000| 1st Karl Malone| 1999| 3rd (Tied for 1st best record though) Michael Jordan| 1998| 1st Karl Malone| 1997| 1st Michael Jordan| 1996| 1st David Robinson| 1995| 1st Hakeem Olajuwon| 1994| 2nd Charles Barkley| 1993| 1st Michael Jordan| 1992| 1st Michael Jordan| 1991| 1st Magic Johnson| 1990| 1st Magic Johnson| 1989| 1st Michael Jordan| 1988| 3rd Magic Johnson| 1987| 1st Larry Bird| 1986| 1st Larry Bird| 1985| 1st"
"Billy Donavan and I don’t think it’s particularly close. Russell Westbrook takes a lot of flack for his playstyle and I think a lot of it is on Donavan. When Westbrook passes the ball to the wing, he stands. When Melo was posting up on the low block, everyone stands and watches and Adams immediately goes to crash. The warriors would have a offball screen set up and a cutter on every possession. Watching the Thunder offense frustrates me so much because I know George and Westbrook would be great cutters and off ball players but they aren’t because Donavan"
   1. Stephen Curry 2. Russell Westbrook 3. Chris Paul 4. Kyle Lowry (plz no hate) 5. Dame Lillard
"[La Canfora] Westbrook told Donovan, “coach, I got this, relax” in a disarming manner. Donovan happily stepped back, Russell called his teammates over, coached them up himself, and then hogged the ball on three straight possessions"
"1. Steph Curry, really no contest 2. Russell Westbrook. Dude is an animal  3. Chris Paul, right up there with Curry, WB 4. Damian Lillard, way too slept on 5. John Wall, he's only getting better"
Russell Westbrook 
Kevin Durant - Roman Reigns  James Harden - Seth Rollins  Russell Westbrook - Dean Ambrose
His numbers are like russell westbrook sprinkled with some extra d
"without reading any replies,  a. James Harden  b. Anthony Davis  c. LeBron James  d. Kevin Durant  e. Stephen Curry  f. Lillard?  g. Kyrie Irving  h. Russell Westbrook  i. Paul George or Kawhi. Most likely Kawhi.  j. Jimmy Butler  k. Drummond  l. Wall  &amp;#x200B;  Model seems to be a bit high on 3 point attempts."
"You could've just said ""I hate Russell Westbrook with a burning passion"" and it would've been a better post than this"
"He also played without Westbrook. It's maybe a joke,  but we all know that Russell takes away a lot of rebounds "
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-they-call-Russell-Westbrook-the-Brodie  Kinda interesting actually
"Russell Westbrook literally broke into my house and destroyed all my Harry Potter LEGO sets, he is satan reborn"
"Howard Schultz is like the idiot roommate who lets the burglars into your house when they are obviously burglars and then gets all confused and indignant when you get mad at him.  There was some local effort to keep the Sonics, it just wasn’t enough and didn’t rise to the level needed to build a new arena or anything. Ballmer tried to set up a last ditch effort to buy the team back and the city actually sued the OKC owners for breaking the lease, and managed to prove in court that the OKC owners weren’t operating in good faith (having subpoenaed the rather incriminating emails of Aubrey McClendon). However, the city settled *on the very morning that the judge was going to announce their verdict*. (The timing on this was such that Russell Westbrook was technically drafted by the SuperSonics—the relocation only became official after the draft but before the season.) It was entirely possible that the court would have compelled the team to keep playing in Seattle, which would force the OKC owners to sell the team (probably to Ballmer) and buy some more time for a new arena.  One factor was probably that Stern’s thumb was firmly on the scale. When a similar situation happened in Sacramento, Stern’s thumb was firmly on the side of the group trying to keep the team there, and he made that very clear—when he made his public statement about the Seattle bid to buy the Kings, he began his remarks by saying he had a game to attend in Oklahoma City. "
"Stick him in Utah and we become even more dangerous.  People say we can't work without spacing with Gobert and Favors, and yet we did. Slide AK in there instead of Favors to start? That's only more dangerous.  Even with AK's poor shooting he shoots better than Russell Westbrook does, and people aren't just leaving Russ wide open."
"Idk man I’ve been doing explosiveness training for like 8 months now and I’ve already seen a 6 inch increase in my vertical and my 40-yard dash time has gone from 5.05 to 4.67.   My point is, losing weight and doing explosiveness/first step training will help. I’m not saying that any fat old average joe can turn himself into Russell Westbrook but it’s nowhere near entirely genetic and it can be worked on, especially if you have world class trainers at your hand"
"He'd be a 4 shooting better than Russell Westbrook.  And he wasn't ever really shooting 3's, get him in shooting more and that's going to go up a bit, his form was always solid and he was willing to take them."
"Dwight Howard, Russell Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook on 100 shots 
I think Thunder fans should start bracing themselves for the fact that Andre Roberson is going to come back worse. He will still be an impactful defensive presence but not the same as he was.   Russell Westbrook &gt; Giannis 
Russell Westbrook
If he can become the John Wall/Russell Westbrook hybrid I would be so happy.
And who has a higher usage rate than Jordan? Russell Westbrook.   I rest my case.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/usg_pct_season.html
- Russell Westbrook - Kobe Bryant  - Dirk Nowitzki 
"In no order: LeBron James, Kevin Love, Russell Westbrook"
"The media tries to downplay Jordan’s legacy in comparison to lebron. In example nick wright lying on tv about Jordan’s stats to make him seem like a 6’6 Russell Westbrook. Same thing with Colin cowherd. The whole of lebron gets one more ring, he eclipses Jordan y’all etc"
"I haven't really seen the other rookies not on my squad yet. I'll watch Wolves preseason games, but I'm not hardcore enough to watch Mavs, Hawks, etc preseason games.  So in regards to your point #3 about Okogie - That kid has looked *nice* in only the two games so far. He's literally shaking with energy to the point that I wonder if he's somehow the offspring of Russell Westbrook and Corey Brewer. He's clearly still got a lot to learn, but looks like he's going to work out really well on defense. He's also managed to rack up 10 points per game in limited minutes, so he's got some offensive talent as well. The Jimmy Butler comparison is pretty accurate, although who can tell if he ever becomes THAT good or if he becomes a poor man's Jimmy Butler. However even in the latter case, being called a poor man's Jimmy Butler is still a damn good title to hold.  I'd say with a high level of confidence that he can be a top 10 rookie this  year, and maybe even top 5."
"I wanna see some skits where Russell Westbrook is just working way too hard at a bunch of jobs. Feverishly tearing through dictionaries, turning the page every five seconds at school or flipping burgers somewhere at light speed and the camera pans over to a stack of like 1000 burgers. Sprinting down the street filling mail boxes with fadeaway jumper envelopes. Waiting for the cook to put the enchiladas down, bouncing back and forth on the balls of his feet while another waiter rolls his eyes next to him. "
PG : Russell Westbrook  SG : Jimmy Butler  SF : Kevin Durant  PF : Draymond Green  C : Zaza
"I mean, i understand you guys were missing roberson, but the team with westbrook and pg13 shouldnt lose out to that jazz. The playoffs are were, unless you have a generational coach or playing system, star players matter most because of the factor of less possessions overall. If your syar players show up to play (meqning if westbrook plays great in the first half of the series or if pg doesnt slow down in the second half when russell got going, the series is easily the thunder's to win."
"Russell Westbrook broke into my house and scuffed my kds, pure evil"
"""Here's what OKC is doing wrong"" usually starts with giving the ball to someone besides Westbrook.   OKC tries that. OKC loses.   ""well it was still Westbrook's fault, if he wasn't hogging the ball the entire year then other people would have more confidence to make plays. not like guys like Ray Felton and Jerami Grant have made plays just fine, not like guys like Cam Payne and Semaj Christon were just kinda shitty, geez it's clearly Russell Westbrook's fault clearly not a winner OKC sucks listen to my podcast give me shekels bye"""
"&gt;Paul George was asked by Royce Young of ESPN after practice on Tuesday if Melo’s absence was beneficial for him and Russell Westbrook and George didn’t quite agree.  &gt;“No. I mean, we had a short stint together so who knows, this year could have been our year. We were trying to learn things on the fly last year. It was a learning experience for everybody.  &gt;“We could’ve very well been a different team coming into this year, knowing that we’ve had a year under our belt. We know what works, what didn’t work for us and we worked through that. So, you never know.”  just gonna leave this here because I know people won't read the article"
"&gt; Stephen Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook  I could personally see 1 or even 2 of those guys not making it due to injuries. Specifically Curry. "
"He'd have to have a huge improvement from last year to make it. There's a lot of guards in the West right now that are easily going to be above him. Stephen Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, just to name a few.  Perhaps when these players start falling off and Mitchell begins entering his prime he'll see a few appearances, assuming he continues improving off of what he did in his rookie season."
"Who is the best point guard in the NBA?  &gt;1. **Stephen Curry, Golden State – 57%**  &gt;2. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City – 17%  &gt;3. Kyrie Irving, Boston – 10%  Who is the best shooting guard in the NBA?  &gt;1. James Harden, Houston – 73%  &gt;2. Klay Thompson, Golden State – 10%  &gt;3. **Stephen Curry, Golden State – 7%**  Damn...... Stephen so good he's the 1st best PG and 3rd best SG at the same time.  "
"im not lol. Paul George came out half way in the season saying shit like ""Russel Westbrook makes this off season an easy decision"", ""I love OKC I can see myself being here"", ""Russell is my favorite teammate ever"", ""I think we can make this work"", ""We are just starting and its only our first year together"". Every single time people would just say he's going to the Lakers."
"But you dont make the definition of superstar. Second MVP voting is not the best determiner of best players. How high did KD and Steph rank in MVP voting this year? Third, when is a top 15 scorer of all time not considered a superstar? Argue for me that any one of those 5 other players mentioned are/were not superstars.  &amp;#x200B;  Second, name who Kawhi is better than among the following: Lebron, KD, Steph, James Harden, Russell Westbrook. All players have been named MVP in the span of Kawhi's career while Kawhi has not. By your argument of ""MVP voting determines rank"" They are therefore all better than Kawhi. Therefore since Kawhi is not a top 5 player, by your argument, he is not a superstar. Cmon man I know they dont teach much in high school but you gotta learn to think a bit buddy. First you argue that MVP votes are correlated to how good a player is, then not mention Kawhi's MVP votes once. Yes Kawhi finished second in ONE season. Then that begs the obvious question, should we really be comparing a player based on ONE season to a another player based on that player's full top 15 scorer ALL TIME career?   &amp;#x200B;  Anyone not delusional would say no."
"&gt; had melo basically giving buckets on defense.  Russell Westbrook: Defensive Stalwart.  &gt;did you just say Raymond Felton and fucking Corey Brewer. Ok you have no validity lmao.  ""Omg lolbro you didn't mention an immediate superstar bro your opinion doesn't count lol what's a roleplayer???""   &gt;and both aren't good spot up shooters.  Have you ever watched Corey Brewer play?   &gt; We had zero options, its why westbrook had to go in so hard by himself.   How long are Thunder fans going to repeat this to themselves about Westbrook? Do you think he just needs a little more talent around him? Have you thought of trading for Jimmy Butler? I mean, it's another all-star, should be guaranteed success right?"
"My top 10 is:  1.Lebron James  2.Kevin Durant  3.Stephen Curry  4.Anthony Davis  5.Kawhi Leonard  6.Giannis Antetokounmpo 7.Kyrie Irving  8.James Harden 9.Chris Paul 10.Russell Westbrook   In my opinion, Embiid has top 10 talent he just hasn’t done enough in the NBA yet. "
Can you just accept that PG wanted to stay with OKC and it had nothing to do with the Lakers? Westbrook showed him how good real love could be ok? PG has never been cared for the way Russell cares for him. He's learned things about himself that he never thought possible. You have to accept that it was never about us and it was all about  **them**. 
"That is amazing but Joel is not a top 10 player ;-P  Top 10 in no particular order.

Random thought - how many rebounds would Steven Adams average on a team without Russell Westbrook?
Russell Westbrook III
I think he’s saying that Russell Westbrook is over the age of 18 or was performed by a surgeon over the age of 18.
Russell Westbrook would be a perfect example for that. Love you though OP I’m going to sleep. 
Give one of your cats to who exactly? Derrick Rose?Russell Westbrook? The Norse Gods?
"This reddit is incredibly biased against Russell Westbrook and the Thunder in general. Lebron has alot of the same issues westbrook but gets praised for them anyway. Lebron and Westbrook both have the same effect on teammates, yet everyone loves to push the narrative that Westbrook is a bad teammate, and Lebron is a good one. Also, this reddit loves players that play like Westbrook (people like oladipo) but hate Westbrook himself, due to his attitude towards the media. If he was white he would be the most loved player on this subreddit."
i think i'll take my chances with russell westbrook

"&gt; Most top ten picks that are PGs fail in that quest.  He was a *top 5* pick.  That's a lot more than a Top 10 pick.  From 2003 to 2013 (arbitrary cutoff to avoid players who can't be judged well yet), the PGs in the top 5 were: Shaun Livingston, Devin Harris, Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Raymond Felton, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, John Wall, Kyrie Irving.  Of those 10 PGs, Rubio has definitely had a worse career than all but Livingston and Felton, and Livingston's career is undoubtedly influenced by his awful injury early on.  Each of those other 8 PGs were at some point much better than a league average PG."
"   He did this like 2 days after he broke his face.  it's the most Russell Westbrook play of all time    everything else was just a dunk, this is a actual expression of who Russell is.    a crazy person who will try to dunk on 5 guys with a giant hole in his face"
Russell Westbrook is the best point guard in the league. 
Russell Westbrook and Paul George They are currently on planet earth
Russell Westbrook in 2 years remember this
"Dennis ""Russell Westbrook"" Schroder?"
"There are some big downsides (typically) for players as they get taller though, namely less athleticism and more injuries. Like KD and AD are both great athletes, but they're not athletes in the same way someone like Jordan was (or Westbrook or LeBron). Part of what makes LeBron so unusual is he has the same athleticism Jordan did but he's built like Karl Malone. Usually the bigger a player gets, the less athletic they are. There are rare exceptions (Shaq probably, or Wilt or maybe Bill Russell), where a person can simply be more of a natural giant rather than that big due to some genetic quirk or pituitary disorder or something, where they don't sacrifice athleticism for size.  But then there's the other issue with being taller or larger in that it's increased stress on the player's joints and body in general. Anyone is simply more likely to get injured or break down more quickly the larger they get, especially once you get up around or over seven feet tall. So height is definitely a big component in building the perfect basketball player, but there tends to be some diminishing returns where height is concerned. That said, probably the person most suited to perfectly dominate in the NBA would have been [Angus MacAskill.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_MacAskill) I'm just not sure how anyone would have defended him."
"Uhhhh both. Russell Westbrook is not a skilled three-point shooter, dunno where you got that from. "
It's the same deal with Russell Westbrook 
"**East:**  Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Andre Drummond, Kevin Love, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry, Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Bradley Beal, Kemba Walker  **Honorable Mentions:** Aaron Gordon, Jason Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Blake Griffin, Khris Middleton  **West:**  LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Chris Paul, James Harden, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, Karl Anthony Towns  **Honorable Mention:** DeMar DeRozan, Jimmy Butler, Paul Millsap, Mike Conley, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, CJ McCollum, Rudy Gobert  The West is so hard to predict. It will come down to reserves who are on West teams that have good records."
You literally did just that.  People are flaming you because the dude was 17 no shit he struggled against Russell fucking Westbrook
As far as I know Russell Westbrook is still on the Thunder. Flair up or shut up
"In what world is Russell Westbrook underrated, he won 2nd Team All-NBA last year, and was 1st team and MVP before that. Unless you think he should be MV-MVP or something, he's one of the most decorated players in the league and talked about glowingly by everyone from Kobe to Oscar. He rated just fine."
Russell Westbrook. 
"A super great read!! Here are some minor typos I found and suggestions I thought of while reading. Please feel free to ignore em if you like because it’s mostly pretty minor and potentially grammar-nazi-ish stuff and doesn’t at all detract from the overall superb quality of your post :)  . Powerful Forward Karl Malone -&gt; Power Forward or powerful forward, Ginobili not Ginobli under Spurs, Pettit not Petit under Hawks, brief-superstar Jeremy Lin not briefly under Nets, favoured not favourited Blazers under Pelicans, peek not peak under Nets, berth not birth under Wizards, ~~the~~Minnesota was able to acquire Andrew Wiggins, looking at ~~the~~ them now under the Suns  . (maybe consider adding) ‘while Jackson’s Lakers rode the wave of Shaquille o’ Neal, one of the most dominant forces in NBA history, and devastating shooting guard Kobe Bryant’, cuz the 3-peat was like 70% Shaq imo  . ‘nevertheless, if the stars \*have ever aligned for Toronto, this is the year it \*happens’?  . Steven Adams isn’t technically an All-Star (yet :p)  . (Just some suggestions..) The Thunder would controversially ~~lose~~ trade James Harden to the Houston Rockets – where he’d go on to blossom into a superstar and become the 2017-18 MVP – and lose their /*2013-14 MVP Kevin Durant to the Golden State Warriors in free-agency ~~– also MVP -~~ , leaving them with the controversial-but-undeniably-incredible Russell Westbrook as the beating heart of their franchise. (Maybe add ‘Westbrook would go on to have one of the most statistically-stunning seasons in 2016-17, winning MVP by almost single-handedly dragging the Thunder to the playoffs while putting up historic statlines not seen in the NBA for over 50 years and performing countless clutch plays, but falling short against the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs, who were led by fellow MVP-candidate James Harden and boasted a historic offense’ because I personally think it’s worth mentioning as an important part of recent NBA history)  "

Why would Dejounte get a tattoo of Russell Westbrook?
"cont (pt. 4)  **New Orleans Pelicans**  **Hallmarks:** Chris Paul from ’05-’11; Anthony ‘The Unibrow’ Davis  **This Year:** Playoff Contenders  Remember the whole Charlotte Hornets fiasco? So the New Orleans Pelicans were founded when the Charlotte Hornets relocated in 2002, then Katrina happened, and they became the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets for two seasons before returning to New Orleans, and a few years later, renaming themselves the Pelicans, and returning the pre-’02 history of the Hornets to the new team in Charlotte. TL;DR, New Orleans’ team history starts in 2002, but they got a bigger jump-start than an expansion team would’ve. Also they retired Pistol Pete’s #7 because he played on the New Orleans Jazz, and they play in New Orleans now, even though the Jazz still exist, but in Utah. It’s all a mess.  Anyway, the Hornets drafted Chris Paul in the 2005 NBA Draft and he quickly turned into one of the most remarkable Point Guards in NBA history – despite this, success was moderate, playoff losses hit them hard, and CP3 would request a trade. The Hornets, weaker than ever, landed the first overall pick in the ’12 draft, and acquired Anthony Davis – who has become the face of the franchise and one of the five most dominant players in the NBA today, already rumored to be the ’18-’19 MVP favorite. Last season, despite an injury to his right-hand man Boogie Cousins, AD carried the Pelicans to a first-round sweep of the favorited Blazers in Round 1 of the playoffs. It’s unclear if Cousins’ absence will hurt the team this year – they seemed to, if anything, play better without him.  This year, watch Anthony Davis. Seriously, just watch him. He is a wrecking ball on both ends of the court. Don’t be surprised to see him carry the Pelicans to another playoff victory, even if they’re unlikely to compete with the likes of Houston or Golden State.  ***  **New York Knickerbockers**  **Hallmarks:** Walt ‘Clyde’ Frazier and the ’70 and ’73 Championships; Patrick Ewing in the ‘80s and ‘90s.  **This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack  The Knicks were founding BAA members from 1946, and though they were successful from the start – making three straight finals appearances in the early ‘50s – luck was never on their side. Coach Red Holzman and star Clyde Frazier finally brought them dominance in the late ‘60s, culminating in NBA titles in ’70 and ’73. Their luck turned down in the 80s, and back up in the 90s, when Patrick Ewing brought them to two Finals appearances – both losses. Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire tried to restore Knicks glory in the ‘10s, but never cracked an ECF. With the 4th pick in the 2015 Draft, the Knicks selected Latvian Big Man Kristaps Porzingis, the new face of their team. Though set back by injuries, when Porzingis is healthy, he’s an absolute menace on the court. It’s unclear when he’ll be able to start this season, and the Knicks don’t really have a complete roster to give him the tools to make a playoff run, but they might have the cap space and the New York pulling power to draw in another key player next season.  This year, watch for Porzingis, and watch the trade rumors. The Knicks’ fate is very much in Kristaps’ hands – but he’s definitely going to need another piece if they want to have real playoff success.  ***  **Oklahoma City Thunder**  **Hallmarks:** Gary Payton; the ’79 Championship Seattle SuperSonics; the Harden-Westbrook-Durant team in ‘12  **This Year:** Playoff Contenders  The Seattle SuperSonics were founded in 1967 and played there until ’08, when, to no small amount of controversy, they relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder. The Sonics’ history, including their greats Lenny Wilkens and Spencer Haywood, and their ’79 NBA Championship, now belong to the Thunder. Young superstar Kevin Durant moved with the team from Seattle to OKC, where they acquired James Harden and Russell Westbrook – all three of whom have since won MVPs. The young trio carried the team to the 2012 Finals, but LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and the Miami Heat came away with the win. The Thunder would trade James Harden to the Houston Rockets, and lose their league MVP Kevin Durant to free agency (later joining Golden State), leaving Russell Westbrook as the beating heart of the franchise. He would go on to win the '16-'17 MVP in one of the most statistically remarkable seasons in the history of the NBA, dragging the Thunder to the playoffs only to fall short to Harden's Rockets (Harden himself would win the MVP the following year). Alongside All-Star Paul George and Big Man Steven Adams, the Thunder are essentially playoff locks this year again – but how far they can get into the playoffs is anyone’s guess. Last year, they lost in the first round to the Jazz.  This year, watch for Oklahoma City to have comparable success to last season. Westbrook is one of the most dynamic and explosive players in the league, and incredibly fun to watch. The Thunder, barring any injuries, should have no trouble making the playoffs. The focus this year is in getting to the WCF.   ***  **Orlando Magic**  **Hallmarks:** Shaquille O’Neal and Penny Hardaway in the ‘90s, Dwight Howard in the ‘00s and early ‘10s  **This Year:** Bottom 10  The Magic were founded in 1989, and by ’93 had drafted the most dominant player of the ‘90s, Shaquille O’Neal, and traded for guard Anfernee ‘Penny’ Hardaway. Along with Horace Grant, the Magic bulldozed their way to an NBA Finals in ’95, but Hakeem’s Rockets were hungrier and more experiences. By ’96, Jordan’s Bulls were back, and swept the inexperienced Magic. The following season, they’d lose Shaq to the Lakers, and though they acquired some past-their-prime greats, the roster wasn’t enough to sustain any success. Tracy McGrady only seemed to find first-round playoff losses, and the Magic wouldn’t see a chance at a title again until their new Big, Dwight Howard, carried them there in ’09, beating a young LeBron and the Cavaliers only to fall short against the Phil Jackson-Kobe Bryant Lakers. The Magic are new deep into a rebuilding process, lacking any true superstars and hoping that their new rookie Mohamad ‘Mo’ Bamba can be the foundation on which future success can be built.  This year, watch Mo Bamba – one of the few rookies this year who could find real success and play real minutes – but don’t get your hopes up for the Magic to make a playoff run. Last season, they started out strong, and a ton of hype got built up. This team’s not ready yet. Don’t set yourself up for that again.  ***  **Philadelphia 76ers**  **Hallmarks:** ’55 Champions; Wilt Chamberlain’s ’67 Champions; Julius Erving’s ’83 Champions; Allen Iverson in the late ‘90s and early ‘00s  **This Year:** Playoff Contenders  The Syracuse Nationals were founded in 1946, winning a title in ’55 before relocating to Philadelphia and becoming the 76ers in 1964, the same year they acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Warriors. Wilt managed to win the ’67 championship, his sole victory over the Celtics’ ‘60s dynasty, before departing to the Lakers at the end of the following season. The Sixers would struggle to find meaningful success again until the NBA-ABA Merger, wherein they bought Julius ‘Dr. J’ Erving from the ABA Nets and immediately took the league by storm, rushing to the ’77 Finals before falling to the Blazers. They would lose again to the Lakers in the ’80 and ’82 Finals, before acquiring Moses Malone and sweeping the Lakers 4-0 to win the ’83 Championship. The Sixers rose to prominence again after drafting flashy superstar Allen ‘The Answer’ Iverson – but he only managed to take them to one Finals, a loss to, again, the Lakers. In the early ‘10s, the 76ers began ‘The Process’, a controversial rebuilding plan executed by GM Sam Hinkie. The team was awful and Hinkie would be fired not long after – and yet now the 76ers find themselves with a trio of young superstars, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, and Markelle Fultz. By many accounts, ‘The Process’ paid off after all. The Sixers are generally ranked as the third strongest team in the East, and last year lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Boston Celtics.  This year, watch for Ben Simmons to continue to improve and dominate as the league’s best sophomore player, pray to God that Joel Embiid stays healthy, and expect the Sixers to be a top-3 seed in the East.  ***  **Phoenix Suns**  **Hallmarks:** Charles Barkley in the ‘90s; Steve Nash in the ‘00s  **This Year:** Bottom 10  The Suns joined the NBA in 1968, have made it to the WCF 9 times, the Finals twice, and have the fourth-best winning percentage in NBA history. You wouldn’t know it, looking at the now. The Suns found relatively consistent success throughout their history. They took an early trip to the finals in ’76 under the leadership of Paul Westphal, and in ’88 and ’92 acquired Kevin Johnson and Charles Barkley, respectively, carrying them to several very successful seasons, including  ’93 Finals appearance in which they lost to Jordan’s Bulls. In ’96 they drafted Steve Nash, who after an unassuming few seasons, with the help of coach Mike D’Antoni, revitalized the Suns. Playing in an offensive system called ‘Seven Seconds or Less’, the Suns developed one of the most unique styles of basketball the league had ever seen, and Nash won two MVP’s as the commander of it. Since Nash’s departure, the team’s hopes now rest in the hands of their young shooting guard Devin Booker. Unfortunately, injuries and an incomplete roster have kept the Suns from seeing much success. They finished with the worst record in the league last year, securing the first pick in the draft, Deandre Ayton.  This year, watch the Suns’ young, exciting team. Their lack of success has meant several top draft picks, and Devin Booker continues to improve. It’s unlikely that the Suns are going to see much success this season, but if they can at least show signs of promise, they might be able to leverage it for the changes they’ll need.   "
"I love Draymond Green style, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook and LeBron James."
"Well he's not Russell Westbrook, not sure what you're expecting. His game has always been much more methodical than fast-paced"
"Russell Westbrook also led the league in FGA with 1607. Despite having taken 107 more shot attempts, Lebron James made EXACTLY 100 more shots.  If the NBA made a new rule that, at the start of every game, Lebron James was REQUIRED to air ball a 3 point shot EVERY SINGLE GAME last season: Lebron would still have more PPG and still have a higher 3p% and FG% AS WELL AS less FGA per game. They could literally add a free miss and Lebron is still a more efficient scorer! HA!"
"&gt; Ex.1 Harden over Westbrook: Last year Russell was awarded the MVP because of his Triple-double season. At least that's what the statistical reasoning was, but he was truly rewarded for doing great despite the lack of another star in OKC. ""The loyal player rising up despite a friends betrayal."" Why do I say this? Because the following season he achieved the same recording breaking achievement yet it was given to Harden.  you say he won MVP  in 2017 because OKC playing good despite lack of another star and **not** because of the triple double season.  then you get mad that doesn't win in 2018 because of the triple double season while playing with another star.  # what?????????????????????????????????"
**Top 5 in USG%:**       James Harden - 36.1%   Joel Embiid - 33.9%   Russell Westbrook - 33.2%   Demarcus Cousins - 32.4%   LeBron James - 31.6%
"The title maybe comes from this sentence in his article? ""Oklahoma City has undergone a lot of change this decade—two head coaches, numerous supporting cast members, and a new set of star teammates to replace a former MVP. But there’s been one constant: Russell Westbrook. And that’s where the Thunder’s problems begin.""  I'll ignore all the personal stuff because I don't get why you threw it out lol. If you don't want to discuss sports then leave? Idk complaining about it in a direct response to me is so weird haha"
"I don't know if you know anything about language theory, but titling your article: ""The Thunder Have a Russell Westbrook Problem"" signifies to me that Westbrook makes the team worse."
Throwing mad shade at James Harden and Russell Westbrook here.
Every article I've ever written about Russell Westbrook has been positive. The people who view it as negative are just viewing any criticism as negative. But it's not. The criticism is all valid. The fact is this: Westbrook is already a great player who can be even better. That's a testament to his greatness if it's fair to expect more from him. Same goes for someone like Giannis and AD with their shooting. Maybe I'm just dreaming bigger for Russ than some of his fans.
"&gt; the MVP award has become a ""best storyline award""   No it didn't  &gt; Russell was awarded the MVP because of his Triple-double season  And for so many other reasons  &gt; Because the following season he achieved the same recording breaking achievement yet it was given to Harden  Harden was better, Westbrook was worse  This whole take is ice cold trash"
"Wait, are you saying Russell Westbrook holds onto the ball too much?  Damn I never even noticed..."
"I think we are really going to see it this year honestly. OKC clearly brought in Dennis and kept Felton in order to get multiple playmakers on the court. Our offense was abysmal when anybody not named Russell Westbrook was running it, and his on off stats were staggering. I hope to see a lot of Dennis at the 1, Russ at 2, just like Harden back in the day.  &amp;#x200B;  Donovan's issues are apparent as well. Obviously coaching is hard to really...grade from an outside perspective. However, we've seen questionable calls and adjustments from him his whole NBA coaching career. Like I know it's easy to blame Russ, but I doubt Russ is simply just not following his directions for all these years.   &amp;#x200B;  I don't think it's ego at all. "
!STAT Russell Westbrook PTS/REB/AST 2016-18 -both
So Russell Westbrook is a figment of his imagination huh 
*camera cuts to Russell Westbrook*
"Well KD says here that nobody on OKC had his thought process, guys who can understand the game on the game on every level( this is what separates greatness from just any other superstar)  or just guys who even had the drive to learn as much as humanly possible and be the best version of themselves. Russell Westbrook isn’t that guy, he can’t think through the game like Curry or more importantly Draymond. Playing with guys like that( not to mention Kerr who is a top coach in the NBA) will undoubtedly make you a better player in every facet of the game.   it probably is pretty hard for a guy like KD who values winning so much to relate to a guy like Westbrook who doesn’t understand or maybe just doesn’t care about all the details that go into a basketball game vs a guy a like Draymond who understands all facets of the game and is one of the best in the NBA when it comes to making the right play every time down the stretch of important or close games.   KD recognized that he wouldn’t be able to grow on OKC, so he did what was best for his development as a player. Did he have to go to GS? Maybe not but that’s besides the point "

So Russell Westbrook apparently isn't good according to him. Durant was apparently the only good player on the Thunder. This is why he joined the Warriors.
"He probably shouldn't imply that MVP, triple-double averaging basketball superstar Russell Westbrook  is some jobber that is incapable of supporting a championship effort. Especially after they were extremely close to winning a championship."
"Why tho? You already have a ball-dominant point guard in Curry, wtf kind of sense would it make to replace Harrison Barnes with Russell Westbrook? If other all stars are available like Durant or Horford, I’d rather have them. "
"This is kind of like when Dominique Wilkins said he never played with anyone good, when he played with NBA Champion, 3x MVP, 12x All-Star, Hall of Fame player &amp; one of the 50 Greatest Players of All-Time member Moses Malone.  Sometimes people just say things in haste &amp; don't think about it all that deeply &amp; it becomes a ridiculous soundbyte.   James Harden &amp; Russell Westbrook are destined for the Hall of Fame, much like Kevin Durant. I wouldn't read too much into this. Plus he played with them at a different time, not when they are what they are today. Harden was coming off the bench.  I also thought it was ridiculous when Robert Parish, whom played with Larry Bird &amp; won championships with him, said that Paul Pierce was the best offensive player in Celtics history. But whatever. People say things when pressed and sometimes you'll disagree with it."
"its funny because all types of people in the black community have line-ups. they look correct whether you are wearing slim fit suits in the business world, playing pick-up at the park, dressing like early 2000's allen iverson, or like modern day russell westbrook.  with white people... you just know the type of person you are getting lol. its so out of place. something we shouldn't be doing IMO"
Russell Westbrook James Hardenbrook Kevin Durantbrook Thabo Sefaloshabrook Kendrick Perkinsbrook  All coached by Scott Brooks  Truly a statistical anomaly that the 2012 Thunder were ever together and that they just work for everything. 
"During his MVP season, Russell Westbrook contested less 3 point shots than DeAndre Jordan. (this is what evidence looks like btw)"
"No it doesn't and I'm not saying anything negative about the Raptors  &gt;Is Russell Westbrook a better fit for the Raptors than Lowry?   &gt;Nah. Lowry is the Toronto Raptors. How he goes they go    &gt;Ibaka deserves his own highlight vid. Kawhi did Kawhi things, but Ibaka was the MVP last night. Dude balled out.  &gt;Kawhi was doing Kawhi things but that crowd should have been cheering MVP when ever Ibaka touched the ball. He was great last night  &gt;Man Kawhi is so good. Credet to the Raptors for that trade  "
"This point is spot on and something Ive talked about in the past. Forget Scary Terry there is nobody on that roster built ot guard Kyrie.   They've had to split the defending of 1's between Robert Covington and Ben Simmons. Simmons can handle certain matchups like Russell Westbrook with size and Covington has done admirably against the Goran Dragic's of the world. But neither is built for Kyrie.   Fultz in theory might be.....but again this is all in theory. I don't think his defense has looked particularly good so far this year through a few games. Also one big reason Boston defended Philly so well is how aggressively they played off their non shooters like Ben Simmons. If Fultz cant be a reliable shooting threat now you pair him and Simmons together? Thatll never work vs Brad Stevens.   Look the reason they traded all they did for Fultz was because in theory how well he specifically fits this team. But if his jumper aint gonna be a threat they also need JJ Redick's floor spacing so badly. It goes beyond JJ's 3 point %, the way he spaces the floor coming off screens amongst many other things is a unique skill. "
You're talking a lot of sense here idk why you were getting down voted.  Russell Westbrook could use some changing in his playstyle. Totally legit criticism.
"Nah I get what u see but all you lot post is Russell Westbrook doing shit, why dont u post what good he does for the team? I swear this agenda is so old and boring"
"you've clearly never watched russell westbrook play the game. in fact a lot of people out of okc do it the most, really makes you think."
"&gt; Russell Westbrook : 32/10/8 on 57/**17/45**  Aw yeah, that's my MVP"
"Mark Jackson. Someone that can actually talk to Russell Westbrook because he is the Thunder. Scott Brooks is known for avoiding confrontational situations and wanting everything to just be all good (I'll post a link to the interview with the analyst that said it later). Billy Donovan just looks to be there, I get no sense of presence and authority from him. I think having a coach like Jackson with Westbrook is a better fit than what he's had thus far. It's not even about the Xs and Os, I do think Donovan can coach. But the game is more than just plays, and Jackson I feel grasps the mental and emotional aspects better than most and could be tough but fair, judicious but empathetic. He's got experience coaching and having been a PG, there's another potential connection there. "
Russell Westbrook player coach 
All 5 proceed to go 0-82 and Russell Westbrook wins MVP for averaging the first ever quadruple double. 
Is no one gonna mention that Russell Westbrook had 32 points? Just me? Ok.
"Russell Westbrook, pretty good guard for being 5'10"""
They're going to tell that story for generations. *Russell Westbrook dived on my grandma*
"I think the NFL inflates their numbers. I have no proof of this, but honestly most of the things people are saying in this thread are complete bullshit, so it's not like there's a sensible explanation otherwise. There's no explanation for why there's like double digits guys *per year* at the NFL combine that put up some of the highest verts ever recorded at the NBA combine. Sorry but some 5th round fullback or linebacker doesn't jump 8 inches higher than Russell Westbrook, that's ridiculous."
"Russell Westbrook has figured out a way to stat-pad efficiency.  And, now, it's fucking ON"
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Russell Westbrook. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Russell. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
"You have no idea how much I love Russell Westbrook. This guy is basically my god, the almighty to me if you will. If Russell asked me to surrogate his kids I’d change my gender for him. I would charge into battle like a medieval peasant just to get slaughtered by a knight if it meant I’d gain his respect. I would give this man my lunch money AND my lunch to prevent him from ever going hungry. He’s finally back, and I’ve dearly missed my Brodie."
"Russell Westbrook puts up better stats than LeBron James but I know who I’d rather have on my team lol. You can look at the stat sheet or you could look at the actual game, Rondo’s impact on those teams were larger than his PPG, dude had games where he’d score 2 points but dominated every aspect of the game anyway."
"Not since they have it all recorded, so since 1983. If you exclude turnovers, Russell Westbrook last year had the only game before that happened like that. He made 6/6 from field and 6/6 free throws too."
*Russell Westbrook jumps in outta nowhere*  
I'm super high on Zach. Think he'll be a star. But he's just not a Russell Westbrook type.  The only thing that ties them together is athleticism and UCLA.

Are we watching an evolution to a Russell Westbrook type player...with a better jump shot?
"Ok, here are the top 5 best per-minute PG's:  1. Steph Curry  2. Chris Paul  3. Kyle Lowry  4. Russell Westbrook  5. Damian Lillard  Disclaimer: This is using ESPN's RPM data before you shit on me"
"LeBron: 31.0/9.2/8.2/1.9/1.2 with 4.0 turnovers on 54.2/36.5/70.9 with 61.8 TS% and a 32.6 Usage%  KD: 28.6/7.6/4.1/0.8/1.2 with 2.8 turnovers on 48.3/34.7/89.5 with 60.1 TS% and a 30.5 Usage%  But if you just use the last 2 season   KD: 28.8/7.8/4.5/0.8/1.3 with 2.4 turnovers on 51.4/37.9/89.8 with 63.5 TS% and a 29.7 Usage%  LeBron: 33.5/9.1/8.5/1.6/1.2 with 4.2 turnovers on 55.0/37.6/72.5 with 63.2 TS% and a  33.5 Usage%  So I guess the point of this is Russell Westbrook made things more difficult for KD, LeBron had an all time postseason in 2016, and LeBron took even more control over the Cavs offense the past 2 years while KD refined his skills over less minutes and with less control over the offense."
I could watch Russell Westbrook dance all day
"I thought it'd be interesting to list the players who have never won a championship, since they have enough accolades to appear on this list without championships.

"Okay, glad i have you here, to tell me how consistently dominant Wilt was then. You can start by explaining why Wilt, who was consistently dominant as you claim, consistently led below average offenses (sometimes absolute bottom offenses) in his first 7 seasons in the NBA and why his dominance only translated into 2 championships.  &gt;Pardon if I'm dumb but this sentence makes no sense, your spelling is the only L here.  You have any sort of mental/cognitive disability you want to tell me about? If so please do, and i will adjust this conversation accordingly.   Durant is not the best player on the Warriors. Steph Curry is.   &gt; Don't put words into my mouth, never said guys like Malone/Dirk/Oscar are blatantly worse than KD they have an argument but I ain't taking them over KD to my team.   The debate isn't about who would you take for your team. The debate is about ranking the greatest basketball players ever. You might have a different criteria than me, and that's fine, because everybody has their own, but your criteria needs to make sense within your own logical frame. You can't just randomly throw names on a table and see what stick if you want to be taken seriously. If you value prime a LOT more over longevity, i don't think that's a fair way of looking at things, but ok, in that case Durant can be higher BUT putting guys like 10th and Kobe 10th doesn't make sense because Shaq was a clearly superior player to Kobe in his prime. So was Duncan, KG and D-Rob...   &gt;Durant is black holes ahead of Curry lol.  No he's not. Curry is a much better offensive player. Curry is a comparable scorer, better playmaker, better on-ball and off-ball, better pick 'n roll player, GOAT gravity from the perimeter.   Durant wasn't a better player than Curry in 2015 (where Curry lead his team to a title, Durant was injured) and in 2016 where Curry averaged 30 ppg on 68%TS with almost 7 assists en route to winning a record-breaking 73 games.   And there's no reason to see Durant as better now, just because he joined the Warriors and can average 30 ppg with minimal resistance from defenses.  &gt; Your ass really thinks KD is frequently unguarded come on now are you really that dumb? KD averages 27/8/3 against Tony Allen, that's a great locking up.   Go watch the Finals in the last two seasons. Not only were the Cavs a bad defensive team, but their gameplan was to stick to Curry at all costs. Durant had more time and space to go to work than any offensive star in NBA history. Kudos to him for taking advantage of that.  In the 2016 playoffs, before leaving OKC, KD averaged 28/7/3 on 54%TS, .130 WS/48, 1.8 BPM... That's not dominating, those numbers are closer to Carmelo Anthony than any Top 10 player of all-time.  In 2013, he lost to the Grizz comfortably in the playoffs, again 30 ppg but 53%TS and not much else  In 2014, the Grizzlies took OKC to 7 games in the first round. Durant averaged 30/7/3 on 54%TS. Again, slightly better Melo numbers. Overall playoff run .145 WS/48, 4.3. Again, not really ALL-TIME Great stuff. Curry has put up way better performances in the playoffs than this and he was getting ethered for underperforming.   His last two playoff runs before joining the most stacked team of all-time were shaky.   &gt; KD is 10 times more impactful on offense and is a better playmaker than most of the guys you mentioned, Malone averaged 3.2 assists, Robinson averaged 2.3. Idk about you but about some of those guys being better playmakers than KD chief said that that ain't it.   I think KD is a better player than Malone, i just don't rank him higher because his career is 1/2 of Malone's and that's a massive difference. Robinson has an arugment over KD because he is one of the best defensive players of all-time, hence his defense is 10 times better than Durants. Offensively he's not better, clearly, but he's good nonetheless.   Problem with D-Rob is that he hasn't played with much talent in the prime of his career. He was clearly the best player on his teams by a clear margin and his teams did great, arguably better than KD, relative to the talent levels. Spurs were a Top 5 team in the league in '91 and Top 3 in '94, '95 and '96, averaging close to 60 wins in those years. The difference of finishing off those seasons with a title is having Dale Davis as your 2nd best player, or Sean Elliott, instead of players like Westbrook, Harden, Ibaka, Adams, Curry, Klay, Draymond, Iguodala... The talent level gap is absurd. We've never seen prime Durant play on a mediocre team. The only time was half a season in 2014, and when he got to the playoffs he got clapped by the Grizz easily, and his scoring (which is by far his main source of impact, unlike someone like D-Rob) fell off.   &gt; True, it doesn't, but when you do it 4 times it starts to mean more than you think.   Yes, it means exactly that. You led the league in scoring 4-times. You want to know who else led the league in scoring 4-times? Allen Iverson. That doesn't make him anywhere near the player Duncan/KG were despite both of them having 0 combined, and not coming close even once in their careers. Again, you're overblowing scoring like a prototypical casual you are.   &gt; How many mainly defence guys you see on top 15s? You'll most likely see 1 that is Bill Russel. The other ones mostly focus on scoring and KD is arguably better than all of them at doing that.   For some reason, you're acting like scoring = whole offensive impact. It's not. Some of the best offensive players of all-time are mediocre scorers but terrific playmakers. They run better offenses than KD. KD can't run a better offense than CP3, he's not a better offensive player than him, despite that he can average 10 more points than him, because Paul makes everyone around him better to the extent KD doesn't.   If we're looking at dominance relative to era, Bill Russell was the centerpiece of 11 title teams, and his defense was by far the main reason that was able to come into fruition. His impact defensively in the 60's is unrivaled by any player at any point in NBA history, because of how ahead of his time he was. The reason i'm not putting him #1 is because he took advantage of a time frame in history where the league was still in its infancy, talent level was poor, offenses were raw and not sophisticated at all etc. If Russell played in the modern era he wouldn't be able to replicate his defensive impact against today's teams. But it's hard to fault Russell too much for something he had no control over.   KD's combined impact on both ends of the court doesn't even come close to that. As good as you're touting Durant to be offensively, we never seen him have that type of impact. He has been the best offensive player on some really really good offensive teams, but a lot of that credit also goes to Westbrook, who is one of the best offensive players in the league as well, and a relatively good cast of players.   &amp;#x200B;"

Is Russell Westbrook a superstar yet? 
What about the Russell Westbrook Problem they have tho? 
"Lonzo still has all-star potential.  Remember the 2017 NBA offseason? Everything Lonzo was the biggest shit around. I don’t think I’ve ever seen any rookie’s debut in basketball hit Lonzo levels of box office before. Everybody, even casual fans, were tuning into his fucking summer league games, and it had the atmosphere of a boxing megafight all around it. Shit was just crazy.  Obviously at the time some strongly believed that he would be a generational talent, and for fair reason. He was a knockdown sniper coming out of UCLA, and his transcendent and uber-efficient passing touted marquee potential. The Ball family peaking obviously played a part in his marketability that year too. Lamelo scoring 92, his shitty reality tv show, and of course his dad. So with the hype, talent, and physicality he had, he had as much of a chance as anybody to be a star in the league. But something happened.  He fucked up.  He couldn’t score for his goddamn life. Couldn’t shoot, couldn’t finish, nothing. And by the way, as a sidenote, I think his finishing is far more problematic than his jumpshot right now. People should be shitting on that way more than his jumpshot. I mean, I can see why people are attacking his jumper. It looks awful, he frequently airballs, etc. The thing is though, at the end of the day, at 32% 3P percentage he had a fairly common rookie shooting toll last year. He was just really inconsistent. When he was hot, he was hot. When he was off, he was off. He hit rookie walls. It’s just the eye account makes it look worse than it already is. His numbers aren’t something we’ve never seen before. Russell Westbrook, who takes a similar amount of 3s, has a career 3P% of 32.1. Lonzo's is far from the bricklayer everybody is describing him to be. 32% is league average. I'm not that worried about his jumper at all. His finishing, however, is just god-awful though. I’ve never seen somebody as bad as him around the rim. He’s missed a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot of bunnies. The league average finishing percentile is around 62.4%. And if you check on bballref, lonzo’s finishing percentage is 49.4%. Very well below league average. The league average isn’t even that fair of a comparison since it takes into account the shooting tolls of every type of position. So I compared Lonzo’s finishing to somebody who should have had roughly the same type of finishing opportunities he has: Andre Roberson. Even somebody as offensively blunt as Andre Roberson had a finishing percentage of 68.1% last year. Do you realize how fucking horrible that makes Lonzo’s? And his lazy haters think shitting on his jumpshot is the way to attack him. Anyways, (goddamn that was a long sidenote) back to my point. So the hype died down completely after about 10 games. The Lonzo hype from then to now has been dormant. And people started talking. They said he was a bust, they said he had one of the worst rookie campaigns of all time. That was generally the notion going on in r/nba. And the shit’s worse outside of the internet. I come across stupid people in my area once in a while, and I’ve heard my friends saying he doesn’t belong in the league (havent bothered respecting anything basketball-related theyve said since).  I keep hearing this shit recently now that the season’s back into play, and I’ve lost it.  First of all, you better believe, no, know that Lonzo goddamn belongs in this league. He’s done literally everything that was advertised at UCLA besides scoring. This man is a top 10 playmaker in this league. He is a top 10 rebounding guard. And his defense was much better than advertised at UCLA too. His defense is somewhere between good and elite. Try debating any of the 3 strengths I’ve listed above. Good luck, you can’t. And if you think you have, you’re probably very wrong. Lonzo does so many things off the stat sheet to help a team win. All this shit alone makes him at least a top 100 player in this league atm, so for my most ignorant Lonzo haters, stop with that notion for god’s sake.  Now for my more educated Lonzo haters, good job. You’re not retarded like the first group. But, you’re still probably wrong. I’d say this tier of Lonzo haters believe that Lonzo will never be an all star. Nope. Think about the strengths I listed in the above paragraph. Lonzo only needs to be about a 70th percentile scorer to be an elite player. How far-fetched is that notion really? You think he'll be a worse scorer this year? He only needs to be respectable to open up the rest of his already very well established game. You think he’s gonna pass worse if his opponents start paying more attention to him? You think he's gonna shrink in size if he scores a couple more buckets? No. Becoming just about a respectable scorer will compliment the rest of his game very well, and would make him roughly a top 40-60 player immediately (he'll be around Rubio or Jrue Holiday level). Now obviously, this hasn't happened yet. And as far as we know, Lonzo could be a worse scorer this year. But seriously? What do you think is more plausible? He's gonna become an even worse scorer as the years go by? Or his offensive game is gonna gradually improve from an already very shaky rookie compaign? If NBA trainers can't teach a player with Lonzo's physique how to fucking finish, i don't know what good they're for. I don't know what's more fixable on the offensive end than a player's finishing ability. It's very plausible to believe that he is going to improve to at least this 40-60 range in the near future. If I was a betting man on whether he'd make or break 40-60 range, I'd do it in a heartbeat. He can improve a lot. Now admittedly, he's still not an all-star if he's just about this good. But it would be a great baseline for him to work from. If he becomes a tad bit better than what I describe here, I think it's fairly possible that he will make his way to become the marquee player he has been on every stage prior to this league. And he'll be a whole lot damn well better than what y'all think he'll be. Lonzo Ball still has every bit of the potential to be what he was touted to be before the draft: an all-star. And guess what? Even if he doesn't, chances are he'll still be pretty damn good."
"I thought this would be a fun chance for me to look at teams/players that I haven't seen that much of. Did my best but I don't catch as many games as is really needed to do this well. Also any player that was/is injury for a significant time I will judge as if they will be back to full strength. So Hayward will get a pass for the games this year as it has been too short to truly judge him yet. I will also exclude rookies for the top ten. Anyways here's my list:  PG:  1. Stephen Curry 2. Russell Westbrook 3. Chris Paul 4. Damian Lillard 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Kyle Lowry 7. John Wall 8. Ben Simmons 9. Kemba Walker 10. Mike Conley  This is the deepest position for elite talent; for me 4 through 10 are pretty close but there is a good drop to 11, etc. I have Rubio, Dragic, and Bledsoe as the next three. As a note (and this will probably be disregarded due to flair), I think you overrate Lonzo, there are probably 15-20 players I would have above him right now, and it might be more depending on his minutes this year. Not to say he won't end up top ten (he easily could be top ten with an average shot), but right now he is not that close. I'm pretty excited by last year's pg class and think some of them will end up in this top ten in the next couple years (hope one of them is Fox).  &amp;#x200B;  SG:  1. James Harden 2. Jimmy Butler 3. Klay Thompson 4. DeMar DeRozan 5. Victor Oladipo 6. Bradley Beal 7. Jrue Holiday 8. CJ McCollum 9. Donovan Mitchell 10. Devin Booker  I thought this was going to be a weak position group but there are a ton of good SG's right now that make up for the lack of elite SG's. I had Jaylen Brown as a SG and he just missed the cut. He is probably top ten if you put him at SF (Bball ref has him 51/45% SG/SF last year). A couple others were hard to leave out: Lou Williams, Gary Harris, Will Barton, Brown, Tyreek Evans, and JJ Redick were all right there for me. I also think this position will have some up and comers this year. Zach LaVine, Josh Richardson, Buddy Hield, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Josh Hart, and Tim Hardaway Jr are all very good young players at this position.  &amp;#x200B;  SF:  1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Paul George 5. Gordon Hayward 6. Khris Middleton 7. Otto Porter Jr 8. Jayson Tatum 9. Joe Ingles 10. Harrison Barnes  This position has the most top end talent but is relatively shallow after the top guys. My next five were Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Taurean Prince, Brandon Ingram, Robert Covington and Andrew Wiggins. I think Barnes is underrated due to being on a bad team, but I expect he will be outside the top 10 for Prince or Ingram by the end of the year. I have Giannis as a PF.   &amp;#x200B;  PF  1. Anthony Davis 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. LaMarcus Aldridge 4. Draymond Green 5. Kevin Love 6. Blake Griffin 7. Kristaps Porzingis 8. Derrick Favors 9. Nikola Mirotic 10. Tobias Harris  This is the weakest position for me. My next three would be Paul Millsap, Aaron Gordon, and Dario Saric. I feel like I might be missing someone here because that group in just not that good. Millsap two years ago would easily make the top 10 but he slowed down last year. Not sure who else deserve consideration.  &amp;#x200B;  C  1. Joel Embiid 2. Nikola Jokic 3. DeMarcus Cousins 4. Rudy Gobert 5. Karl-Anthony Towns 6. Al Horford 7. Andre Drummond 8. Clint Capela 9. Steven Adams 10. Marc Gasol  Another group that was deeper than I thought. My next four would be Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, Jusuf Nurkic, and Hassan Whiteside. Lots of potential here for some young guys. I think particularly Jarrett Allen and Deandre Ayton have a chance at top ten by the end of the year.   &amp;#x200B;  Let me know why this entirely too long post is wrong!  &amp;#x200B;"
"Yeah chill dude. Its not like he threw a Finals game (yeah this was also a shot against JR Smith) for you to call him out and label him a **very low IQ thirsty selfish glory chaser** what the fuck are you talking about?  Don’t forget this guy lead his team in beating the Paul George, Russell Westbrook lead Thunder in six fucking games **AS A FUCKING ROOKIE**  Calling him low BBIQ  thirsty selfish glory chaser is disrespectful and delusional get some fucking help will you."
I think the Thunder need Russell Westbrook.
Mine is  1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Anthony Davis 4. Stephen Curry 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. James Harden 7. Russell Westbrook 8. Giannis Antetokounmpo 9. Kyrie Irving 10. Jimmy Butler 
Only 4 other players outside your top 5 have multiple game 7s on their resume  [Russell Westbrook](http://bkref.com/tiny/2HIRc)  [Chris Paul](http://bkref.com/tiny/BCX5D)  [Paul George](http://bkref.com/tiny/FYlt3)  [Klay Thompson](http://bkref.com/tiny/nAWVa)
"LeBron is more efficient lol? By what metric? Please mention TS% so I could have a good laugh.   Really dude, DBPM and defensive ratings?? By those metrics Russell Westbrook is a better defender than Anthony Davis, you agree with that? These stats are more team oriented and affected by pace so they’re misleading.  &gt;More clutch? Tough to debate something like that  Normally I’d agree with that statement but not when comparing LeBron to Jordan. Those couple no pressure, go into overtime worst case scenario buzzer beaters were cute and all but that doesn’t make him clutch than Michael Fucking Jordan. And those stats are nice but I think this graphic tells [a better story](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DbrziTVWAAIP7aY.jpg) "
"&gt; Russell Westbrook (Not efficient, but can play consistent elite defense  I'm not so sure about the ""elite defense"" part of that. The ""not efficient"" part is definitely true."
"I think his most recent was one of the most impressive runs we've ever seen in the NBA. Against a 73-win reigning championship squad, that just knocked off Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, two HOFers in their primes, the previous series... and the Cavs were down 3-1 before a huge comeback. It's hard to top that."
thick trunky coastal kid  silicon valley  the nba is like a business  russell westbrook and kevin durant are going through a divorce  lebron is in his mogul stage
&gt;LBJ is a much more versatile player. Stats will show you that.  Lol right because of a couple more assists and rebounds. Russell Westbrook must be your 2nd GOAT I’m guessing. 
Except ESPN did http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24655062/russell-westbrook-arthroscopic-knee-surgery-miss-oklahoma-city-thunder-first-games
I think it’s mostly fun. What I remember is that Russell Westbrook went up and goatended Rocky’s half court shot during a time out. And then next time they played Rocky had a bunch of fake mascot security to make sure he didn’t get goaltended. So not really direct interaction. I found two clips. https://youtu.be/dVfdFDt6aF4 and https://youtu.be/sOkOW0YpG2Q
"Per the article  &gt; he ""would have been in a Lakers uniform"" if he had never been traded from the Indiana Pacers. But after the Pacers dealt the five-time All-Star to the Oklahoma City Thunder instead last year, he fell in love with his new team and playing with Russell Westbrook   Saving you guys clicks and adding some context "
Jordan would just be Russell Westbrook in today's nba
Espn:  Did Lebron make the wrong decision?  Skip Bayless:  See?? Lebron is overrated now that he isnt in the Leastern Conference  Nick Wright:  Don't worry guys he's just resting for playoffs  Colin Cowherd:  Lebron should win MVP instead of Westbrook.  Russell is just a stat padder 
"It blows my mind that there are people who make accounts for the sole purpose of shitting on Russell Westbrook, or any player. It's ok if you don't like him but how in the fuck could anyone care *that* much? That's just sad for real."
Rocky has a feud with Russell Westbrook I think. There should definitely be more of these. 
Let's go with the hot take: I'd rather have Ben Simmons as my Point Guard than Russell Westbrook.
"not only that, he used to as a metric to base who a better defender is. Is Russell Westbrook a better defender than Draymond Green? because he has more steals per game so he must be!!!!!!!!!!"
"They'll probably make hybrid monstars, like Russell Westbrook + Boban = some magnificent 7'9"" speeding bullet."
"&gt; ""Russell Westbrook can't shoot, can't do much of anything"" - Donovan Mitchell  Is OP, which was a misquoting of what Mitchell said, and he was misquoting in jest."
ESPN: Donovan Mitchell calls Russell Westbrook 1-dimensional
"""Russell Westbrook can't shoot, can't do much of anything"" - Donovan Mitchell"
Russell Westbrook has a few dealerships in LA and OC. John Elway has a couple out here as well. I’m guessing in Colorado too

"""Russell Westbrook is not a good basketball player"""
"&gt; He genuinely had a lot of underwhelming games in the playoffs.  He's played five career playoff games. How is it even possible to have ""a lot"" of anything in the playoffs with a five game sample size???  &gt; You see Brodie willing his team to victories even if it means shooting the ball up 35 times. It's not a clever strategy, but the point is that he backs himself to lead the team to victory all the very time.  And? You're trashing KAT for his playoff history but giving Russell Westbrook of all people a free pass? How did he do in the postseason last year?"
Wow it’s also my birthday AND Russell Westbrook day. Amazing.
"No, that is a poor reading of my comment. Let me copy your earlier one for clarity:  &gt; James Harden is a better basketball player than Russell Westbrook **because of better TS%**.  &gt; Kobe or Duncan are not top 10 players **because they have relatively lower TS% than other players with similar accomplishments**.  Both of those examples are using a specific stat to reach a conclusion that goes beyond what said stat can tell them. I'd re-word the first one like:  ""James Harden is a better *scorer* than Russell Westbrook because he can score a similar amount of points on better TS%.""  It's much more defensible, and while there might be a few factors we're missing out on (teammates, system, etc.), at least it's a start in the right direction. It uses TS% to reach conclusions about scoring ability.  OR  ""One of the main things/The main thing that separates Harden from Westbrook as a player is Harden's superior TS%.""  This is fine by me, too. It at least acknowledges in some way that there are other factors, and that the two players are similar enough in those other aspects of the game that efficiency can be a deciding factor. There is room for discussion about those other factors, if there is disagreement."
James Harden is a better basketball player than Russell Westbrook because of better TS%.  Kobe or Duncan are not top 10 players because they have relatively lower TS% than other players with similar accomplishments.  Are those reasonable opinions or are they misuse?
"Imagine the reaction if GSW, still on the court after winning the title, had to play a full second game immediately after as Russell Westbrook or James Harden led their squads onto the floor with the Playoff in the Bank Briefcase!  Book it."
A star genuinely enjoys playing with Russell Westbrook. Can ESPN stop with the what ifs?
* Paul Pierce  * Kevin Garnett  * Marcus Smart  * Russell Westbrook
"My point is, it's part of a normal scheme to pass out to an open shooter. The player creates an offensive threat for the defense, and exploits the gap in the defense that creates an open shooter. That's a scheme. That's accepted as a scheme. Everyone agrees that's great basketball. However, if a team's scheme is to have the bigger players box out so that the smaller, faster players can rebound and push the transition pace, suddenly it's stat padding. All it is is a scheme.   Honestly, if you watch the Thunder, you'd see it. He's not givign up easy shots for assists unless he's blatantly showing off, but those clips will get posted without context anyway. They're not compromising ball movement to get the ball in his hands, there's not enough off-ball movement to facilitate more ball movement. It's hard to pass when no one is open. That's why they stick so hard to ISO, pick and roll, and drive and kick.   What if the other players put the ball in the basket more often? What if the other players passed? The blame is only placed on Russ. You look at a box score, or see that the [Thunder are 22 - 26 when Russ takes more than 17 shots](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2018/03/07/the-thunder-are-now-22-26-when-russell-westbrook-takes-over-17-shots/), and then see his usage rate, and just assume he's the problem. Never mind how things like usage rate are calculated, which influences why his is so high more than the team's actual scheme. Never mind that the [Thunder are 9.2 ppp better when Russ grabs a defensive rebound, or that that's 10,9 ppp than league average.](https://mobile.twitter.com/bballport/status/984806703832051712) 108.1 when he's on the floor, but he doesn't rebound. The next best on the team is Adams, at 118.6. Never mind that his teammates shoot better from his passes than they do normally (I don't have my source for this, it was saved on my last account).  Nope. Russ is a statpadder."
The worst part was when he called Westbrook Russell Wilson lmao
"Russell Westbrook is one of the most athletic players we’ve ever seen. Yes you can’t yet judge Zion, but from what we *have* seen he looks to be right up there with the most explosive jumpers ever"
Did he forget that:  Russell Westbrook won an MVP. (KD hasn't  since leaving OKC)   Russell Westbrook has averaged a triple-double the last two seasons thus all of guaranteeing his HOF status  Russell Westbrook has become Jordan Brand's marquee athlete.  Russell Westbrook earns more money on the court + probably off the court considering all Westbrook's fashion endorsements.  Russell Westbrook has even gotten married and birthed a child.  Just a throw in: Russell Westbrook is every old head's favorite point guard. If you think I'm lying visit a black barbershop - trust 
"If Simmons ever develops a pull up jumper, it's game over. The Celtics were able to contain his drives a few times. Seeing him not even think about pulling up for his own shot, instead passing it to a teammate was pretty frustrating. If he ever develops some sort of jump shot I wouldn't be surprised if he had a 30/10/10 Russell Westbrook type of season. "
You miss 56.1% of the shots you don't heave from half court.  -Russell Westbrook

"I'm 100% out on everything Russell Westbrook.   He'll rack up all his counting stats and be inefficient and the Thunder will do nothing for years, but people will still consider him a great player because he has good highlights.  "
If rings are the only thing that matter then Dellevadova is a better PG than Russell Westbrook and James Harden.  
"I agree, as Lebron has always been a candidate for the award year after year. I mean, he carried the Cavs to the finals last season compared to a superior supporting cast for James Harden (even though he did have a fantastic season!). I think the line is being pushed and pulled in one of two directions each season - individual success vs team success. There is never a clear balance between the two. For example, when Russell Westbrook took home MVP honours even though the Thunder placed 6th."

"They don’t have a former Wildcat but the Thunder are incredibly fun to watch.  They have Russell Westbrook who is one of the most energising and fun players to watch, we have one of, if not THE best defense in the league all while having one of our best defensive player injured. We’re potentially the 2nd best team in the stacked West and potentially in the “Title contenders but not really becaus the Warriors exist” group.

"Embiid’s usage: 32.1%  Russ usage: 35%  Embiid has halved his turnovers from last year bc he’s had his first healthy offseason since he was a senior in high school. Keep in mind, going into this season he had played less than 200 organized basketball games in his entire life, and a lot of those turnovers were due to a lack of experience. This year those dumb turnovers are not happening.   Obviously, a pg is going to be the better play maker, but Embiid is better at everything else.

"You see, all of those wide open shots he got with us were ruined because Russell ""makes all of his teammates worse"" Westbrook was the one passing to him. Now that Chris ""better than that bum Russell Westbrook"" Paul is passing to him, he will be able to shoot again!  Oh and don't forget, their wide open threes are system threes!

Classic Marv: Russell Wet... Westbrook..
Bill Russell Westbrook
Good now we can move onto why russell westbrook is better than harden
wow with this meltdown  Youd almost forget that Russell Westbrook will always be better than James Harden
"Durant, AD, Kawhi, Giannis, Harden, Kyrie, Harden, and (in a couple yrs) Embiid. Maaaybe Lillard. Depending on the supporting cast, I'd also add Klay Thompson and Russell Westbrook.      After that, it'd be hard to list anyone else regardless of their supporting cast. For example, let's say there was a hypothetical team of Kemba Walker, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Paul Millsap, and Clint Capela. All are good to all-star level players. Depending on whom you rank higher, that team's best player would be either PG13 or Butler (both around a top 12-18ish player) Would that team be able to beat any of the championship winning teams since 2008?     The problem with having a Top 15-20ish player be the #1 option is that the top end talent would be too low to win a championship. Go back through the last 40 yrs of the NBA and look at all the title winning teams and who the best players were: Kareem, Magic, Bird, Moses Malone, Isiah, MJ, Hakeem, Duncan, Shaq, Kobe, Wade, KG, Nowitzki, Lebron, Steph, KD.... All were superstars, Top 15-ish all-time, or Top 3-ish in that current time."

Ah Dennis Schroder. The NBA player who is better than Russell Westbrook.
"Some reporters are so damn entitled and Stephen A is one of them.  I knew these athletes are paid millions of pounds and they shouldn't be above criticism but some of these 'reporters' like SAS, Bayless and Colin Cowherd make millions off just trolling and ranting about famous athletes all day.  Look at Skip with Lebron and Cowherd with Russell Westbrook and Aaron Rodgers. If those players want to take shots at reporters than they should be able to.    The other day Cowherd said on national TV that Rodgers didn't travel with his teammates to the Patriots game and got a private jet...basically saying he keeps away from his teammates unlike Brady but on the Packers Instagram page you see Rodgers and Cobb pictured coming off the team plane. How can lies like that be allowed?"

I don’t think it’s gonna happen.  Russell Westbrook is sooo not showing up for that draft.
Russell Westbrook.

"Most likely this. I'd say the secondary choices are:  East:  1. Kawhi Leonard  2. Kyrie Irving  3. Joel Embiid   West:  1. James Harden  2. Anthony Davis  3. Russell Westbrook   For the East, I think Kyrie has a strong enough brand that he could get the top seat if Giannis goes down and Kawhi performs poorly or Kyrie performs well. Embiid is a popularity magnet, not much else to say. He won't get it unless he puts on an MVP-caliber show, and Giannis already has a significant lead in stats and in popularity.  In the West, I think that Harden's MVP gives him the (second) strongest claim to captain. Russ is polarizing, whereas AD is not, so I think that AD has a better claim. KD would have to regress and whichever secondary captain contender would have to step it up, but KD could lose without serious injury.  As for honorable mentions: Voters don't seem to like Damian Lillard that much. DeMar will have a tough time with a small local fanbase. There's a really far-out chance that the LA market puts enough pressure on the league offices for LeBron to become captain in the West."
"Jokic : ""No homo. I pick-pick Giannis...uh... A for his length""  Embiid : ""I select Westbrook. Congrats Russell on not getting dunk on by the Process this year"""
Some of those plays are actually absurd. Like a giant Russell Westbrook
"I mean, people are doing that with Ben Simmons right? But Simmons has the height advantage and can pass over players much easier.  I think best case Zion can be Russell Westbrook and that’s great but again it’s a huge assumption to think they do make that NBA leap"
"We’re losing because Stan Van assembled a pretty terrible team. Our point guard thinks he’s Russell Westbrook but is in fact barely a starting caliber player. We have to play ZaZa decent minutes because the bigs Stan drafted are terrible. Lottery pick Stanley Johnson has been a bust. And while Blake has been great, Stan shipped away last year’s first to get him, so we didn’t have a chance to pick up any young talent to build around. Not that Stan would have been able to do anything with that pick anyway if he was around. We are talking about the guy who took Luke Kennard ahead of Donovan Mitchell.   I will not blame any struggles this year on Casey. He’s done a nice job with Blake, and he doesn’t have much else to work with right now. "
"Russell Westbrook is the modern Allen Iverson. A great player with a cult of personality, but not necessarily one of a playstyle that is conducive to winning or any real team success. His value is overstated and his game is self-centered. "
Khris Middleton and Kyle Lowry underrated. Russell Westbrook and James Harden overrated.
Russell Westbrook is at worst a top 8 player and anyone who has him outside the top 10 is clearly not objective. This sub is just too biased towards efficient shooters
"Hedging is a type of Pick-and-Roll defense when the big man jumps in front of the ball handler before recovering back to their man.  [Watch how Giannis defends Lillard on this play](https://youtu.be/GywONxVisys?t=118) - that is a hedge.  The guard fights through the screen and recovers back to the ball handler after the hedge.  It is the most traditional PnR coverage, I believe OKC mostly uses hedging.  It is good at preventing the ball handler from getting an open shot, but a good passing PG can hit the roll man easily unless the team cheats off the shooters on the weakside.  Drop coverage is when the big man defending the screener just drops towards the rim, staying between the ball handler and the rim.  It is up to the guard to fight through the screen to prevent the ball handler from getting an open shot.  [Watch Brook Lopez on this play as he drops and Kemba makes him pay.](https://youtu.be/Pt8gCBBDHJc?t=178)  In general, dropping is good for protecting the rim and guarding against corner threes.  But hedging is good for stopping the ball handler from using the pick to get an open shot.  Drop coverage is the way to defend Russell Westbrook, but hedging/switching is the way to defend Stephen Curry.  "
"I can't stand Russell Westbrook. His Brody ""I do what I want"" persona bugs the crap out of me. I can't stand his version of hero ball. He sucks at shooting threes and takes way too many.  But the L is way more fun when I can hate on him. Get well soon, Russ."
"For reference here's his 2015 top 5:  1. Anthony Davis (22, 3rd year rookie deal)  2. LeBron James (31, 1st year 1+1 max deal)  3. Steph Curry (27, 2nd year 4/44 contract)  4. James Harden (25, 3rd year 5/80 contract)  5. Russell Westbrook (26, 3rd year 5/80 contract) "

"Fun fact, this 86-87 season was Michael’s most efficient scoring at 33.4 points per 36 minutes. The closest NBA player to that kind of scoring efficiency? (aside from Wilt)  2016-2017 MVP Russell Westbrook, at 32.9 points per 36.   This is a higher efficiency than Curry (31.7), Harden (30.9), Durant (29.9), Lebron (27.4), Kobe (31.1) or anyone in a whole season, while also managing to average 10 assists and 10 rebounds per game at the same time.   In case you’ve ever wondered why he earned MVP that year."

Russell Westbrook &gt; KD. 
"Because Russell Westbrook is not the GM or coach and doesn't orchestrate the game plan on how those players are used. If you actually had any basketball knowledge you would understand this. Legit every single person you listed was used in the wrong way BY THE COACH (for example: playing Oladipo and Sabonis next to Russ as spot up shooters, making durant be a pure isolation scorer and not moving him around and using his gravity to the teams advantage, not starting harden even though he was still rough around the edges, etc.) These are ALL either coaching decisions by two of the worst coaches at rotations and making plays in the ENTIRE LEAGUE or GM decisions that had to be made because of the Durant situation and the fuck up by the GM for not resigning Harden. Is it Lebron's fault that Ingram isn't fitting together with his style of play, or is it the coaches and GM's fault for not getting Lebron the correct pieces? Russ did his best to work with what he had but he straight up didn't have the correct pieces around him. Also Ibaka's best years where arguably in OKC, Reggie Jackson was used correctly he was just stubborn and wanted to start that wasn't Russ's fault at all, they had Steven Adams so why would they start Kanter, and Harden was no where near the player he is in his prime in Houston. Russ isnt the fucking GM and the coach stop acting like he is.  "
Noooo....that title is securely owned by a combination of James Harden and Russell Westbrook
"A few things to note here:   1) I don't think I hear anyone actually call him ""subpar"", so this seems like a straw man.   2) His assist to turnover ratio hasn't been great throughout his career IIRC   3) There's more to being a good/great playmaker than simple assist totals. I doubt anyone would say Russell Westbrook is a better playmaker than Lebron James, despite the fact that the former always averages more APG than the latter. Playmaking prowess needs to factor in hockey assists, the shooting ability of the players around you, the offensive scheme your team is running etc. as well.   Edit: Also, and this isn't a knock against him, but I think he probably benefits from Golden State's pass heavy offensive scheme and the fact that he has two incredible shooters with him as well. Durant is a decent playmaker, but he's not the kind of guy I feel like you could reliably have running the point or anything. "

Wait a minute the basketball media and r/nba told me that Russell Westbrook is a selfish and terrible basketball player and teammate.
Westbrook is way better the those players you mentioned like wtf? Artis Gilmore? Gimme Russell Westbrook anyday.
"My favorite is when Donovan Mitchell ISO'd the OKC Thunder to death, making 1 ridiculous low-percentage shot after ridiculous low-percentage shot.  AND AT THE SAME TIME, everyone criticized Russell Westbrook for going ISO and taking ridiculous low-percentage shots.   It was like in baseball when a pitcher throws a pitch right down the middle and the batter doesn't swing, the announcer goes ""WOW GREAT PITCH"". But if the batter swings and hits a HR, the announcer says ""HE THREW IT RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE, TERRIBLE PITCH!"""
"Russell Westbrook, 2016 Game 5 vs. San Antonio.  35-11-9 to lead OKC to the win on the road, giving the Thunder a 3-2 lead coming back to OKC, where they would finish off the series."
"&gt;Overall, not efficient.  You heard it here folks, 56% true shooting is no longer efficient.   If only he could aspire to be like Paul ""51.6%"" George or Russell ""54.1%"" Westbrook."
I noticed many comments were about old players returning to their prime but what about young players fast forwarding to their prime? See OKC 2011-2012  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Serge Ibaka  Kendrick Perkins  
He also played with the most selfish version of Russell Westbrook in OKC and Orlando ... is orlando lol no need for further explanation on that one
"Individual assists are overrated. If I’ve got a guy getting 10+ assists a night it means he’s got the ball in his hands majority of the time and it makes it easier for the other team to defend because they know he’s the key to the offence working. But if I’ve got 3-4 guys who are averaging 4+ assists, like the Celtics last year, then it makes it harder for the defence to stop the offence because everyone’s creating.   Only 1 player in NBA history has averaged double digit assists in the regular season and the postseason and won a championship. That player was the greatest point guard of all time: Magic Johnson. One player. ONE. Not Steve Nash, not Jason Kidd, not Russell Westbrook, not CP3, John Stockton etc. I understand the post isn’t about averages but I’d just like to point this out. Individual assists are overrated. "
"All those criticisms sound like Russell Westbrook .. who most people have in the top 10.   Embiid imo is at least as valuable as Russ, when you consider his total impact on both ends . So definite top 10 player to me  "
Why did it take him so long to figure out his game? Was the shadow of Russell Westbrook really that long?
"I think if you actually watch the games and see the role rhythm and momentum play, there is actually great value in, for example, Kobe fucking up the ball movement, chucking up a shot, and getting to the free-throw line 2 times in a row.  I mean you can see coaches like Mike Dantoni or players like Russell Westbrook sometimes just saying “fuck it” because they don’t have a chance to stop and think.  It’s like when I’m talking to a hot chick I wish I could just call a time out and think what Stephen Jackson would say in that situation, But also I’m not Stephen Jackson so if I said with Stephen Jackson would say, I would probably get slapped. So again that extra time to think and slow things down would be helpful."
"Also, there is no player on this sub that gets as much fair &amp; legitimate criticism as Russell Westbrook. "
and a russell westbrook led team can't get past the first round unless he has kd carrying him
"you mean to say most valuable player russell westbrook got bounced by harden in the first round, added an all star, then got bounced in the first round again "
"Now that you've admitted you're a troll I can see why this has been so difficult. You were never arguing in good faith.   Even though my reading comprehension is literally better than 999 in 1000 individuals, a text which is intentionally misleading, duplicitous or sarcastic can be difficult to appropriately read. My mistake. I do take solace in knowing that only a deeply flawed person could persist in such an argument and that your own pain is even worse than whatever defeat you are now experiencing in this conversation.   Still- here is the original comment ""Russ doesn't really dunk this year. Not in traffic anyway. He looks as quick and explosive on the floor as he ever has, but he's not doing those freight train traffic dunks anymore... I guess 5 surgeries on one knee will do that... Thanks Patrick Beverly.""  The first sentence says ""Russ doesn't really dunk this year."" Besides the fact this is objectively and ridiculously false, it sends the mind reeling. What reasons could possibly account for one of the most ferocious dunkers of all time no longer dunking? The first reason that would pop into anyone's mind is injury or age- either way the implication is a loss of athleticism. Esp for Russell Westbrook who is known to be a fearless athlete. Why would anyone assume that Russ has all of the sudden taken to self-preservation?    The OP then goes on to say ""he looks as quick and explosive on the floor as he ever has"" which leads to me to ask 'but not in the air?' Is it because this poster is saying he is injured? This would the most likely explanation for any NBA player no longer dunking.  Then the OP goes on to say ""I guess five surgeries will do that to you."" Tell me- what do five surgeries do to you? They reduce athleticism. Do they make you more hesitant to initiate contact? perhaps. But the one thing everyone knows is that multiple knee surgeries are not good for athleticism and explosiveness. Reinforcing that the OP is at least suggesting that RW may have lost something. Finally he thanks Patrick Beverly, evoking a well-known incident in which RW's knee was injured.   The OP goes on to say that his post did not even ""vaguely intimate"" that Russ has lost athleticism- when his suggestion that Russ doesn't dunk this year is already a sign that OP is not particularly careful with his words.  Therefore, with all of this taken together, it is nearly impossible to argue (as OP does) that his comment is not at least suggestive, without further clarification, that he believes Russ has lost explosiveness.   If he wanted to make a statement about Russ having learned to be careful, he would need to say that somewhere in his comment.  Suggesting that RW would ever dial back his aggressive style is a statement with a much higher burden of proof, than the idea that players with multiple knee surgeries lose athleticism.  "
Russell Westbrook has never beaten Robert Williams
"&gt;That's entirely conjecture and confirmation bias.  No, because your stats literally don't concern the point of the strategy. The Thunder use this strategy with the intention of creating fastbreak attempts. Your ORtg stats include the possessions where Russ grabbed a board and the fastbreak was not an option. That's going to skew things. Like I said, we'd have to compare the transition stats, because that's what really matters.  &gt;If you just think about it logically an outlet pass is faster than Westbrook grabbing the rebound and running down the court, so if I wanted to use your argument I'd say that's probably the best course of action and Westbrook grabbing the rebound is meaningless.   If you think about it logically, throwing a ball to Russell Westbrook sprinting at a full stride is not always a safe and easy pass. He can sprint to half-court in the blink of an eye.  &gt;This also doesn't even cover the topic of how often Westbrook ball watches and doesn't follow his assignment so he can get a rebound, which undoubtedly lets up far more points than it creates.   He does that from time to time, but if it were an epidemic we'd have the worst guard defense in the league, because between Russ and Schroeder we're already pretty bad lol."
He was the best player in a series that included Russell Westbrook and Paul George. 
"It's unfortunate, but he really does stat-pad. You can argue the whole ""point guard getting the ball leads to a better fast break"" argument, and that can be valid and it is valid at times for the Thunder. However, there's been numerous times where Westbrook is chasing the triple double. There's plenty of evidence showing this online. Just search ""Russell Westbrook stat-padding"" on youtube. [Here's one that displays it quite well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU23Fz1T7JY).   It sucks because he really doesn't even need to do any of this and he'd still average 25/7/8 or so, just naturally without forcing stats and we'd still praise him just as much, especially if it leads to more wins. If you wanna bring in the whole ""every time Westbrook gets a tripdub, the Thunder have a better chance to win"" argument, well.. that's just silly. What about the games where he barely misses a triple dub and loses? You're saying because he had 9 rebounds that the Thunder lost?  Now when it comes to 3-pointers, he's heavily criticized. I don't mind him shooting it actually. However, I would like it if he wouldn't just jack it up with a hand in his face and/or without even moving the ball around and giving the offense some chance to flow. If you could get an open look with some ball movement or confuse the defense at least a bit, then it'll likely be a higher percentage shot. When it comes down to crunch time though, I don't mind him doing the usual jacking-up that he does, cause he's got a pretty good history of getting it done on the clutch.  He just needs a good dose of the humble pie, work on these negative habits and he can be a top 10 player, but more importantly, his team can gather up some wins."
"Russell Westbrook is that fast and scary with a basketball. Some players get in a groove off a rebound to go score.   Look at Lebron, Derrick Rose, Stephen Curry as well. "
Man Reggie Jackson is insane to me. Dude actually at one time thought he should be starting over Russell Westbrook.

"&gt;For example, DRtg for last season rates Andre Drummond as #1, Hassan Whiteside and Demarcus Cousins both in the top 10, and Russell Westbrook on the same level as Marcus Smart. DWS is even worse.   DRtg is just the rate stat version of DWS. They're equally as bad as each other."
Something I've noticed in the last 2 games is that Russell Westbrook have stopped taking a lot of shots and focused more on assists.
Steph Curry is a better basketball player than Russell Westbrook. 
"I think he had a serious argument in 2010 and again in 2011. In 2010 he averaged 26/4/5/2 on 45/34/75 shooting. His defense was bad, he played 64/82 games, he averaged 3.8 turnovers per game and the Warriors won 26 games that year. I think he deserved the all star nod over Jason Kidd though, the ASG that year was in Dallas so he won the nod because he was a hometown player and Dallas had the 2nd best record in the West that year.   2011 he averaged 24/4/6/2 with again bad defense a lot of turnovers, but his splits were good 45/36/79, and GS won 36 games that year. He played in 80/82 games, unfortunately Deron Williams, Chris Paul and Kobe were all undoubtedly better. I do think he could have made it over Russell Westbrook (21/5/8/2 on 44/33/84) or Manu Ginobili (18/4/5/2 on 43/35/87 shooting), in fact he 100% should have made it over Manu. Manu's 2011 season wasn't even that great tbh. His 05, 08 and 10 were much better.   His two years in Dallas he could have made it, but Dirk got the nods, which I don't think anyone minds. One of the years Dirk averaged 22/6/3 on 50/40/90, the other year Dirk was a PF injury replacement.   &amp;#x200B;"
"Russell Westbrook is not a player you can build a championship team around, so he does not justify a top 3 pick in my opinion   As far as lebron having seasons below 75%, those are fairly insignificant differences. He's right on the cutoff, and I'm not so rigid that I can't accept that.   If you think the cutoff should be lower, though, that's fine. But my larger point that poor free throw shooting should be a disqualifier for a top 3 pick remains. "
"He has as many seasons shooting under 75% as he has shooting 75% or greater, and for his career averages from free throw is below 74%  Edit: How about Russell Westbrook? He went fourth, but shot just 68.5% in college, shooting 55% and 71% in his freshman and sophomore years respectively. "
"The only team that deserves more than two All-Stars would be Toronto. All other teams have a similar record and have played well to open the season. However, there’s still those players who have had stellar seasons with a poor record (Hardaway, LaVine, Booker), so I decided to award them.   P.S. I wish the NBA would expand the roster size smh    EAST G Kyle Lowry G Kyrie Irving F Kawhi Leonard F Giannis Antetokounmpo F Joel Embiid   Andre Drummond, Blake Griffin, Khris Middleton, Victor Oladipo,  Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic,  Kemba Walker  Next: Tim Hardaway Jr., John Wall, Jimmy Butler   WEST G Stephen Curry G Russell Westbrook F Kevin Durant  F LeBron James  F Anthony Davis  Mike Conley, DeMar DeRozan, Paul George, James Harden, Tobias Harris, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard,  Next: Devin Booker, Klay Thompson, Marc Gasol"
Tell that to Russell Westbrook
"""Fuck /r/nba "" - Russell Westbrook"
"I'd like to see a team with Russell Westbrook, Dejounte Murray, Kevin Durant, Tristan Thompson, and Andre Drummond just to see what the rebounding would look like"
"Russell Westbrook is fast. Like, really fast. He's so fast, he makes other fast people look not fast "
Oh right Russell Westbrook is on this team.
"D'angelo Russell will be a (not super) star. Had he been drafted by or traded to a franchise willing to let him grow, he'd be amazing by now.   Chris Paul is the best PG of all time.  Prime Celtics Rajon Rondo is my favorite pg of all time (have to argue my case becausw a laker shouldnt like a celtic).  Boris diaw in 2014 was the most important role player of all time.   Kyle Lowry is better than Kyrie.   Despite him being a better player, i'd rather have an array of ppl over Westbrook to win a playoff series"
Russell Westbrook is a great guy off the court. Stephen Adams is a cool guy.  LeBron is a good basketball player.  The Celtics are still a great team despite their problems.
"Russell Westbrook won on being the first player to be averaging a high-scoring triple double, and also on the Thunder being a deep lottery team without him that year, and also on ""if we don't give it to Westbrook we have to give it to fucking Harden and everyone hates watching Harden play""."
"Yeah to me here would be the general run down of all the top candidates   And if I personally had to rank it: 1) Embiid 2) Giannis 3) Jrue Holiday 4) Gasol 55) Paul George   1) Marc Gasol   a) Per cleaning the glass opponents take shots at the rim with 6.6% lower freq when he's on the court than off. That on/off differential is 98th percentile   b) His actual stats [protecting the rim are pretty average](https://on.nba.com/2ReJo7j)  c) His man to man defense has been real good. [here is his matchup data](https://on.nba.com/2Rbcdl0) the following are some good offensive oriented bigs he's faced this year: DeAndre Ayton, KAT, Embiid, Brook Lopez, Jokic, LaMarcus Aldridge. Note only Ayton really had significant success vs him. He held ALL of KAT, Lopez, Embiid, Jokic, LMA to WELL below their normal average effectiveness. V impressive   d) Eye test wise I still don't think he's particularly great on the perimeter and someone you really want switching. THey scheme around his limitations on that end very very well in Memp   2) Giannis   a) Per Cleaning the Glass opponents actually shoot more at the rim when he's on the court. Team also defends worse in transition when he's on the court which is surprising   b) He doesn't contest shots at the rim a ton but so far when he has [hes been very effective at it](https://on.nba.com/2R8kkyt)  c) All kinds of versatility can guard any position. Matchup data shows he hasn't had to face the most challenging matchups but [nobody has given him problems](https://on.nba.com/2RaEXtZ). Amongst his harder matchups:   Aaron Gordon 26 poss 4 pts allowed 2/6 shooting. Ben Simmons 65 poss 9 pts 4/12 shooting allowed. Paul Millsap 75 poss 12 pts 4/13 shooting allowed. Gallinari: 43 poss 6 pts 2/7 shooting allowed. Tobias Harris 17 poss 0 pts 0/4 shooting allowed.   d) Eye test shows improved off ball recog and awareness in rotations   3) Joel Embiid   a) Double whammy: Statistically [has top stats protecting the rim](https://on.nba.com/2R8kkyt). And on top of that Cleaning the Glass shows opponents take shots at the rim with 7.8% less freq when he's on the court vs off(that differential is &gt;99th percentile). Super impressive   b) Matchup data [shows him having some issues defending Nikola Vucevic JV and Brook Lopez](https://on.nba.com/2ReLCnb). However his defense on Blake Griifn, Marc Gasol, Anthony Davis and Andre Drummond have all been good.   c) Eye test wise Im of the belief he's considerably better on switches than his reputation. He has issues being over aggressive on the perimeter at times for sure but he's improving here.   4) Paul George   a) No true 3 [contests more shots at the rim](https://on.nba.com/2R7RCOf). And while Steven Adams is a big part of this per cleaning the glass opponents shoot at the rim 7.6% less freq when he's on the court vs off a top figure. He also is 82nd percentile in terms of on/off differential in terms of how his team defends in transition with him on the court vs off.   b) Awesome off the ball defender really stood out all year eye test wise  c) Very versatile [anybody from Jrue Holdiay to Nikola Mirotic he can be a primary defender on](https://on.nba.com/2RfqRYw). Matchup data shows him absolutely destroying Jayson Tatum and Tobias Harris while doing a good job on Luka Doncic and James Harden. Only guys to give him some real issues were Tim Hardaway and Buddy Hield(Jrue Holiday to a lesser extent)   5) Jrue Holiday : I know a guard will never win DPOY but he's just been too impressive for me not to mention   a) Per Cleaning the Glass his on/off differential in terms of how the Pelicans defend in transition and off misses is top 10 percentile   b) No player has [more impressive matchup data](https://on.nba.com/2PPYqDG).   i) EVERY player he has spent at least 25 poss guarding this year scores at a rate below their average   ii) Only two guys to give him any kind of fits are Gary Harris and tim Hardaway   Note how many guys he's held to at least one of: a) &gt;10 pts below their expected pt total given the total no poss of poss b) &lt;35% shooting    DeMar DeRozan, Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, James Harden, Jimmy Butler, Caris LeVert, Jamal Murray, Paul George, Zach LaVine, Lou Williams, Tobias Harris, Russell Westbrook, Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, CJ McCollum   That's absolute insanity  "
TIL being worse than Boogie Cousins and better than Russell Westbrook is bad.
"Due to the wholesomeness of this post I will /s this copypasta.    k listen up you little shit  I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns. This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES  "

"The logic is that if you started him, your bench would be very weak and the starting lineup already had elite scorers in Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. "
I bet Russell Westbrook has a gun tattoo on his leg and is from the council estates
Russell Westbrook is a one of a kind dominant player. He deserved that MVP over Harden. 
"See, Russell Westbrook has such a good heart!"
"Yeah he a point guard, not pass guard  -Russell Westbrook"
"I'm sorry son but if you don't think 21 out of 30 constitutes the vast majority then you are delusional.  &gt; Russell Westbrook, Collin Sexton  We've already went over why these guys shouldn't count.  &gt; George Hill  * averages 1.2 3PM * averaged at least 1.3 3PM in each of the past 7 seasons  &gt; Rondo  Is not the starting PG"

Russell Westbrook, Jeff Teague, Darren Collison, Emmanuel Mudiay, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, George Hill or Collin Sexton, Ben Simmons, Rajon Rondo, and Elfrid Payton. That's **9 PGs** right there. So no I don't think that constitues the vast majority. "
Russell Westbrook out for season with torn Labrum after attempting to throw shoes into the upper deck in the name of parity.
BREAKING: Russell Westbrook suspended for 17 games for attacking a fan with his shoes 
"I don't think people were underrating Schroder, but were more just wondering why you would take on a ball dominant starter quality point guard, along with his starter quality contract, to play backup to Russell Westbrook.  It's worked out well for them though, when Westbrook missed games due to injury, they had Schroder to pick up the slack. That last game against Golden State was a really good sign too, when Westbrook and Schroder were both playing but WB was struggling, he deferred to Schroder and Dennis went off for 32 points in 28 minutes."
HOT TAKE: Russell Westbrook wanted to get rid of his sneakers and he threw them toward what he perceived to be the nearest garbage can. 
INCOMING HOT TAKE: RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS A NICE PERSON.
I heard he was like a massive Russell Westbrook that was always stat-padding. That’s why he didnt win many championships.   But he was a indeed a very dominant bigman. 
"ok, but Ibaka's got a damn good list of ex-teammates. Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Steven Adams, Enes Kanter, Aaron Gordon. An extremely likable dude like Ibaka can probably get at least one of those guys to come."

"Wade was battling knee issues in the 2013 Finals that limited his production, Bosh didn’t score a single point in an elimination game and Bron still beat the Spurs. We saw what Harden looks like against the Spurs.   Harden played with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, and has never had less support around him than Bron did last year or in the entirety of his first career in Cleveland.  Hardens team literally won in spite of him against the Clippers in game 6. Imagine the Cavs benching Bron in a 4th quarter and winning without him in the playoffs "
1. LeBron 2. Curry 3. Kawhi 4. KD 5. Giannis 6. Harden 7. AD 8. Embiid 9. Russell Westbrook  IMO anywhere in the 6-9 range is acceptable right now. If he can improve his 3-point shooting a bit and continue to decrease his turnovers while playing All-NBA caliber defense he can move into the top 5.  &amp;#x200B;
"Do a count.  Curry, harden, Kemba, lillard, kyrie, westbrook, bledsoe, lowry, wall, rose, conley, cp3, holiday, simmons, russell, fox, schroder, morris, murray, payton, teague, dragic, collison, lavine, rubio, evans, are all 100% better than him, and players like young, evans, dinwiddie, jackson, and ball are all probably better than him, but I’d love to hear which of these players Lin is better than."

Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder has been fined $25K for throwing his shoes into the stands.
It’s a Russell Westbrook day miracle
"KD leaving put Westbrook and the entire ""Thunder culture"" on blast. The team proceeded to rebrand itself, build around him, sign a fringe superstar (OKC couldn't even get a FA meeting for the first 10 years), and basically erase the ""no one likes play with Russell"" narrative. All while KD is arguing with 12 year olds on Instagram and hated by a fanbase and team that he made invincible.  Russ is on that Dirk journey. A single championship for Russ will count way more than pretty much anything KD does for the rest of his career."
At best I’m hoping for a Russell Westbrook situation
Remember when a significant portion of this sub said they'd take Brad Stevens over Russell Westbrook?
"&gt; Mario was just bigger Wayne   Ooof!  That's like saying Russell Westbrook is just a bigger Steve Nash.  Both amazing athletes, but very, very different approaches to the sport."
"John Wall stan right here. He DID come into this season out of shape, no matter how you want to spin it.   He’s not a team player, I used to be disillusioned by assists too. He dribbles the clock out and gives it up at the last second. He’s like Russell Westbrook, just less talented  Also, I’m not saying he’s better by any means, but if I were building a championship contender I’d take Otto Porter Jr. over Wall 10 times outta 10"
"In a playoff series, I need the inconsistent guy on my team. A prime example of that is these past playoffs. Giannis was content getting his 25 PPG on good efficiency this past playoffs but it wasn't enough. He needed a game where he just forces the issue and even if he fails, gives his team a chance to win. Meanwhile a guy like Russell Westbrook, probably would've willed the Bucks to a win over the Celtics. Dude is not afraid to fail. He may very well shoot his team out the series but I know for sure he would have at least a few 40+ point games to win his team those games. "
"* Still Cavs. I mean the Cavs didn't really do many things right except draft Kyrie between 11-14 and still got LeBron to come back. And he hated Gilbert..  * No  * Toss up. Dame is better but I trust Scott Brooks way less.  * Top 5 PG. Probably seen as a Russell Westbrook kind of level player but with probably slightly lower stats. And I would freaking love to see prime Rose again.  * Worse for 2 of them. Melo is self explanatory. Smith might provide some shooting but is mehh otherwise. Ok depth though. Wall's contract will mess up their FA plans and only provide a decent short term boost. And will interfere with Lonzo's development.  * Don't think so.  * No. But I'd give them a very strong fighting chance against the Warriors cause that means Dame is on some crazy MVP level.  * Kawhi, if he stays. But that's mostly because I think he's entering his prime and Giannis has some more room to improve."

"I agree with all the sentiments about Kemba, that dude is a fucking beast, but i think your point about it being hard to put up good numbers without other talent around you is completely wrong. It is most certainly is easier to put up big numbers without anyone else around because it allows everything to funnel through that one person. Look at guys like Chris Bosh, Kevin Love in Minny, Devin Booker, even Russell Westbrook to an extent. I think at this point Kemba has proved he's more than that but that point really irked me."
The worst team he's had has had.... Russell westbrook lmao.

A team that also had Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Not to mention Finals vets like Derek Fisher and Kendrick Perkins. He had a great squad around him. 
Foreal perfect timing with these bad teams and Russell Westbrook out too guess they lucked out 
"Probably not. But most players who sign that contract don't live up to that sort of contract because he's being paid similarly to an all-time great like LeBron. For example, I doubt Russell Westbrook lives up to his contract."
Monta had that Russell Westbrook energy. Fun to watch. 
"Snyder &amp; Westbrook.  Move over, Smith &amp; Wesson.  &gt; Uh uh. I know what you're thinking. ""Did he fire 44 shots or only 43?"" Well to tell you the truth in all this excitement I kinda lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Russell, the most powerful Westbrook in the world and would blow your lead clean off, you've gotta ask yourself one question: ""Do I feel lucky?""

I've seen a few comments asking this question. Can you guys really not tell that is Russell Westbrook? Lol it's clearly 100% him.
"I didn't think Russell Westbrook nor Harden would EVER be MVPs in their second season either.  We can't really view a lot of these young players as finished products yet as they're about 3 years away from their prime.  I will say Simmons hasn't improved much from his rookie year in my opinion and if he hit his peak early then he probably won't be winning any MVPs, but if he continues to progress and grow in a similar fashion to Westbrook/Harden then I think he absolutely could win an MVP."
Because I still think Russell Westbrook is just a little bit better than Kyrie
Russell Westbrook is an amazing player and anyone would be lucky to have him.   
"Demar derozan for the footwork and midrange game  Russell Westbrook for being relentless, fearless, and ferocious  Kobe was also an insanely creative finisher, so the kyrie comp isn't without merit. But kyrie is definitely his own beast when it comes to ball handling. He's also nowhere near kobe in terms of explosive athleticism  Derozans midrange game + kyries finishing ability and clutch shotmaking + Westbrook athleticism and temperament = kobe Bryant  Edit: caught a lot of flack for comparing Westbrook and kobe's athleticism. My point was more about aesthetics and style of offense, that Westbrook blows by guys and murders the rim, and shoots without fear even though he's not really a graat shooter. Similarly kobe got a lot of his points by using his athleticism to Dunk it all over the opposition. Even the 2012 version of kobe would ruthlessly slam game-winning dunks over the defense, and then stare then down and intimidate them as being unstoppable "

"Egad, so that's what Russell Westbrook would look like if he had no idea how to pass or rebound. "
"Also Lebron doesn’t play much defense anymore which is why he can never be better than Jordan. Oh, and did you know that James Harden doesn’t play defense either? Or Russell Westbrook for that matter."
&gt;Russell Westbrook (assuming he gets healthy)    so Westbrook is probable to be a lock?

KD is such a bitch. Lost all respect for that clown these last couple years. When you make Russell Westbrook look like he's not the asshole you know you fucked up.
"You’re really overrating Bron’s performance in that series. It’s not even in his top 3 Finals. Dude shot like trash and chucked shots til he got his numbers.   I know why he shot so much, but he basically played like a giant Allen Iverson.  His shooting splits made Russell Westbrook look like Steve Nash. "
"It will NOT be closer than people think assuming they both play the same number of years moving forward. Russell Westbrook has 600ish more turnovers than Harden.  Since Harden’s trade to Houston, he and Westbrook have averaged 4.4 TO/game. Last year, Westbrook averaged 0.4 more TO/game with Harden averaging 0.4 more TO/game the year prior. This year, Harden’s 5.3 TO/game is far worse than Westbrook’s 4.1 TO/game but that’s just a small sample size.  They average very similar TO/game. Harden isn’t going to surpass Westbrook unless this year’s numbers end up being what they have forever moving forward (5.3 TO/game versus 4.1 TO/game) and even then, it would take 500 games of Harden averaging 1.2 more TO/game than Westbrook for that takeover to happen. That’s 6-7 more seasons of basketball."
"It’s hard to think 25 players better than Westbrook all time.  Just off the top of my head   Lebron, MJ, Russell, Wilt, Bird, Magic, Kareem, Shaq, Duncan, Hakeem, West, Baylor, Stockton, both Malones, Pippen, Barkley, Steph, KG, KD, Dirk, Kidd, CP3, Kobe, Nash.    That’s 25 and I’m probably missing a couple of obvious guys but already it’s difficult to think of guys better than Westbrook.    Maybe guys like Cowens and Unsled but it’s not very obvious that they’re better. "
Nuggets fans typically dislike Westbrook.  They come by it honestly though:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2017/4/9/15238908/russell-westbrook-game-winner-thunder-vs-nuggets

He was so good a franchise he didn’t even play for retired his jersey. Look at all that. Can you name someone else in NBA history who did that? Russell has the rings but not the MVP’s nor scoring titles. KAJ has the MVP’s but not the rings nor scoring titles to match, neither does Magic, neither does Bird, neither does Bron. No one in NBA history can match the team success and the individual success of MJ.   Also none of Karl Malone, John Stockton, Gary Payton, Charles Barkley, Shawn Kemp, Tim Hardaway, Patrick Ewing and Reggie Miller have rings because of MJ’s dominance. Who did Bron stop from getting a ring? Westbrook, Harden, Rose and PG? No offence to those guys but MJ’s list is more impressive. "

"Westbrook had a significantly higher eFG% and TS% than Iverson did during his MVP season.  And really, how is a triple-double arbitrary?   Is averaging 10 assists a lot? Sure is. Usually at or near the top of the league in any given season.  Is averaging 10 rebounds a lot? Sure is, even for a big, let alone a point guard.   Did Russell Westbrook average both, all while leading the league in scoring? Yes.  Oh, and Westbrook played 10 more games than Iverson did during his MVP year."

The Russell Westbrook strategy
"I get that the title of the thread is about Lebron and Durant, but this side discussion didn't really concern Durant until you brought him up yourself independently.  It was really about Wade and Bosh having sacrificed more than Lebron, which is undeniably true.    I will concede that Lebron gave Kyrie more scoring responsibility by their final season together, but   1) Lebron was still by far the #1 option in their first 2 years   2) Lebron was and always is the main option on offense, not just in scoring, but in every facet of the offense which is usually the Lebron PnR and kick out to a shooter.  Since I did entertain your earlier Durant mention, I will go your route and use USG as a proxy for who the #1 option is, even though I think it's too simplistic and lazy when USG numbers are both within a point or two of one another.  You know that Russell Westbrook had a higher USG than Durant in seasons 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016?  You know how insane that is?  Furthermore, comparing FGA between Durant/Westbrook to Lebron/Kyrie is just not a rigorous comparison, because Westbrook != Kyrie.  Who's to say that Westbrook isn't a bigger drain on his teammate's FGA than Kyrie?  And even if they were, it's also a poor assumption that Durant and Bron's scoring would be affected in the same way, since they're very different players with very different styles.  But really, the eye test is the best way to judge these things.  Westbrook dominating the ball and chucking bad shots even with one of the greatest scorers next to him was something that NBA observers had complained about for years and years.  Funny what a single postseason run and an unpopular free agency decision does to make everyone forget that."
"Eh he's 6th on the KIA MVP ladder rn - who gaf what r/nba thinks, really?  This is not the place to get definitive opinions on Russell Westbrook.  He's playing great, his team is winning, he could absolutely make it to 1st team All-NBA by the end of the season."

"kidd and rondo's bigs would give them the outlet pass, but being an okc fan you're clearly not used to that. that's just how the game was played, because not every point guard is russell westbrook running at 200mp/h down the court.  i'm not sure you realise this, but people were arguing russ' mvp *because of the triple double*. that's why it is not arbitrary, nor unfair to provide evidence that this triple double does NOT constitute evidence that he deserves MVP. that's all it is and you are ignorant.

"Actually the present system keeps the fans from affecting the game already. OP is wringing his hands over nothing.   Every single all star starter last year was top-3 in media votes. You can vote for Zaza and Dwayne wade till your fingers turn blue it won't get them into the all star game.   That's not a coincidence, if you do the math, the circumstances required for the fan vote to actually affect the final roster are extreme. Fans may be able to bump Steph Curry into a starting slot over Russell Westbrook, but all three of them were guaranteed to make the team anyway based on the coaches ballot. "
"Warriors have the best record in the league, the Cavs have the 6th best record and are falling.  Edit: I can tell people are salty cause I'm literally getting downvoted for saying record matters.  That's ridiculous.  63% of all-MVPs went to a player on a first-seeded team.  You want to know the last time the MVP went to a player on a 3rd seed?  1988.  Do you know what it took to make that happen?  Michael Jordan had to score 35 ppg while winning DPOY.  If Lebron wants to win MVP, he needs to take his team to atleast the 2nd seed, or hope he can pull an all-time great narrative out of nowhere like Russell Westbrook did."

"Much better shooters? Irving's a better shooter than Dame. Butler is barely better than Russell. George is a better 3 point shooter than DeRozan. Porzingis is a better 3 point shooter than Jokic. Gobert can't even shoot lmao.   The defence is not on a different level. Irving's slightly better than Dame. Butler and George are much better than their matchups but Porzingis destroys Jokic on D and Embiid vs Gobert is very close. I may have been wrong to say it was about even, but it's not like North-West is way better on D.   Better playmakers is a stretch too. Irving averages 5 a game to Dame's 6 but the everyone knows the Celtics' offence runs through Horford. Kyrie averages 32 mpg to Dame's 37. Russell averages almost 1 assist more per game than Butler and plays 10 minutes less than him. 10. I understand that Teague is the main distributor but does that really make up for 10 less minutes played? I don't think it does. Plus the Wolves are much better offensive team than the Nets. I can't imagine it's easy to get dimes running that Nets' offence. DeRozan averages 2 more than George in 2 less minutes. Yes George has Westbrook to defer to but DeRozan has Lowry to defer to as well. Jokic is better than Embiid at playmaking, but the difference is 1 assist. Porzingis and Gobert are equally irrelevant at distributing the ball.   Seems pretty close to me on all accounts!"

"So he now leads the history of the team with 21, and Russell Westbrook had how many just last year? Not saying one is better than the other, just a crazy stat that for career triple doubles, 21 is a record for an entire teams history and for another team its not even the record for a season"
"Basketball is the worst sport for feigning, flopping and simulation. It's not angrily condemned by vets.  The amount of praise Russell Westbrook received last season was gross.

I mean, I wanted to play basketball, but my parents would always say, 'Without school, you'll be stuck.' So I started paying more attention to school, and I played basketball along with it.

I don't think Russell Westbrook will ever win a title. He is good but the way he plays isn't good for any team wanting to be a championship team.
"One, seeing as he's fucking Russell Westbrook, his extra-cirricular resume probably shits on yours. Being the captain of a sports team is huge to a lot of schools.   Two, not every school grades on the scale yours does apparently. I went to the top public school in my state and it graded strictly on a 4.0 scale. There were some good teachers that basically never gave As. Only three students managed a 4.0 GPA through HS from my class and they went to Princeton, Northwestern, and Air Force Academy respectively. A 4.7 GPA sounds comically high to some people."
Russell Westbrook got an academic scholarship to Stanford but not an athletic one  Also he was DPOY in his conference one year lol
"KD probably shouldn't be DPOY.  That said, this article is awful. This dudes gives us DRPM, DRting, and *one* clip and uses those as the reasons why KD shouldn't be DPOY? Notable god tier defenders like Russell Westbrook and Nikola Jokic are among DRPM leaders. David West is 2nd on the year behind only Aron Baynes. DRtg is completely useless on an individual level, and at its absolute best is only a general indicator of defensive performance of a team while someone is on the floor. Shame on whoever wrote this.  Edit: DPOY, not MVP"

"Sometime in the last 10 minutes is Enes Kanter trying to hide Russell Westbrook behind him after Westbrook hit the ref in the head with the ball.  That play never fails to crack me up. Enes, without hesitating, steps in front of Westbrook and puts his arms out to try to hide him."
"Is Russell Westbrook or James Harden the best player in the league?  There's more to it than that.  Kobe was awesome, and was a top-5 player for almost his whole career.  But he didn't have the kind of peak that a guy like Jordan, LeBron, Bird, or Magic did."

"Agreed but how can he determine that from just this tweet?  Gobert, Anderson and Green are above average defenders (2 of them are consistent DPOY candidates if healthy).   Russell Westbrook has improved defensively.   Gasol, idk. "
"He needs to refocus himself. He seems to think he's a Dwyane Wade/Russell Westbrook type slasher (in fact he actually trained with those 2 last summer) but in reality, his potential probably lies in being a great defender and decent shooter from the corners. "

"James Harden and Russell Westbrook: Great offence players and terrible defenders. Both MVP candidates last year   Andre Roberson and Marcus Smart: Terrible offensive players but amazing defenders that do all the dirty work. Don't get talked about much  Kawhi Leonard and Paul George: Amazing 2 way players who can do everything on the court. Super stars, yet only borderline MVP type players.   With this information you can tell that offensive players &gt; defensive players. But a preferable player would be balanced "
Russell Westbrook didn't get a single free throw?

"I love it.  Guy just exudes confidence, what a bad ass quote. Sure, they probably don't stand much of a chance at getting a Championship right now, but don't tell Russell Westbrook that. I'd rather have a player on my team that genuinely believes in the team assembled around him, rather than being half hearted about shit.   Stay you, Russ. "
"&gt;	The current players who draw perhaps the most frequent comparisons to Kobe, Thunder guard Russell Westbrook and Raptors swingman DeMar DeRozan (both of whom are from the L.A. area and played there collegiately), each count Bryant as a mentor of sorts and possess a handful of the same skills and flaws that he had.  &gt;	In Westbrook’s case, he’s so talented that he sometimes can dominate the ball too much — even when he has another superstar, or two, on the court with him."

That's a big discrepancy considering even Russell Westbrook, with a 41.7 Usage Percentage and 2nd in FTA that year, had 10.4 FTA per game putting him at  Russel - 10.4TA / 41.7USG% = 24.9%  Harden gets calls more often no matter the Usage rate because he exploits the rules far more often than anyone else. He has no business shooting from the line as often as he does."
"Well then can't you just divide their FTA per game by their usage rates from last year and see who gets to the free throw line more often?

"Stat padding is no where near as annoying to fans as harden slowing the game down for his oh so ""efficient"" free throws and KD joining a 73 win team he choked to.  Russell Westbrook haters were emboldened by the thunders bad start and James harden's great start. At the end of the day, people just like Westbrook more than harden and that probably won't change."
It might be frustrating sometimes but he him and Russell Westbrook had the same free throw average per game last year. It's overblown. You would think he is only good because of that with the way r/nba bastardizes him.  
"The year is 2036.  Advances in medical technology have prolonged Darth Durantder's career beyond expectations, and the Warriors have won the past 18 finals.  Noah Russell Westbrook leads a fledgling Seattle squad (the 46th NBA franchise team, alongside the Shangai Sharks and the Pyongyang Pirates) beyond expectation in his first season in the league.  However, Emperor Steve Kerr, after Noah's refusal to sign on as a free agent in the summer, decides there is no place in the league for the young brodie.    EMPEROR STEVE KERR Now, young Westbrook...you will die.  Although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts  from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound  screaming through the room. Noah's body writhes in pain.  Darth Durantder grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed  figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm.   The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now  lifted high, away from Noah. Now the white lightning arcs back to  strike at Durantder. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his  helmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high  over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of  the throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength,  Darth Durantder hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.  The Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls  into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it  explodes, creating a rush of air through the room. Durantder's cape is  whipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the  bottomless hole. Noah crawls to his father's side and pulls him away  from the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young point guard and the giant forward are too weak to move.  Durantder (a whisper) Noah, help me take this mask off.  Noah But you'll die.  Durantder Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my  own eyes.  Slowly, hesitantly, Noah removes the mask from his (god)father's face. There beneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus. But the dying man smiles at the sight before him.  KEVIN	 (very weak) Now...go, my (nephew?)son. Leave me.  NOAH No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save  you.  KEVIN You already have, Noah. You were right about me. Tell Sam Presti...you  were right.  NOAH Father...I won't leave you.  Darth Durantder, Kevin Durant...Noah's (not real) father, dies.  A huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Noah rises and, half  carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a  shuttle.  A star shines across the sky above Oklahoma City.  It catches the glow of a young r/NBAer momentarily, before a wiggle across his foot catches his attention.  A Ball Kevthon.    And for once, the r/NBAer smiles.  For once... the snake is loved.  "
We lynch him and the name “Russell Westbrook” is banned forever from this sub
"Or, it implies that the team itself has bought into a ""any Thunder player getting the rebound is better than the other team getting it"" school of thought that is quite literally the entire foundation for ""boxing out.""  Watch a Thunder game in its entirety and I can virtually guarantee you that you'll witness Russell Westbrook grab at least one board over multiple guys 5+ inches taller than him out of pure determination and athleticism. His rebounding is elite for a PG, whether or not his team's philosophy gives him some easy ones that allow them to get the fast break started quicker without needing an elite outlet passer for a center.

"Honestly, it's sacrilegious to say it but Russell with Steph's shooting would be a far better player than Jordan, and far better than basically any player in history.  The biggest knock on Westbrook is his efficiency. You're basically having him chuck like he does now....except they actually go in all the time now....  I can't even imagine a Westbrook with unlimited range and insane efficiency. He'd be able to bulldoze you and posterise you, he'd be able to launch 30 foot off the dribble step-backs, he'd be able to finish in the rim in all sorts of creative ways, he'd be able to assist and rebound all across the pitch. It wouldn't even be fair  "

"That Lebron is better than Westbrook Almost everything Lebron can do, Westbrook can do better. Disclaimer:This comment is not meant to “flamebait” or be insulting towards other fans, but merely to point out the flaws in the common misconception that Lebron is the best player in the league. If you disagree, leave a reply explaining why. Note that all stats are accurate and sourced from basketball-reference.com ............ Scoring: Westbrook In the 2017 NBA playoffs, Russell Westbrook scored 37.4 points per game, the most since 1988 when Hakeem Olajuwon scores 37.5. On the other hand, Lebron scored 32.8. Critics will point out Westbrook’s field goal percentage. In last season’s playoffs, Westbrook shot an effective field goal percentage of 43.1% and LeBron shot 62.2%. However, Lebron had two allstar teammates and a whole host of shooters to take pressure off of him. Westbrook’s best player was who, Victor Oladpio? When LeBron was put in the same situation in the 2015 finals when Kyrie and Kevin Love went down, he scored less than Westbrook, 35.8 ppg, but what was his eFG? 43.1%, the same as Westbrook’s. Yet Westbrook not only held that similar stat line for the entire first round against Houston, he held an arguably better line for the entire regular season (81 games for WB) at 47.6 eFG% and the scoring title of 31.6ppg. Assisting: Westbrook In the 2017 playoffs, Westbrook averaged a playoffs-high 10.8 apg while Lebron only averaged 7.8 apg. Furthermore, Lebron averaged 4 turnovers per game while Westbrook averaged 6. Break that down, Lebron averaged 1.95 assists per turnover and Westbrook averaged 1.8, but had 4 more assists per game AND had a bum roster while Lebron, again, had two all stars and a great supporting cast. Not to mention, in the regular season, Westbrook averaged 10.4 apg and 5.4 turnovers (1.93 apt) while Lebron averaged 8.7 and 4.1 (only around 0.19 fewer turnovers per assist, but 1.7 fewer assists with a stacked roster. Imagine what Westbrook will do with Paul George and Carmelo Anthony. Probably 13+ apg. Rebounding: Westbrook Last season, Westbrook averaged 10.7 rpg and Lebron 8.6, so around 2 fewer. Westbrook contested the least shots of anyone who played over 30 mpg, but he was still great on defense, which I’ll get to later. In the post season last year, he averaged 11.6 rpg to Lebron’s 9.1. But Westbrook grabbed 1.8 offensive rebounds compared to Lebron’s 1.1. You can’t statpad offensive rebounds NOR statpad in the playoffs, which Westbrook didnt, or did only in the last minutes before he was yanked in blowouts. Steals: Tossup, favors Westbrook Lebron averaged 1.2 spg in the regular season to Westbrook’s 1.6, but in the playoffs Lebron averaged 1.9 to Wesbtrook’s 2.4, but held that 1.9 for 12 more games than WB’s 2.4. Caveat is, like all these stats, that Westbrook would be more tired from carrying his team than Lebron, so he may not have had the energy to attempt more steals. Blocks: Lebron 0.6 blocks in regular season and 1.3 in the post compared to Westbrook’s 0.4 and 0.6. This one goes to Lebron. Defense: Westbrook, and it’s not close People don’t understand how good Westbrook is on defense. He had a defensive rating of 103.8, or 13th in the NBA right behind Danny Green, who is hailed as a great defender. Lebron is no where to be seen on the top 20. Yet people say that Lebron really turns it up in the playoffs. Okay, in the playoffs, Lebron had a defensive box plus minus of 4.2, while Russell Westbrook had a DBPM of 5.2. If you take anything away from this post it should be this: In the playoffs, Russell Westbrook was statistically better on defense than Tim Duncan during ANY season, and definitely better than Lebron. The highest DBPM Tim Duncan had was 5.1 and Lebron 3.6. And in the regular season, he posted a DBPM of 4.7, worse than only 3 seasons from Tim Duncan, one of the best defenders of all time. ................ So, would you rather have someone better at scoring, assisting, rebounding, steals, and defense, or someone better at blocks? You tell me."

"""Basketball fans like to scour the Web for highlights of stars we already know. The pleasure of rewatching their most acrobatic feats is like the satisfaction of rereading passages from a favorite book. But, to me—and, presumably, to the half a million people who routinely watch each of his videos—LeBron James, Jr., offers something different. It’s not only that his story is unfinished, or even just beginning, but that it seems to have two authors at once, each with a legacy to define. There’s the boy himself, thirteen and already in possession of immense talents, and there’s his father, perhaps the greatest basketball player of all time, who, at thirty-three, continues to play like he’s in his prime. Other sons of basketball stars have made the N.B.A., and a couple of them—Steph Curry, son of Dell; Kobe Bryant, son of Joe—have become superstars. But no one has so openly wrestled with his status as a hoops legend like LeBron James has. It was inevitable, when his son started playing, that the younger James would figure into the larger narrative. Watching him feels like the start of the next chapter.  Sports journalists and college scouts have been touting Jr. as his father’s son since before he reached middle school. Highlight reels circulated online with clips of a boy of average height, spindly but confident, heaving up a shot with two hands, or dunking on a mini-hoop in a suburban driveway. Glimpses like these were enough to prompt one newspaper headline to hail him, at twelve, as “a basketball clone of his dad.” Duke and Kentucky reportedly expressed interest in his future prospects. LeBron, Sr., sought to cool the hype at first, as any sensible father would. “Right now, all I care about is him having fun,” he said a few years ago. “He doesn’t need added pressure from his dad . . . . I’ll teach him when he gets old enough. I’ll wait till he gets thirteen, fourteen.” At that point, James said, he would share with his son what he called “the blueprint.”  Now that Jr. is old enough to access the master plan, the highlight videos are multiplying. The clips reveal a versatile guard, big for his age in both size and bearing, with an impressive handle and a smooth jumper. The echoes of his father’s game are hard to miss. LeBron, Jr., slashes to the basket, springing past defenders with crafty spins and beguiling hesitation moves. He shares the ball like his dad, with one-handed bounce passes whipped from great distances, crisp dishes, and creative finds in traffic. “He’s already a better passer than I was,” James has said.  If it’s odd to lavish so much attention on such a young kid, it’s also irresistible. When LeBron James was fourteen, he joined a local travel team and played at a tournament, in Orlando, that marked the start of his national ascension. “LeBron really separated himself,” his then-coach said, in the documentary “More Than a Game.” “You could see that he was the best player there.” By the time he was a junior in high school, he’d led his team to two state championships, and he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated. His high-school outings were relocated to a nearby college gym to accommodate the crowds, and ESPN broadcasted the games with a full assembly of analysts—from Bill Walton to Dick Vitale—like they were college showdowns between top-tier teams. “He’s the best high-school basketball player I’ve ever seen,” Jay Bilas said, courtside, at one game. LeBron’s precocity aged him in some ways, both flattering and otherwise; he entered the league as a mature player, then, before our eyes, graduated to superstardom undiminished by the fact that everyone saw it coming.  Are we watching his son too expectantly? Maybe, but a highlight reel from the John Lucas All-Star Weekend, posted this month, suggests not. It’s easy to forget, while watching the player here, that he’s only thirteen. His command on the floor is expressed with an air of total nonchalance—enough to make his father seem like a late bloomer. The same goes for a February video, shot at his school, where he’s seen laying the ball in with grown-up English and tossing shovel passes from half-court. The competition isn’t as stiff as in the other videos, where he plays with his travel team, but he hardly seems to break a sweat.  If he were older, his future might have begun to take some discernible shape, or at least to assume a more tangible trajectory. Zaire Wade, whose father is the former LeBron teammate Dwyane Wade, is a sophomore in high school, and is looking like a serious player; Shareef O’Neal, son of Shaq, will play for U.C.L.A. next season. Their playing careers are becoming their own; reality will soon temper our expectations, or vindicate them. LeBron, Jr., is young enough for his future to look limitless. And with his father still dominating, after fifteen years in the pros, an absence of limits seems like part of the family inheritance.  My favorite question to ponder, as I watch Jr. carve up helpless young defenders, is whether his father is sharing with him some singular fount of basketball wisdom. The James genes are clearly the key part of the “blueprint,” but there’s a deeper code that father and son may have to unlock together. To become a great player is hard enough, but for a son to do it on his own terms, undimmed by the legacy of his dad, is something else again. Maybe that explains the travel-team jersey number of the younger James: zero, worn in honor of Russell Westbrook, one of his father’s rivals."""
"What I've got so far  **WEST**  Rockets - Westbrook winning MVP over Harden  Warriors - KD snek  Blazers - Ray Felton was a cancer his one season in Portland, lead a mutiny against the coach (Nate McMillan at the time) and was generally overweight and underperforming.  Spurs - broken Kawhibot  TWolves - KG winning a championship w/ the Celtics  Thunder - Young Big 3 before they split up  Jazz - MJ pushing off on Byron Russell for his final championship in 1998; Jazz have yet to make it back since  Pels - looks like KAT but not sure what the relevance is  Clippers - basically calling them the LA Sparks  (LA's WNBA franchise) or implying that the Sparks are bigger in LA than they are  Nuggets - young Melo w/ dreads  Lakers - Stern's 'basketball reasons', the justification given for vetoing a done-deal trade for CP3 to the Lakers in 2011 offseason following a lockout  Kings - no idea  Mavs - Deandre in a Mavs jersey; he nearly signed with them in the 2015 offseason as a FA before his Clippers teammates barricaded him in his own house and cut off all contact with Cuban/Mavs front office  Grizzlies - sad Marc Gasol, probably from this season lol  Suns - Robert Horry hip checking Nash into the scorer's table during a pivotal playoff game, causing a bunch of Suns' players (most importantly Amare) to leave their bench and get suspended for the next game, likely costing the Suns the series and a trip to the Finals      "
Carmelo since that wave of talent first showed up.   Also Russell Westbrook more recently.

"His reputation will be just fine in 5 years when he's got like 3 rings or more.  In 10 years, we'll be talking about how he was part of one of the greatest teams of all time and his success, not about his relationship with Russell Westbrook. "
"I know bitter fans are gonna downvote me, but I gotta ask though, but the two arguments are ""Lebron put a triple double"" and ""Lebron lost the series but he had the better plus-minus when he was on the floor"". Isn't this basically Russell Westbrook MVP argument that most of r/NBA shits on? Triple Double average and had a positive plus-minus in the Rockets series?"
"Not to the same degree as those guys for sure. He's not even that bad in the regular season. In the finals, regardless of what stats say, he plays a little like Russell Westbrook. Definitely better though. "

"Okay now, don't get me wrong DeMar DeRozan is my favourite player in the nba, even over nets players but he had an infamously bad playoff series/game and we still all praise him around here.  James Harden had a terrible playoff game and we still say he is a top 3 player in the league rn who could get MVP. Russell Westbrook *also* has had a terrible couple of games in the playoffs yet he was an MVP? 🤔🤔🤔 one game in the playoffs don't mean shit bro"
"Oscar Robertson -&gt; Russell Westbrook  George Gervin -&gt; Kevin Durant  Jerry West -&gt; Stephen Curry  those are the most obvious ones i think, you could argue a few more, but it would be kinda disrespectful to for example compare DeAndre Jordan to Bill Russell, although their playing style was quite identical."
Russell Westbrook is more like 6'4-6'5.
"To add on to this, Russell Westbrook is a good playmaker. Sure, he's not Magic Johnson and sure, assists aren't everything, but you just don't get that many apg without being a pretty good playmaker."
- Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook is very good at playing indoor basketball
"No, the actual title he used was “Russell Westbrook with a JUMPER”"
dennis smith jr is the next russell westbrook
"I know you're joking, but thats mad disrespect to Russell Westbrook."
"Exactly. Durant carried those OKC teams. It’s a miracle they were even competitive.   People forget in his last year in OKC, he only had Russell Westbrook and pretty much nobody else on that team, it was awful. How are you supposed to win a title with just Westbrook? Westbrook and Serge Ibaka and that’s pretty much it. You can’t win a title with three dudes. It was just him, Westbrook, Serge, and then I guess Steven Adams too. You can’t win a title with those cats, you just can’t. Not with just him, Westbrook, Serge, and Steven Adams. You need a bench, all they had coming off the bench was Dion Waiters, and he’s good I guess, but apart from that it was just Enes Kanter and he’s good too, but that’s it. Durant and Westbrook had to carry those teams, their only help was Serge Ibaka, Steven Adams, Enes Kanter, and Dion Waiters coming off the bench. That’s it! It was just him and Westbrook pretty much, and then all those other guys, but then that was it. "
Do you think Russell Westbrook was a better player last season than Kobe and Lebron at their peak?
[Should we eliminate nba championships altogether?](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2724864-daryl-morey-talks-eliminating-nba-awards-after-russell-westbrook-wins-mvp)
"Game 7 against GSW, Russ grabs a defensive rebround and turns on the jets, you see him streaking down court and you’re getting ready for the dunk to end all dunks.   On the defensive end, KD has rushed back to D and is setting up near the post wathing Russell Westbrook approach with the force of 7 hurricanes. He locks in. Russ is not winning with these cats and KD will block Russ to prove that even if it was meant for his alt account, he said what he meant and he meant what he said.   Russ crosses the half court line. KD is getting ready to jump up for the block. Russ is at the 3 point line. KD is focused. Russ is charging at full speed, ready for revenge, ready to release the frustration and anger of the last two seasons by posterizing KD while throwing down a dunk so strong, such strength hasn’t been seen since Shaq caused the hoop to collapse. KD knows he made the right choice, he has a ring to show for it, he will make the block.   Russ jumps. KD jumps.   What will happen?  FIND OUT ON THE NEXT EPISODE OF DRAGON BALL Z."
"Maybe you just aren’t reading me correctly. It’s 100%, and probably even likely, for two athletes to both have the same vertical and one be more explosiveness. For example, the two guys I just mentioned, between Pat Connaughton(44 inch vertical) an Russell Westbrook(36.5 inch vertical) who would you say seems more explosive?"
"That’s just simply untrue. Feats of strength, sprinting, cutting, etc. can all be just as impressively explosive. Jumping and explosive aren’t entirely linked. For example, Pat Connaughton(sp?) has an amazing vertical and tested top in his draft class with a 44 inch vertical. This might be past your time,idk, but Jordan Farmar out of UCLA was top of his draft class in vertical at like 40 or 41 inches(for comparison, Russell Westbrook had a 36.5 vertical) but neither of these guys(even though they are both as tall or taller then Russell) are well known as posterizers because they can jump but not nearly with as much explosiveness as Westbrook or even quick enough to catch defenders off guard. Explosiveness is how quickly and powerfully(the rate) you a do a movement, so it’s entirely possible for someone to be able to jump high or lift a lot of weight but do it at a slow rate."
"&gt;doesn’t improve the next season  He went from one of the worst to one of the best defending guards on paper this season, and the eye test shows that he made huge progress in that regard (and one of the factors in the Blazers' quantum leap on the defensive end).   He already does really well in the counting stats (he has more PPG than Russell Westbrook) what exactly is it that you want him to do?"
"He has a very convincing stat line and a chance to make it for sure, but he does have a lot of competition for his position. He's competing with:  * Klay Thompson  * Chris Paul * Paul George * Russell Westbrook * Jimmy Butler * Andrew Wiggins * Damian Lillard  And this is not including the bigs/frontcourt. As well as he is playing (and as much as I want him to play) it's hard to see him get to play over these players. Maybe over Wiggins but that's about it. "
"PG: Russell Westbrook SG: Klay Thompson SF: Kawhi Leonard PF: Dirk Nowitzki C: Alonzo Mourning  RESERVES: Mark Price Toni Kukoc DeMarcus Cousins  Why this team will win: This team is just flat out dominant. You have shooters around Russ and perfect Pick and Roll partners in Dirk and Zo(Mourning). If all else fails, either ISO with Russ or Kawhi or post up wih Dirk or Zo. Klay is the perfect spot up shooter who provides lockdown D along with Kawhi, if you get past them good luck with the rim protection of Zo. I have a reserve team full of shooters with Price providing good playmaking and shooting off the bench, Kukoc with his amazing shooting and versatility, and Boogie as my main firepower off the bench."
I don’t think they really care that much about each other. Like KD is too soft to hate anyone and  Westbrook doesn’t come off as someone who would care that much about a teammate leaving to feel betrayed. Westbrook is competitive and probably just wants to beat the Warriors and KD is probably just butt hurt that Russell doesn’t want to be friends anymore.
"John Wall had a TS percentage of .490, Russell Westbrook had a .480 in his rookie season and a .491 in his sophmore season. Not saying he is on either of those player's level but I love how people overreact so much when it comes to rookies. "
Russell Westbrook   He knew he would the second he signed that extension  
"I hope Nick “Hair Jordan” Collison retires in OKC and gets his jersey retired. Then I hope he runs for OK Governor, fixes Oklahoma’s school funding and education problems, then runs for president and is the 1st astronaut to land on Mars. Then, on his death bed, his last words will be “Russell Westbrook never stat padded u dipshits” "
"Not all these players are superstars but they're players that are popular for their PG skills. I agree with the consensus which is..you cant be an elite PG in today's league and have below average handle. However, you can have average handle and I think these guys fit that category..   - Russell Westbrook. Might get some hate for this but i think his handles may appear better just because of his athleticism and physicality.  - Lonzo Ball. A rookie..yes but he gets the attention of a superstar. He has great vision and size but he cant blow by a defender purely on his handle. - Ben simmons. Another rookie in the sense but he had a year off in the nba to work on his game. He is a point guard right...? Who knows..but he has great handles for his size but he has average handle compared to other pgs   "
"Players who are 6'3"" and under are only allowed to take 1 three a game, thus making Russell Westbrook the best PG in the NBA."
"What's the worst play of these: a Dwight Howard post-up, an Andrew Wiggins isolation, a Russell Westbrook ""stand still on offense and hope someone does something before eventually returning the basketball to me"" possession or a Dion Waiters drive and ""and-one"" shriek?"
Russell Westbrook  Lamarcus Aldridge  Klay Thompson  CP3   Jimmy Butler  Karl-Anthony Towns  Paul George
"CP3: Only played five games less than Curry. Still undefeated when playing with Capela and Harden. Top 3 PG through eye-test and stats.  Jimmy Butler: Leading Wolves to 4th. All-star through eye-test, stats and impact on winning.  Russell Westbrook: Averaging near triple-double  LaMarcus Aldridge: Leading Spurs without Kawhi  Lou Williams: Check his game log wtf  Karl-Anthony Towns: Beast   Draymond Green: 11/8/8 with great D and the heart&amp;soul of Warriors "
"Russell Westbrook gave his MVP rewarded car to a family in need, if an all star player got it they don’t need to drive it themselves "
this sounds like MTVs Made. Remember Made? Can you imagine Russell Westbrook being your Made Coach? OMG that'd suck.

Russell Westbrook III
"""Is Russell Westbrook Good At Basketball?"" "
Russell Westbrook had 20 assists and it feels like it's the 4th of 5th most notable thing about this game. What the fuck
Yeah but noone was calling Russell Westbrook best player in the league or MVP for that matter. It is an entirely different question. 
"Best point guard in the east wouldn't start over Stephen Curry.   Russell Westbrook, the second best point guard in the west, will not start over Stephen Curry."
"I think this is the main issue. NBA stars are generally a pretty tight-knit group, they know each other, see each other at parties, get-togethers, etc. The main thing that might worry them is the problems it might cause to some relationships if they feel the captain values them less than someone else. It could create tensions, and I think guys like Curry and LeBron don't want their personal rankings of their friends (fellow NBA players) televised.   And you know what ESPN is going to do, ""Curry picks Draymond Green after Russell Westbrook ... is there tension in the locker-room?"" ""LeBron picks Kyrie before IT, has he lost faith in his new teammate?"" etc, etc."
What a game for Russell Westbrook. Elite floor general performance today
"Hey shit, Russell Westbrook "
Russell Westbrook
"Here's stats comparing several of the top guards in the game right now.

RUSSELL “Barry Allen” WESTBROOK. 
Does not even remotely play like Russell Westbrook.
The Russell Westbrook revenge tour starts during the playoffs.   He's gotta get back at lebron for sweeping him in the finals.  
"lmfao Mavs fan I just dont like flairs. the username is not because I'm a thunder fan lol it was actually a joke because of this douchebag thunder fan i met at a bar. i made the joke that he ""sexually identifies as a Russell Westbrook"" and then the username came about."

In fairness, the changes to the cap would have made that tax hit more manageable than they thought it would be when they traded him."
"With the exception of Russell Westbrook, I have seriously never seen an MVP get doubted and questioned so much. And then when he won unanimous MVP, plenty of people DID NOT like that.  Remember the Ayesha ""saw it live"" tweet? Yea it wasn't smart to tweet that though people understood it was her husband that just got ejected so it was a heat of the moment thing. Like photoshop whatever you want but don't be photoshopping Ayesha's face on a naked chick next to 2 naked guys photoshopped to be Bron and Kyrie. THAT was how much people hated the 73-9 Warriors. Adding KD simply fueled the hate even more"
One of is an understatement. Russell Westbrook is the most athletic point guard of all time. 
Jaylen Brown  Terrance Ferguson  Larry Nance Jr.  Russell Westbrook
"&gt; A quick look at Westbrook’s shot chart suggests that all that practice has not paid off in efficiency, but those seeking to evaluate Westbrook’s offensive contributions through his shooting behavior are simply doing it wrong. Last season provides the perfect example. Somehow, despite winning the scoring title, Westbrook also ranked fourth in the NBA in assists per game — and it’s that statistical category that may define the next phase in his career.

"Here's what WS/48 would have picked just applying a simple +20% expected growth age 19 and 20, 15% age 21, 10% age 22 and 5% age 23 and then the reverse expecting 5% decline at age 28 and 29 and then increasing in 5% increments each year (minimum 1000 MP):  1. Kawhi Leonard 2. James Harden 3. Kenneth Faried 4. Kevin Durant 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Kevin Love 7. Ryan Anderson 8. Chris Paul 9. Derrick Rose 10. Greg Monroe 11. Blake Griffin 12. LeBron James 13. Paul George 14. Serge Ibaka 15. Joakim Noah 16. Thaddeus Young 17. Ersan Ilyasova 18. Andrew Bynum 19. Russell Westbrook 20. Derrick Favors  If you get to look at the 12/13 season (not sure if this was printed after the season started), a lot of the bad picks here would be adjusted out. Ryan Anderson,  Ersan Ilyasova, Kenneth Faried and Thad Young all had outlier good seasons in 11/12. Bynum and Rose also both missed the next season.  Removing those four would add the following players:  * Deandre Jordan * Lou Williams * Gordon Hayward * Steph Curry  There are more misses here than the BR list, but if you just look at how it predicts the younger players, which is a far tougher challenge, it does a lot better than BR did... Kawhi, Harden, Irving and George weren't household names at the time.  Obviously, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Towns, Lilliard or anyone drafted after summer 2011 can't be included here, but other omissions are as follows:  * Kyle Lowry (#33) * Demarcus Cousins (#38) * Lamarcus Aldridge (#42) * Demar Derozan (#139)  Jimmy Butler didn't play 1000 minutes in 11/12, but if he did, he'd be ranked 21."

"Gobert is underrated if anything but he's not gonna ever turn into a guy that free agents are gonna be excited to team up with. If Mitchell pans out like he's flashed already, he could be a Russell Westbrook-type guy that gets guys excited to play with him even in a smaller market."
We had Dion Waiters the last year we had KD. Had a few good games but was inconsistent as fuck and got benched in favor of Andre can't make a free throw Roberson. Reggie was a huge locker room cancer that refused to play behind Russell MVP Westbrook.
#D'Angelo Russell Westbrook Lopez
"Of course he could; Larry Bird wasn't unathletic especially in his younger years and would play power forward.  I am not interested in projecting into the future of what Rose could have become. It's conjecture. Nobody knows the answer to that question. Rose is not Russell Westbrook. No one is Russell Westbrook. All I care about is what happened, and Rose in 2011 and portions of 2012 isn't a top five player n the league today. He's around the same tier of Dame."
"He needs to do whatever Russell Westbrook did, and avoid anything that Greg Oden and many other Blazers did."
LeBron James is a really good player.  Jason Tatum is only 19 and has great potential.  Steph Curry is a great 3 point shooter.  Cavs are old  Kevin Durant is also a good player  Russell Westbrook is an MVP and carried his team.  Since this seems like the only thing you can post on this subreddit I'm wondering what you guys think about this.

Are you joking? A team with Kevin Durant &amp; Russell Westbrook went 23-59 too. That's what happens when your two best players are in their first and second years. Then you get better. Jesus Christ.
Russell Westbrook 
"I thought that was a bit harsh initially, but the more I think about it the more it makes sense. The average height in the NBA is what, 6'7""?   I don't think anyone above 6'3"" in the NBA would have much of a chance of being a world class player. Most of the guys left are at least 6 feet tall. This would leave four positions for them: goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and centre forward.    I definitely think guys like Russell Westbrook could be similar to someone like Raphaël Varane physically, but techically there's a small chance he'd make it."
"Russell Westbrook as forward. He'd win every header near him, explosively quick, would be relentless pressing defenders. "
It’s hard to see a star player coming to OKC to play with a 30+ year old Russell Westbrook over the next couple of years tbh (unless they make a big trade which will be hard since they already traded away most of their young assets)
"""If the Thunder keep up this hot streak and manage a top two seed, should Russell Westbrook win MVP?""  That is the name of a post you made 3 weeks ago. In his last 15 games, he's averaged 27.9/9.9/10 on 51.2% shooting, (taking 2.3 three point field goal attempts a game) with 4.3 turnovers and 2 steals a game, compared to his MVP season averages of 31.6/10.7/10.4 on 42.5% shooting (taking 7.2 three point field goals a game) with 5.4 turnovers a game and 1.6 steals.  Basically what I'm getting at is that within the span of you making a post suggesting it's possible for Russ to get MVP this season and this post denouncing him and his ""historic drop off"", he's actually playing better than he did during his MVP season. In other words...Delete this."

What Arron Afflalo did should be punished like if he actually did hit Bjelica. He tried to punch someone's face. This article is a real disgrace."
Russell Westbrook tries
This graph conveys that Russell Westbrook impacts the defensive end much higher than anyone else on his team as well as the offensive end.
"I feel him...but I think it's more due to having to play in a conference where your other competition at PG is Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, &amp; James Harden.   Hard to even give him even second team All Star consideration with those three guys in front of him. He'd have a lot better chance in the East against Kyrie, Wall, &amp; I.T./Lowry/Kemba/Conley.   It should've been something to consider before signing a 5yr deal with Portland. There's no way they're going to let him go without a fight."
"For their own numbers, sure. For people around their numbers, sure they may pay attention or look when a person around their caliber gets an extension they may look at their numbers. I'd think the agent would know their numbers and tell them to shoot better, score more or something but the player themselves wouldn't know all the numbers. That's something we'd need a nothing study to find out though.  Those that want to evolve their game? That's impossible to quantify. Everyone wants to get better. Kobe did, but that didn't stop him from taking as many shots as he could. Statistically he wasn't always the best option but he forced it anyways. Russell Westbrook as well. Blake Griffin. Paul George. Etc... Great players don't always follow that even though they want to be the greatest. Dwight Howard is a huge example. "

Anything Russell Westbrook related that isn't positive really
Russell Westbrook don’t make his teammates better. He didn’t deserve MVP. Yeah. Thats about it.

you are the russell westbrook to my james harden
"i think russell westbrook makes his teammates no better or worse than they already are, PG went off yesterday and he still took more shots despite shooting 40%, that shits standard"
Russell Westbrook is beautiful 
"As far future potential superstars at C and PG, yes. We all know about Shaq but keep in mindthat Penny Hardaway made All-NBA 1st team in only his 2nd year in the league, that's how darn good he was. The talking heads like to say if Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson had a baby, it would be Russell Westbrook. Imagine if Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson had a baby. That was Penny. If you took 85-90% of Jordan's offensive skills and about 85-90% of Magic's passing ability and combined the two, that was essentially Penny's game."
"I'm not saying it's illegal. I'm just saying he'll always be under scrutiny if he's near the top. Trust me, I'm a Russell Westbrook fan."
"Ehhh they didnt really focus away from Kobe that series that whole series Shaq got one on one treatment. The Pistons whole plan was to treat Shaq one on one and focus help elsewhere while letting Shaq get his.  It's why inspite of how good his stats were that series he probably should have been even more aggressive.   All of this is besides the point though. IF you want to talk about him not having enough options to help him......in 2012 that clearly wasnt the case. Nobody would call having Kevin Durant and Russell WEstbrook ""not having guys who can relieve offensive duty from you"". "
"Covington actually spent more time guarding 1's and 2's this year than Simmons. 56% of his poss vs 41% for Simmons   https://public.tableau.com/profile/knarsu3#!/vizhome/DefensivePositions/Dashboard1  Both guys can guard 1-4. Simmons though spends more time on 4's and can guard 5's like Al Horford when asked.   https://stats.nba.com/player/1627732/matchups/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season  https://stats.nba.com/player/203496/matchups/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Defense  In terms of ""guarding the best scorer"" it depends on matchup. Ben Simmons took Russell Westbrook, Tobias HArris, Steph Curry, Harrison Barnes, and Jrue Holiday more than Covington this year. Covington took more of Kevin Durant, CJ McCollum, Goran Dragic, DeMar DeRozan, Kmeba Walker, Victor Oladipo and Devin Booker this year when they played. "
"Going out on a limb:  1. The Golden State Warriors have reconstituted themselves around the K-AD-S core (Kevin-AD-Steph) and are gearing up to attempt to win their 5th championship in the last 8 years and avenge their loss to the Boston Celtics in the 2022 NBA Finals (more on them in a minute)  2. LeBron James will be a third team all-NBA Center for the Los Angeles Lakers. Following the addition of Luca Doncic at the trade deadline, the 3 seed Lakers are poised to return to the promised land for the first time in 13 years.  3. The Russ-PG-Adams Big 3 has aged out, but their 7 game series against the Warriors in the 2019 WCF is remembered as an all-time classic. Russell Westbrook has averaged a triple double in four of his last seven seasons  4. Jalen Adams, the 58th pick of the 2019 NBA draft, is a two-time all-star and third-team all-NBA guard for the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs have extended their streak of playoff appearances to 26. Popovich is coaching the team in between cabinet meetings in Washington.  5. The Boston Celtics have assembled the Big 4: Kyrie Irving, Jayson Tatum, Kawhi Leonard, and Gordon Hayward. Banners 18 and 19 have been raised in the Garden following the 2019 and 2022 NBA Finals. Brad Stevens has taken up Pop's mantle as the best coach in the league. With that territory comes snark and condescension, as when the Celtics played the 0-44 Vancouver Grizzlies and started a 15 year old Leukimia patient at power forward. The Celtics went on to win 108-79  6. The Philadelphia 76ers are still Processing, with Embiid and Simmons laying claim to being 2 of the top 10 players in the NBA. The acquisition of RJ Barrett at the trade deadline gives them hope that they will make their 2nd NBA Finals appearance in the last 5 years.  7. The New York Knicks have assembled a superteam with Giannis and Kristaps, the Adriatic Attack. Following a 60 win season that earned them the 2 seed in the East, the Becky Hammond-led Knicks will now attempt to execute a push for their first NBA championship in nearly 50 years.  8. The Toronto Raptors set the NBA on fire in the summer of 2020 when they traded every single one of the players on their roster, but the resulting squad came together around young stars like Clint Capela and Otto Porter while savvy Veteran Rajon Rondo has led them to the 4 seed. The Raptors are seeking to avenge a loss in game 6 of the previous season's ECF in which Rondo was fouled on a potentially game-tying 3 but didn't get the call. "
"first he's got to make some metaphor about life.   &gt; When I got married I learned you have to make sacrifices. Russell Westbrook goosing rebounds from his teammates is the start of a rocky road towards an inevitable divorce. Trust me, I've lived it. "
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ I support both but it's the Russell Westbrook show   On a serious note I started watching in 2014-15 and the first game I watched was the OKC Phily game where Russ took it coast to coast. Ever since I've been a huge fan. PG is my 2nd favorite player so that really sold it for me.   Raptors all the way in the east tho ofc. I'd root for them in the finals if it came to that. 
"But when Russell Westbrook does it he’s the worst player of all time, amirite?"
Russell Westbrook is in his prime now.
harden hits the craziest stepbacks in the nba. russell westbrook hits turnaround bank shots at a low rate but they are difficult. are they better than harden’s open 3s
"It’s not blasphemous. Both Curry and Harden, and even KD , might be better scorers than Kobe when you take the three ball and efficiency into account. But Kobe’s three ball was underrated actually but his tunnel vision tendencies were often Russell Westbrook like lol."
"Victor ""Russell Westbrook"" Oladipo"
"Ultimately I think experience wins out here. Only one of these teams has an MVP on it, and I can't see how the other team can compete in a 7-game series. You really just need to look at the best player on the floor. I'm excited to see Derrick Rose match up against Russell Westbrook in the 2nd round."
"Anyone catch Zach Harper telling the story of why Russell Westbrook hates Ricky Rubio? Apparently before Rubio's first game, people kept asking Westbrook about him. So, Westbrook has hated him since that day."
"Victor ""Literally Russell Westbrook"" Oladipo"
"Wow.  Imagine pairing him up with someone like, I don't know, Russell Westbrook.  That backcourt could've been amazing if they ever got on the same team."
"Injured guard Andre Roberson yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Singler gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Russell Westbrook yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before PG hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kendrick Perkins hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”  "
Russell westbrook IS an elite playmaker. Top 5-6
It really fucking annoys me how much Russell Westbrook screams for every fucking dunk. Dude looks ugly af

Victor “Russell ‘Gregg Popovich’ Westbrook” Oladipo
Reminder: Victor Oladipo was on the Thunder last year with Russell Westbrook.  Then he gets traded to the Indiana Pacers for Paul George.  Not only did the Pacers finish with a better record than they did last year but they finished with the same record as the current Westbrook/George Thunder.
Did Russell Westbrook make him bad in Orlando too?

"Not sure which prime line-up I'd rather have:  James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant  or  Kyrie Irving, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, LeBron James, Kevin Love"
"I agree with many that your post seems to not really drill down on many details, but I will agree with you that he does seem uninformed at times.  I don’t like Westbrook, but he talks about Westbrook and LeBron with such gritted teeth, it’s obvious he’s so biased against them. “LeBron hasn’t passed Russell yet” is fucking laughable.  He was wrong about Philly at the beginning of the year, and ripped the redick signing (lol), he said he wouldn’t trade Tatum for AD earlier this year, and then joined in Russillo in making fun of the people still saying that this week, he keeps saying the Warriors regular season stuff matters, when it clearly doesn’t, he makes ridiculous comps to like the 2013 Celtics as if the warriors are just completely washed, his analysis of statistics is ridiculously dumb, he rejects stats he doesn’t understand, then says he looks at 3pt defense (which is mostly random) as a key indicator of a team, he says box score stats should still matter more, but thinks triple doubles are overrated, he thinks triple doubles are overrated and arbitrary, but authored the arbitrary “42 club” in columns years ago, he talks about the entertaining as hell tournament, and then admitted a Hornets/Bucks play in game would be unwatchable.   He’s just really all over the place and kind of a gasbag at this point. He is entertaining, I enjoy his pods by and large, but there is no doubt the advancement of basketball analysis has made some of his thoughts seem really basic and hot takey."

Its titled ""Russell Westbrook is not as good as you think at the rim"" What I took from it is if Russ had better body control and made better decisions on drives he would cut down the finishes he can't make."
"It is astonishing how stupid you are. Kevin Durant never said that, he  signed with the Warriors because Steph Curry is a better player than Russell Westbrook. The team was 73-9 because Steph Curry is a better player than Russell Westbrook. "

"And because it's Kawhi and the Spurs, it hasn't even been as much of a story as it should. If any other players/organization had this happen, it would be a shit show.

Then /r/nba would show up and carve 'triple double this lol' into his chest."
"Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook  James Harden, Jimmy Butler  Klay Thompson, Paul George  Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond  i go with small ball, maybe add 1 more big if curry doesn't want to play  or maybe leave lillard or westbrook off if i think i need another big  i leave the old guys off   boogie and gordan hayward i didn't consider because of thier injuries         "

&gt;Russell Westbrook when he defended Jimas Hardin
"Announcer yelled ""Russell Westbrook is out of his cotton-picking mind!""   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8bmhm1/okc_announcer_saying_westbrook_is_out_of_his/?utm_term=0586cefc-994b-4a06-b1e4-1cef4b9aef54&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=nba&amp;utm_content=1"
"I’ve been watching basketball since 2001 to answer your question.  An important stat to look at if you want to see a player’s overall impact on the game that takes into account both offense and defense is win shares.  Paul George entered the league in 2010-2011 season, later than any of the other players you mentioned (Russell Westbrook entered in the 2008-2009 season, and Stephen Curry and James Harden entered in the 2009-2010 season). If we compare the number of win shares for each player since PG entered the league, here are what the numbers look like.  Paul George: 53.4 total win shares  Russell Westbrook: 82.1 total win shares  Stephen Curry: 88.6 total win shares  James Harden: 102.2 total win shares  And if we compare their career stats for win shares per 48 minutes for their careers, here are what the numbers look like.  Paul George: .146  Russell Westbrook: .168  Stephen Curry: .208  James Harden: .220  However, you specifically mentioned PG’s impact in the playoffs, so perhaps we should examine whether he is elite amongst the other players you mentioned in that arena.  James Harden made his first playoff appearance in the 2009-2010 season, which also happened to be his rookie year. Russell Westbrook was his teammate that year and it was his first playoff appearance as well, but he was in his second season. Paul George made his first playoff appearance in his rookie season in 2010-2011. Curry’s first playoff appearance was in the 2012-2013 season during his 4th season in the NBA.  Paul George has had 7 playoff appearances since entering the league.  Russell Westbrook has had 8 playoff appearances since entering the league.  Stephen Curry has had 6 playoff appearances since entering the league.  James Harden has had 9 playoff appearances since entering the league.  Paul George has had 2 Conference Finals appearances and 0 Finals appearances.  Russell Westbrook has appeared in 4 Conference Finals, one NBA Finals, and has 0 championships  Stephen Curry has had 3 Conference Finals appearances, 3 Finals appearances, and won 2 championships.  James Harden has had 3 Conference Finals appearances, one Finals appearance, and 0 championships.  The career win shares per 48 minutes in the playoffs are as follows.  Paul George: .145  Russell Westbrook. .150  Stephen Curry: .199  James Harden: .168  Based on these numbers, in the regular season it is clear that PG is not in the same category as these other players you mentioned, and his playoff numbers are barely comparable. "
While Russell Westbrook gets killed for it.
"Wilt broke the game so bad they had to basically rewrite the whole rule book, and his insane statistical records are an artifact of that. But people do still rag on Wilt like they do Westbrook, he's often juxtaposed with Bill Russell to argue Wilt didn't care about winning while Russell did. "
I’ll probably get downvoted for this because”tRiPle DOuBLeS” but Russell Westbrook is a big reason they didn’t have more success. That and their inability to find 3nD guys. Go look back at the stats from that finals series like shooting percentages and tell me why Russ thought it was a good idea to take more shots than KD did. His inability to slow down and not turn it over/force bad shots is what kept them from closing out the Warriors up 3-1 as well. 
"Not dunk of the year, but who dunked on the better player? Larry Nance/LAL over Kevin Durant or Joel Embiid/PHI over Russell Westbrook? "

Russell.... Westbrook 
Oh. Let me introduce you to our Lord and savior Russell Westbrook. 
"I'm not arguing Zach should be on an All-Rookie team over John Collins dude, so counting stats don't really mean much here. John Collins has had more opportunities to play this season since he played on a pathetic excuse of a roster. Yippee. If a team is trying to win the most games though, and you need a backup PF/C for Lauri/Allen, you'll likely do better with Zach than you would John. Basketball isn't an offense only game, otherwise Russell Westbrook would actually win in the playoffs."
That would parallel Russell Westbrook going to GSW.

"Simmons really pissed me off in this podcast. Not only his shitting on OKC as a city, but his shitting on Russell Westbrook. Scoffs at Westbrook being in his top 5 MVP candidates and then later says Oladipo is in his top 5. Dismisses Roberson's injury like it was nothing and says they easily replaced him with Brewer. Give me a break."
"Why don't you take a look at Westbrook's stats in the 2011-12 NBA Season when the Thunder made the Finals.  After that, he started stat padding and the Thunder never made it to a Finals again, even though he had KD for some of those seasons.  He averaged 23.6 points/5.5 assists/4.6 rebounds in 2011-12, where he shot his highest FG% of his career.  That was before his stat padding days, when his team made the NBA Finals.  Now he puts his stats above his team.  That line he averaged is about his true NBA ability if he played not to stat-pad.  He's really a 4-5 rebounder like I told you if he played to help his team win games.  http://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook  Take a look at his career numbers.  Notice his offensive rebounding numbers never improved, but his defense rebounding numbers are the ones propping up his rebounds.  This makes sense, since it's way more skill for a guard to get an offensive rebound than a defensive rebound.  So yes, he started padding his stats since years ago, starting with the year after the Finals run (probably felt slighted that KD was the star and James got a huge contract with the Rockets).  He never became a better rebounder since his offensive rebounding rate is the same.  He just learned to sag off his man and wait in the paint to give himself a better chance at getting a defensive rebound.  He also learned to just let the bigs box out and he can go in and scoop up the rebound.  All of this can be done on the defensive end, but not the offensive end, so that's why his offensive rebounds never improved.    That's why Durant left.  He didn't want to play with someone like that.  RWB will never win a championship with this playing style.  I can guarantee you that.  He'll be a first ballot HOFer sure, but he'll be like slightly better version of Dominique Wilkins."
"Lmfao KD in his first finals appearance led all scorers with 31 PPG on 65 TS% at only 23 years old, he's been the league's all-around best, most efficient and unstoppable scorer since he became legally able to drink. His efficiency has always been unprecedented no matter who he's played with. The only salty fans here are dudes like you who can't stand the fact that such a historically elite scorer is now backed up by Steph Curry instead of Russell ""Most turnovers ever before age 30"" Westbrook. Stay mad lol"
"I mean if you’re talking non-basketball people, I don’t think they care about Russell Westbrook averaging a triple double. Kobe is fucking Kobe and everyone knows him. "
"check the ratings for this past Oscars and then compare it to the highest rated NBA game and also the NBA awards show you'll find the following is true.   The ratings for the Oscars will blow any NBA game away.   The highest rated game does not have Russell Westbrook.   The ratings &amp; coverage for the award show where Russell win MVP pales in comparison to the Oscars where Kobe won the Oscars.   Conclusion, there are more people who know Kobe, a basketball player, won an Oscar than there are people who even seen Westbrook play or even know who he is. "
The Russell Westbrook effect 
"I mean there is that Lil dicky ""Russell Westbrook on a Farm""..... "
I'd say Bill Russell Westbrook is at #3. Imagine Bill's size with Russ' motor
Wilt Currlamberlain.  although id prefer Bill Russell westbrook simply for size reasons
"As soon as you said there are players with more humility IRL, you lost me. You're still describing the persona. I see where you're coming from, but he's proven to be a whole different person off of the court. There's a reason there is Russell Westbrook Day in OKC, and it's not because of triple doubles. "
Russell Westbrook 
"For sure.   Like I completely disagree entirely with his CP3 for All NBA defense selection to a degree I almost never do with Zach Lowe. But I sure as hell respect the fact he put time into making that decision: I would never accuse him of ""just mailing it in"".   The dirty little secret about this years ballot is  1) if you have Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, DeMar Derozan, Victor Oladipo, Steph Curry, Dame Lillard, James Harden at the guard spot that's 7 highly deserving candidates for 6 All NBA guard spots. Somebody is getting left off.....and no matter who it is it will trigger that fan base because of how good all those players are.   2) For All NBA defense at forward you have:   Robert Covington, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Al Horford, Giannis, Draymond Green.   That's 6 great defenders for 4 spots. 2 guys are getting left off. And whomever they are those fans will complain. "
"&gt;Davis made the comments during the second quarter of the Thunder's season-closing win over the Grizzlies, when he referred to Russell Westbrook as ""out of his cotton pickin' mind.""  What the fuck?"
"He said Russell westbrook was ""out of his cotton picking mind"" when commentating the thunder game earlier this week.  This can be seen as having racial connotations obviously, but when he said it he was just using it as an exclamation and compliment for Westbrook (it's a pretty common phrase in the south, and obviously he would never say something intentionally racist on live tv.)  Hence only 1 game suspension and a weird situation. Soft imo"
"Yeah the Chris Paul on 1st team All NBA defense is about as much as Ive disagreed with something on Zach Lowe in a long time. Ive watched houston pretty closely this year...........frankly ther'es no case for it at all. CP3 is straight coasting even in the games he does play on that end he's legit going like 60%. And he doesnt guard the opponents best players AT ALL; I get he is great in the FS role off the ball but this is bordering on straight hiding him with how theyve used him on defense at this point this year.  http://stats.nba.com/team/1610612745/matchups/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Defense&amp;CF=DEF_PLAYER_NAME*E*Paul:OFF_PLAYER_NAME*E*&amp;sort=POSS&amp;dir=1 permalinksavecontextfull comments (26)editare you sure?yes/no Reply  Like you cant just not guard guys like Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry etc for more than a dozen poss in a game and say your team isnt clearly just trying to put you on the worst opposing player possible.    CP3 certainly wasnt a bad defender by any means this year.......he just doesnt have a good case for all NBA defense at all. "

"I don't even dislike the Thunder or Russell Westbrook, but man Royce Young is fucking insufferable"
They don't hate stat padding. They use it to justify their hate for Russell Westbrook.
"Russell Westbrook is a better scorer, passer, rebounder, hustler, defender, than James Harden."
"Correction: Lebron James, Russell Westbrook, Ben Simmons and Josh McRoberts combined for 55 triple doubles this season."
"I agree with this post.   Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Lebron James, Paul george, Hilton Armstrong, and klay Thompson all want to play on the lakers. with the young core they have they can definitely win multiple championships and create a dynasty. "
This is somewhat controversial. Simply because Harden didn’t contribute to all 65 wins. He was out for ten games and it’s more of a team effort that brought the Rockets to 65-17.   Westbrook played all 82 games and team chemistry issues like Melo not being a product of hoody Melo and PG13’s shot being so embarrassed to show up in another game time after scoring a measly 9 points in the allstar 3 point shooting contest.  Russell still did average a triple double in the end after all that.
Russell Westbrook is better than James Harden. 
Well this is the only season I can remember where OKC was feared of not making the playoffs. Russell Westbrook has taken OKC to the playoffs every season since being drafted. Even in 2016-17 when he was technically alone carrying the team there.
"Tyreke had a great rookie season, but it wasn't an all-time historical season or anything like that.   He put up 20/5/5 in his rookie season. There have been 57 different players that have done that at least 1 season of their career.  Simmons put up 15/8/8 this year. There are only 8 total players that have done that in at least 1 season of their career. Every single one of them was/is a superstar.  Oscar Robertson	  Magic Johnson  LeBron James  Russell Westbrook	  Wilt Chamberlain  James Harden  Michael Jordan  and  Ben Simmons   "
"paul george, russell westbrook, carmelo anthony, steven adams is less talented than the jazz? pfffft"
"At the end of 2014 Russell Westbrook has a career average of 4.9 rebounds per game. Don't underestimate the difference pace and style of play can affect stats. Harden averaged 8.1 last year. There's no reason he couldn't average 10 if they planned for him to crash the board. Probably not the likely strategy next year, but things can always change."
"&gt; Hate on him for hustling, but he'll have the last laugh.   But that's the thing, he doesn't hustle! It's insane how often Westbrook's man cuts under the basket and Westbrook just kinda stops chasing him and waits under the rim for the rest of the possession. The possession that often ends with a wide open shot  from the man he should have been guarding. That's hustle? His hustle is for insane things, things that  don't help you win. He hustles to steal defensive rebounds from his own teammates (pointless), often at the expense of contesting a shot or staying with his man. He hustles to jump passing lanes, often at the expense of staying with his man, leading to an open shot from a 5 on 4 situation. He hustles when he has the ball on offense, often overdribbling and not involving his teammates until late in the possession. He almost never hustles when he doesn't have the ball on offense.   Ajayi, winning 82% of the time when Russell has a triple double is just as bullshit as Michigan basketball going 28-0 this year when Duncan Robinson had 6+ points. You're mistaking correlation with causation. And I hate to break it to you, but the correlation is probably more that Russell had the leeway and freedom to accumulate the requisite assists and rebounds for a triple double in a win/blowout against teams that are worse on average.  Not that the wins were powered by the strength of his triple doubles.  And none of this stems from not watching him, it stems from watching him. Westbrook was literally one of my 2 favorite players earlier in his career. He used to give real hustle. Now he quits on defense and doesn't involve his teammates enough, and I've lost respect for him. Still a superstar, I just feel like he could be so much better than he is. "
"1. wins 2. people have been talking about him winning all year, whereas lebron started balling out much later in the season 3. i think some people feel bad about voting for TRIPLE DOUBLES!!!!!!!!! last year (if you don't understand this, here's a mediocre article about it http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2703050-nba-mvp-2017-russell-westbrook-james-harden-debate-has-no-correct-answer)  i think it's mostly #2. he's great and deserves it, but narrative &gt; logic for awards"

Russell Westbrook would be dominating the league like LeBron if he was a smarter player. He's one of the dumbest players ever
"k listen up you little shit  I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns.  This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"
Russell Westbrook will never be the best player on a championship team.

"Okay but we'll get out of the first round and you won't. Our head-to-head matches were both incredibly close in Simmons' career, so it's not like you ever smacked us. According to your argument, if you can't shoot a 3 you're worth nothing,  apparently. So what, all centers are garbage? Oh wait no. Russell Westbrook is a worse 3pt shooter than Joel Embiid by percentage.  Your only conceivable argument here is that Ben doesn't have a 3 PT game: okay, well Ben gets it out to better 3pt shooters who space the floor. Ben can drive in and take it home or kick it out for a 3, rather than forcing a bad 3 like Westbrook. Come on man, it was a cute argument but if you really think that Ben not taking any 3 point attempts this season means he's not good, you might want to seek the opinions of some professional analysts. Ben has been phenomenal all season. Get outta here"
"This OKC team has an all meme lineup featuring Paul “Pushoff P” George, Russell “Guarantee that” Westbrook and Carmelo “come off the bench? 😂😂” Anthony "
I recognize this is kicking people while they're down but a team led by the current Russell Westbrook will never run anything resembling an efficient NBA offense. It won't happen. And it doesn't appear that offense is capable of winning anything significant against teams that know what they're doing.   Thunder are in the unenviable spot of owing a lot to Westbrook but he's very much the limiting factor to their success. 
No but /r/nba loves their Russell Westbrook roast time

Reason. Westbrook cannot run an offense. He can be a good playmaker but he isn't good at feeding the hot hand. Its his job to get the ball to the hot hand.  Carmelo Anthony - 5/16 **31.2%**  11 points  Russell Westbrook - 6/17 **35.2%** 20 points  Paul George - 6/12 **50%** 24 points  Why has PG taken the least shots.

"IMO, no disrespect to Rubio, but this is a lot closer to Steph vs Delly in the 2015 finals than it is Payton vs Stockton.  Stockton is an all-time great and was always considered a top tier player (ffs he made All-NBA for a decade straight).  He was straight-up Gary Payton's rival for much of that time.  They'd be in the same conversation.  Meanwhile, Rubio has never made an All-NBA team or an All Star Game.  He's playing basically the best basketball of his career in this series.  And on the other end, you have reigning (at least for a few more days) MVP Russell Westbrook who is widely considered one of the top 5 point guards in league who's losing this series."
Surprised ESPN didn't  uncover the story.  EDIT:  Omg I checked I wanted to be sure. yup they covered it  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23297248/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-says-instagram-comment-criticizing-russell-westbrook-was-accidental
"For reference, Harden's Playoff TS% this year would be the highest of any single Playoff run in the **careers** of Russell Westbrook, DeMar DeRozan, and John Wall.   So, not so bad."
"While Durant had Green on his squad—""You know he's got your back if something jumps off""—Green, surveying his own locker room for his squad, looked right past Durant and Stephen Curry, presumably because it's hard to imagine either of them in an actual fight. Instead, he took Warriors power forward David West along with Oladipo, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook to join him in the park.   Good choices "
"[Royce Young on Twitter](https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/988516403706609664?s=19)  &gt; Kevin Durant tells me it was a ""total accident"" that he liked a comment on Instagram about Russell Westbrook. Was just an honest mistake."
"You actually can debate this fact. He was given time to learn about the NBA and probably even sat in on practices and got a full year more of knowledge and experience than Mitchell. Your argument about ""NBA's definition"" is pretty dumb since the NBA definition of shit always changes.  For example, historically the MVP was given to a player who was on one of the top 2 teams of either conference but last year it was changed for Russell Westbrook whose team was 6th seed in the West.   I still believe Simmons is a better player and will be the next LBJ, but you can't overlook the fact that he has gotten more experience in his year off than Mitchell. And their team records were within 4 games of each other. They should be co-ROTY."
"I would rather have Russell at his worstbrook than I would KD. I don’t care if we never win a championship. I don’t care if we never win a playoff series. I will yell my lungs out every home game for the guy who puts my city on his back night in and night out. KD when you were here, even tho they shielded you from the media, your character was so soft and it was obvious. 10 championships cannot get you to where Westbrook is in the heart of his city. You will never have that. "
Also didn’t they rekindle their friendship smh has got to be a blow to Russell Westbrook to see this 
"Lmfao 2nd best player in the league but lost in the first round in 07'. Missed the post season completely in 08'. Lost in the first round in 09'. Lost in the first round in 10'. Get the fuck out of here.    Here's the difference since it's so complicated apparently. Lebron joined a fringe playoff team. FACT. KD joined a team with the most wins in NBA history with 3 all-NBA players and an MVP on it coming off of a finals appearance AND a championship the year before that. FACT.    That same ""superteam"" the year after Lebron left it, missed the playoffs. Go look up GS's record without KD in the lineup.   Lebron left Daniel Gibson. KD left Russell Westbrook. It's not complicated."
"People assumed it, but during the whole alt-account thing earlier he had said the complete opposite actually, and basically said it was everything else (organization, Donovan, players except for Westbrook).  https://sports.yahoo.com/russell-westbrook-likes-thunder-cats-kevin-durant-dubbed-not-good-162700416.html  &gt; “He didn’t like the organization or playing for Billy Donovan,” Durant wrote in the third person. “His roster wasn’t that good, it was just him and Russ. … Imagine taking Russ off that team, see how bad they were. KD can’t win a championship with those cats.”"

"&gt;along with 30 other GM’s would rather have Curry run an offense  Nice mind reading technique bro. Russell Westbrook is a better playmaker, he sucks players inside, thus getting his teammates easy open looks. He also has the higher assist to turnover ratio. He’s also better at the pick and roll and pick and pop. You are entitled to your opinion though."
"I, along with 30 other gms in the league would rather have curry run an offense than westbrook  i feel like you are confused and maybe think curry plays offball because he isn't as good at running an archaic offense like the thunder do  Please explain to me why, if russell westbrook is such a great playmaker, and he has had such quality teammates next to him over the years, OKC still has the identity of an iso only team and issues within the offense"
&gt; Russell Westbrook is the most glorified ballhog in history.  Allen Iverson says hi.
"I've got a few:  - Russell Westbrook is the most glorified ballhog in history.  - Anthony Davis is too injury prone to be a LeBron-level star in this league.  - LeBron won't join Philly because he'll be putting his career at the mercy of Embiid's health.  Edit: When I say ""LeBron-level star"", I mean face of the league level star."

(Note: **The Houston deal isn't technically a supermax**, but bird rights, a presumed rise in the salary cap, and Paul's years of service would escalate his new deal to similar heights).

"Kyle Korver is playing like Klay, except with the shooting ability of Russell Westbrook. "
Why are we acting like that's good? -Russell Westbrook probably
"""Russell Westbrook"""
I don’t think a coach can do much with Russell Westbrook. I know this is gonna get shit on but Billy is doing around as anyone could coaching a team around Russell.
"It's actually 80 points - Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Serge Ibaka.  I know it's hard to believe, but James Harden also was on the Thunder, but they decided they needed to trade him for some reason after they lost to the Heat in the finals. "
"I'm pretty confused that this is even a debate. Rudy and Adams are averaging the same ppg this year. Rudy is having a bit of a down year offensively. Adams is having a career year. Adams has 2 more shot attempts per game AND plays with freakin Russell Westbrook/PG13 as his PnR partners. Come on guys. Steven Adams is one of the best, but he's not better than Rudy."
"You're being downvoted because of recency bias. Derrick averaged 16+ ppg for two season until he got injured a couple years ago. Steven Adams has a career high 13 ppg average this year, playing with freakin Russell Westbrook. "
"Name me 10 point guards who you would take over Russell Westbrook.  Actually, name me 10 PLAYERS you would take over Russell Westbrook."
"I'm sorry, but you're not going to convince me that Russell Westbrook taking 0 shots in a 7+ minute stretch of the 4th quarter after taking 17 shots in the previous three quarters was solely due to the defensive scheme. Westbrook had 25 shots in Game 1 and 19 shots in Game 2 including fourth quarter shots in both and I'm fairly confident Gobert was on the Jazz in those games too. Some of those shots were ill advised and rushed, especially in Game 2, but he still took them because that is how he plays. He did not play how he normally plays last night imo, and I would love to know why. Was he trying to send a message a la Kobe in that Game 7? Was he stat padding? Did he have something going on at home? Was it really just a giant coincidence/defensive scheme related?  Ultimately, it is possible that there was nothing there, but I personally think it's more likely there was something there than there wasn't."
"Not only that, Donovan Mitchell has outscored Paul George, Russell Westbrook, and Carmelo Anthony COMBINED 23-9 in the 4th quarter the last two games."
Well yesterday a Warriors fan said Kevin Durant would run the PG position better than Russell Westbrook. 
"Let’s have an uncomfortable conversation. Say you’re a GM. Rank the following options:   1. 29yo Russell Westbrook on his current deal 2. 28yo James Harden on his current deal, or 3. Donovan Mitchell on his rookie deal  Am I fucked up for thinking it goes 2&gt;3&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1?"
Plot twist: Russell Westbrook is just Oscar Robertson reincarnated so this was his plan all along 
The last time a player not named Russell Westbrook or Kobe Bryant shot 43 FGA was CWebb in 2001 then before that MJ in 93. Westbrook has done it 4 times in 4 years. It's ridiculous
The fan who was yelled at by Russell Westbrook at half time of game six allegedly said that to garner that reaction from him. Not to be mistaken with the fan at the end of the game who was filming too close to Westbrook's face for his liking. 
Helps when a team is balanced. Ask Russell Westbrook what happens to a team when one guy tries to take over.   
- russell westbrook 
if oladipo doesn't become a selfish russell westbrook in the last quarter of this game and actually facilitates his teammates the pacers should easily win this
"Carmelo Anthony yelled “Yo P, they want me to come off the bench”. Russell Westbrook gave a look of genuine derangement. Paul George belted out “I’m going to a different [expletive] squad”. And before Corey Brewer hit the locker room, ex-OKC star Kevin Durant hugged him and said “You can’t win a championship with those cats”. "
Draymond green shoots the 3 at a higher % than Russell Westbrook. 
"I disagree about 60.5% being much different from 55%, but in the end, that just comes down to opinion and perspective. I don't think usage rate is a good representation of lower shooting percentages unless the player is forcing shots. For instance, in OKC, Russell Westbrook has a usage of 38.2%. But he often forces his shots and takes shots he shouldn't be shooting. Because of that, his shooting percentages are lower than what they should be. On the other hand, James Harden has a usage of 36.8%, which is also crazy high. But he's having a career year and shooting well, because he takes shots by what the defense allows him. He has multiple shooters around him and trusts them to make shots. That's where you're right about spacing and scheme. Giannis would have higher percentages if he had more shooters around him to space the floor. Though the fact that he shoots a majority of his shots at the rim and within 10 feet, means his shooting percentage won't be significantly higher unless he starts scoring most of his points on guaranteed lobs and dunks."
"I'll be honest, the way Westbrook spoke at the conference, I thought the guy with the phone was saying some racist stuff. Or some real out of bounds stuff.  Seeing this video not only clears that up, it kind of disappoints me about Russell owning his actions. Pretty weak for a guy that gets to play sports for crust. "
This is when a triple double actually helps your team....Russell Westbrook...please take notics
I think okc’s front office will think twice about going after stars now given their history. They might go the AI route and surround Westbrook with solid role players instead as the past experience ya with pairing Russell with big names just hasn’t panned out.
"If you've actually read the comment chain and think you can work an angle that I'm a huge westbrook supporter who thinks he did nothing wrong, then you've come in with massive preconceived notions that I cannot break through.  Also you've unironically compared Russell Westbrook to Donald Trump. Let that one set it."
When did that specific fan mistreat Russell Westbrook?  Holding a camera out as NBA players walk by is mistreatment?  No Russell was just being a dick and struck a fan because he was in a mood.   That fan did nothing that warranted having his phone slapped out of his hand.    Also....Breaking news: home town fans talk shit to opposing players... More at 9.
Jabari Parker probably has more friends than Russell Westbrook
rules are rules.. doesn't matter if you're Russell Westbrook or Greg Ostertag.  
"He's a person that is just as valuable as Russell Westbrook. He wasn't milking anything. He wasn't trying to sell anything or get a settlement. He was just telling his side of the story because a very public figure made it sound like he made disparaging, vulgar remarks about his family. He has every right to tell his side. It was a national story so there;s no reason why he shouldn't let the media know what he actually said or did. "
"The guy shoved his camera in the players faces and everyone that cares to notice will see it. Yes thats disrespectful and yes he shouldnt do it, and no that lady next to him shouldnt be acting shocked like they did nothing wrong when Russell reacted. That being said this shows that thats all that was done, not name calling, verbal taunting besides cheering and no profanities. It makes sense for this guy to put his story out there because westbrook said things about utah fans saying terrible and disrespectful things to him, which could damage this persons reputation if it were believed he was one of them (because just looking at the original video we dont know all of what may have provoked him). We still dont know what that person at half time said to russell, or what they are exposed to from the fans generally as we have all seen videos of fans being disrespectful to players. All that being said we all know russell isnt the best at controlling his temper as well"
"I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns.  This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES  "
Well if my basic math is right then Draymond Green + Russell Westbrook should fuck and have a baby. He would eclipse Jordan as the sport's GOAT
No.  He dared to insult our lord and savior Russell Westbrook.
"I saw Russell Westbrook at a grocery store in OKC yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
"Draymond gets near triple doubles and doesn't give a shit unless they win. Russell Westbrook, OTOH, is still wondering why KD left because he doesn't know everyone on his team is sick of him averaging triple doubles with zero wins. "
"Wow, a reasonable comment among this mess.  Here's what happened:   1. Fan holds camera about 18 inches from Westbrook's face (not 3 inches, like I keep seeing people claim). Not unreasonable, considering he's in the front row and Westbrook is walking immediately by him. [SCREENSHOTS](http://imgur.com/a/sC7VJu9)  2. Westbrook overreacts and slaps the fan's hand while trying to hit his phone, presumably because he's frustrated about the loss.  3. The fan who got slapped has his face posted all over the Internet, and is getting lambasted for allegedly making racial or hateful comments towards Russell. Many people justify Russell's slap.  4. Fans posts his own video to prove what actually happened. He makes sure people know it was just a slap, not a punch, because he's not looking for money out of this.   5. Fan gets called a pussy for saying the slap hurt a little bit, and is labeled as an attention-whore for doing an interview about this, even though he was already getting plenty of attention from this scenario. The end.  "
"Russell ""Rodney Hood"" Westbrook"
"&gt; not good at getting and finishing at the rim since his injury  Paul George at the rim this year: 67% (6% better than Russell). He has 20% of his total shots at the rim. 8% higher than Klay Thompson. &gt;Most thunder and pacers fans who have watched him know he's not a good facilitator   Pacers fans would disagree, since the dude averaged 5 assists in the playoffs since he had a role as a starter, and averaged 7.3 assists last year in the playoffs. Hard to facilitate in a thunder jersey when your point guard has a 39% Usage rate in the playoffs  &gt; He's closer to klay than most people realize.   This year that is somewhat true, as a first option (previous years), not even remotely close. This year he was forced to be a 2nd option, 3 point spot up since Russell takes the most shots on the team. Something that should not happen:   - Thunders record when Westbrook takes 15 or less shots this year: 14-3   - Thunders record when Westbrook takes more than 15 shots this year: 34-31  The main argument people use to take away this stat is: he shot so well in the games where he shot low attempts that it became a blowout. Well, Westbrook shoots under 50% in 12 of those 17 games with less than 15 attempts. "
Team needs a new coach and an actual system.  Westbrook-Abrines-Roberson-Grant-Adams  Could be a solid team but really needs a good system that brings the best out of russell
"“I don’t confront fans, they confront me.”  -Russell Westbrook"
"Joe Ingles yelled out, “Theh yeh go!” Mitt Romney gave a look of pleasant surprise. Russell Westbrook belted, “Get that [expletive] out of my face.” And before Donovan Mitchell could finish his interview, ex-NBA undrafted free agent Quin Snyder hugged him and whispered, “You smell so nice.”"
"Assault from whom? From the fan or from Westbrook? It's an unfortunate reaction from Russell, but that's it."
"A lot of people say stupid shit like ""Russell Westbrook at one point was a top 10 player in the NBA"" and ""Russell Westbrook deserved MVP in 2017"" lol"

"[Full Video of Melo's Exit Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHNHW6pLqhg)  Talking points that Melo brings up...(which I think are all bullshit by the way..but for sake of argument...I want to share them because they are laughably bad)  * Melo says He was brought in at the last hour and OKC was already going with Plan A...and had difficulty integrating him into Billy Donovan's system  * Melo says...Multiple times, Melo, talks about how the team was 'learning on the fly' about how to play together...etc.   * Melo had been a certain kind of player for 14 years...and this year had to be a different kind of player...BUT NOTE....Melo implies strongly here that he will/wants to go back to the kind of player he was last year...not form...but rather be in a system that let's him jabstep his way up the stairway to heaven)  * Melo says the team needs to come together to figure out how the players (I think he means w/ regards to Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Carmelo Anthony) are going to work together.  * In response to ""In what way do you see you being a more effective player?"" Melo: ""Um...to be honest with you I'm the player I am because of the way I established the type of play...playing the way I do throughout my career. So now [we] need to figure out the best way to implement that game into something that we are trying to create"". (LOL, choke on that)  * On looking back on this season in the future: ""...training camp...like preseason...""  * The worst question asked I think, Reporters: ""What's it like to be one of the most coveted guys on the market?"" Melo: It's an honor to be wanted...""  * Reporter: ""All year, people have talked about how much you have sacrificed...Next year how much are you willing to sacrifice be it financial....playing time...or even sacrificing a bench role? Melo: ""Yeah, I'm not sacrificing no bench role, that's out of the question."" On Finances: ""...I don't want to talk about...its uncomfortable...We play the game to feed our families...that money is guaranteed so it's about how to make it work...EVeryone knows how much I sacrifiiced...moving here with my family...my game....I need to think about how I'm going to want to finish my career....what kind of player do I want to be...etc.""  My takeaway: (1) Melo wants his money.  (2) Not accepting a bench role. (3) Believes he is still the kind of player he was in NY if the system fits around him. (4) Everyone pay attention to Melo and how much he sacrificed, sacrificed, sacrificed this past year. "
Needs the ball in his hands to be effective. Can't have the ball in his hands when playing with Russell Westbrook and Paul George. Not a good off-the-ball player.
Russell Westbrook and Kyle Singler
I think the question for making the playoffs is whether he can pull of a russell westbrook show at the same level of last year.  
"The sad reality is that if this team goes back to being ""The Russell Westbrook Show"" like it was last year, I don't think you can expect much improvement from those guys. "
"That's how you respond to fans, @ Russell Westbrook"
"Maybe Russell Westbrook brain washed him to never speak negatively of him since Westbrook is a ""bad teammate"" /s "
"When it's not the playoffs you get threads like ""Who would be the 34th best SF in today's league if all SFs through basketball history were available to play in their primes?""   So I don't get banned:  ""[SERIOUS] Should Russell Westbrook be euthanized?"""
"Paul George was 2-16, but him only getting 16 shots is almost as bad as him only making two. He probably needed to be involved more to get a rhythm going. Westbrook should have been trying to get George going. Instead Westbrook was busy taking 43 shots, 19 of which were three point attempts.   Let that sink in.   Russell Westbrook, one of the worst high volume three point shooters of all time and a guy who shot below 30% from 3 this season had **19 3-pt attempts last night**. He took more 3-pt attempts than Paul George had field goal attempts, and that should *never* happen."
"a 40 year old farmer makes me think of the Lil Dicky song ""Russell Westbrook on a farm"". Normally wouldn't comment this, but I feel it's moderately timed to be appropriate.

"I think he's already made enough money that it doesn't really matter.  If you can blow $230 million, you'll blow $260 million.  Melo hasn't been to the 3rd round since 2009.  I don't think he had much fun playing in New York, and a year of losing with an angry, spiteful Russell Westbrook sounds worse.  When he's 50, what is he supposed to show those grandkids, a photocopy of a paycheck?  I *seriously* doubt that he'd walk, but it's not a ridiculous option.  Some guys, at that stage of their career and with so much already in the bank, would definitely take the lifestyle over the money."

No he's not. He's Russell Westbrook who's just as good or better.
"What's truly amazing is that Russell Westbrook led the league in assists by far this year, and OKC finished 28th in team assists.  To put it into context, Ben Simmons had 29.8% of the 76ers assists.  Westbrook had 46.9% of the Thunders'.  "
Russell Westbrook full playoff highlights
"Westbrook is their biggest weakness. This whole season it felt like Melo and George never quite fit in, because Russell was still chasing the triple doubles. It I were both of them I would jump ship. Westbrook needs players who will compliment him. Not players who might be better than him."
"We've seen proof that Jordan mentality can work in the modern NBA if you consider Kobe's career path. The problem with Russell Westbrook is not how edgy or competitive he can be. It's the fact that he has limited basketball IQ. MJ and Kobe were dicks to everybody. But, on the court they were smart and they knew all the key components to win. Russell Westbrook doesn't."
It's an expression. Obviously they weren't throwing alfalfa pellets at Russell Westbrook.
Westbrook needs better coaching. Brooks and Donovan are push overs who let Russell run over them. Pop and Russ need each other. It would make the Spurs Elite again. 
"Honestly, coaching is what keeps killing OKC. They need a strong willed coach to get in Westbrook's ass when he wants to force things late in the game.   Russell just needs to learn how to play under more control to take the next level. I would love to see Westbrook with Pop. The NBA wouldn't be able to handle it.   Kawhi for Westbrook straight up please. "
This is completely 100% serious. They blow up the team. They're not going to be able to keep PG. His comments about the off-season were even less assuring then his comments he gave to Pacer fans before he decided to leave. Melo gives you nothing but you're stuck with him.  I think you trade away Steven Adams and Russell Westbrook for a king's Ransom. With where they are right now in their careers you could get three to four or maybe even 5 picks between the two of them. They are not winning with the squad they have currently.
Nobody can build a team based style like that as long as Russell is there.  It's just not possible.  Your best laid offensive play ends when Westbrook decides to launch a fuck you 3 with 30% chance to go in.  Westbrook is the system.     This team is on a rough trajectory. Stuck with Melo for another year.  Big contract for Westbrook as his athleticism starts to wane.  Couldn't see another star want to come join WB after melo leaves.
Russell Westbrook inspired Oladipo but he also limited him. Oladipo is showing that he can strive as a leader.
"They quit. I've been saying it all over this sub. They gave up man. Some combination of the coaches, Russ, and management decided it was OK for Russ to continue to get a 33% usage rate with two other superstars on the team. I'd quit too. Russell Westbrook ain't LeBron, no matter how much he wants to be. "
Russell Westbrook with wins.
"Russell Westbrook is soft, cranky, and a bad teammate.   /u/DylanisWavy"
"Of course they aren’t. You think Russell Westbrook just started acting like that when he got to the nba? That’s part of his character, he’s probably been acting like that his whole life. I didn’t see anyone else acting like that, which tells you it’s not the grand stage that makes a person act that way. Look I respect Westbrook’s game a lot, but he’s a hothead, and a douchebag. He’s the type that is really talented but such an asshole that you don’t even want to be on his team even if he wins you games. Now I see what KD was on about. Sorry you have to be a thunder fan, my man."
"I don’t need to play pro sports. You know when you play a pickup basketball game, there’s that one guy that argues every call and gets way too aggressive during the game? That’s Russell Westbrook. "
because russell westbrook is a bad teammate and a cancer to any hopes your team has to winning an NBA Championship.

Who is the most overrated player in the league and why is it Russell Westbrook?
"For whatever it's worth, I hated OKC in 2012 because everybody was rooting for them even those don't know basketball aka bandwagon fans but Russell Westbrook made me change my mind about the team.  When you have a player like him that shows full effort, albeit inefficient, you have the main guy you need. He exerts too much emotion that shows he cares. Which is the exact opposite of Kawhi and DRose who have poker faces, it leads me to think they don't care much at all."
"All you blog boys, it does count for shit when it's Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook trying to double you and you still get the gamewinner off. If somebody's forcing you left while defending, that tends to make you less efficient than you are with your right, and you can't pass your way out of some situations so even if this is not statistically backed up you just can't ignore the vastly higher variety of finishes that Kyrie has, which unsettle defenders and make them bite on more of his fakes."
"It seems like underrating the sheer amount of talent the Thunder have had on their team is a common theme year in, year out. Personally, I think their Iso-centric nature of their scheme and their stars make it easy to forget. In ~10 years they've had:  Shaun Livingston  Jeff Green  Nate Robinson  Kevin Martin  Thabo Sefolosha  Caron Butler  Jeremy Lamb  Lance Thomas  Reggie Jackson  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Serge Ibaka  Dion Waiters  Enes Kanter  Domantas Sabonis  Victor Oladipo  Doug McDermott  Taj Gibson  Patrick Patterson  Camerlo Anthony  Paul Goerge  That's 21 names. They range from MVPs (Durant, Harden), to MVP canidates (Anthony, George, Oladipo), to DPOYs (Ibaka) to guys who have played pivotal roles on championship teams (Livingston, Butler*), to guys who have taken over months/entire playoff series (Green, Robinson, Jackson), to guys who have/had a legit place in the league and been meaningful, positive, multi-year contributors with other teams.  Literally none of them played their best basketball with the Thunder. You can pull some stats, or point out who won awards and where, but even in the case of Durant and his MVP season, it's impossible to argue that he's playing worse basketball with the Warriors than he did with the Thunder.  The supporting cast around Westbrook has been insane, absolutely insane during his time with the team. You can blame coaching and scheme all you want, but it's clear that Westbrook only wants to play basketball one certain style, and it's no conducive to getting the most of of his stud supporting cast. The only guy in his time with the team that has played the best basketball of his career with Russell is Corey Brewer on a 24 game sample size. Everybody else has been an inefficient, shell of themselves, who ~80% of them time bounce right back to who they were before they arrived in OKC once they're shipped out of town.  So yeah, Melo was rough this season, Playoff P was a no show outside of Game 1, and Patrick Patterson could've get it going all season. History says that all them of them will have more gas in the tank than expected once they're no longer playing with Russ  ---  *Butler was injured for the 2011 Mavericks playoff run."
"Next up on Mike and Mike, I'll tell you why Russell Westbrook is joining the GOP"
"I'm not pushing anything.  I'm filling in parts you've omitted in your bias diatribe to add context.  I'm OK calling Westbrook an amazing athlete, arguably one of the most the NBA has ever seen.  He's a leader in triple doubles, in turnovers, in FGA... but a leader who manages the game, and plays winning team basketball... he is not.  Stats don't mean a lot to Superstars.  They mean A LOT to Westbrook.  Awards don't mean a lot to Superstars.  They mean A LOT to Westbrook.  Awards and stats don't mean a lot to Superstars, because Superstars don't need those things to feel appreciated or to get respect.  But if you're looking for a straw man narrative, I can recycle one for you:  Russell Westbrick - the MVMe.  "
Oladipo's performance tonight looked like he went to the Russell Westbrook school of how to play basketball good and do other things too. I don't see how Dipo having a surge once he got a starting role somewhere is proof of Russ being a bad teammate. 
"Fan puts a camera in front of Russell Westbrook and he goes after him.  Fan puts a camera in front of Donovan Mitchell, and he guarantees a win and backs it up."
"&gt; today Sabonis put up 19 and Oladipo had 28  And literally everyone recongnizes that they both became better players after leaving, yes. Especially Oladipo. Don't pretend like the dude didn't lose 20lbs and impprove in every aspect after leaving OKC, he's barely the same player.   &gt;The Thunder offence is literally just run a pnr for Russ, run a pnr for pg  Which, like you yourself just said, isn't Russ's fault. He's not the guy with the clipboard and our coaching is garbage. Yes, Russell Westbrook makes bad decisions on the court sometimes, but if you pass t to Melo or PG 10 times in a row and neither of them are scoring, how do you want Westbrook to magically make them better?   If you pass someone the ball and they have an open look and miss, that's not on the person who passed them the ball. This loss was not Westbrook's fault. "
in what world does russell westbrook need to take 19 3's?
"Point guard used to be the position that got the rest of the team going: organising offense, decision making, ball movement, make the team play together etc.  Russell Westbrook is the point guard, but he's very bad in exactly these things.  People play worse when they arrive at OKC and better when they leave again.  I don't think it makes Westbrook a bad player.  He's got speed, skill, physicality of an all time great.  He's got the stats (even when we deduct the padding).  But he shouldn't be the leader, point guard of the team.  He should play next to a real, traditional point guard who decides when Westbrook can make his plays.   The chaos at the end today, the poor shot selection... that shouldn't happen.  Now it's almost a lottery: he takes bizarre decisions and if he makes them (which happens a lot because he's good) he's a god.  And when he doesn't he's a bust.  And on overage his stats are poor."
"The Thunder are the most successful tank job ever. They were the 6ers before the 6ers and just knocked so many picks out of the ballpark that they couldn't stay bad for that long. But otherwise, the model was pretty identical with them trading away all vets for any picks they could get and absorbing bad contracts for picks.  But yeah, losing Durant took them out of contention, and they could have just blown it up and rebuilt. I'm not sure any GM though would have done that... Maybe Danny Ainge.  Westbrook is 29 now though. I wouldn't at all be surprised if the Thunder move him with in the next 18 months. If George leaves, there's a reasonable chance he's gone this summer. Players that play with Russell's aggression and are reliant on athetlicism rather than BBIQ to succeed don't last very long. In fact, Russell has already outlasted most of the guys I can think of with similar games.  Baron Davis, Steve Francis, Stephon Marbury, Derrick Rose... all these guys were pretty deeply declined by their late 20s if not earlier."
Russell Westbrook ball doesn't seem to work. Better try it again next year anyways.
"Ladies and Gentlemen, the Russell Westbrook experience."
That moment when you’re calling out Russell Westbrook for amount of shots taken and then realize over the series he only averaged 3 shot attempts more than PG and only 1 more than Harden and shot .5% less than PG and 1% less than harden...And then you realize you’re a dumbass and  don’t really understand what you’re talking about ...
Playoff P....2-14 with 5 points in an elimination game    Carmelo Anthony 3-7  Russell Westbrook taking 43 shots  What the fuck went on in Oklahoma 
More to the point when are they going to start giving out T's and $$$ fines for players who are shooting and flopping trying to  look for a foul call. Not to name any names Russell Westbrook....
"Donovan Mitchell, a Rookie in his FIRST Playoff series outplayed Russell Westbrook, the reigning MVP."
If you're going to suggest moving the freaking team you better have more evidence than Russell Westbrook taking a swing at a guy holding a cell phone too close to his face.
"It's going to be hard to shake this narrative from his career overview.  Some players get a reputation for things, unfairly most of the time. Harden's was ""doesn't play defense"", LeBron's was ""not clutch"". Once something like that sticks it's incredibly hard to change public perception of your game. But I think Russell has to shoot to stay in these type of games. People differ to him a lot, so it creates disruptions in their offensive flow a lot of times, and he feels like he has too. Sometimes it works out others it doesn't. I don't think people should be hard on him for shooting this much, people praise Kobe to this day for the exact same mentality, sometimes to the team's detriment.  If Westbrook hadn't tried that hard imagine what this score would have been. People would have said not aggressive enough otherwise"

Russell Westbrook reminds me of Mike Tyson so much

(I agree with his reaction there) I honestly think in Westbrook's case it was just the energy in our stadium is electric. When you have as much pressure on you as Westbrook does and you hear 20000 people screaming their lungs out happy that you didn't live up to expectations then your gonna be pissed.

Does that mean all Utah fans are terrible and all other fans are great? Absolutely not. But there does appear to be somewhat of a trend here. "
"At least one, but only because I showed her all the cat and dog gifs.  I actually thought some people might see the name Russell and think Russell Westbrook.  I guess my biggest mistake was assuming that large numbers of people on /r/nba had historical knowledge of basketball beyond 2003."
"At the end of the day it's popularity and how that translates to shoes and merchandise sales. All those guys are on a different level than Kawhi and anyone else in Jordan brand.

Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony: $5 million each, Nike (Jordan)  Some of these are outdated (like Westbrook who signed a big deal last summer) and are pretty old contracts so they may not be great comparison numbers but I would say he's somewhere in the Lillard to PG range as far as marketability goes. He's getting offered PG money essentially (4yr/$22m). I think he COULD get more but he'd likely have to get away from Nike."
Because he's secretly Russell Westbrook.
Because skill set matters.  Otherwise you’d probably take a young prime Ginobili over Russell Westbrook

"Oh it's the same thing I was just too lazy to type out their respective percentages. I don't mean to imply Curry is last or something he's definitely not that's why I left the link.  Anyways so yeah, Curry has a 14% career turnover % and Lebron and CP are at 13%. The difference is Lebron and CP handle the ball a ton and generate a ton of assists. Curry mostly plays off-ball and does not do a lot of direct playmaking and yet has a higher turnover % than these guys.  If you look at playoffs career among active players Curry gets near 15% and Lebron is still around 13% as is CP.   |Rank|Player|TOV%| |:-|:-|:-| |67.|Kendrick Perkins|24.25| |66.|Mario Chalmers|17.28| |65.|Dwight Howard|16.71| |64.|Rajon Rondo|16.37| |63.|Shaun Livingston|16.26| |62.|Draymond Green|16.23| |60.|Joakim Noah|15.68| |61.|Devin Harris|15.68| |59.|Tyson Chandler|15.67| |58.|Manu Ginobili|15.37| |57.|Kyle Lowry|15.09| |56.|James Harden|14.98| |55.|**Stephen Curry**|14.97| |54.|Paul George|14.63| |53.|Tony Allen|14.62| |52.|DeAndre Jordan|14.48| |51.|Richard Jefferson|14.20| |50.|Lance Stephenson|14.15| |49.|Dwyane Wade|13.94| |48.|Marcin Gortat|13.78| |47.|Russell Westbrook|13.75| |46.|Jeff Teague|13.67| |45.|Nene Hilario|13.66| |44.|Nick Collison|13.52| |43.|Andre Iguodala|13.36| |42.|Derrick Rose|13.22| |41.|Tony Parker|13.15| |40.|Josh Smith|13.08| |39.|**Chris Paul**|13.07| |38.|Udonis Haslem|12.92| |36.|Thabo Sefolosha|12.52| |37.|**LeBron James**|12.52| |35.|Paul Millsap|12.37| |34.|George Hill|12.10| |33.|David West|11.96| |32.|Al Horford|11.91| |31.|Tristan Thompson|11.86| |30.|Kevin Durant|11.80|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/tov_pct_active_p.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#stats_active_p_tov_pct) Generated 5/3/2018.

" I completely agree he's played like trash for the better part of three years, he tore up his knee and is trying to hold onto the past with diminished athleticism and is playing like he has something to prove. Bad combination. but I think Westbrook is a huge part of the problem. Russell is one of my favorites, but his mamba mentality of being involved in every posession really screws up their pace.  The way they all play ball dominant at once makes them all have to force their shots.  They all iso and just stand there the bench hardly gets the ball and the only assists are kickouts off a drive. Literally looks like a bad 2k player. Anyway I think this is a wake up call for Melo and he's going to come back meaner than before,  all he needs is more post work a patient shot tempo, and to at least jog to the other sideline on offense now and then and he's there.

For all his shortcomings, Russ is the Thunder's only hope, and when you have a player that talented you have to either blow everything up or move heaven and earth to enable him to succeed. There is no middle path."
"I mean, Russell Westbrook often leads the nba in assists but no one would say he is good for OKC’s ball movement "
You're asking me to create another player that isn't Russell Westbrook lol. 
"Lebron puts up these stats on shook teams who choke in the playoffs, the fact you find this so impressive in a game the Raptors did their best to give away, and they did, isn't impressive at all to me.  Stat whores will find a way to get stats, see Russell Westbrook the past two seasons. If Lebron gets one game in the Finals, presuming he makes it, that would be impressive for the shit roster he has that he helped build."
"I wish Donovan would just run his Florida Gators offense. Seriously this 1 on 1 ISO bullshit has gone too far. His gators offense consisted ball movement and a lot of player motion and heavy point guard slashing, which (surprise!), would be good for a team with Russell Westbrook.  "
Something something Russell Westbrook.
Thunder - Russell Fucking Westbrook and Billy Donovan too. Playoff P 
"Lebron ""Russell Westbrook"" James "
Russell Westbrook
"The team isn't Russell Westbrook, the team are the OKC Thunder. PG, Melo, and the coach dropped the ball. "
"Because I read, I'm an nba fan and know how Russell Westbrook plays basketball. Pretty funny that I called his play for the series without even watching the games. "
"The assist numbers are a) inflated by pace and style, b) inflated by possessions. Both Kobe and MJ played in the triangle, which is notorious for leading to low individual assist totals. Kobe played in the league at its slowest in the modern era.  Are you going to tell me Russell Westbrook is a better playmaker than them as well?  &gt; The eye test doesn't lie  Implying you've actually watched Kobe or MJ and aren't just looking at BBREF  &gt;The testimonials don't lie  Which ones?"
They also had Russell Westbrook rated better than Anthony Davis  Fat L on that one.
"It isn’t very productive to take the word of a few fans and apply it to a whole fan base. Obviously the best years were 2012 and 2013 before PBev injured Westbrook.   And - obviously management knew we wouldn’t be winning a title last year, but if you have a player like Russell Westbrook already on the roster, you re-sign him. It’s pretty simple. The entire point of tanking would be to gain a superstar. The idea was to use him as a core piece to surround with other stars. Obviously, it failed, but the PG and Melo trades were considered steals at the time. "
Russell Westbrook does the same thing. Lane violations are not called often. 
"I think it was Zach Lowe who said that everybody who leaves a Russell Westbrook team improves and he isn't wrong. Russ is a fantastic player, but he seems really difficult to coach and also play with."
"Thunder forward Paul George yelled out, “Here I go! Here I go.” Bricklayer Carmelo Anthony gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Russell Westbrook yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before George hit the locker room door, former Thunder great Kevin Durant hugged him and said, “You can’t win with those cats.”"
"the only thing (to me) about the Paul George trade that threw me off was the denial OKC was in. It was clear they did not want to lose any big names to free agency after Durant left, but they've put themselves in the same position again. The dude had done more than just hint at wanting to play for the Lakers. He had one year left on his deal. You had one year to convince him that Russell Westbrook + Melo were more attractive to play for than not only his hometown, but overall a more storied/publicized franchise &amp; an overall more exciting place to live. I haven't been to either town (and I'm from Sacramento so I know the feeling) but I'm picking LA as a place to live 100 times out of 100, at least over OKC and Indiana. &amp; Los Angeles as a city is overrated as fuck.  They only gave themselves one season to try to convince him. Why not try to obtain other big stars who have somewhat of a history of loyalty, and/or a contract with more longevity."
If you’re talking guys who’ve had bad situations with injuries/contracts and now have unrealistic expectations   JR Smith  Derrick rose  Lance Stephenson  Carmelo Anthony  Tristan Thompson    But if you’re talking just All-Anti Team as in hated players (in this sub)  Russell Westbrook  Harden Kevin Durant  Lance Stephenson  Zaza  
Russell Westbrook. It's funny how seriously he takes everything yet shows up to the arena dressed like a damn peacock. 
"Oklahoma, in its ~10 year regime, has hosted lineups containing:  - Kevin Durant - Russell Westbrook - James Harden - Steven Adams - Paul George - Victor Oladipo - Carmelo Anthony - Serge Ibaka - Andre Roberson - Domantas Sabonis - Enes Kanter  I cannot fucking believe this team never won a championship. It's unfathomable that, in a 10 year span, a franchise so remarkably stacked never experienced the sheer bliss of a championship. Confetti raining among a thousand cheers, an entire city rejoicing in unison, lingering joy for a full offseason- it should've all belonged to the Thunder. At least more than once. "
"Yes Carmelo is older and not as good as he was but nonetheless he’s still a star! He’s on a team with Russell Westbrook, obviously his stats are going to regress even more than they should. If you think Carmelo isn’t still a star hop off basketball and go to soccer :)"
"&gt;The Thunder are 1-4 in playoffs games when Russell Westbrook scores more than 40 points.   &gt;OKC is 2-11 in playoff games when Westbrook has more than 27 field goal attempts.  &gt;Only 2 times in NBA history has a player ever taken more than 42 FGs in a playoff game.  &gt;&gt;Both were Russell Westbrook and the Thunder are 0-2 in those games.  &gt;4-18 4th quarter shooting last year in an elimination game  &gt;Career 30% 3 point shooter firing 30 footers in crunch time of an elimination game  &gt;Ricky Rubio getting a triple double being guarded by the MVP  &gt;5-17 game 3 -25 for the game  &gt;13 TOs, 12 assists in games 3 &amp; 4"
"Russell Westbrook can only play 1 way, it doesn’t matter who the coach is or what system you implement.  Edit - lol at the downvotes, you Westbrook apologists are delusional. The guy is the most stubborn player in the league. He has always played the same way regardless of teammates and he’s going to be 30 next year. You really think he’s going to change for anyone?"
I think we’re learning this playoffs that even stars play better in a system where they share more. Imagine Russell Westbrook on the Celtics or Jazz.
"Well aren't the Thunder hyped up, trading away a superstar for another Superstar who leaves the next year.  Don't worry, Russell Westbrook is averaging a triple-double!!!"
it’s almost like this has been turned into the defense of Russell Westbrook sub. nobody can point out how virtually everyone is better when they leave Russ without being downvoted or called an idiot. 
He played sidekick role to the reigning MVP in Russell Westbrook. He won't do the same for Oladipo. 
Westbrook is also really efficient: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/  
"Couple of notes:  *  Forgot to mention in the title, but this is only for the winners of the first round. *  LeBron, to no one's surprise, is the leader in this analysis by far. *  The Pelicans and the Sixers were the most ""balanced"" teams, as in there was not one player who consistently was scoring much more than the others. The Pelicans had Jrue Holiday and Nikola Mirotic go off in games, and the Sixers had JJ Redick, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, and Dario Saric score a bunch as well. *  I didn't really know who to pick as the ""star player"" for the Celtics, so I just went with Jaylen Brown. *  Here are some other notable players, as well as players NOT from winning teams, and their percentages:   Russell Westbrook: 28.99%, Joel Embiid: 16.56%, Giannis Antetokounmpo: 25.25%, Al Horford: 17.70%  "
"You'd be surprised, before this season people thought there was a chance PG would want to stay on a team led by fucking Russell Westbrook (lol). "

"Kawhi is an all time great, however, a shoe endorsement rests entirely on his marketability and personality. Unfortunately for him, he is not very outspoken. He is not a great personality, and that doesn't sell shoes.  It's much easier for Russell Westbrook or Carmelo Anthony, even with their flaws, to sell shoes just because they are more outspoken. It's the reality."

I get the strangest suspicion that you don’t like Oklahoma or Russell Westbrook
"It'll be okay buddy. Paul George, Carmelo Anthony will leave you this year Russell Westbrook will leave you next year and you'll never return to prominence again without drafting players you got before the franchise moved to a god forsaken place like Oklahoma. But hey at least you'll get one more season of watching Russell Westbrook bum rush the hoop and chuck up midrange shots and not have the foggiest idea how to play team basketball."
"Look at the Wilt vs Bill, Wilt vs everyone else stats. There's plenty of stuff written about how that was part of the gameplan. Make Wilt less efficient than usual, and let him shoot like crazy with Bill defending him.  Those 60s celtics came up with a lot of the foundations of the basic strategies in todays game.  In 40 years, someone might look at Westbrooks stats for this year's playoffs and think ""man WB did was the GOAT, look at all those points"".  Except they lost, and UTA was fine with WB going full Westbrook.  Context matters for this stuff. It's why people who watched the games back then always choose Russell over Wilt, and only those of us reading up on history want to favor Wilt over Russell because of the stats we read, without all the proper context.  "
costume designer russell westbrook lmao
"Has Lin done any of the stuff you claimed he would've done since leaving the Knicks?   Did Carmelos ego ruin Amares health?  Is Feltons weight problem a product of Carmelos ego?  Did Carmelos ego stop the Nugs from making the playoffs every year he was there?  Did the Thunder make the playoffs despite Carmelos ego.  Did Carmelos ego prevent Russell Westbrook from shooting 43 times?  All you've articulated is that when the Knicks had talent and coaching they did well. When they didnt, they did poorly.  None of that has to do with ego. This is a laughable garbage attempt at a hatchet job. Trash post."
i think there is no question to that. Lebron is only interested in mooching off  teammates stats so he can build a stats legacy. he was trying to average that per game triple double but failed.  anybody 2nd tier star can do 27/7/7 given the number of touches and opportunities that lebron is demanding. Russell Westbrook has proven that.
Whenever thinking of barber shop what-if scenarios one of my favorite is Russell Westbrook with a savant (hell even good) coach. Look at what Brad Stevens has done with Terry Rozier in Boston and go ahead and salivate at how good Westbrook might be given an elite coach
I made eye contact walking by Russell Westbrook once... Dude looks angry all the time I didn't even wanna bother him
"I wonder if this was a marketing thing, although idk if I want a Jazz superfan as my attorney.  &gt;King also pointed out to the judge that the defense attorney in the case was all right with extending the filing deadline.  Probably would've been less embarrassing to go with ""Clerical error"" or perhaps ""Technical issues in transmitting the filing"" as opposed to a multi-paragraph report on how much you love the Jazz and how Russell Westbrook ruined your night."
He's dressed like Russell Westbrook trying to go undercover at Frankston Centrelink. 
&gt;r/nba an ode to the OKC Thunder what a mf blunder. a trash year to say the least melo should've stayed east pg hates being here the lakers are what okc fans fear russell westbrook looks like a sandwich averaging 5 turnovers again is his niche steven adams says mate melo puts up 3 points shooting 1/8 mods aren sleep my ass is stuffed with a thick ass cock billy donovan got fucked over cuz his daddy donovan mitchell bent him over the thunder will go 37-45 next year sam presti eyes look like that of a dear  Saves
[Russell Westbrook looks like a sandwich ](https://streamable.com/sg39z) 
Ill say it now and ill say it again. Russell Westbrook is a team killer. His own team. 
"They are totally disorganized. You attempted to answer my argument in response to Lebron by saying that it wasn’t an answer to Westbrook. Lol.  60 is an arbitrary cutoff that isn’t required for MVP. You basically need at least 2 superstars to win 60 games. Neither Harden nor Westbrook could have achieved that, so just give Westbrook the MVP? Get the fuck out of here, man.  Kareem winning an MVP over 40 years ago when there were only 18 teams and no three point line is not a precedent for Russell fucking Westbrook in the modern NBA. Lmao."
Marcus Smart is a tough dude and a crucial member of NBA Ninja Turtles team which also includes Russell Westbrook and Rajon Rondo
[Here's the link for quick reference](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23364202/zach-lowe-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-nba)
I can't think of any dumber comparison than comparing John Stockton to Russell Westbrook
"Are you really cherrypicking one article to try to convince me that KOC is a better writer than Zach Lowe?  As if this wasnt already Zach Lowes [second](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23364202/zach-lowe-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-nba) article of the day?  Listen, its not like Zach Lowe is even my favorite writer.  But its obvious who KOC is trying to be, and hes coming up short.  Id love if KOC did his own thing instead of completely copying someone elses style.   &gt;I'd highly suggest you actually read him before attempting to make claims that his is just a 2nd-rate version of another writer.  As I told you already, I have.  Ive given him multiple shots.  His analysis is lazy, his conclusions are usually hyperbole that is disproved in a weeks time, and his articles are usually pure clickbait.  Man, ive never met a KOC stan like this.  And it seems like you post mostly theringer.com articles.  Did Ringer employee Kevin Durant teach KOC how to have a burner account?"
"I'm not sure if Harden should have won last year, but literally anyone other than Russell Westbrook should have won.  Of course I can argue Harden this year.  Hes going to win specifically because his team got more wins because a top 3 point guard was added to his team.   LeBron lost a top 15 player, had the most useless and toxic player in the league on his team for 20 games at a 30% Usg%, had to put up with Derrick Rose for half a season, had a complete overhaul of the team mid-season, lost Kevin Love for 40 games, had one of the most efficient and best statistical years of his career, and still managed to win the same amount of games as the previous season.  Context matters.  Its a shame the media made up there minds in November simply because they messed up by not giving it to Harden last year."
PG - Russell Westbrook  SG - JJ Redick  SF - CJ Miles  PF - Paul George  C- Steven Adams
What? If he wanted not to be the system maybe he should do something. Cant blame the coach for Russell either sitting at the top of the key or in the corner bent over with his hands on his knees. You don't need a system to know how to move or the coach to tell you that. As a professional off-ball movement should be clear as day.   But for Westbrook its not. Without the ball he stops and dont do shit. Why? And how is that Billys fault?  I dont think hes a great coach but coaching Wbrook seems like a  horrible experience
"is it supposed to say ""(Russell Westbrook Lowlights)"" in the video title?  Bootum, we caught you slipping"
"&gt; Russell tried over and over again to let other players shine  While he allowed other players to shoot, his intentional lack of off-ball movement would stifle any iso scorer. He will only move off-ball if he is 100% going to get the ball and refuses to be a decoy for his teammates. If Westbrook doesn't drastically improve his shot selection and off-ball movement there is a good chance the Thunder never make it out of the first round for the rest of Westbrook's career."
&gt; the team played horribly  [Could it have been the fact that Russ shot 38% from the field for the entire month of November?](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook)
"Agree with this 100&amp;#37;. It's the same thing though. Everyone always wants to absolve Russell of any and all blame. Melo is the new scapegoat along with Donovan.   Westbrook didn't try over and over and over to let other players shine. He gave up the ball earlier at times and he shot less. But what else did he do to create offense? Did he screen for those players? No. Did he float to open areas on the floor? No. Did he cut hard to the rim without the ball? No.   Passing the ball with 18 seconds left on the shot clock \(GASP\) and standing like a statue watching the rest of the offense isn't sacrifice.   He will KEEP going back to last seasons form over and over and over again. This isn't only because of teammates or system. It's because he's only impactful with the ball in his hands on the offensive end of the floor. And man, oh, man how impactful that is. Problem is, that type of ball domination isn't ever going to give you consistent results. Westbrook hasn't figured that out yet and at this point in his career, I'm not sure that he ever will. "
Harden is good but he is no Russell Westbrook 
"It’s common sense.  If I didn’t bring up Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka, then I must obviously be talking about PLAYING for the Sonics instead of being drafted and wearing it once for a photo shoot."
[Yes they did] (https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=russell+westbrook+sonics+jersey&amp;client=ms-unknown&amp;prmd=sinv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiClfzfiZrbAhWoAcAKHZqsBYIQ_AUIEigC&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=560#imgrc=1KdyBMuaHT5xBM:)
If we’re talking next year it’ll be Anthony Davis if DeMarcus Cousins leaves or it’ll Russell Westbrook if Paul George leaves. If we’re talking like a young guy who’ll average 30ppg one day it’ll be Devin Booker without a doubt. 
By your logic is Russell Westbrook better than LeBron today?
Russell Westbrook Supersonics jersey has to be up there
Hard to need to score 40+ when you play alongside Russell Westbrook and Steph Curry. 
"It's definitely worthy of a discussion.   You could argue for all of these guys on the original top 50 list to have had better careers: Jordan, Kareem, Russell, Julius Erving, Wilt, Shaq, Magic, West, Karl Malone, Moses Malone, Bob Cousy, Hakeem, Bird, Havlicek, Pettit, Oscar Robertson, Elgin Baylor, David Robinson, Rick Barry, John Stockton, Barkley, Pippen, Gervin, Ewing, Isiah Thomas, Clyde Drexler, Parish and Worthy.   And since then, you can make the same argument with these more recent players: LeBron, Duncan, Kobe, KG, Dirk, Wade, Payton, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Dwight Howard, Jason Kidd, Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, Curry, Westbrook, McGrady, Harden and Carmelo.   He may be in the top 50, but it's definitely super close. And I even left out Schayes, Mikan, Sharman, Hayes, Frazier, Sam Jones, Willis Reed, Hal Greer, Cowens, Cunningham, Arizin, Lucas, Archibald, Bill Walton, Maravich, Bing, Thurmond, Unseld, Earl Montoe and Lenny Wilkens who were all on the 1997 top fifty list. "
Russell Westbrook  Paul George  Steven Adams  Andre Roberson  Jerami Grant  Terrance Ferguson
"There's an argument to be made that it helps not having any other standouts on the team, except maybe Kevin Love.   For instance, Russell Westbrook started averaging a triple double after KD left. It isn't that he instantly got better, it's being the sole carry gives you more opportunities.   With that being said, Lebron is one of the GOATs and you're right, people just expect these performances from him."
"You're making the same mistake that stat whores make.  Look at individual games in the playoffs rather than taking the average.    Just because Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double for an entire season, will you make the argument that Russell Westbrook had a triple double every game?  No, right?  Okay, then I rest my case."
"Great scene in Westbrook basketball camp. Russell Westbrook was FaceTiming his son, Kevin Durant. He asked to see Bradley Beal. Someone brought the phone over to Bradley and he said “great camp.” Bradley responded, “Not me, that was your Dad!"""

Russell Westbrook is the greatest basketball player of all time
"It's just that he makes it so personal. Russilo is a big Russ critic but it's always a specific basketball criticism. Simmons and Cowherd take it to this level of ""Well if you like Russell Westbrook then you must not be smart."""
"Thread as in comment thread. It was clearly a separate conversation from what OP posted about. It happens all the time on Reddit.  Oh my god. I’m not even deflecting anything. I’m literally adding Harden and CP3 along with other players that whine. OKC fans get so fucking defensive about Russ it’s ridiculous. He was the MVP and you’ve been a guaranteed playoff team for nearly a decade now. Seriously, chill. Just because someone talks about Russell Westbrook doesn’t mean they’re always saying something negative. Me and another person were having a fun conversation and joking around about a few players. That’s all."
This game took a turn when Marcus Smart came in and destroyed four possessions in a couple of minutes jacking up long range shots early in the shot clock. Boston was moving the ball around well and he completely disrupted that.   He has a real Russell Westbrook mentality to him. 
Westbrook is smart st least off the floor. He graduated with honors in high school and got a partial academic scholarship at Stanford.  https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/242007/russell-westbrook-was-offered-partial-academic-scholarship-by-stanford
"My mistake, he is eligible for a contract similar to the supermax.  https://www.si.com/nba/2017/06/30/nba-free-agency-2017-supermax-clippers-rockets-chris-paul-russell-westbrook"
Probably because he [doesn't watch film](https://247sports.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/Bolt/Russell-Westbrook-says-he-doesnt-watch-film-49028616)
"Magic, Bird, Bill, Wilt, Duncan, Shaq, and Hakeem.   Magic has said it multiple times, kobe is the greatest player to wear the Lakers Jersey. His word Carrie's a little more weight then the people around here.   Bird - kobe dominated longer. I've never seen anyone use longevity as a way to bring down a player as much as I've seen it used on kobe.   Bill - Bill dominated his era. If you value ranking players on how they did in their era apposed to how players did in other eras then that's fine by me.   Wilt - so Russell Westbrook gets shot on for stat padding but we put wilt on the top 10 list? No doubt he was great but his stats never really equaled championships. I'm taking kobe over him easily.   Duncan - I watched the majority of both of these guys careers. I never once heard anyone claim that Duncan was better then kobe up until kobe started getting injured. Call me biased but I'm taking kobe, and he has a winning record against Duncan in the playoffs  Shaq - greatest peak ever. I have no issue putting him over kobe  Hakeem - probably my second favorite player ever. When it comes to skill hes probably better but when it came to winning basketball games kobe was better. No issue putting him over kobe.  Edit - at least comment on why you disagree."
"really? because i watched russell westbrook shoot 29% in the 4th quarter of an entire playoff series just last year against a much worse defensive team than the reigning champion warriors.  but hey, you do you."

So did fucking Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook is much worse. He proves some guys are in the league off athleticism rather than having any BBIQ
Russell Westbrook stealing his rebounds of course 
" This is like when he was in OKC, KD defended Russell Westbrook from the media.  He loved Russ so much, and the media were making up stories. "
"He’s not top 10-15.  In no particular order: Jordan, Lebron, KAJ, Wilt, Magic, Bird, Russell, Shaq, Hakeem, Duncan, Kobe, David Robinson, Bob Petit, Moses Malone, Chuck, KG, Dr.J, Isiah Thomas, Stockton, Malone, KD, and Steph are all better than him and there’s probably more that I’m missing.  Sorry, but averaging a triple double while you continue to flame out early in the playoffs or miss the playoffs entirely doesn’t mean anything.  Ask Westbrook.  If KAJ hadn’t dragged him to a ring (18 ppg in 37 minutes per game on .486 from the field.  Any superstar today would be shot at center court for those numbers.), he’d be a footnote in basketball history.  "
"Jordan would be like Russell Westbrook in this era with less passing. lots of attacking the rim and pull up 2s. I think he would score a lot but he wouldn't be unquestionably best player in league. The thing that everyone forgets is how depth has changed, there are.just so many good to great players now. The 90s had dozens of players who were totally worthless, that s part of the reason scoring was so much lower. the role players were shit. "
"They legit have to be stupid. In regards to his skill level, some dumbass on Facebook said LeBron is not that good because of the then 2-0 Celtics lead. There's also a guy named Marcus on Facebook that comments on nearly every NBA post whether it's about LeBron or not. He just says that LeBron is trash, he'll never be Jordan, and that Russell Westbrook is by far the best player in the league. "
"Russell Westbrook is not a great shooter and he dominates. Even though he is not the most efficient, he is still considered a superstar. MJ was bigger, longer and more skilled than Russell. I think people exaggerate with how crowded the paint gets or even zone defense. Remember MJ was a phenomenal help defender and would score a plethora of points in transition too. If guys like Demar Derozan can average like 28 (I think he did that last season), then Jordan def averaging 40 in his prime in this era. "
It's funny how this thread immed. turned into a Russell Westbrook debate.
"russell westbrook, i mean come on."
"I get that, I do.   But if a person averages a triple double for the season -- say Russell Westbrook, you can say that they're expected to get a triple double without it being semantically incorrect. Even though they'll only get a triple double about half the time. "
PG - Russell Westbrook  SG - Paul George  SF - Kevin Durant  PF - Serge Ibaka  C - Steven Adams
"If Russell Westbrook is the best player on a team, the ceiling potential is low as fuck, man will never win a ring unless he’s coming off the bench of a good team. He can make a shit team good, but he can’t make a good team great"
KD also let his true feelings slip out and did [this](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/04/23/kevin-durant-likes-instragam-comment-russell-westbrook-problem)  PG going to the Lakers is a lifestyle and career move - he wants to be the man in Hollywood and all the perks that come with it than be 2nd fiddle to WB's heroball in OKC.

"He had no interest in it. There were a few times where he said he would do it, mostly because everyone ask him to do it, but in the end he never signed up for it. It is fine that he doesn't do it, but he never realized the consequence of it. Because Lebron didn't enter the dunk contest, neither did the other stars, like Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, Russell Westbrook, Demar DeRozan, Durant, Harden, Giannis, Kawhi, etc. Instead, you get decades of guys like Nate Robinson, Zach Lavine, Gerald Green, and a bunch of mediocre stars. The only 2 stars in the last 15 years that entered the dunk contest were Blake Griffin and Dwight Howard. "
Did you not watch the video and see him guarding MVP level Russell Westbrook?  Have you watched him play at all?
"Oladipo is due for a major regression next year.   Players don’t just get better and better. If John Wall continually got better he would be Michael Jordan by now, but he’s just Discount Russell Westbrook thats just as expensive as Russell Westbrook. "
"Here's Doncic, at age 17, blowing by NBA All-Star Victor Oladipo.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRJBeaez-94#t=1m45s  Go to the beginning of the video and you'll see him guarding Russell Westbrook."
"Full disclosure I was all about the Beasley hype and was full of hot takes around 08 saying things like ""how the hell could anybody see Derrick Rose play and Beasley and be like nah I want Derrick Rose"" lmao   I thought his floor was an efficient scoring machine who could get you the easiest looking 20-25 points a night for you at worst. I've never been so wrong on a player lol   08 in general is the worst I've ever whiffed on a class. Loved OJ Mayo and Jerryd Bayless thought Russell Westbrook was a bad reach etc lol just whiffed on every draft take that year"
MVP doesn't mean best player. What this award really means is what Luka did at his age was more exceptional than performances of other MVP candidates. Doncic is not the best player skill or performance wise but he is the MVP. This is the Westbrook vs Lebron situation. Everyone knows Russell is nowhere near as great as Lebron but he was the sensation that year and that what MVP means or can mean. Doncic simply had more to handle at a very young age than other candidates who are objectively better players right now.

Curry and Klay when they get hot.  Lebron   Donovan Mitchell is also electric   Russell Westbrook because of his unworldly motor and athleticism   Greek freak 
"Im saying Russell Westbrook who will make 350 million in nba money till he is 34 which accounting for taxes is really 150-175 million,  throw in 250 million from Jordan/endorsements, which is 125 million after taxes,  So you are telling you think Russell Westbrook will make 725 million after tax in his life?  But i guess your caveat that its being invested so well, oh do they also spend zero dollars, don't think spending 10,000 dollars on every outfit you wear once is gonna help get you gain 750 million regardless of investing "
Team Shoulda Woulda Coulda   Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Serge Ibaka  Steven Adams 
"Derrick Rose was meant to be who Russell Westbrook is. Russell Westbrook was meant to be who Patrick Beverley is. Careers end up in funny places, especially in the NBA."
Lonzo ball had a better 3 point percentage than Russell westbrook
"Russell Westbrook, at least he says he compares his game to him because he has a similar frame."
"Because one is a superstar player that has had the ability to impact his team's system for several years. The other is under 20. Russell Westbrook should have an immense amount of control over his shot selection, whereas Doncic should have fairly little.   Edit: Not saying Westbrook isn't, by necessity of being a superstar, forced into taking bailout shots. I'm saying that his poor shot selection extends beyond what I consider necessary poor shots."
Russell Westbrook is still an insane talent. I’d take him.
Wow goodbye Russell Westbrook 
did you watch him in college? he’s Russell Westbrook without the athleticism. just a bad chucker. 
"&gt;**much more efficient** in transition when Westbrook grabs the board, as opposed to Adams  citation needed  https://www.pbpstats.com/possession-finder?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamId=1610612760&amp;OffDef=Offense&amp;StartType=OffMissedFG&amp;TimeType=StartTime&amp;ReboundPlayerId=201566  Russell Westbrook rebound: 1.23 points per possession  https://www.pbpstats.com/possession-finder?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamId=1610612760&amp;OffDef=Offense&amp;StartType=OffMissedFG&amp;TimeType=StartTime&amp;ReboundPlayerId=203500  Steven Adams rebound: 1.19 points per possession    That's a 0.04 difference, and we *do* expect long rebounds by guards to lead to more transition opportunities. Cancelling out the occasional long rebound, looks like it's basically the same.   -  Now, imagine if Westbrook wasn't positioning himself for a rebound during the times when Adams actually got the rebound. *That* would have been deadly."
"The only other all star that shoots 42% is Russell Westbrook  and look how well he's doing, trust me, Devin booker wouldn't be my first offer but these ISO ball low field goal percentage shooting guards are a thing of the past"
Russell Westbrook. They will destroy him and call him a team killer and loser 
"Your argument is weak.  You're discrediting Simmons because he has a better supporting cast, which I agree - he does. But the NBA doesn't work like the NFL, a good NBA player doesn't need a good QB to perform well. In fact, their numbers are usually better - look at Russell Westbrook without Durant, the dude won the MVP.   Just check the numbers dude, Simmons' numbers were actually better with Embiid (the Sixers' best player) off the floor."
"Isn't really a fair comparison, PG is a more important position than SG. So ultimately if I were starting a franchise today and I had the options of these two guys it would be Simmons, and it's not even close. Simmons has a largely better defensive presence, is an amazing facilitator (dude has a Magic Johnson-like pass every game), and he scored 15.8 ppg without shooting the ball. He would easily score 20 points per game, if he wanted - but that's not how he wants to play. He isn't a Russell Westbrook-esque ball hog player, and it made the Sixers more exciting because of it.  Booker's a solid SG, but his only real attribute is scoring, on a bad Suns team where he is their only option to score. He averages 19.5 shot attempts per game, trailing only Russell Westbrook and James Harden.. so it would be pretty weird if he didn't score a lot of points. But with the NBA, PPG is the holy grail - so I can see why people would say Booker. "
The Russell Westbrook syndrome.
"&gt; so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.  Fam. My heart..."
Neither would win a title though. You can't win a title with Russell Westbrook as your best player. 
I personally wouldn’t take Westbrook over Stevens. I think if you traded let’s say Terry Rozier and Brad Stevens for Russell Westbrook this current thunder team would have a much better shot at a championship than they did this year.  The rest of the top 15-20 I agree with except maybe John Wall
"&gt;LeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.  you're funny but I hate you"
"That’s fair, but evaluating how Young is going to do based on how he did against NCAA opponents may not be the most prudent way to examine him as a prospect. Despite how he did in college which, giving credit where it’s due - was extremely impactful, this is about how he’ll do in the NBA against athletic monsters like Russell Westbrook or Eric Bledsoe.  There are plenty of players even those with size that look great in college, but don’t display the skills or physical tools to succeed in the NBA."
"&gt; OKC Thunder  &gt;LeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.  Lol. This better work."
"""LeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player. ""  most savage yet accurate one of them all!"
"I think that a lineup of   PG: Russell Westbrook  SG: Andrew Wiggins  SF: Carmelo Anthony  PF: Ben Simmons  C: Dwight Howard  would look pretty great on paper, but all these guys want to dominate the ball and there isn't a ton of floor spacing"
Russell Westbrook   DeMar DeRozan  Andrew Wiggins  LaMarcus Aldridge   DeMarcus Cousins  That's 4 all stars and tons of big namss......and yet they wouldn't be any kind of real title contender despite all the big names
"&gt; play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.  Tough but fair"
"&gt;OKC Thunder &gt; &gt;LeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook &gt;for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.  You did us dirty man! "
"&gt;OKC Thunder  &gt;LeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.  Goddamn that is brutal"
"This is AMAZING. I haven't laughed this hard in ages, and I laughed at almost every single team.  My favorite ones: &gt;LeBron realizes the mistake, but shrugs his shoulders and signs with the Nets instead, because he will have the same results with either the Knicks or Nets.  &gt; LeBron loves space. He will sign with the Rockets so he can go to NASA and fly an actual rocket into space to find better competition on other planets. Mike Dan Tony will be confused why LeBron doesn’t show up to their games. Mike, he’s in space, deal with it.  &gt; LeBron loves pace. He will sign with the Pacers so he can out-pace the other NBA players and win a championship. He will also become best friends with Lance Stephenson and the two will call out plays to each other by blowing in each other’s rear, I mean ear.  &gt; LeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.  &gt; LeBron will sign with the Raptors just to check up on them and make sure they are ok. "
"I remember back when this sub hit 250k followers and thinking it was really getting big then. Or even further back the  LeBron decision to return Cleveland being one of the top scoring posts in Reddit history - to this date it's still on page 3 of r/nba's all time list despite 5x growth of the sub and all the algorithm changes, which is a testament to its incredible impact on the league and fanbase.     You're absolutely right about the toxic, reactionary, and hive-minded nature of the sub now. I won't go as far to blame the influx of casuals since that's a bit elitist, but things have gotten bad. Every single post-game thread and discussion is now filled with:     * parroting lazy sports-talk radio narrative shit like: ""Boston is amazing because Danny Ainge is a genius GM and Brad Stevens is master coach,"" ""Raptors suck because of the trash bros and a Casio calculator could outcoach Casey,"" ""Russell Westbrook is inefficient garbage,"" ""KD is a snek for going to the Warriors""        This type of polarizing, negative, and simplistic garbage is so stupid. I've stopped bothering to respond no      matter how much it gets me riled up.       * idiotic hot takes. I saw someone claiming Jayson Tatum will be better than Paul Pierce. Are you fucking joking? Did you even watch PP play? I'm not a fan of his and he thinks he's better than he actually was (like on LeBron's level lol), but he was one of the best players in the league and to claim a rookie will surpass him is completely unfounded.        * immature and uninspired memes that nonetheless get reposted over and over. One of my favorite things about this subreddit was the it managed to achieve a near-perfect balance of humor and thoughtful discussion without either becoming a no-fun-zone like r/nfl or uncontrolled chaos like other forums.         Even looking back at the LeBron's Coming Home thread there were hilarious posts by novelty accounts, well-      reasoned commentary by others, and lots of earnest positivity. The humor was always simple, but I feel like it's      only gotten more immature and mean-spirited as the sub has grown over the years. not to mention the      increasingly prevalent copypasta text walls that are low effort and meaningless.     &amp;nbsp;  The post-game thread for Celtics/Cavs Game 2 was absolutely toxic and epitomized so many things that are wrong with the sub now. I think both the shift in both content and tone that accompanied the huge growth in users are by far the biggest causes. I miss the older sub. The detailed analysis might never reach the front page like it used to do, but the posters here would do better to have less polarized and simplistic views on the league and its players. It's not about shitting on the teams or players that you hate and making life miserable for those other fans/reveling in their misery, but rather celebrating your own team's success and enjoying the season as it goes along.     I hope people can realize that again.      "
healthy Russell Westbrook is the best comparison for injured Derrick Rose
"Russell Westbrook who had a 13.1 BPM in the playoffs last year? lol  I'm a big fan of advanced stats. But when someone cites PER and Win Shares they obviosuly don't know what they mean. Harden adjusted plus minus stats are also higher than Durant's atm but the sample is so small that I don't think there is much point in using them.   Again, can you tell me why Harden's BPM is higher than Durant's? Have you looked at the formula? Do you understand what BPM is trying to estimate? Or are you just blindly copying and pasting basketball reference?  "
You got it all wrong. Russell Westbrook is the best comparison for healthy Derrick Rose. 
"I see, all advanced stats are now meaningless and useless... only box score totals matter.  Excuse me while I go anoint 2017 Russell Westbrook as the greatest playoff performer of all time."
Trevor Booker and Kirk Hinrich had a faster sprint time than John Wall  [https://www.bulletsforever.com/2015/3/13/8208939/john\-wall\-fastest\-player\-nba\-russell\-westbrook\-40\-yard\-dash](https://www.bulletsforever.com/2015/3/13/8208939/john-wall-fastest-player-nba-russell-westbrook-40-yard-dash)
Colin Sexton for Russell Westbrook 
"He was usually top 10 and for around a decade was always at least debatably top 10.  I'd say Chris Paul, James Harden, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Giannis, at a *minimum* are all ""superstars."" Some years it's more. Some less. But it's pretty rare for only 5 guys to deserve that title."
Made Russell Westbrook and James Harden better. Serge Ibaka too.

"Westbrook is a volume shooter(a mediocre one at that, that gives the appearance of being a good rebounder because his teammates box out players to make sure that he gets the rebound and his coach’s game plan seems to be oriented around padding Westbrook’s stats and not winning. No, I don’t love Russell Westbrook."
Nobody wants to go to San Antonio dude. KD made the best choice for his career. Played in the NBA 10 years without a championship. On that OKC with terrible coaching and a guy like Russell Westbrook who clearly has mental issues.

"Russell Westbrook gets a *shitload* of both those is he more selfless than Steven Adams? The selfless guys are the ones that do well on the non-box-score stuff, not the stat padders. Selflessness in basketball is setting good screens and boxing out for rebounds because they don't show up in many stats and help your team win."
LeBron is just Russell Westbrook with male pattern baldness 
Yeah it's scary. although John Wall and Russell Westbrook will make $40+ at the end of their deals.   Meanwhile Kemba Walker's playing for $12M and not generating much interest either.
My goodness Morris thinks he's Russell Westbrook. The man has never passed up a shot.
"Yeah having an all time great team definitely had nothing to do with ratings, it's all because of cool nicknames and Russell Westbrook  Seriously how do you get this delusional?"
You can be a ball hog and still rack up assists. Dribbling for 20 seconds and then passing only when there's an assist in it for you is ball hog 101. Ask Russell Westbrook.
"Okay, I'll play.  * Literally everyone that knows the game of basketball will say your opinion is shit if you think LeBron is a better shooter than Bird. You can take that to the bank. In a time where the average NBA 3pt% ranged between 25-32%, Bird still finished at 37.6% and was the original founding member of the 50-40-90 club something that LeBron has zero chance in hell at ever making. Heck, even though the game has become completely 3pt oriented, LeBron makes only 34.4% of his 3pt attempts... oh, wait, is that... LOWER than Bird's 37.6%?? Why, yes it is! Bird also led the league in FT% 4 times... LeBron has shot higher than 80% zero times, his career high is 78%, whereas Larry's career average is 88.6%, while LBJ is a career 73.9% free throw shooter. That's subpar, especially for such a talent like LBJ.  * For one, LeBron has never had a 40-20 game whereas Larry has. LeBron has never came close to a quadruple double. Larry refused to enter back into a game in the 4th quarter despite being 1 stl shy of a quadruple double.  * Bird averaged 10reb/gm despite playing alongside a HOF center and HOF power forward. LeBron has never come close to averaging 10reb/gm. This season was actually his closest at 8.6/gm... Bird, while being a slow, decrepit 34yr old still managed to average 8.5/gm in the 91 season, which was his WORST rebounding season ever. Also, for a guy that's not known for defense, he averages a tick more steals (1.7 to 1.6) and the same amount of blocks (0.8 to 0.8) as LeBron (James is the much better defender though but that's not what we're arguing).  * So I guess we're just talking stats? That must mean James Harden is a better defender than Klay Thompson because he averages more stl+blk. That means Russell Westbrook is a better passer than LeBron James because LeBron has never averaged 10ast/gm. That means Marcus F'n Smart is a better 3pt shooter than Larry Bird because Smart makes more than 1 3pter per game?  What else do you got, troll?"
"You don’t watch basketball, or you’d know that Durant operates primarily off the ball in OKC to accommodate for ball dominant guards in Russell Westbrook and James Harden. If OKC has dedicated every possession to going through KD, those two wouldn’t have developed into the stars they’ve become.   LeBron had an all world team in Miami and they failed to meet expectations. He tried again in Cleveland, and is again failing to meet expectations. "
"What did they expect Durant to do? They had Russell Westbrook and that's it. I had to do what I wanted to do... er, I mean... What *he* wanted to do that was best for *his* career, not mine. I'm not KD."
I call it the Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook makes sense
"LeBron ""Russell Westbrook"" James "
"&gt; He left the thunder, which had Westbrook, a top 5PG and overall top 15 or 10 player in the league, and James harden.   &gt; I don't think he ever had an all-star teammate in that time, but kd had Russell Westbrook and James harden! This guy literally was on a team with 3 mvp players and they couldn't win or come close in the finals with the that squad.   Jesus Christ. Did you just start watching the NBA yesterday? The team of KD, Westbrook, Harden and Ibaka made the finals and only lost to  primed Lebron, Wade and Bosh. It was the Thunder who decided to blow up that team instead of just paying Harden/Ibaka what they deserved.  None of you people whining about KD can even recall what happened a few seasons ago yet you seem to know for sure what KD's legacy will be years from now. I find that incredible."
"23 out of the possible 56 teams have had 4 HOFs or more.    Teams with 4 HOFs or more facing teams with 3 or less are 10-4 in that time.    4 times have both contending teams have had at least 4 HOFs. These numbers aren’t included in the second stat.   I would argue that parity and dynasties don’t go hand in hand. And although there have only been a couple dynasties according to the win/loss column, so many of these teams in this list have been as dominant at their time, if not more, than the Warriors are now. And they all added a piece to get to their peak.   Here is a list of every finals since 1980 that I put together.

"The important thing to remember is that Westbrook isn't 90% of players, he's Russell Westbrook. If you were to make a list of most talented players in the nba and he wasn't bar the top of the list you'd be a damn fool, but it feels like he wastes that when he doesn't move off ball, takes possessions off on defense and repeatedly jacks up bad 3's. "

"So you think he should've stayed in OKC with stat-padding Russell ""open shot? nah, I need that assist"" Westbrook?"
"Dude is quite literally a top 3 player who went from his original team in OKC where they were a game away from beating GS to joining them in the summer essentially breaking any sense of competitiveness in the NBA didnt even tell his ""best friend"" Russell Westbrook he snaked out of OKC and joined a team that held the record for most wins in an NBA season without him."
"&gt; He did put in his dues.  Then what are you complaining for? You think he should've stayed in OKC with Russell ""get out of the way, that's my rebound"" Westbrook until one of them got traded?"
"He took twice as many field goals as anyone else on his team and posted the second worst +/-.  51 TS% is not good at all.  Lebron has the ability to post big numbers and still have a bad game.   I dunno man, he looked pretty tired to me.  Makes sense, he's had to carry this team.   What is a good game for Russell Westbrook?  Stats?  I'm not a fan of his at all, probably not the right guy to talk with for that. "
"Regardless of his efficiency being less than its usual ridiculously high standard, you're telling me that 33/10/11 isn't a good game? I don't know what to tell you mate. By that logic, Russell Westbrook has had about 5 good games for his whole career"
"He already ruined his legacy by having burner acocunts, having his mom go on sports center to defend him from all the 'haters' after they won their first ring (or second one).   He left the thunder, which had Westbrook, a top 5PG and overall top 15 or 10 player in the league, and James harden. When lebron left, Dan Gilbert and co wouldn't get him anything help after staying for I believe 7 seasons. I don't think he ever had an all-star teammate in that time, but kd had Russell Westbrook and James harden! This guy literally was on a team with 3 mvp players and they couldn't win or come close in the finals with the that squad. They even lost 4-1 to Memphis in the 2nd round lmao. Ibaka was also a solid player when he was with that squad.   Even if KD returns to OKC, no one respects him for what he did, joining the historically best team. He can't bring them a ring bc OKC is in a salary cap disaster with melo, and it's a tad better if they could trade him. He didn't see his window to winclosing; he was 26 when he joined the warriors, and has been playing his prime at GSW. He got tired of losing and jumped shipped. LeBron returned, brought a hard fought championship, and enhanced his game to a god-like level. These two guy's legacy are like an inverse relationship both off and on the court as players and relations with the fanbase. "
".... I mean he’s 22 and has two hall of famers on the court with him. Probably didn’t know it at the time, but still.   Idk how you compare LeBron and KDs decision. One went to join one of his best friends since he joined the league (Dwayne wade) on a 40 win team, and left a Cavs team where Mo Williams was the next best talent on the court.   The other had Russell Westbrook and a prime Serge Ibaka, was up 3-1 against a defending champion / 73 win team and choked it. And in the off-season went to join that 73 win team, because he needed “validation”.   A guy that had been to the NBA finals twice, was named MVP, needed validation. Stop comparing the two decisions.   Until LeBron goes to join a team that had 70+ wins and was down 1-3 to him in a playoff series, the decisions aren’t even close. "
Curry shooting fuck you threes in the dying seconds is the opposite of Russell Westbrook stat padding in garbage time.
Ain't nobody winning with Russell Westbrook on their team. One of the most overrated players of all time. Put Russell Westbrook on LeBron's early Cavs teams and they still get eliminated before the finals. 
"LeBron wouldn't take a back seat to Kobe and Kobe would'nt have been good for LeBron. Kobe destroyed Dwight Howard. In Kobe's last season he played iso defence on LeBron in the all-star game to prove that he could d up LeBron ( https://youtu.be/7Tfq3V6C5dA ). As the video goes on Kobe gets more aggressive trying to get LeBron  to go at him. Kobe was too competitive to take on another superstar as a teammate again.  The Celtics players hated LeBron, don't you remember Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce hating Ray Allen for joining the Heat. He never would've played on that Celtics team, never.  He picked the heat with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh because he liked those guys as friends, and they should've been able to beat any team in the league in 7 games series. If Wade hadn't declined so rapidly, they maybe could've won 3 in 4 years.  The Heat were the best decision for LeBron. The Lakers or Celtics wouldn't have worked. On the the other side KD likes and gets along with the warriors players, like LeBron with the heat players. Plus, KD didn't seem to be getting along with/like playing with Russell Westbrook anymore.  It just happened that the best team was also a group of guys he liked and the team that could pay him something fair. They both did what made the most sense."
"I give LeBron all the credit in the world.  He was smart for doing that.  My problem is KD getting shit on for doing it.  Both were smart moves.  From KD's perspective, why should he have to watch LeBron go to the finals every year while Russell Westbrook pisses his prime away.  Cut out the middle man and meet LeBron in the finals every year."
And he wore Russell Westbrook pants because he knew he was going to get a triple double. LeBron is LeNextLevel   
Russell Westbrook.... you can’t win with him. He won’t ever see a conference finals now 
"Lmao he played with Russell ""Triple Double Chaser"" Westbrook. No wonder he wanted out."

Russell Westbrook III is an American professional basketball player for the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association. 
"Imagine you and a good friend(Russell Westbrook and KD) have been bullied by 3 big kids who live in a rich neighborhood(Klay Thompson,Steph Curry,Draymond Green/a little bit of Iguodala in reality but for the story I’ll stick with 3)  These bullies are the toughest kids in the town and all of a sudden you and your good friend are whipping their asses, ok?   But then they get back up and whip your asses til you lose the fight all together( or what usually will end the fight in your eyes). Then the next day your friend leaves you and your neighborhood for the bullies and the rich neighborhood you were just beating up on and had a chance to win against. The civilians(us as fans) make memes and laugh at you guys until the Bullies get their asses kicked by another group they almost won against( Lebron, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love). Now they are the meme. It’s all fun  and great. What a wonderful time we live in.   The civilians would’ve respected the good friend if he moved to DC, or Boston( for example lol). But the town sees him as a traitor because he moved to the rich neighborhood. And now you all get to watch as the kid who left you and your neighborhood , and his group of new friends just terrorize the town lol.   Hope that makes it somewhat clear of the recent story"
and don't forget he had to play with russell westbrook

*Russell Westbrook likes this post*
Of the top ten I think he is the most likely to bust. Smaller player and game predicated on attacking the basket. Always looks to score. Streaky shooting. Not really a fan tbh. He plays with great passion though. I think he will be a worse Russell Westbrook which isn't really what I'm looking for.
"I honestly think the bigger aspect of him moving was a desire to not have to be the number one option for once in his life. Having Steph as the known commodity going in, he was a presumptive #2, where he was still pressured to be #1 with Russell Westbrook at OKC. When they were losing that pressure was still directed at him and not Russ at the time. "
"You really think if a player hasn't made an All Star team by the time they're 23 then they never will? The guy Randle is most often compared to, Draymond Green, didn't make an All Star team until he was 25. Also, [there's this:](https://twitter.com/TommyBeer/status/1004375125775605760)  &gt;Julius Randle was one of just five players to average at least 19 points, 9 rebounds and 3 assists over the final 41 games of the 2017-18 season.  &gt;The other four were: LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo.  &gt;Randle was the only one to shoot &gt; 55%"
"Yeah, if you're going to ignore the facts and act like you know what a guy's intentions are while you're watching him play basketball from hundreds of miles away then there's no point.  You're blinded by the narrative.  EDIT: You can ""prove"" anything you want by taking single plays out of the context of a full game.  Russell Westbrook is the greatest defender on Earth, here's five good defensive plays he has made.  Stephen Curry is a selfish chucker, look at these bad shots he took when he had other options.  It's nonsense."
Did you miss the second half of my comment entirely? I love OKC. It brings me great pride to finally have a team from my home state  edit: that's why I'm a Cleveland bandwagon flair. My normal flair is OKC: Russell Westbrook
"Kind of a loaded question, but to me, personally, watching LeBron has been more entertaining because I've just never seen someone who's 6'8"", 275lbs do the stuff he does and move the way he does.  Jordan was still a lot of fun to watch, too, but very similar to Kobe Bryant.  The most *fun* I've had, though, is watching Russell Westbrook in person.  He's just an unbelievable athlete.  Edit: MJ was hands down a better dunker than LeBron, though.  I wish LeBron would dunk more often with authority with his size and strength, like Shaq or Dwight Howard.  His dunks, while certainly impressive and flashy, always seem to end with a really clean ""ploop"" of the ball through the rim, rather than a Westbrook/Vince Carter/Darryl Dawkins/Shaq/Dwight ""power"" dunk.  MJ didn't dunk with power a ton, but his moves, smoothness, hangtime, and vertical made them sensational.  LeBron's too big to sorta ""softly"" dunk it through the rim.  Kill the rim like Westbrook, man."
Lebron.. Russell Westbrook has literally given up free points to stat pad. That's horrible.

"&gt; Imagine a player like russell westbrook who was as efficient as KD.  Damn, that is a great way of putting it"
*russell westbrook pointing at a fan gif*
"&gt;It wasn't as bad, it was bad. KD was still far, far worse. People underplay KD a lot. What he did is still mind boggling. What respectable, competitive athlete would leave their #2 team, for the #1 record breaking stacked team that beat them?   Given what that team had Russell Westbrook,I can understand. "
"There are a lot of people here who obviously didn't see much Jordan. MJ was much more about dominating the other team, getting in the paint and stuffing the ball in the rim. Basically MJ was more about his own personal physical and athletic gifts. Lebron, though he is much bigger, is more of a finesse player. He has much more in common with Larry Bird and Magic than MJ. LBJ is trying to make his team beat the other team by making the right play, whether it means passing to a teammate for the final shot or taking it himself. MJ was more about *he* was personally going to beat you. So, in a sense, LBJ plays a more cerebral game than MJ.  But I will say, people on reddit probably don't fully appreciate what Jordan was. He was so physically dominating. Imagine a player like russell westbrook who was as efficient as KD. That guy was Jordan -- and his Bulls teams were just as intimidating as the 73 win warriors. You just felt like your team had no hope even before the game started. "
"45-23=22   Lebron James has 2 sons  22/2=11  Lebron James won MVP in the 2010 season, AKA ‘10  11-10=1    Last season’s MVP Russell Westbrook set a record for triple doubles in a season. A triple double means you have at least 10 of 3 stat types in a single game.   3 sets of tens  The Golden State Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals"

"your first two sentences contradict each other.  how is someone shut down if they go 9/11?  I don't think Adams can carry them to a win, but if someone is shooting that well, even if it is dunks or layups, i would try to get them more touches.  I said Melo was trash.  Again, Melo shot better than Westbrook, George was both good and bad, thats what I said in my first post, although he did have 8 assists and played way better defense than Westbrook who had 5 assists and 5 To's.    Donovan does know how to coach, he ran a good offensive system at Florida, was lauded for his tactics against Golden State.  Maybe the players on the floor bear some responsibility.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2018-nba-western-conference-first-round-jazz-vs-thunder.html  edit for formatting.  look up the stats if you want.  Westbrook was outplayed by Mitchell and Mubio.  George was inconsistent but just as good as Russ according to most stats( i don't know how to format from Bball ref so i linked the page.).  Will you blame the coaching when PG leaves?  I don't.  having played ball all my life I would never want to play with someone who uses 40% of all the possessions or shoots 40 plus times a game.    I don't care if you disagree, you are totally entitled to your opinion.  My opinion is Russell Westbrook plays Low IQ, selfish basketball and players might publicly say they like him, but will not want to play alongside him in the long run.   "
"&gt; You’re entire point is that the fact that a few outliers exist  I never said anything close to that. You thought I was talking specifically about Russell Westbrook, and I gave you another example.  It's not about their credit, it's about using defensive rebounds as one of the elements in the equation to measure defensive prowess.   In the hypothetical scenario I provided, both fictional players are the exact same at defense (steals, blocks, and even the intangibles like switching correctly), but because one of them rebounds more than the other because of the way their respective teams handle the start of fast breaks, he's going to be considered better at it when using this formula.

"The Westbrook actually hurts his team narrative has gone way too far, ya'll need to put some respeck on his name.  The man is a surefire hall of fame who made the finals at age 23 beating kobe, dirk, and the spurs.  Led the league in scoring twice and in assists once.  If Donovan mitchell is ever as good as russell westbrook that is a huge success, and thats not even a knock on mitchell, the kid is amazing but Russ is an all time great.  MVP russ dragged a team of bonafide scrubs to the playoffs.  He had to play selfishly on that team because literally no one else could do anything with the ball in their hands, oladipo hadn't gone super saiyan yet.  Donovan is an amazing player who is integral to the jazz's success, but ya'll are sleeping on how good the rest of the jazz are especially rudy gobert if you think donovan mitchell contributes more to winning than westbrook would."

"Dude with Draymond's goon tactics, Durant's snakish history, Klay's man's game bullshit, and Iggy literally quitting on the Nuggets and telling the Warriors he would join them mid series, Golden State doesn't know shit about respect.   To refute your claim though I'll leave these here.  https://www.si.com/nba/2017/10/13/kendrick-perkins-oral-history-celtics-thunder-cavaliers  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kendrick-perkins-says-russell-westbrook-and-kevin-durant-back-on-talking-terms/"
"How... how did you get so far gone?   Does he coast on defense more than a James Harden or a Russell Westbrook?   I’m mostly sure Durant is better than Curry in a vacuum, but I’d take this team with Curry over this team with Durant."
"I was going off eye test, but since you pulled up your suspenders and called me out with advanced stats, I took the liberty to look some stuff up:  MVP Westbrook was inefficient as hell, in fact one of the most inefficient MVPs in the entire history of the NBA at 47% eFG.  His advanced percentages (eFG &amp; TS%) were boosted vs lottery teams in the regular season, you should look that up.  He performed more poorly than 47% eFG vs playoff-level competition.  In addition, Westbrook's 2017 playoff performance was worse than 2018 playoff Mitchell straight up, despite having very similar team compositions (main offensive option surrounded by defensive talent).  Also, you are ignoring context if you think Westbrook's 10 assists and 10 reb are impressive.    9 of those 10 reb were defensive and of players to get anywhere near 10 reb, Westbrook had THE most uncontested ones as well as the biggest share of the 50/50 rebounds, which means teammates were actively helping him pad stats.    Assists?  His % of passes to assists is one of the highest, suggests that he only looks to pass to set up the assist, and when you watch him he does so usually late in the shot clock, ensuring his pass is the final pass.  Westbrook plays selfishly, so I would take DMitch if I want to win games.  &gt; Lmao can't believe this is upvoted.  All you did was try to show **regular season Russell** MVP season &gt; Playoff Mitchell with zero context around opponents.  Even if we go by your own metrics (TS%), playoff Mitchell 2018 &gt; Playoff WB 2017, despite one of them getting superstar treatment at the line."
"Lmao can't believe this is upvoted.   Russell: 31/10/10 on 55%TS   Rookie playoff Mitchell: 24/6/4 on 51%TS    Mitchell shot such shit percentages, but because he's a rookie he was viewed pretty positively (which is fair btw).  To say you'd rather have his rookie playoff self over MVP Westbrook is so dumb though"
"LeBron isn't much of a rebounder like everyone thinks. He just happens to get a lot of defensive rebounds. Same goes with Russell Westbrook and James Harden. All those 'triple double' guys, basically.  The rebound stat in general is overrated and the real stat to look at are contested rebounds."
"Well, he's got maybe 8 seasons left.  5 if he keeps playing this breakneck style, which will likely lead to debilitating injury.  But of those 8, he stays the main figure for maybe another three (33 years old) before OKC gives up on him as designated alpha.  Odds of winning during those coming three seasons?  Not looking good.  Next year?  NO way.  After that, Boston and Philadelphia will be making life hell for everyone.   After OKC, 33 year old one\-track point guard isn't going to be the choice of another franchise looking to get over the top.  franchise looking to sell tickets?  Sure.  Russell is a hell of a show.  Does he win a ring by himself?  Shit, if LeBron can't do it with help, Westbrook sure isn't by himself.  Does he need to change to achieve it?  Uh, yeah.  A LOT.  Great theatre though!  "
"Russell Westbrook will win a NBA championship.  Don't ask me to explain the route that makes it happen, but I think it will."
"Donovan Mitchell, steph curry, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, manu ginobli, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, joe ingles, Russell westbrook!"
"&gt;It's not a supermax - he's *literally* not eligible for one from us.  You keep saying this but you're wrong. It's not the DPE, but he's still eligible for a 5 year deal starting at 35% of the cap, which is what the DPE allows for, so it's basically the same thing. For instance, last year the Warriors and Thunder used the DPE to sign Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook to ""supermax contracts"" for 5 years worth just slightly over $200 million. Chris Paul, due to his age and experience and the Rockets having his Bird rights is eligible to receive exactly the same deal of 5 years and slightly more than $200 million. So it's not the DPE, but it's still a supermax."
"It's not that crazy, shit Russell Westbrook was the MVP last year and wouldn't start on the warriors. "
Russell Westbrook robbed
"How? Compare Curry to his contemporaries, those being Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, even John Wall. He’s comparatively unathletic. There’s nothing wrong with this descriptor. I’ve started to call him NBA’s Tom Brady because of it. He’s dangerous of course, but he isn’t the most athletic of the bunch. "

"Scorer: that doesn’t explain the massive gulf in efficiency.    Ballhandler: there is no objective metric for ballhandling, but that doesn’t mean one can’t be clearly better than the other.  If you’re going to sit there and actually try and contest that Stephen Curry is the better ballhandler, then I have to question your ability to evaluate talent.    Passer: no, I’m telling you that Robertson and Curry are neck and neck in passing when you actually normalize for context.  But I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that a Big O fan thinks box score stats are the most important thing in basketball.  Bet Westbrook jumped into your top 3 after the last two years huh?  And no, you haven’t given me “lots”.  Look back at our conversation.  All you’ve done is idly contradict things I’ve said without raising any actual points about why you think Big O is better.  Seriously.  Find me a time when you replied to me with anything but contradicting my arguments and calling me a homer.  Edit: In fact, I'll do it for you.     First comment: &gt;....do you not know about Stockton and Robertson?  &gt;Because Stockton is at least on par with curry and Robertson is at least a tier above.  &gt;Edit: and what do you know, I’m not alone in my thoughts on this  Here's where you first claim Curry is at least a tier below Robertson.  Second comment:  &gt;I can when we’re comparing players and you bring in team accomplishments and subjective voting metrics in an objective conversation. Lol  &gt;By your logic, Bill Russell is the best player to ever play the game.  Here all you do is contradict what I say without introducing a single argument for Robertson.   Third Comment  &gt;Holy shit you’re a homer that doesn’t know lol.  &gt;I’ll bite: how is Curry a better scorer than Robertson? How is curry a better ball handler? How is curry a better passer?  &gt;Go ahead and provide solid metrics to prove those points that don’t hinge on your opinion lol.  You call me a homer and ask me to explain myself.  Still no points raised.  Next comment:  &gt;Scorer: lol at you ignoring that Oscar didn’t get an extra point opportunity anytime in his career.  &gt;Ball handler: eye test isn’t an objective metric.  &gt;Passer: so you’re telling me Robertson is a better passer even when you do everything you can to discount his stats?  &gt;Also, I’ve given you lots. You just ignore it because Steph is your idol.  Again, just contradicting my arguments and calling me a homer."
"###**2014 1st Round**  Steph Curry - 23-4-8 on 44%  Chris Paul - 17-5-9 on 42%  Blake Griffin - 23-6-4 on 53%  Paul played lesser minutes due to constant foul trouble, having 5 fouls in 3 of 7 games and 4+ fouls in 4 of 7 games.  Paul was individually outplayed by Curry, but thanks to Blake and Deandre leading all players on both teams in PPG RPG BPG and Curry's 2nd-leading scorer Klay Thompson being outscored by Jamal Crawford off the bench in 12 less MPG, he got bailed out by his great supporting cast. That is the only reason the Clippers were even in position to face OKC in the first place.  ###**2014 WCSF**  Russell Westbrook - 28-6-9 on 49% and 50/57 FTs (89%)  Chris Paul - 23-4-12 on 51% and 18/24 FTs (75%)  Westbrook scored way more and way more efficiently as he went to the line more than twice as much, shooting almost 90%. Paul also choked away the eventually deciding Game 5 with his 2 turnovers in the clutch, including on the game winning attempt. He fouled Westbrook on his 3pter, so Russell made 3 FTs to take the lead in the game and the series.  Westbrook outplayed him in the clutch of the crucial swing Game 5, further cementing that Westbrook outplayed him for the series. Had Paul not done that epic choke job, the Clippers would have been up 3-2 with Game 6 in LA. Chris Paul's overrated defense allowed Westbrook to shoot the highest FG% of any series in his career at 49% compared to 39% in Rounds 1 and 3 combined. For someone (undeservedly) praised so highly for his defense, that's inexcusable for Chris Paul.  ###**2015 1st Round** Just like the 2014 1st Round, Blake and Deandre led all player on both teams in PPG RPG BPG and Blake Griffin was the best Clipper in the series. Griffin had +1.4 PPG, +8.5 RPG, and only -0.5 APG in the series compared to Paul.  ###**2015 WCSF**  Griffin led the Clippers to a 1-1 split to steal homecourt without Chris Paul, putting up 30-15-9 on 52% without him in the first 2 games (showing that Paul's passing is not mainly responsible for Griffin's good playoff performances). Deandre had 13-13-3-2-3 on 80% FG without Chris Paul in the first 2 games. They did exactly what they were supposed to without Paul. Blake had 27-12-5 on 56% and Deandre had 14-13 with 2 spg 2 bpg in the series. No excuses about help  Then Chris Paul infamously allowed the Clippers to blow a 3-1 lead  Game 5  - CP3 had 12 points and 4 assists after losing by 15+ - roughly half of his 22-10 stat line were in blowout situations  Game 6  - CP3 had 1-6 FG in the 4th quarter before a garbage time 3 at the buzzer to make it 2-7 FG - His choking in the 4th quarter led to the Clippers blowing a 13-point 4th quarter lead  Game 7  - CP3 had 17 points 3 assists for 3 quarters, losing by 17 at the end of 3 - had 9 points and 7 assists in the 4th when it was already too late, losing by 13 - finished with a deceptive 26-10 stat line when a large chunk of his numbers came when it was too little, too late  Games 5-6-7  - Blake 28-12-3 on 55% - Deandre 12-12 wth 2.3 spg 2.7 bpg  Clippers were 1-1 (0.500) without Paul on the road and 2-3 (0.400) with Paul  Keep in mind the Rockets best perimeter defender Patrick Beverly did not play in this series, but Paul still couldn't beat an undermanned team. No excuse about losing with that stacked help against an injured non-Finalist team.  ###**2017 1st Round**  Paul should have had a big statistical series at the bare minimum considering one of the best defensive players in the league in Rudy Gobert missed 3 of 7 games due to injury, on top of the Jazz's best player Gordon Hayward missing the last 3 quarters of Game 4 due to illness.  Paul had one of the worst Game 7 performances of any star player in history.  Chris Paul, Game 7 vs Jazz   - 2 points on 1/9 FG, 4 ast to 2 TOs in the 2nd half of Game 7 - 0 points on 0/8 FG, 4 ast to 2 TOs after 11:00 mark of 3rd quarter  Chris Paul rarely gets criticism for this, proving that he isn't held to high standards compared to true all-time greats.  "
Are you going to deny that Kobe was an erratic 3pt shooter? There is literally no pattern of consistency to Kobe's shot. He didn't improve his shot from one year to the next. There is a very simple reason Kobe ranks #1 all-time in missed shots: he is the peak of what a player like Russell Westbrook can reach.
"I have a theory that some hate Curry, because he wasn't part of their narrative. It was suppose to be Chris Paul...it was suppose to be Russell Westbrook....it was suppose to be James Harden. When fans think of an NBA , they don't think of a smaller guard with limited athleticism who can shoot well from the floor.  Yes, he had a ""softer"" upbringing than those guys, but coming from a similar background, I see so many kids from privilege who don't know the meaning of discipline or hard work. There are aspects of being an elite athlete that are genetic and some have natural talent. But talent is overrated, the only thing that matters is being willing to adapt and work on your craft. Stephen Curry is an elite player and has shown it time and time again. Ignore his skin tone, body or boyish looks...and focus on the play. "
LeBron  KD  Curry  Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook / James Harden
"He's good on the macro level but he's pretty awful on the micro level. He can get great players and he works with the theory of ""stars win games"" and while that is true, there has to be a level of figuring out how everything will mesh and long term team building that Presti has failed to figure out. His whole mentality is ""make the stars happy and figure out the rest later"". And while it's brought a level of success to OKC in terms of wins and losses, it hasn't led to championships because the little things are never in place to propel the team. If his star player was literally anyone except Russell Westbrook people would accept this theory, but it's way too juicy to blame him and not the fact OKC has never has an great two-way role player in his entire time as GM or that we're ten years into his reign as GM and no one has the slightest idea was his tenets or core principles as a GM are beyond ""well, we've have a lot of really good players here even though it's a small market."" As an organization we're directionless and as a team we're directionless. Really making the 2012 Finals was probably the worst thing for the franchise because every year since has just been constant short term-ism under the guise ""we're in win-now mode""."
Man if he only manages few more boards and assists and pile up on turnovers and making his team mates redundant ball-watching retards he could almost be as good as Russell Westbrook.
Mo Bamba posted a faster 3/4 Sprint than Russell Westbrook
"I reckon my thing is this: I dislike the narrative that these guys are “bums”, and when they lose it’s because “they”, aren’t good enough.   These professionals were all contributing members to their teams before coming to Cleveland. And everyone who remained a CAV post mid season trade, remained so with James’ blessing.    “Go spot up and shoot”, got Russell Westbrook 10 assist per game, but we see how well that worked out for him in the end.  James makes any team that he lands on good-great, but he doesn’t make his individual teammates better. Better stated, A team is better for having him, but he doesn’t make their individual games better.   “He has to do everything”, is often thrown out because his game necessitates that he has the ball all the time. He has to get all of the rebounds because he needs space and can’t have big men In the lane.   I digress  There aren’t many players who have that attribute, so this isn’t a knock. But for the love of Larry Bird, let’s stop treating his teammates as if they were the now defunct Washington Generals...JR Smith aside. "
Wilt Chamberlain and Russell Westbrook.  Imagine someone the size of Wilt being able to move as quick and jump as high and with as much force as Westbrook. oooweee.
Russell Westbrook and Shaq
"Are you sure? If we compare   1. Steph Curry is better than CP3. Steph has: 2 MVPs, 2 rings.  2. Harden and Klay are nearly tied but I’d go with Klay because he is more efficient off ball and is a better defender-overall better two way player while Harden sucks at defense. 3. Lebron edges KD out but KD is a more efficient shooter.  4. Rockets have no answer for Draymond. Capela is no where near Draymond defensively. 5. Bench: Warriors have shooters like McCaw, Jones, Bell, Livingston who can get buckets. Rockets have no real bench which is why Dantoni played 7 people throughout the series. 6. Iso vs ball movement: Warriors have proven that ball movement wins championships ie why they have been to the finals 4 times and have 2 rings. Iso doesn’t work in the current NBA. Ask Russell Westbrook why he struggles in the playoffs despite avg a triple double."
"Guys, guys, guys. You're reading this wrong. He is literally just saying how bad it was to play with Russell Westbrook. Westbrick is a literal cancer my dudes, he makes everyone on his team feel awful about themselves.     Oladipo? Playoffs!   Harden? MVP!   Durant? Multipe titles!     Watch Steven Adams go somewhere else to be a perennial all star   "
"There was a time when KD, Russell Westbrook, and James harden all played on the same team. It could have been the thunder being the team to beat"
Russell Westbrook is someone we consider untouchable. The only way I accept a trade for him is if I'm blown away and this one doesn't do that.
"No, I'm saying stats work when they work and don't when they don't.   Shit passers don't lead the league in assists, they record few assists. See Hassan Whiteside.   Good shooters lead the league in 3-pointers made and are high in 3pt%, shit shooters don't. See: Steph Curry.  Rebounds per game is pretty fucking simple. Doesn't take a genius to know Lebron averaging nearly double digit rebounds in the playoffs is better than Curry sitting at a career high 5.6/game right now.   Shit defenders literally lead the league in the stat you referenced, see: Carlos Boozer. The only reason I even know that is because there was a 3k upvoted post YEARS ago pointing it out.   Ben fucking Simmons was second in the league in defensive win shares this season. *Russell Westbrook* was 4th, is he a way better defender than Curry? I think I know what'd you say to that. Defensive stats are trash.  Get a grip, you know what I meant. Sure, make a strawman and run away, how convincing."
"List of players (loosely) I would rather have for any given game in a vacuum, going by the order of team flairs in the subreddit banner:  Nikola Jokic, Paul Milsap, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, James Harden, Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan,  Marc Gasol, Jimmy Butler, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Boogie Cousins, Jrue Holiday, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, (Devin Booker?), Damian Lillard, Cj McCollum, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kawhai, Rudy Gobert, (Donovan Mitchell?), Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, Kemba Walker, LeBron James, Blake Griffin, Victor Oladipo, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kristaps, Joel Embiid, (Ben Simmons?), DeMar Derozan, Kyle Lowry, John Wall, Bradley Beal.    I'm probably leaving out a few and overrating a few, but he's top 30-40 ish in my mind. That list is a lot longer than I was expecting it to be. "
"If Golden State doesn't exist, he may honestly have 0.  2015: James Harden and Dwight Howard win their first championship with the Houston Rockets over the Cavs, who were missing Kyrie Irving (broken knee cap in game 1 of the finals) and Kevin Love.   2016: Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook win their first championship for the Thunder, joining their former teammate as champions. The Cavs trade Kevin Love for Carmelo Anthony during the summer.  2017: Kawhi Leonard wins the MVP, leads the Spurs to a 60+ win season, and finishes up his dream season without getting cheap shotted by any Georgian players, beating the Thunder in 7 games, delivering the Spurs their first championship without Tim Duncan. The Cavs look much worse i the finals as it appears trading for Carmelo Anthony was a big mistake.  2018: The Thunder, in their 2nd season with Oladipo and Al Horford gel and  win 73 games and go 16-0 in the playoffs. NBA fans say the league is going to be too boring because of the OKC super team.   "
"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy watching great performances as much as the next guy. But I also like the mystery of a new season. Everyone starts off with a fresh slate. Yes, there are teams that you know won't win the championship that year, but at the same time there are a handful of real contenders. But not in the NBA. It's literally the Warriors and no one else. It sort of kills it for me. I think to myself, 'why should I care that LeBron scored 51 in Game 1 of the Finals? The Cavs have no chance. Why should I give a damn the Russell Westbrook just averaged a triple double for the 2nd straight season? It's not like OKC could best Golden State in a 7 game series? I understand the Warriors are great. As much as I may not like them, I'm not delusional. I'm just frustrated that it looks like for the foreseeable future it's not going to matter what any one team or player does, the Warriors will be the team hoisting the trophy at the end of the season."
"&gt;	Isn't that the reason kyrie left? One of the best 1 on 1 finishers in the game didn't like how he had to run almost every play trough LeBron to score.   Kyrie’s usage rate was higher than Lebron’s in his final Cleveland year.  Kyrie left because he did not want to be in Lebron’s shadow, which is fine, but is not some fault of Lebron.  &gt;	The cavs point guard isn't really a point guard because LeBron would rather do it himself.  It is almost as if he is one of the best passers in the game.  &gt;	How can he not have so many points when he has such a high usage rate in the cavs,  Most teams do not have the luxury of multiple transcendent scorers.  A team is typically lucky to uave one, and that one is typically the main scoring option, yes.  &gt;	how can he not get so many assists when he makes it so he gives the final pass.  Wow, someone better bring that up with *basically every dominant passer in the history the league.*  Stockton, Magic, Nash, and Kidd all had it so easy!  &gt;	LeBron basically plays like Russell Westbrook  If Westbrook were a substantially smarter and more effective scorer and floor general, maybe.  Oh, wait, that sounds quite a bit like James Harden, and we have all seem just how much better Lebron at his best is than Harden.  So maybe that “comparison” is just a pointless and lazy one."
Not exactly. I was trying to determine who has carried their team the most so it's basically (players VORP)/(sum of all players on the team VORP). Also I was only looking at players that made the finals.   Although I just looked at the all time single season playoff Vorp list and you can safely say Lebron has 40% of the top seasons. He has 5 of the top 10 and 10 out of the top 25.  * 1.	Tim Duncan	3.52	2003 * 2.	LeBron James	3.37	2018 * 3.	LeBron James	3.21	2012 * 4.	LeBron James	3.15	2016 * 5.	LeBron James	2.95	2009 * 6.

Russell Westbrook becomes my favourite player Everytime I see Kevin Durant
"The post title mentions how it's the hardest anyone has carried a team. I just pointed out how the east is void of really any resistance. Something to consider when pointing out LeBrons stats in the playoffs. I mean everybody talks about how much LeBron has to do on the attacking end to win but they don't mention how wherever he has played he has to have the offense go trough him. Isn't that the reason kyrie left? One of the best 1 on 1 finishers in the game didn't like how he had to run almost every play trough LeBron to score. When he would try and do it himself and he missed he would be crucified for being a ball hog, when he made it and got his, people would keep their mouth shut.  LeBron has to run the offense trough him, his team mates around him are mostly spot up shooters because LeBron is drive and shoot or drive and kick. And if they aren't any shooters around him it's usually defensive players and why is that? Because he doesn't really play defense. With the offensive load he does it would be too tiring to do so.  All these things inflate LeBrons stats, how can he not get so many assists when he makes it so he gives the final pass. The cavs point guard isn't really a point guard because LeBron would rather do it himself.  How can he not have so many points when he has such a high usage rate in the cavs, he basically has the last pass or shot on most possessions.   LeBron basically plays like Russell Westbrook but he's bigger and plays in the considerably weaker east so it's easier for him to win and carry"

"Should the NBA have a revote for the 2017 MVP in case it was a big fluke?  No disrespect to Russell Westbrook, I'm a firm believer that Brodie getting MVP is a huge fluke and robs the Beard of truly accomplishing what their capable of. I've spent the last few months in pure disbelief and it just doesn't make sense to me. I've spent the entire 2017 regular season watching Russ play great basketball it's just not fair.  If Harden loses again I will face that Westbrook deserved the win, but I am just 100% sure it was a fluke and does a big disservice to James Harden and the NBA."
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook. 
"I was born in '88 and I actually think about this exact subject quite a lot. I was/am an undersized \(by NBA standards\) point guard. I played a high level of ball growing up and then topped out in university. I never had a coach that encouraged the 3\-pointer in game, or even ran skill drills from beyond the arc.  Instead, when not running sets, we were in the weight room and there was a high value placed on athleticism. Resistance training and plyometrics were our bread and butter. The goal was to be fast and explosive. A standing 30\+ inch vertical was the expectation. At the time, I recall thinking I was fortunate and that it was a progressive strategy. We had coaches who wanted us to be fast, not necessarily big or tall. It felt like it was challenging the status\-quo.  For me, every game plan and film review revolved around driving through traffic, drawing fouls on the take, drawing in opposing bigs and dishing short passes to our bigs for the finish. As you can imagine, despite being strong, I got hammered in the paint.  Of course, playing this style of ball and relying exclusively on athleticism has resulted in some health complications. I have had serious knee issues over the years: ACL, meniscus, MCL, tendinopathy. I still have a a bit of a difficult time adjusting to how most kids play at my local run: Fast, spread shooters, high pNr with a big.  Looking to the NBA, Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook were the marquee guards taken in what would have been my draft year. Both have had some knee issues and both rely heavily on their athleticism. Obviously they can both still contribute and have an impact, and Westbrook's athleticism has basically ensured he can still get a bucket at will...But they look dated in the modern NBA and it's hard not to imagine they had similar coaching to what I experienced throughout my youth.  All in all, this change is good news for all basketball players going forward. Being able to pepper in the three will surely save some knees, spacing the floor and limiting contact in the paint will save even more joints. It's strange being a 30 year old basketball player and feeling ancient...But I'm happy for the kids. Nice that the game is still progressing."
*TRADE KYRIE FOR RUSSELL WESTBROOK*
"Followed the league for about 15 years. I remember listening to Kobe hit the game-tying three against the Pistons in '04 on the radio when I was in elementary school. IMO the league is as talented and smart as its ever been. The convergence of aging but still incredible LeBron + vets-with-rings like Durant, Curry, Kyrie and Kawhi and young talent like Giannis, KAT, Simmons, Tatum, etc. bodes well for the league. (Not to mention the mid-tier of players like Harden, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, etc.) And for all the talk about pace-and-space, teams do have diverse playing styles: the Rockets are iso-heavy; the Warriors pass a ton; the Spurs shoot midrange jumpers; the Cavs play two big men. The story lines and drama have also evolved tremendously with Twitter, the league valuing player personality and the increased power and intelligence of the player (shorter contracts providing more leverage to demand trades, players more intentionally valuing a team's front office, etc.). I personally really liked the '00's when teams were often one superstar and a bunch of scrubs (Allen Iverson and no one making the 2001 Finals, Paul Pierce making the Conf. Finals with Antoine Walker as his sidekick, KG-Cassell-Spreewell making the Conf. Finals, LeBron and no one making the 2007 Finals), but superteams--though perhaps moderate by our modern standards--generally still won it all (Shaq + Kobe; Duncan + Parker + Manu; Wade + Shaq; KG + Allen + Pierce). The league is truly great right now. "

"Not impossible, just unlikely. Russell Westbrook literally cannot be the best player on a title team. I think LeBron would sooner go to OKC than RWB would ever win a title as best player"
in what way in Lonzo Ball better than Russell Westbrook?
"Heres a complete list, as far as I can remember:  1. 1985-86 Philadelphia 76ers: Bob McAdoo, Moses Malone, Julius Erving, Charles Barkley\* 2. 1981-85 Los Angeles Lakers: Bob McAdoo, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson 3. 2003-04 Los Angeles Lakers: Karl Malone, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant 4. 2009-12 Oklahoma City Thunder: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden\*  \*Malone, Erving, and Barkley also played together during 1984-85.  \*That OKC squad is the first team to have 3 players who eventually become MVP. All the other teams had at least one who had already won the award and was nearing the end of their career."
The narrative that people don’t want to play with Russell Westbrook is stupid.  Gets me downvoted every time 
I am an openly bandwagon Lebron fan. I followed him to Miami andback to Cleveland and I have openly said many times. I don’t want him to go to LA but if he does I will follow and be a fan. If he goes to OKC I will not follow. Because Russell Westbrook is a cancer to the NBA

"He can say that as much as he wants, but I don't think the chemistry between Scott Brooks, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden is really comparable to Popovich, The Big Fundamental, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobli. It takes a lot more than saying you admire Manu Ginobli to think they had a likely chance of emulating one of the most fundamentally-sound, unselfish basketball systems in the history of the NBA."
"Unfortunately for OKC they jumped the gun on trading Harden no matter what, they traded him 16 months before his contract would count against the luxury tax and other problems with salary cap. Essentially the OKC front office not recognizing the financial changes coming for the league led them to breaking up their dynasty unnecessarily.  The following except from this article, https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/section-nba/news/kevin-durant-thunder-vs-warriors-russell-westbrook-james/1tt026yq1lmjj1vh97biyotfwf  -In those 16 months, the average team valuation jumped 30 percent, the president of ESPN said the NBA was a “critical product” for the network and the Kings sold for a then-record $534 million, an 18.6 percent increase on the prior record Warriors sale three years earlier despite being in a small market. Additionally, the league increased its cap estimate for 2014-15 twice during the prior season, from the original $62.5 million that July to $62.9 before the trade deadline to $63.2 in April.  In February 2014, the Thunder and every other team possessed more than enough information to see where the league was headed financially.  While the league’s gigantic national TV contract was not announced until October 2014, the expectation was that the national television contract would double its per-year amount from about $930 million under the prior deal. It ended up almost tripling to a whopping $2.6 billion per season, but even doubling would have meant a massive uptick in the salary cap and luxury tax.  All of this is to say that by the latest that the Thunder could have traded Harden without financial hardship, they would have known about the expanding finances of the league combined with the still-limited contracts of that time. They even could have signed Harden for his maximum without any real fear of long-term implications. With a little maneuvering, they also could have kept Serge Ibaka, the player whose commitment often is used as an explanation for why the Thunder could not afford to keep Harden, without facing down the NBA’s dreaded “repeater tax” for high-spending franchises."
"Too bad Russell ""Triple Double"" Westbrook won it over him last year.  EDIT : His two years as MVP were last season, and this season, but Westbrook avereging a triple double got more votes, so he won't have two years in a row as MVP."
"Who is the better player, Russell Westbrook or Victor Oladipo?"
"Someone made a post in our sub about the gigantic discrepancy between our drafted players and the person who went in the draft just one spot later. Anyone can look back in hindsight and say ""Damn, why didn't we draft Marc Gasol?!"" since he ended up being a star from late in the 2nd round. But it's uncanny how often the *very next pick* ended up being so much better than ours:  2008 3rd pick: Kevin Love -&gt; Russell Westbrook (technically we drafted OJ Mayo and traded for K-Love)  2009 6th pick: Jonny Flynn -&gt; Steph Curry   2009 18th pick: Ty Lawson -&gt; Jeff Teague   2009 45th pick: Nick Calathes -&gt; Danny Green   2010 4th pick: Wes Johnson -&gt; DeMarcus Cousins   2011 2nd pick: Derrick Williams -&gt; Enes Kanter   2012 10th Pick: Traded away in a package for Marko Jaric + Lionel Chambers. That pick turned into Austin Rivers   2013 14th pick: Shabazz Muhammud -&gt; Giannis Antetokounmpo   2013 26th pick: Traded pick -&gt; 1 pick later was Rudy Gobert   2014 40th pick: Glen Robinson III -&gt; Nikola Jokic    Just by keeping our picks and drafting the person immediately after our pick each time, we could have drafted all of the following:  - Westbrook - Curry - Boogie - Giannis - Jokic - Gobert - Teague - Danny Green  It's one thing to look back in hindsight and look at the guys that EVERYONE passed on like Marc Gasol or Nikola Jokic, but it's quite another thing when the very next pick after yours always ends up being some kind of star player while your picks usually bust.  "
"I would bet my house that Gordon Hayward will never outplay Paul George and Russell Westbrook in the same series. Mitchell has the 'it' factor that Hayward never has had, and I'm speaking as a Boston fan."
Lol This feels like solving a murder.   Who profited? Who had the most to gain? Who’s still standing?  *camera pans to Russell Westbrook performing a Pre-game dance routine*
"Paul George, if Russell Westbrook keeps PG in OKC when he was all but assuring he was going to LA in free agency, it is the clear danger of letting shit play out and just hoping things go your way (that the players develop relationships they have a hard time walking away from)."
"The Legendary Sannin, featuring Russell Westbrook as Tsunade, James Harden as Jiraiya, and Kevin Durant as Orochimaru. "
"Steve Blake was our starting point guard.  ""Who he guarding?""  ""Russell Westbrook""  😂....""naw for real, who he guarding fam?"""
Russell Westbrook
"Look. Russell Westbrook is good. He probably would have won a championship if Klay didn’t go crazy in game 7 2016. If Klay had just calmed the fuck down, the view around Russell would be so different. "
[Still 2016-2017 MVP to me](https://m.herosports.com/nba/player-comparison/james-harden-vs-russell-westbrook).  Edit: You have to change the year for both of them to 2016 since it didn’t change for whatever reason.
"its not, if that guys name is Russell Westbrook."
"yes because PG will not just do that with OKC and wait out Melo's contract. Plus he would have Russell Westbrook and Adams with him already.   If PG leaves OKC will be to a team that can contend next year. If the Lakers trade for Khawi I think PG will sign there regardless of LeBron. You would just have to give up Ingram and other assets but a team with Lonzo, PG, Khawi, Randle/Ingram can sway him that way. Or if LeBron teams up with him to sign somewhere. Otherwise, just take the max with OKC and have your own big 3 with RW, Adams and yourself. Plus whatever they can get on trades/FA once Melo is gone. Hell, Im not a melo-believer but if he can at least perform as a decent role player, the thunder can do a deep playoff run and with some luck, finals (OKC's luck would be tragedy for other teams tho).

*[OC] Why Russell Westbrook led to the demise of the Oklahoma City Thunder*
"For the new fan: Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Ante..fuck it i cant spell his name, Paul George, James Harden, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook.   This dude forgot Joe Ingles though."
"Yeah, his main point was ""I'd hate to be paying 35 year old Russell Westbrook $40mil"""
"Russell Westbrook torn meniscus in the 2013 first round... when Beverley tried to steal it as a timeout was being called. Still think we would have played better in 2013 finals had we made it, better than we did in 2012. Could have possibly made it two years in a row (although we would have had to get through the Spurs in 2013 again). A year more of experience for our youngsters to gel, think we could have gotten it done."
"They drafted Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka, and went to the Finals, but now we're going to pretend they were a trash front office all along.  Ok."
Probably Russell Westbrook

Don't you mean Russell Westbrook?   Carmelo took like a third of the shots RW took
You can always pencil in the Russell Westbrook HoF speech for somethin of this nature
"Amount of All nba players that Durant has played with while he was on the team  Russell Westbrook (5x all nba (4x second 1x 1st)) Steph Curry (2x all nba (1x 2nd 1x 3rd)) Realistically 1st team all nba talent both years.  Draymond Green (1x all nba (1x 3rd)) (2016-17 DPOY)  Amount of all nba players lebron has played with:   Wade (3x all nba ( 1x 2nd team, 2x 3rd team) Kyrie Irving (1x all nba, 1x 3rd team)  So durants has had 8 seasons of all nba play alongside him, with a 6 2nd teams, 1 1st team and 2 3rd teams. Realistically Curry would have been first team both of the last two years if not for injury but you could probably make an argument irving might have another all nba season if not for injuries as well.  Lebron has had 4 seasons of all nba play alongside him, 1 2nd team from wade and 3 3rd team all nbas.   Obviously the next argument will be that lebron makes his all stars into role players but Bosh only had one all nba before he joined the heat, he was an all star caliber player but not all nba. Love was an all nba player, but id argue his inability to do other things on the court severely limited his ability to contribute to a winning team where hes not the #1 option"

"Obvious Bait.  But since you asked (Based on the players given for the 2k18 all time teams)  Bucks (Oscar, Moncrief, Allen, Giannis, Kareem)  Bulls (Rose MJ Pippin Rodman Gilmore)  Celtics (Cousy, Havlicek, Pierce, Bird, Russell, and a phenomenal bench)  Heat (Tim Hardaway, Wade, Lebron, Bosh, Alonzo)  Jazz (Stockton, Maravich, Dantley, Malone, Eaton)  Kings (Oscar, Richmond, Peja, Webber, Lucas/Boogie)  Lakers (Magic, West, Kobe, Kareem, Shaq, and a phenomenal bench)  Magic (Penny, Tmac, Hill, Dwight, Shaq)  Nuggets (AI, David Thompson, Alex English, Melo, Mutombo)  Pistons (Isiah, Dumars, Hill, Sheed, Ben Wallace)  Rockets (Harden, Tmac, Drexler, Hakeem, Yao)  Spurs (Parker, Gervin, Kawhi, Duncan, Robinson, +Manu)  OKC/Sonics (Payton, Westbrook, Allen, Durant, Kemp)  Warriors (Steph, Klay, Mullin, Durant, Wilt)  Some of these might be close. Most won't. Nephew begone. "
"You know you have a losing argument when you need to leave out almost all relevant information from the outset. 5 rebounds and 4 assists in 18 minutes (so a 6/10/8 per 36 statline), while successful containing Russell Westbrook multiple times, in a win, is beyond extraordinary for a high school junior."
If he can hit 6’3”ish I bet he’ll be fine. He’ll just wind up being more of a Russell Westbrook type than the freak that Lebron Sr is. 
I love that they're a UCLA couple and Russell and Nina Westbrook are a couple as well. I hope their babies go to UCLA and dominate every sport.
"He dominated the Pistons and Hawks but lost to the Magic who werent nearly as good as some of the teams he’s beat in his other dominant playoff runs. Obviously he was amazing but he was more Russell Westbrook (with efficiency) than the measured player he is now that can dictate the tempo and flow of the game better, in addition to adding a post game.  Gimme 2016 or even 2015 LBJ Finals runs over this 2009 performance no matter how individually impressive it was."
"Westbrooks last year was 38. On a team with two other all stars. Three points higher than *LeBron*. The thunder will never be successful with Russell Westbrook at the helm, book it. "
"Warriors and Rockets at the top 2. (Self-explanatory)      Jazz at 3:     -- They missed Gobert for a lot of time and still finished with the 5 seed.     Pels at 4:    -- Uncertainty around DeMarcus Cousins makes it hard for me to put them higher.  If you guarantee a healthy Cousins, I'd have them running away with the 3 seed by like 5-7 games.    Nuggets at 5:  No way everything breaks wrong for them again.    Timberwolves at 6:   Thibodeau can get teams to the playoffs. (Keeping them intact is another matter.) OKC at 7:   Don't discount Russell Westbrook.   Blazers at 8:  Don't discount Damian Lillard. It was just damn good defense from Holiday and Rondo in the playoffs.         I have the Spurs missing. Parker, Ginobli, and Gasol are one year older. They could be looking at even fewer games of Leonard. "
Two very influential and knowledgeable prepscouts who’ve been in the business for 30 years. Greg Hicks famously called Russell Westbrook a future pro when he was a merely three star with offers from Miami and Saint Mary’s.

"I mean that's a terrible opinion, I'm not really sure why you would think that.   Russ scores more points, with absolutely atrocious efficiency.   Russ gets more assists, but handles the ball 90% of the time and will get mad at his rim Runner centre for not taking a contested mid-range shot because he made the pass.   He literally had teammates put their hands up and let him grab rebounds (the fastbreak excuse is bullshit because it'd be more effective if he ran to the halfway line and got an outlet pass)   He doesn't play defence and will leave his man to hit door rebounds, gamble foolishly, and when his ego is challenged, he spends all game being a beast individual defender and ignoring team defence .  Russell Westbrook is the definition empty stats and as long as he's there, OKC will never win an title."
"Advanced stats in general have a long way to go as far as measuring defense.  Edit: Here's some fun with defensive metrics.  DRPM had Paul George as the 28th best SF last year. Harrison Barnes was bottom 10 out of 92 SFs.  Andre Drummond: 1st in defensive win shares, 1st in defensive BPM (any position)... and 34th in defensive RPM among only centers.  Do you think Russell Westbrook was a top-five defender this year (any position)? Defensive win shares says yes.  DBPM says Jimmy Butler was a worse defender than Dirk last year. Klay Thompson was 102nd among players classified as forward with 1,200+ minutes, out of 103 players. "

I agree with you because of his freakish size/athleticism ratio. But there is one player that rivals his athleticism even surpassing him in speed. that is Russell Westbrook. Having seen both in their prime. Live in person multiple times. Russell Westbrook is also a true freak of nature. Literally no one moves at his speed with the control that he has. He is like super Saiyan to Gohan. He has the power but kept the speed.  
I would rather have 84-year-old Bill Russell on my team than Westbrook since I'd want the team to actually get along &amp; be able to develop.
Russell Westbrook
1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Stephen Curry  4. James Harden  5. Russell Westbrook  6. Anthony Davis  7. Kawhi Leonard  8. Chris Paul  9. Giannis Antetokounmpo  10. (Honestly a toss-up between a bunch of different people)
"Russell Westbrook. For a guard, he's just incredible at rebounding. He does so much more with less length. His Triple Doubles prove that"
"&gt; Plus the NBA has the greatest athletes in the world.  This isn't true at all. Russell Westbrook is considered an incredible NBA athlete but he looks average compared to most NFL WRs/CBs.   In terms of pure, traditional athleticism (running, jumping, lifting) NFL is absolutely ahead of the NBA. There are 300+ lb lineman in the NFL who are as fast as LeBron James. That about says it all.  You do need to be a lot more skilled to make it in basketball though. "
"Ive noticed people liked james harden, kevin durant, and russell westbrook a lot more when they all played together. Now its no defense harden, kd is a snake, and russ stat pads. Seriously tho imagine the dynasty they could have been"
"Lol that's not true. It's because he doesn't project as a good athlete on the NBA level. Think about it, we expect players like Russell Westbrook and Andrew Wiggins to be elite defenders because they're elite athletes. They aren't. We expect good athletes to be good defenders. It's that simple. Obviously there are some bias when it comes to white athletes but, this isn't the case.   Also not gonna lie it's really weird to say it's not about race when it comes to white people."
Letting Russell Westbrook go for a 3rd straight season of averaging a triple double 
Coincidence that’s he’s in Oklahoma City on Russell Westbrook day? I think not

Not saying that D Rose was known for being some super smart player or anything, but his decision making wasn't as questionable as Russell Westbrook, especially when the game is on the line. "
"I'm only judging the first 6 rounds.  Team 1(Curry, Wade, LeBron, Dirk, Russell) Harden  Team 2(Oscar, MJ, Kawhi, Hakeem, Robinson) Carmelo  Team 3(Nash, Kobe, Durant, Malone, Davis) Dominique  Team 4 (Thomas, McGrady, Pippen, Duncan, Wilt) Stockton  Team 5(Magic, Iverson, Erving, Barkley, Kareem) Westbrook  Team 6(Rose, Drexler, Bird, Garnett, Shaq) West  I'll take Team 1. Go small-ball with Curry/Harden/Wade/LeBron/Russell.  I think team 3 should've drafted Harden, imagine Nash/Harden/Kobe/Durant/Malone."
"But the video is how to have a body like Russell Westbrook not local gym lifters.  Plus I know with the right diet and commitment you can reach your own potential. But it won't be the same as Russells, it's basically his job to stay in shape"
Trash analytic take. Harden at age 21 was coming off the bench and also playing with Russell Westbrook. Booker was only playing the 1 bc Suns are terrible and had no other option. The guy has scored 70 in a game of course you don’t want him running point
Step 1: Be Russell Westbrook  Step 2: Don't not be Russell Westbrook
Happy Russell Westbrook Day fellow Brodieist!!!
Russell Westbrook is your number 1? Is this real life? 
"Russell Westbrook, an NBA MVP, played 22 minutes against a team that this subreddit thinks can't even beat the Suns. Madrid wouldn't have beaten an OKC that fielded their best line up for the entire game, but neither can the Suns. "
Happy Russell Westbrook day!
steven adams: 9 mins russell westbrook: 22 mins  did you even look at that game? the starters barely played it was bench vs madrid rofl
"Damn sure aren't trading Russell and tanking. Probably run it out with the same group and fight for a playoff spot, then try to re-tool in the offseason when Melo is off the books and you only have Westbrook/Adams/Roberson under contract. "
"Ernie: Hello, and welcome to ""Inside the NBA""! I'm Ernie Johnson. With me, as always, is Kenny ""The Jet"" Smith, Sir Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O'Neal  Charles: Can I get somethang off my chest Erneh?  Ernie: Uh go ahead Chuckster  Charles: Lissen Erneh I don't mean to be disrepeckfal or any thang but Russall Westbrook should not being shooting this turribley with Paul George and Carmelo Anthany. I get that he's not Steph Curry, but you're telling me he's only shootang 44% from the field and 28% from three!! I mean first of all Erneh this was da MVP from last year. Not only did he-  Kenny: Chuck let me stop you right there because I know what you're going to say. Yea Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double but Westbrook has never been that great of a shoota. Westbrook needs the ball in his hands a lot and of course that means hes going to be shooting a lot of the shots which means his field goal percentage is going to be down. So-  Charles: Yea but he was da MVP Kenneh there should be no excuse as to why da MVP of da league should be shootang dis turribly I mean Westbrook-  Shaq: Chuck stop you don't understand the way Russell plays. Just like Kobe he takes lots of midrange shots and he thrives off iso  plays. If Russel continues to put in the work and helps his teammates he'll get a ring eventually. Something you'll never understand Chuck.    "
Russell Westbrook was pretty nasty last year.  And this tbh
The city named every day Russell Westbrook day. He’s the best cult leader
"Yeah, there's clearly a problem with max contracts in the NBA.  I don't know how to fix it, but when teams need to give good-but-not-great players like Kyle Lowry and Mike Conley as much money as James Harden and Russell Westbrook so they don't lose those good players, it makes it a lot harder for teams with those good players to take it to the next level."
"What, you don't think paying Russell Westbrook and Blake Griffin a combined $85 million dollars in a couple years is a good idea?"
Russell Westbrook cries even harder 
my man Russell Westbrook never claimed to have elite production in college
Your man Russell Westbrook couldn't even get 4 boards a game in college.

Russell Westbrook.  Does no one remember him [playing that game against OKC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRJBeaez-94) when he was like 16? He already looked like he belonged in the NBA then. 
"So your argument is that Russell Westbrook is statpadding his points?   Top-tier analysis my dude, you have a gift :)"
"Il just do this for stars as we go long.   LeBron: As great as ""Playoff LeBron"" was this year playoff LeBron was a pretty real disspaointment defensively this year. It wasn't just effort he really just doesn't have it to nearly the same degree he used to. We're past the point honestly of expecting LeBron to really ramp it up defensively for stretches much anymore.   Durant: His dribble is really high and it causes him issues when he is trying to exploit switches or mismatches on smaller players. Its often why he has to face his back to the basket against them and resort to ISO ball and stagnate his teams offense.   Curry: He still can get sloppy and too cavalier with stuff on both ends of the ball. Unnecessary sloppy passes on offense and dumb reachs in on defense.   Kawhi: He still needs work as a playmaker/passer.   Harden: His stamina is a real issue and is a big part of why towards the end of playoff series he doesn't always play up to expectations.   Anthony Davis: He needs to improve as a playmaker/passer while expanding his skill set in terms of shot creation in the post/ISOs to really take the next level and go from top 6 type player to top 3.   Giannis: He can get too foul happy.   Chris Paul: At this stage of his career he's an overrated defender he mostly just hides on weak opponents goes like 60% on that end most of the time and cant move his feet close to like he used to.   Paul George: Him as a primary shot creator on an offense leads to tons of inefficient looks. The OKC on/off data when it was him without Westbrook was laughably bad last yr   Russell Westbrook: He hasn't shot above 40% in 6 of his past 8 playoff series. Before this postseason he was an abominable 40/144 from the field in playoff crunchtime situations. AT some point he just is who he is...…….he limits your ceiling in the playoffs with his style and limitations.   Jimmy Butler: His playoff track record isn't as great as you would hope.   Kyrie: His on/off data back in Cleveland when LeBron wasn't on the court was horrendous and Boston's offense was below avg last yr. Him as the leader offensive initiator on a team still hasn't proven it can lead to a high end overall unit. "
"Lowkey, Russell WestBrook isn't a fun teammate to play with, P.G isn't coming back"
Luol D'Angelo Russell Westbrook Lopez
No because Russell is better.   John Wall even said in an interview that Westbrook is better than him. 
"Yes? And they reward that loyalty with a large contract offer, such as they gave to Russell Westbrook."
"Also because of Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka, lmao y’all like to forget that he still had a lot of help."
"Robinson, Duncan, Big O, Bird, Magic, Karl Malone, Stockton, Kobe, Lbj, Shaq, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Barkley, Julius Irving, D-wade, KD, Elgin Baylor, Ewing, Pippen, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Stephen, Clyde Drexler, Bill Walton, John Havlicek, KG.  That’s 25 that will likely have little fight. One could also consider Chris Paul, Westbrook, Reggie Miller, Anthony Davis, Steve Nash  It varies why what era you are playing in but I put out 30 that I’m sure some would rank ahead of Dirk. If you had to pick 1 player to build a team around, I don’t think he’d hit top 30.  Obviously not trying to take anything away from an UNBELIEVABLY great player, just not top 20"
You’re getting downvoted but Draymond said he respects Embiid because he talks trash whether he’s winning or losing. It’s just for fun and the only ones who take it serious are fans and Russell Westbrook.
Switch around John Wall and Russell Westbrook and I think it works better lmao

"Funny how you haven't answered my other comment on your post about Russell Westbrook ""recruiting"" top tier free agents.... "
"I'll throw some quick thoughts, did a lot of journalism and writing in high school/college, might as well apply it.   &gt; Paul George: Where the Hell is he Going?  Titles are extremely important, and what you have is decent, but if you haven't written a lot of titles it's a skill you gain over time. The capitalizing though is really inconsistent for a main title, either capitalize it all or capitalize he.   &gt; To start, Russell Westbrook is clearly not a player PG enjoys playing with. And they’re stuck with Carmelo Anthony next season on a max deal.  To start probably isn't the best way to start a sentence, maybe for starters is better, but it's not a big deal. Don't start a sentence with and like that. That sentence is really a separate thought from the last sentence, I'd add to that line or drop it, as it sits it's not a very great sentence.   &gt; What the Thunder can do if they Resign Paul George  Re-Sign, and make sure the capitalization is consistent. Why is Resign capitalized but the rest of the words that aren't the proper nouns aren't?   &gt; The Thunder are in a tricky situation with or without PG13. To be an actual contender they’d need to make some drastic moves. Nobody is going to want to take on Carmelo’s contract, so they can’t trade him. Next, Russell Westbrook is the face of the Thunder, so they can’t get rid of him. So, that leaves Steven Adams. OKC would more than likely do nothing and leave the team the way it is because they’re idiots.   If you're going to use language like ""Next"", establish the fact you're going to list some reasons, and I'd do that between the second and third sentence. It doesn't have to be a full sentence, just establish you're going to list some reasons, because I think the Steven Adams things could be a reason on your list.   I'd say in general, the content is petty good, but your kind of weak on proper journalistic language and syntax. I'd research AP style if I were you, following proper syntax and style will drastically improve readability instantly while your writing ability will improve with time.   Couple style/syntax areas that could be fixed in the article:  - Names: You're very inconsistent with referencing people, lookup AP style on that, quick fix. You call PG about three different names, makes it harder to follow as a reader.   * Sentence Length: Take a look at each sentence, especially the shorter ones, and decide if 1) it's necessary 2) can you add to it? or 3) can it be added to another sentence. Your flow will seem much more fluent if that's improved.   Like I said, the content is good, but it's just got some errors. Journalistic articles are like 15% writing the article , 40% researching, 40% editing, 5% writing your title.   If you have questions or want more advice, feel free to let me know, I've got some free time to look at stuff!   "
Could you imagine if we saw a high school kid like that today? Teams would be mortgaging their future almost immediately to sign him.   I imagine Wilt was like a cross between Shaq and Russell Westbrook 
The dude defended Russell Westbrook (the most athletic player in the NBA) one on one and kept russ in front forced him into a mid range jumper that missed. DONCIC WAS 17. That was 2 full season ago. 
Kevin Love to reunite with his UCLA teammate Russell Westbrook
russell westbrook gets criticized because   &amp;nbsp;1. he doesn't run any offense.    and  &amp;nbsp;2. he is dumb on defense
Them dunking still won't be as exciting as seeing the men dunking. It would be like Tim Duncan's dunks where he just barely jumps up and dunks it. The highest vertical jump in the WNBA is probably like 25 inches there's not much that can happen in that time they are in the air. It's not as exciting as seeing Russell Westbrook flying through the air with his feet 40 inches off the ground. Plus the actual dunking of the ball won't be as impressive since the dunks we remember are powerful slams of the ball where it looks like the rim might be destroyed and women just can't produce that force so they'd their dunks would be no different then when a NBA player casually dunks the ball on a fastbreak. 
"Lakers will have more fluidity on offense and rough riders on defense this year than last. Look at the Lakers’ bench. Whether it’s led by Lonzo or Rondo, the offense will continue to flow when LeBron rests.  Since you’re an OKC fan, let’s take a look at OKC. Who does OKC have other than Westbrook and PG? You have Robertson who can only play D and can’t shoot or create a shot to save his life. You have an aging Melo who can still ISO, but can’t defend.  Plus, when Melo gets the rock, good luck getting it back. And then Steven Adams... good interior defender, but not much else. Don’t even get me started with the bench... Felton is going to spell Russell? Please. Looks like another 1st round exit.   If a rookie in Donovan Mitchell led a Utah team to the playoffs and past a former MVP led OKC team in the 1st round, imagine what LeBron can do. "
"In the moment everyone was talking about how PG went for pennies on the dollar. To say that it was win-win in the moment is revisionist.  &gt;Winner: Oklahoma City Thunder This is pretty obvious. They got Paul George for Victor Oladipo and a guy who averaged less than six points a game on less than 40-percent shooting. Pairing George with Russell Westbrook and Steven Adams could, if everything breaks right, make the Thunder the second-best team in the West this year. They should be right there with the Rockets and Spurs, depending on how free agency plays out.   &gt;...  &gt;And who knows, maybe a year of playing with Westbrook and getting into the heat of the Western playoffs convinces George to make a go of it for the long haul in OKC. That would be a grand slam for the Thunder, but this move alone, even it's only for one year, is already a home run.   &gt;At the very worst, you unloaded Oladipo's anchor of a contract -- $84 million over the next four years.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/winner-and-losers-of-paul-george-trade-to-thunder-celtics-have-had-better-days/"

"Who do I want my kid to look up to? Russell Westbrook who has never asked to be traded or exercised a player option to join a team? Giannis or Lillard who never threatened to leave because they don’t have enough support? Do I want them idolizing players who hold an entire team hostage?   I don’t care how great a player is, the moment they do something that would put them on the evil team on a Disney movie, I forget all about legacy. Do you know how the Jordan vs Lebron conversation would be going if Lebron didn’t make “The Decision,” and reorganize a young team to fit 2 all stars when he returned? That 3-1 comeback was due to the efforts of Lebron, Love, and Irving and the others.  The media portrays rings as the end all be all, but that’s dummy math. Lebron owns all stats, but his character and ambition are shitty. I would have been fine if he made The Decision and went somewhere like Brooklyn and cashed in and built an empire, but standing with the arms crossed with Bosh and Wade was something I would have turned the channel on if my kid was watching.   I think if Lebron won 1 ring in Cleveland or Durant won 1 ring in OKC, their stock would be so much higher in conversation of the greats. When I think of Jordan I think Bulls. When I think of Bird I think Celtics. Magic- Lakers. Kobe- Lakers. Russell- Celtics. I’m not saying to be loyal to a business organization, but what uniform was he wearing in his prime? What team saw his best work? What team does he represent?   Being a Cavs fan, before and after Lebron, I watched my team get gutted several times. I watched him join to be one of the Harlem Globetrotters in Miami. But the Lebron I enjoyed the most was the three years before he took his talent to south beach where he was giving his best performances. He was hands down the best basketball player in the league. He was simply amazing to watch. But he thought a ring was everything and he couldn’t win it in Cleveland.   Now, Dan Gilbert is a real POS, but I’m sure they would have done anything for him including signing Bosh and Wade.   IMO players aren’t their best on superstar teams. Who was the real amazing feat of athleticism and skill during the championship this year? Durant, Curry, or Lebron? Who is more impressive? Bosh went from being an MVP candidate in Toronto to Larry in the Three stooges. He was growing an in his prime, only to spend 1/3 of the plays just watching Lebron shoot. Wade won more rings, but everyone credited Lebron.   I respected Irving because he wanted to lead. There were rumors that there weren’t even practices and that the coaching staff was a joke with Lebron and all the B rated superstars this past year. I’m glad he got to a place that will respect him. He made the shots at the end of the game that won us game 7 that year. But nobody remembers that. We thank Lebron.   He’s in my mind the greatest player of all time, but I’d never buy his jersey and I would hope my kid would think about greatness in a more evolved way than to want to be on the winning team like him and Durant.

&gt; Russell Westbrook  &gt; 50% FG  &gt; 40% 3FG  Lol
"1st. Russell Westbrook. I see him averaging 24 points, 15 assists, 2 steals, 4 turnovers, and 6 rebounds. Shooting 50% FG, 85% FT, and 40% 3FG. Leads OKC to a 60 win record.   2nd. Anthony Davis   3rd. LeBron   4th. Jokic  5th. Devin Booker"
"I would not call Russell Westbrook a good sport, the few games I've seen him at in portland he comes off as a dick.  I remember a foul called against him and he chucked the ball into the stands instead of handing it to the ref.    Maybe he was having off days but he just comes off like a really poor sport when he doesn't get his way.  It's kind of like watching harden, the guy is talented, and his fake flops to get foul calls.  I'll never understand athletes who are talented and use crap tactics when they dont need them."
"Yeah, he said he's all for competing and oroving he's the best 2-way player in the world. Wouldn't mind playing with Bron, but not dead set on Lakers. Mentioned respect for Russell Westbrook for how he dealt with KD leaving and saying "" I'll get guys to come run with me and beat you guys."""
Yay. Another Russell Westbrook type player. Take a bunch of shots to be a less than average scorer.
"Paul George is not the first and he will not be the last person to say this.  Russell Westbrook really is an amazing person.  This was back in 2007 when I was visiting my childhood friend at UCLA, we saw Russell Westbrook help an elderly lady across the street.  He was such a gentleman helping that sweet lady cross the busy intersection while carrying her groceries for her.  He definitely didn't have to do that.  She was even telling him that it wasn't necessary, but he insisted.  It was unfortunate that the lady had just crossed the street from the opposite way, but that is not the point of the story.  "
"okc wasnt a top 10 defense because of corey brewer and russell westbrook. they were top 10 cause of roberson and pg, neither of which had to guard mitchell. "
Russell Westbrook is the Katsuki Bakugo of the NBA. 
"Hi, that's some incredible information about Russell Westbrook. I work at ESPN. Can ESPN quote this on all platforms/affiliates with credit to you? Thanks!"
and Russell Westbrook as his flair lol
"KD made a logical decision but that doesn't mean I have to respect him. It seemed like he gave up in the end of the Thunder-Warriors series that year and then when they didn't win, despite how close they were, he went to the best team (record-wise) in history. If KD had waited one more year with the Thunder they could've won the championship. Instead he betrayed Russell Westbrook, and in my opinion his rings will never mean anything. I don't support personally attacking him, but I will call him a pussy. Calling him a pussy or bitch is hardly a personal attack."
"So, here's what happened:  PG was the only remaining Pacers from the ECF runs. He didn't want to be ""the guy"" in Indiana, because he's just not a superstar...he's a star. He gave up on the Pacers.  He wanted to go to LA, and it leaked to remove any leverage Indiana had with other teams. LA tried to trade Clarkson/Randle plus two late 1sts (that ultimately became Hart and Kuzma). Indiana thought that was a shit deal, and rightly so.   OKC gambles, shipping Oladipo, a young guard who didn't fit with OKC's system, and their lottery pick from the past year, a random underperforming big from Gonzaga. Indiana saw Oladipo's potential to succeed as the focus on offense, and they saw OKC misuse Sabonis. They both bloomed in Indiana.   PG is treated like a god in OKC without having to take the heat for losing in OKC, because they have Russell Westbrook. He's content. And the Thunder won't make it out of the second round, because PG is honestly a little over-rated. "

He'd do anything to make sure we got the win, he'd shed every ounce of fat, every morsel of fear, every fibre of weakness all so that he could get us in a position to compete harder.  &gt;I believe in Russell Westbrook. I believe in what he is trying to do this season. I believe in what he represents. This isn't a game of basketball, this is a war. This is a man tasked with breaking the shadow of darkness. If you aren't with Russell Westbrook then you're evil. That's fine, you sit there and suckle on the teets of Lucifer, you bathe in the fires of damnation.

There’s times where it’s Russ, you gotta control your attitude or KD, you gotta stop, you gotta speak up, whatever. There’s times we cuss each other out, but that’s a part of being brothers.

Wait so Russell Westbrook *isn't* a jumped up showboat?  Well I'll be!
Russell Westbrook because he isn’t afraid of the moment
"Yes, which is one of the main reasons why the eyetest is important as well. If a player forcing rebounds, overplaying passing lanes for steals (I don’t really care about SPG too much though) or holding out for assists hurts the team then I would count that against them. I don’t rate Russell Westbrook very highly because of this, even though he completely destroyed BPM and VORP single season records in 2017 while averaging 31-10-10. He is in my top 10 but not any higher."
Harden. Russell Westbrook is barely a replacement level player (am I doing this right?)
"I just don’t see it. As someone who followed all of this pretty closely the last year, the only time PG said anything definitive about LA was informing the Pacers he wanted to go there when he told them he would opt out. After that, the PG to LA honeydick is a media creation.   Whenever he was asked about it after the trade, his answers (if you go back and look) start very vague “yes, i grew up there and it might be great to be there someday but I’m focused on here for now.” Fair enough, he’s being careful.  By January, that changed to:  [""Russ is the reason **why this decision is becoming even more easier to make,**is the character Russ [has],"" George said on Wednesday. ""A stand-up guy, and he has his teammate's back.""](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22205131/paul-george-says-russell-westbrook-all-star-game-support-makes-future-decision-easier)  Just over a week later, in another interview with Rachel Nichols who specifically asked about LA: [“I obviously **would’ve loved** to go home. That was ideal **when it was that time**,” George told Nichols. “**But now, being here** and playing alongside Russ, playing alongside Melo, I feel a real brotherhood with those guys. If we’re here right now, then where can we be next year? Where can we be the year after that?”](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eLyGI14jDGA)  Then he went on to say: “Of course, LA is home, so that’s always going draw the attention. But we’ll see. **I won’t rule anything out, but I’m definitely happy where I’m at,” George said to ESPN. “I like where we’re going, and I want to see how this unfolds.”**  Everytime this stuff was posted the top ranked comment was always “He gone.”  Turns out he was telling the truth. The media honeydicked you. Not PG.    Edit: I have to add, *some* Laker fans and *some others* honeydicked themselves by refusing to believe PG would 1) like playing with Russ and 2) like living in OKC. "
"I like how a lot of commentators, reporters, and people in general think Russ is overrated. A stat hoarder, etc. And yea maybe that stat thing is true, but the fact that his teammates, numerous of them, do not care about this at all must mean he really is an awesome dude. Russell plays as hard as anyone too. That is always admired and respected. I still remember how he came to Adams defense last year at the press conference lol. And the time he dressed up as him for Halloween... Paul George was there a year and he’s already a huge Westbrook guy. This also makes you really question LeBron as a teammate. Don’t get me wrong here, just LeBron as a teammate. Honestly, LeBron is one of the best people in sports. A legit role model. But teammate ehhhh"
"Can you imagine someone like Russell Westbrook agreeing to this? GS is stacked, but damn many players are still competitors. They'll lose respect for their team if they pull of shit like this.     Maybe it can be a strategy though? The team that actually competes will attract the competitive guys for another super team."
"Imagine this:  Russell Westbrook has his hand in Kevin Durant’s face. KD is looking to pass to Curry. He looks around and then looks forward again. Suddenly Westbrook steps to the side and waves Adams to step to the side, and clear the lane. Then he sarcastically motions KD to go for the lay up.  Rinse and repeat with Harden, and every other All-Star for that matter.  That type of shit destroys a man.  We don’t need to drop games to do this. Just doing that would break him, and all of the other players on the team if they did the same to them.  Imagine the Lakers doing it to Klay all night long.  Anthony Davis and Rajon to Boogie.  Lebron to Green and Igoudala.  Kyrie to Steph Curry.  He’ll, if Michael Jordan came out and said that Kevin Durant and the Warriors are low-power uncompetitive and chose the easiest path, it would probably break the Warriors.  Edit: a few things."
"&gt;Here’s the problem with the stretch: because of massive contracts for George and Russell Westbrook, plus smaller but still significant commitments to Steven Adams, Andre Roberson, and now Jerami Grant, 2018-19 isn’t the only year the Thunder are in cap hell. Granted, once Anthony’s contract comes off the books next summer, the nine-figure luxury tax bills end. But the Thunder would still be in the luxury tax going forward.  &gt;And stretching Melo would make that worse.  &gt;Adding $9 million in dead cap weight in 2019-20 would really hurt OKC’s ability to add talent with the mid-level exception without drawing huge luxury tax bills. By deferring Melo’s contract over three years, the Thunder would make 2018-19 easier to swallow while making it harder to add help for Westbrook and George so long as they have them.  &gt;By using the stretch provision, Melo would remain on the books so long as George is committed to OKC. As such, the argument against stretching Melo is that by sucking up the pain now, you actually make it more likely the Thunder can legitimately compete for a title during George’s contract.  [Source](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/7/1/17522596/carmelo-anthony-stretch-provision-thunder-salary-cap-paul-george-rumors)  By stretching Melo, you're basically committing to trying to contend with your team as is for the next three years.

"Durant choose to go to the Warriors for less than he could have got elsewhere.  And the Warriors aren't in as big a market as you seem to think for whatever reason.      Oklahoma City in their short history has been in one finals and four conference finals.  &gt;When max contracts are a thing, and a soft cap is a thing, small market teams can't outbid big markets for star players. A hard cap and the elimination of max contracts are essential for the ability of small market teams to put together contenders.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/paul-george-free-agency-okc-thunder-star-free-agent-reportedly-reach-four-year-137-million-deal/  https://www.si.com/nba/2017/09/29/russell-westbrook-okc-thunder-contract-extension  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/thunders-steven-adams-signs-reported-4-year-100m-extension/  https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/OKC.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/GSW.html"
so was russell westbrook scared of a rookie led team in the first round last season?
"I think they mean more to role players than star players. Like if I were in the league, I’d rather be a multiple time all-star, MVP, etc. without a ring than be a role player who won a ring. The way I look at it is: Who are we gonna remember more in 20 years time? Javale McGee or Russell Westbrook? Nick Young or Charles Barkley? JR Smith or Karl Malone?   I know guys like Chuck and Malone would want rings and they tried to compete for one each year (you can just tell by watching TNT Chuck is really sad he never won one) but I’m pretty sure they’re fine with their MVP’s and millions of dollars. "
LeBron left a team where his 2nd best player was Mo Williams. KD left Russell Westbrook. And went to a 73 win team that he blew a 3-1 lead to. LeBron joined a 47 win team.
Do you think if Russell Westbrook ring chased like LeBron that Westbrook would be remotely close to Jordan?
"Do you have any more of them saved? The ones I have are this one, Austin Rivers, Westbrook, and D'Angelo Russell"

"eh? LOL who exactly do you think I root for?  I am not a fan of Cuban and Carlisle and how they treat players. Cuban won and then tried to go cheap on his players and fucked over Chandler and Butler. Carlisle, a huge gaping asshole, became an even bigger cunt after getting a ring. He swears he is as good as Pop, and that is why he is such an asshole, but nobody wants to play for this guy. And Cuban is just a loud mouth jerk. His little weird feud with Russell Westbrook and not calling him a superstar. Players notice that kind of shit.   Sure, Mavs fans will always love them for bringing them a ship. I get it. But Mavs will never win anything ever again as long as those guys are in charge. "
A bunch of players live and train in LA during the summer. Westbrook is born in raised in Southern California and still lives in LA during the summer. No one has ever seriously thought that he'd leave OKC for LA or anything. KD lived in LA last summer and no one thought he was leaving either. It's just a place rich people live. Rich people can live anywhere.  http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-russell-westbrook-brentwood-home-20180604-story.html
"Top ten players in the East:  1) Giannis Antetokounmpo  2) Kyrie Irving 3) Joel Embiid  4) Ben Simmons 5) John Wall 6) Kemba Walker 7) Kristaps Porzingis 8) Bradley Beal 9) Gordon Hayward 10) Kevin Love  Top ten players in the West:  1) LeBron James 2) Kevin Durant 3) James Harden 4) Russell Westbrook 5) Stephen Curry 6) Anthony Davis 7) Kawhi Leonard 8) Karl-Anthony Towns 9) Jimmy Butler 10) DeMarcus Cousins  That’s a pretty big difference, all the way down the West is better than the East."
So much success in 10 years the thunder have had on their roster  Kevin Durant  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Victor Oladipo  Paul George  Carmelo Anthony 
They didn’t move the goalpost for Kobe. You gotta have a top 3 team to win mvp unless you’re Russell Westbrook. 
Imagine he gets traded for Russell Westbrook then him and Reggie Jackson are on the same roster again
1. Lebron 2. Kevin Durant 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. James Harden 5. Steph Curry 6. Anthony Davis 7. Russell Westbrook 8. Giannis  9. Chris Paul 10. Joel Embiid 11. Kyrie Irving 12. Damian Lillard 13. Paul George 14. Boogie Cousins 15. KAT 16. Klay Thompson 17. Demar Derozan 18. Jimmy Butler 19. LaMarcus Aldridge 20. John Wall  That's my list.
"Not sure if anyone has brought it up before, but isn’t it crazy to think that at one time James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook were all on the same team?! "
"My Personal List, if everyone is healthy:  1) Lebron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Steph Curry  4) Kawhi Leonard  5) James Harden  6) Anthony Davis  7) Giannis  8) Russell Westbrook  9) Paul George  10) Chris Paul  11) Jimmy Butler  12) Damian Lilliard  13) Joel Embiid  14) Demarcus Cousins  15) Kyrie Irving  16) Kristaps Porzingis  17) John Wall  18) Demar Derozan  19) Victor Oladipo  20) Gordon Hayward  The Porzingis pick is going to be controversial but I've seen Gobert in some lists and Porzingis is statistically (i.e. BPG, BLK%, FG% allowed at rim) just as good as him as a rim protector. Add on 22 PPG scoring and I think, if we're talking fully healthy, he's top 20. I think by the time he comes back from his injury, he'll have worked on his conditioning and he'll cement his place on the list."
Happy Russell Westbrook Day!
"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden, Giannis, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Joel Embiid, Chris Paul, Kyrie Irving is a good start and probably in some order the top 11.   Then you have guys like Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Demarcus Cousins, Karl Anthony-Towns, Demar Derozan, Victor Oladipo, Kristaps Porzingis, Damian Lillard, John Wall, Nikola Jokic, Ben Simmons, Rudy Gobert, Gordon Hayward arguably top 20, it gets very debatable here.  That should give you a good base. "
"1. LEBRON JAMES  2. KEVIN DURANT  3. KAWHI LEONARD (HEALTHY)  4. ANTHONY DAVIS (HEALTHY)  5. STEPHEN CURRY  6. JAMES HARDEN  7. RUSSELL WESTBROOK  8. GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO  9. PAUL GEORGE  10.

KYLE LOWRY  You can argue rankings from 5 and beyond, but top 5 is solid."
I put Russell Westbrook
"I live in New York and I like Russell westbrook, we don't have a team either"
"Lol and the thunder never won a championship with James Harden, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook let that sink in bruh 🤣🤣🤣"
Because Russell Westbrook. 
PG BLUE balled us. Used the Lakers for leverage to get out of indy. And didn't even meet with the Lakers. All to stay on OKC with Russell Westbrook and busted ass Melo. WHUT. fuck that Boi. 
"In terms of fit, maybe Celtics have the better team not necessarily players. Shaq, Kobe, Magic and LeBron who are all ball dominant will struggle to move the ball. Celtics can throw out  a lineup of Cousy/Rondo, Hondo/Johnson/Jones, Bird/Pierce, Garnett/McHale, Russell/Parish who like to move the ball. Also they have some amazing role players who can all defend. Pistons also have some great lineups with Isiah/Billups, Dumars/Hamilton, Dantley/Hill/DeBusschere, Wallace/Rodman, Ben Wallace/Laimbeer/Lanier. Oklahoma/Seattle can have Westbrook/Payton, Harden/Johnson/Allen, Durant/George, Kemp/Anthony, Sikma/Adams."
And Russell Westbrook wins MVP 5 years in a row
I think it's Tuesday. Russell Westbrook should be the lead Monstar
RUSSELL WESTBROOK has to be in the movie!
"We still have a damn good core locked up for 3 years to build around  Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Steven Adams, Andre Roberson, Jerami Grant.   That was our first year together and I can definitely see them playing way better this season with good chemistry and not starting off at 8-12"
"No I didn't jump again, I added the the Thunder to my teams because Russell Westbrook is also my favorite player. With me it's really not even so much of teams but more of my favorite players to watch."
"Oddly enough, there's a higher chance of Lonzo making a three than Russell Westbrook."
"Active players who've made All-NBA 1st team, by current conf.:  West LeBron James Kevin Durant James Harden Stephen Curry Anthony Davis Kawhi Leonard Chris Paul Russell Westbrook DeAndre Jordan Marc Gasol Dirk Nowitzki Derrick Rose  East Joakim Noah  TBD Dwight Howard Dwyane Wade"
Russell Westbrook is beside himself driving through downtown LA begging Paul George’s thots (thru text) for his number.
Russell Westbrook is more likely to have a triple double now then to make a shot in 2009.
draymond green demar derozan joel embiid russell westbrook al horford
There is also a higher chance Russell Westbrook gets a triple double than Russell Westbrook making a shot
Sounds like Lonzo Ball and Russell Westbrook
"It speaks volumes about Russell Westbrook, let's be honest."
"Superstars don't need elevation,  if they complement each other then they will have great stats. Bron and kyrie were friggin incredible together. Kevin love was not needed to score , was just an easy target to blame , he was there to be the third guy. I didn't see Much of the heat big 3 , but from whatever highlights I've seen , D wade was getting pretty easy looks now and so was bron.  This elevation stuff is for role players etc , its just getting others shots , Russell Westbrook can elevate his teammates as we'll,  Paul george fits with his game too , if they didn't win it doesn't mean Russ didn't elevate pg13,  they didn't have a team around them.  Or are you a nephew "
Pg would rather play with Russell Westbrook than lebron. That tells you everything 
*If Russell Westbrook attempts to move his feet when he doesn't have a ball in his hands the Thunder can probably win a couple more games 
"Russell Westbrook, once he starts to lose speed"
"That's two-time Best in Style player Russell Westbrook.   Meanwhile, Steven Adams out there wearing eskimo hats and sweatpants"
He's an Allen Iverson/Russell Westbrook guy for me. He's a Hall of Famer that will never win a title as the main piece.

"If we judged things by fantasy production, Russell Westbrook would be better than Michael Jordan."
"This is such a petty argument, but it's fun, so I'm gonna piggyback off your comment to point out that you noted that [4-12 that year ""was a fucking mess.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1pecil/official_rnba_top_50_51/cd1gzzs/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=nba) This post proves the point of the anti-Melo post: there was one year in which Melo had a strong case, but even then, he wasn't a clear-cut top 5 player. KD, Chris Paul and Lebron were. From the post: &gt;  &gt; If it makes everyone feel better the difference in average score between CP3 (3.27) and Russell Westbrook (6.15) was higher than the difference between Westbrook and James Harden (8.96). &gt;  &gt; Which means 1-3 were simple choices for everyone and 4-12 was a fucking mess. &gt;  &gt; Everyone had different opinions on who should get those last two spots in the top 5."
"He’s critical to any success OKC will have because of his ability to be effective without the ball. But if your value is derived solely from defense, screen setting, and boxing out bigs so Russell Westbrook can grab selfish rebounds so he’s the one that gets to push instead of leaking out and letting others push the ball then there’s a good chance you’re overpaid. Those things just aren’t worth 20 million when you can get 80% of the value from some scrub who is willing to work hard. Capela is essentially the same guy only his screens lead to kick outs to open 3’s instead of Russell Westbrook midrange pull-ups. So imo he probably has a slightly higher value than Adams but not enough to justify tying up any chance at cap space for the next 4-5 years. "
"There was plenty of people low on Simmons coming into this year. I remember because I thought they were all crazy. They had Lonzo Ball with better ROTY odds coming into last season, occasionally they even gave Dennis Smith Jr. the nod over him.

"&gt;There are reasons for this. The international 3-point line is more than a foot and a half shorter than the NBA line. Meaning, all those NBA long 2s become Sloan-friendly 3s in Olympic play. And, of course, Olympic Melo’s teammates are, like, freaking incredible. The passing that Melo finds so odious in everyday life is a must in international play. No Team USA player has ever notched a usage rate above 30 percent, not even Michael Jordan. When the United States beat Australia, Coach K closed out the game with Olympic Melo at center, alongside Durant, Paul George, Klay Thompson, and Kyrie Irving. Of course Olympic Melo is unselfish. It’s different when you’re sharing the court with Ron Baker or Courtney Lee (who’s fine), or another player who’s used to dominating the ball. Like Nuggets Allen Iverson.  &gt;Or Russell Westbrook.  From a great article the Ringer put out on the 3 Melos a while ago- “Waiting for Melo.  Carmelo Anthony hosts three distinct basketball personalities in one body, and the Thunder are hoping the Team USA version makes an appearance soon. Their season might depend on it.”  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/12/5/16737440/carmelo-anthony-hoodie-melo-team-usa-thunder"
"Even if you don't like my argument don't make up random stats comparing **one season of Melo's playoffs** with **three seasons of Westbrook's regular season** that's not even a valid argument.  Carmelo Anthony TS&amp;#37; (career) is .542 and in the playoffs is .510 (including this year's trash peformance)  Russell Westbrook TS&amp;#37; (career) is .532 and in the playoffs is .516  Now let's take into account the teams in which Melo played for during his Knicks days. He had no legitimate offensive threats, entirely his fault for forcing that trade and being a diva with guys like Lin, to take pressure off him both in scoring load and defense. Westbrook has played alongside Durant an arguably top-2 player in the league and former MVP, James Harden a legit scoring threat even in his OKC days when he played 30+ MPG 2/3 seasons in the playoffs, and Paul George a top-15/20 player in the league who was one of the best shooters in the NBA this year. I don't think Melo was a top 5 player outside of his one season with NYK, but making random comparisons can make any player look better than another and everyone here blindly upvotes people like you that have no basis to their argument and that's how we ended up with all of this retrospective Melo hate in the first place."
"You can track this for players on bball ref. Just go to the players' bball ref page go down to ""Shooting"" and find the Abbreviation ""Dist."" [Russell Westbrook ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCtI6uxbTho) for example has an average shot distance of 11.4 feet for his career"
"I made a post a month back calculating TAPG (total assists per game), if you're interested:  This season marks the first time that the NBA has tracked probably the most important non-boxscore occurrence in the game - screen assists.  I feel like these aren't discussed enough as a major factor in offensive prowess. A good, smart screener can provide high-quality playmaking opportunities just as well as a good passer.   Players who can do both are extremely rare and pose a versatile threat in the half-court.  TAPG (Total Assists per Game) is a stat that combines these two to calculate a total number of opportunities created by the player that directly lead to a score.  The '18 leaders in Screen Assists per Game:  1. **Rudy Gobert - 6.2** 2. Steven Adams - 4.8 3. Andre Drummond - 4.7 4. Marcin Gortat - 4.5 5. Nikola Jokic - 4.3 6. Dwight Howard - 4.2 7. Brook Lopez - 4.1 8. Myles Turner - 4 9. Tyson Chandler - 3.9 10. DeAndre Jordan - 3.9  The '18 leaders in Assists per Game:  1. **Russell Westbrook - 10.3** 2. John Wall - 9.6 3. LeBron James - 9.1 4. James harden - 8.8 5. Rajon Rondo - 8.2 6. Ben Simmons - 8.2 7. Chris Paul - 7.9 8. Draymond Green - 7.3 9. Lonzo Ball - 7.2 10. Jeff Teague - 7  The highest a Top10 player in one of the categories appears in the other is Jokic, who finished 15th in APG  Finally, the '18 NBA leaders in TAPG:  1. **Nikola Jokic - 10.5** 2. Russell Westbrook  - 10.4 3. LeBron James - 10.1 4. John Wall - 9.7 6. Draymond Green - 9.1 5. James Harden - 9.1 7. Ben Simmons  -8.9 8. Blake Griffin - 8.7 9. Rajon Rondo - 8.7 10. Chris Paul - 8.4  Some other guys who filled both of the categories were DeMarcus Cousins and Al Horford at 8.1 and 7.5 TAPG respectively. "
Because he shared a ball with Russell Westbrook and is a willing passer?
"Anthony had a TS&amp;#37; of .497 while Westbrook had a TS&amp;#37; of .544 over the last 3 seasons (when he was considered a top 5 player). That's a significant difference.  On top of which, the **main** on top of which, Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double for back-to-back seasons while putting up 2 steals a game. This has been done only by one other player in history, a top-15 player all-time, Oscar Robertson. Melo barely got 2 assists and less than a steal a game. Lets not compare Me7o to the Westbrook."

"Kevin Durant was making between 30 to 35 million per season from endorsements when he left Oklahoma City. That amount hasn’t really changed since joining the Warriors.  Russell Westbrook and Damian Lillard each earn approximately 15 million per year from endorsements, even though each of them live in a small market. They are both among the top 15 highest paid athletes in the world.  Market size has very little to do with it. It’s all about his ability, personality and marketability."
Russell Westbrook 
"You do realise only like 25% of the draft stay in the league beyond their rookie deal right? It's not that NCAA players are NBA ready it's the fact that we don't know what they are is what makes them appealing for drafts. A lot of European players are role players that didn't exactly have the exposure to basketball that American players do. I guarantee a large portion of European players didn't pick up organised basketball till they were in their early twenties since in Europe there aren't as many youth programmes like in America and had already reached their ceilings, which is still a higher level than that of an NCAA team.   In 2016 OKC, a playoff team starting Russell Westbrook faced Real Madrid in a preseason game in which Real Madrid came out victorious. No way an NCAA team pulls that off.  Maybe you should realise talent =/= potential and Euro teams are just much more talented than a rag tag team of college players. There's a reason Ncaa is called amateur and the Euro league is called Pro. "
"It totally is, we don't have Russell Westbrook."
"Even if AI is top 20 (I like the thought since he has been one of my favorite players for a long time, but I doubt it's true), Melo is still not 35.  Here are 40 guys clearly better than Melo (not in exact order):  LeBron, MJ, Kareem, Wilt, Russell, Magic, Bird, Duncan, Shaq, Hakeem (10), Kobe, Robertson, Karl Malone, Moses Malone, Barkley, West, Dirk, George Gervin, Isiah Thomas, Wade (20), KD, Dr J, Cousy, Schayes, Havlicek, Stockton, David Robinson, Garnett, AI, Dwight Howard (30), Pippen, Ewing, CP3, George Mikan, Steve Nash, Rick Barry, Kidd, Hayes, Nique, Rodman (40).  And then you get into the list of players like TMac, Webber, Drexler, Payton (I can list another dozen guys in this zone) who have as many or more accolades as Melo w/ probably higher peaks... and plenty of up and comers who already have higher peaks than Melo ever had and are only working longevity at this point (Curry, Westbrook, Harden...).

"Idk what you’re referring to in the last Olympics because he only had 1 game where he took more than 11 shots, and that was the game where he went something like 11/21 for 31pts. All the other games that year he took less than 12 shots. That isn’t enough shots to almost shoot anyone out of a game, let alone the USA Men’s Basketball team lol. I could argue that playing somewhere that you didn’t actually want to play, with people you didn’t want to play with might take away your motivation when training. However, he is a professional basketball player, and still has a job to do no matter what; so if that’s what happened, that is another topic entirely. Playing somewhere you WANT to play, with someone you consider a friend, can make a huge difference in your performance. Setting that aside though, let’s just call it how it is....CP3 and Russell Westbrook are two completely different types of PG’s. Not saying one type is better than the other, but one type is definitely more conducive to helping those around them excel than the other. I think that is another reason that Melo in Houston would look a lot different than the Melo we saw in OKC last season. "
"Not true at all man. PG just criticized the Pacers front office on instagram. If Lebron did that that would be the top post here, the first thing they talk about on Espn First Take, the Jump, Undisputed, First Things First, The Herd, all the sports podcasts and radio shows etc. and it would be cemented in history. People would be talking about Lebron and Dan Gilbert's relationship.  Cousins has done tons of weird shit on social media recently. Devin Booker. Karl Anthony Towns. Jimmy Butler. Russell Westbrook constantly likes stuff that disses Durant lmao. Lebron posts what? Arthur memes, and that's the top news story. He doesn't fan the flames of him vs Gilbert or Kyrie or something.  Edit: Also, the Spurs rookie has said some Nazi shit on social media. No one cares."
That's literally Russell Westbrook all game every game.
that happens sometimes when Russell Westbrook is on your team
"Just a few weeks ago I was hanging out with a guy who made several absurd comments.  1. Brad Stevens is the best NBA head coach of all time  2. Al horford is the best player on the Celtics   3. Russell Westbrook isn't a top 25 player in the NBA  4. Steph curry and Chris Paul are the two greatest PG's of all time (with magic ""maybe"" being top 5 in his eyes)"
Zach Harper says Russell has had a grudge against Ricky Rubio since Rubio first came into the league. Apparently too many reporters asked Westbrook about him so he decided to hate him.
Nice. Russell Westbrook has about the same chance of winning a title as Kobe does this year. 0 Percent. And that's the present!
"I get that OKC was young but in retrospect, they had Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, and James Harden going up against Lebron, Wade, and Bosh. Which favored the Heat, but not by *that* much. And then behind that the Heat had Mario Chalmers, Udonis Haslem, and Shane Battier, vs. OKC playing Serge Ibaka, Kendrick Perkins and Derek Fisher.   If you took Lebron and Durant off those teams the series would have been in favor of the Thunder by a pretty great margin. Their roster was just deeper. The issue for the Thunder is that they had no answer to prime Lebron - that was right in the thick of Lebron’s best career stretch as a two-way player. "
"WB passed the ball a lot, he has a clusterfuck of assists. The thing he has going for him is even when his shot isn't falling, he is still doing something to contribute on the floor. The WB hate here is ridiculous, he averaged a triple double because he is a great all around offensive basketball player. Durant was not hindered by Russell Westbrook, he was still an elite player and his deficiencies where his own fault. The Thunder have continued to be a solid team with Westbrook, even after removing tons of his help. Presti has done a good job finding other players, but its unfair to give Westbrook no credit for the Thunder being a consistent play off team in a stacked west. "
"He never had a killer group of teammates like Steph, Wade or Duncan but he did have:   * *HOFers in their Prime:* Amar'e Stoudmire (1.5 seasons), Paul George and Russell Westbrook (1 season), Allen Iverson and Chauncy Billups (3 seasons) * *All Stars in their Prime:* Tyson Chandler (3 seasons), Kenyon Martin (2 seasons) * *Quality Starters:*  Jeremy Lin (1 season), Marcus Camby (6 seasons) Amar'e Stoudemire (4 seasons), Nene Hilario (6 seasons), Kenyon Martin (5 seasons), JR Smith (9 seasons), Ty Lawson (1 season), Kristaps Porzingis (2 seasons)  That's a lot better than say Dirk Nowitzki, Jazz Karl Malone, pre Boston KG, or Anthony Davis. Melo didn't luck out with injuries (Stoudemire) or playoff matchups (Lakers in 09), but he had a pretty average to slightly above average supporting cast throughout his year by most standards IMO. "
yes we have already known that the Thunder were going to have a horrific time passing the ball and it's not just because Russell Westbrook is on their team (but that's a big reason)
adorable and terrifying at the same time. welcome to the Russell Westbrook experience.

Best bets for each team to be lifers   Dallas: Dirk  Denver: Jokic  Golden State: Steph  Houston: Capela  Los Angeles Clippers: Jerome Robinson  Los Angeles Lakers: Lonzo Ball  Memphis: Marc Gasol  Minnesota: KAT  New Orleans: Anthony Davis  Oklahoma City: Russell Westbrook  Phoenix: Devin Booker  Portland: Damian Lillard  Sacramento: Harry Giles  San Antonio: Manu  Utah: Donovan Mitchell  Atlanta: Trae Young  Boston: Jayson Tatum  Brooklyn: Jarrett Allen  Charlotte: Cody Zeller  Chicago: Lauri   Cleveland: Sexton  Detroit: Drummond  Indiana: Myles Turner  Miami: Bam  Milwaukee: Giannis  New York: Porzingod  Orlando: Jonathan Isaac  Philadelphia: Joel Embiid  Toronto: DeMar DeRozan  Washington: John Wall   Realistically only like 2-5 of these guys end up being lifers   
"Yeah.. I feel like using assists as a knock against him is just sorta lame.  The whole point of looking at assists was a proxy for how you make your teammates better. Curry does that by being arguably the goat off ball player, and it shows if you just directly look at how much better his teammates do when he's on the court.  Nowadays individual assists honestly kinda suck at showing how you are improving your teammates. Like is Russell Westbrook really improving his teammates efficiency more than anyone else in the league? Nearly all of his teammates who have joined/left were more efficient off of OKC. A super high individual assist count is way more closely tied to poor ball movent as a team, meaning it's in one player's hand for the majority of the possession.   I feel like nowadays since we can track advanced stats we should be looking more directly at how you improve your teammates shooting % rather than just looking at assists. "
Russell Westbrook is a bad basketball player 
Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook. 
did you guys know Russell Westbrook wanted to be in the dunk contest his rookie year but the fans didn't vote him in?  now he says he wouldn't want to do it
Russell Westbrook. I think he's a Thunder lifer at this point.
"Westbrook, Russell "
"As a native St. Louisan, I’m a bit biased towards Missouri. Our core of Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, and Otto Porter Jr. would be decent.  But in all seriousness, California would be the enormous favorite. The LA area alone could field a team of:  - James Harden - Kawhi Leonard - Russell Westbrook - Paul George - DeMar DeRozan - Klay Thompson - Jrue Holiday - Kevin Love"
"- 11* players have won MVP, FMVP, and made 10+ All-NBA teams (Dirk instead of West + everyone else listed except Russell)  *Russell would be included as well if FMVP debuted earlier than 1969  - Dirk is one of seven in the 30K point club about to pass Wilt for career points  - Dirk was the leading scorer and only player to appear on each of 11 consecutive Mavs teams to win 50+ games (third longest streak ever) while playing on very good but not stacked teams  - Aforementioned 11-year prime run he went 24/9/3 on 48/39/88 splits (59% TS) playing in the 2000s slow, inefficient, iso-ball era   - Playoffs those years he averaged 26/10/3 on 46/38/89 (58 TS) advancing 7/11 times, three conference finals, and two NBA Finals during the Lakers and Spurs reign  - Won a game seven in San Antonio during Duncan's prime in the middle year between two Spurs championships, beat the Kobe-Pau Lakers after they had repeated, KD/Westbrook/Harden/Ibaka Thunder a year before they made the Finals, and LeBron/Wade/Bosh Heat a year before they repeated  Jordan, LBJ, Kareem, Magic, Bird, Duncan, Wilt, Russell, Shaq, Hakeem, Kobe are eleven that I would never argue Dirk is above but that twelve spot I think Dirk has as much a case as West or anyone"
"IMO shows how max contracts are brokren. He's amazing and deserves every penny, but Russell Westbrook dominates his stats in every cat and ~~can't be paid more~~ *also makes his max*. This is why the Warriors happened.  Edit: thanks /u/selicate, I was wrong  Edit. 2: I love y'all, and this sub is dope, but I admitted I had a problem with my thought process and got downvoted. Wtf? Shouldn't a correction on principals merit respect?  Edit 3: current NBA cap regs are correct? Prolly not. I'm questioning pure bs cap regs."
"Rick Carlisle is the most overrated coach I've ever seen and players hate to play for him. He comes off like pop, but he's not even a poor man's pop. Mark Cuban is one of the most arrogant cheap owners in the NBA. After winning the championship he let go of Butler and Chandler and they haven't sniffed mediocrity sense. If you're counting, mediocrity would be a good thing for the Dallas Mavs. I believe Mark Cuban hurt the Mavs when he talks trash about Russell Westbrook. Players listen. I believe players only see the Mavs as a place to get overpaid. it's just a place to make money at this point and nothing more. No one will ever join the Mavs honestly saying, I want to be here and believe we can win a championship here.   Now, those are just facts. My hot take is that Mavs fans will never want to hear facts because they got their one championship and that's good enough for them. And their eyes Carlisle and Cuban can do no wrong"
"Russell Westbrook and James Harden own this thread.   I’d say Chris Paul is up there cause he’s incredible, but his flopping and his dirty tactics are gross.   Same with Draymond Green except he’s not incredible. He’s good. But not good enough to make up for all his on court doo doo. "
"Russell Westbrook. If you were forced to keep your eyes on one player for an entire game, he'd probably be your pick. LeBron is a close second. Depending on who's play-style you like more"
"See: Westbrook, Russell"
Russell Westbrook.   Half the people in the world think he’s a selfish ball hog who can’t shoot and makes his teammates worse. 
Russell Westbrook is better than Kahwi Leonard. 
It was only thanks to his amazing shooting that Russell Westbrook was carried to his triple double average a year ago.   Watch your tongue. 
0- Russell Westbrook 
0: Westbrook  1: Oscar Robertson  2: Kawhi  3: AI  4: Dantley  5: KG/Kidd  6: Bill Russell  7: Melo  8: Kobe  9: Petit  10: Frazier/Rodman  11: Isiah Thomas/Elvin Hayes  12: Stockton  13: Wilt  14: Cousy  15: Vince Carter  16: Pau Gasol  17: Havlicek  18: Dave Cowens  19: Willis Reed  20: Gary Payton  21: Duncan  22: Elgin Baylor  23: Lebron/MJ  24: Kobe  I realize I have Kobe twice and I’m really not trying to be a homer but like there really aren’t many good number 8’s throughout history lmao 
"I'm an OKC fan because I was a Russell Westbrook fan. I'm a Charlotte fan at heart and always will be. But, if both teams are playing, I'm watching the Westbrook led OKC Thunder 100% of the time"
00 Robert Parish  0 Westbrook  1 Oscar  2 Moses  3 Wade  That's all I feel like doing. Oh and 6: Bill Russell.
"Just too much talent in the West though for Ingram to make it, even with a big jump in talent  **BACKCOURT:**  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  James Harden  Klay Thompson  Damian Lillard  CJ McCollum  Russell Westbrook  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Mike Conley Jr  **FRONTCOURT:**  Kevin Durant  LeBron James  Draymond Green  Jimmy Butler  Karl-Anthony Towns  Nikola Jokic  Anthony Davis  Rudy Gobert  DeAndre Jordan  Paul George  Kawhi Leonard, maybe  ..  And those are just some names that are absolutely above Ingram in the pecking order for an All Star appearance. Hell, there's 21 names there... almost half of this list won't make it either."
I think Ben Simmons has a real shot to average a triple double.  He could be the first guy to do since .. wait Russell Westbrook just did it?  He did it twice?  Well never mind then.
" East   * Kyrie Irving   * Demar Derozan   * Joel Embiid   * Giannis Antetokounmpo   * Bradley Beal   * Kevin Love   * Al Horford   * Kyle Lowry   * Victor Oladipo   * John Wall   * Ben Simmons   * Jayson Tatum   Contenders/Fringe: Kris Middleton, Andre Drummond, Goran Dragic, Kemba Walker  West   * Stephen Curry   * James Harden   * Lebron James   * Kevin Durant   * Anthony Davis   * Russell Westbrook   * Damian Lillard   * Draymond Green   * Karl-Anthony Towns   * Klay Thompson   * Jimmy Butler   * Paul George   Contenders/Fringe: Donovan Mitchell, Demarcus Cousins, Lamarcus Aldridge, Nikola Jokic, Devin Booker, Kawhi Leonard?   This is what I've come up with so far. I want to put Donovan Mitchell in, but I'm not sure who to take out. Maybe one or two of Green/Towns/Thompson/Butler/George"
"Allen Iverson, Dave Cowens, Derrick Rose, Steve Nash, Bob Cousy, Willis Reed, Bob McAdoo and Russell Westbrook are all arguably worse. "
"A couple years ago, Russell Westbrook blew the roof off of the arena when he dunked on Clint Capela. Absolutely insane.   Terrance Ferguson has some sassy ones but he needs some more nuance. He doesn't have anyone to dunk at yet. "
But its Russell westbrook day. How can it be paul George day too
now we got Russell Westbrook day and PG day
"Fun Fact, July 7th is also Russell Westbrook day"
But every day is supposed to be [Russell Westbrook day] (https://mobile.twitter.com/cityofokc/status/913861809031008257)
i thought july 7th was russell westbrook day
But nobody wants to play with Russell Westbrook /s
Russell Westbrook Sonics. 
 Russell Westbrook has made people worse
Harden and his flopping...BY FAR.  Russell Westbrook aggravates me when he doesn't get back on defense/falls asleep on defense.  Tony Parker rubs me the wrong way when I look at him. Idk why. Hopefully he makes my Hornets better. 
Russell Westbrook is good at basketball
"Word. Enjoy shitty Russell Westbrook. I look forward to yet another decade of the Jazz getting bounced out of the first/second round. But hey, at least he was Rook..... Oh, right. Nevermind. "
"'Russell' is a male given name, that originated from the surname Russell, which in turn derives from the Anglo-Norman russel (Old French rossel) ""red-haired or red-skinned""  Westbrook Name Meaning. English: brook in the west  Russell Westbrook is red with anger at all times and the only way for him to cool off is to take down everybody in the west"
TIL Melo missing wide open shots is being blamed on Russell Westbrook. What a world. 
"Actually he has shown that he can accept that lesser role: when he played on the USA olympic team. He wasnt out there chucking, he was an elite spot up shooter, being patient, playing a lesser role behind other great players. Doesnt matter what the competition is, in 2008, 2012, 2016, he is comfortable not being the primary option. I simply think that Melo, on NBA teams, has felt he needed to shoulder the scoring load more when the offense is stagnant, and the offense in OKC is definitely stagnant, but even then Melo isnt getting consistent looks. He is not the player who can lead a team, but if you put him next to someone who is a leader or is better, he can definitely succeed. Russell Westbrook is not that player. "

I made a comment about comparing Zhaire Smith to Russell Westbrook jokingly in the Sixers sub and people just shit on Westbrook in the replies. 
They absolutely would.   1.) The lack of floor spacing would be cancerous.    2.) A pair of 6-3 Russell Westbrooks guarding Kevin Durant on a ball screen?   3.) Barely 200 lb Russell Westbrook defending Boogie Cousins on the post up?
According to the Ringer's article from today it's Brandon Ingram lol... but personally I think Russell Westbrook is the best answer here
what's up guys coach nick here  fuck russell westbrook  anyways let's get into the video
"Russell ""your feathers"" Westbrook"
"He's like 175 pounds with zero muscle tone. He was always going to suck initially cuz he doesn't have anything close to an NBA ready body. Looks like rookie Curry, a baby face who could pass for 14. But at least rookie Curry had freaky boxer handspeed to get his shot off and handle the ball against NBA defenders.  Trae is going to struggle cuz he's just athletically outclassed, but once he puts on 15 quality pounds, it's a whole nother ballgame. He's basically playing with a prepubescent body right now, that's a huge handicap. He'll never be a Russell Westbrook or John Wall, but he could be a league average athlete with a great shot and good all around skills."
"""I know OKC fans would say no because Westbrook is the better player in the deal but would Wizards fans say no to swapping an All-NBA level player for an MVP level player?""  Literally word for word what I posted.  Will someone please stop hating on Russell Westbrook. Look at all the abuse I'm spewing at him."
Other interesting ones:  - Markelle Fultz: 20 - Vince Carter: 15 - Boban Marjanovich: 22 - Russell Westbrook: 27
"Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis and Enes Kanter"
"Joel Embiid, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving. "
"&gt; what's the logic for your stupid ass analogy?  Uh the analogy is that pretty damn simple dude. Russ isn't coming up ripping boards away from Adams, but Adams lets Russ get rebounds that he could have gotten cuz it's understood. AKA Russ isn't stabbing a guy and taking his wallet, he's showing him a knife and making them hand over the wallet.  &gt;the ball is going to be passed to him anyway as he's the point guard, if adams boxes out and russ gets the rebound he can quickly initiate the fast break  This has been analyzed and I'm not sure where I can find it, but it's either untrue or the impact is negligible. And if you think they were letting Russ get boards for a strategic purpose and not a stat padding purpose, you're blind. And even if Russ getting the board was helpful for the fast break, him totally abandoning his defensive assignment in order to get the board outweighs the benefits of him starting the fast break. From his MVP season:  &gt;Westbrook ranks dead last in the NBA in contested shots among players averaging 30 or more MPG by a considerable margin. Hilariously, the only two players who have contested less 3P FGA’s are Rudy Gobert and Whiteside, who have contested 53 and 64 respectively. Russell Westbrook is at 69 while having playing [sic] close to the same amount of minutes…Yes, DeAndre Jordan has contested more 3P FGA’s this season than Russell Westbrook.  &gt;Westbrook is contesting approximately 3.4 of his PG matchup’s 13.1 FGA while on the floor. The player he’s supposed to be defending is attempting 74% of their shots without a contest from Westbrook.  &gt;His opp. +6.9% over expected FG% is dead last in the NBA among guards. The only other players over 4.5% are Sean Kilpatrick, Kyle Korver, and Emmanuel Mudiay. "
"Other than DeMar DeRozan and Victor Oladipo being too high, actually a pretty respectable list.  EDIT: I have him at #20 on my list. Parenthesis are there NBA Ranks last year and 2 years ago.

Russell Westbrook is a Thunder. 
Pretty wild that some bulls fans predicted Russell Westbrook over Derrick Rose 5 years ago 
“My bet - some of the usual suspects:  G Kyrie Irving (age 25) G Russell Westbrook (age 29) F Kevin Durant (age 29) F Lebron James (age 33) C Anthony Davis (age 24)”  /u/RPN not bad my guy. 
Russell Westbrook. No question I want him on my team if I’m in the finals. I know he’s turnover prone but he also is a fucking assassin
Lebron is definitely number one. Here are some numbers for players mentioned in this thread for the 17-18 season.  |Player|% Shots = Layup|Layup %| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|36.17|0.690| |Stephen Curry|22.89|0.626| |DeMar DeRozan|18.91|0.609| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|37.33|0.605| |Ben Simmons|36.76|0.605| |James Harden|28.59|0.603| |Victor Oladipo|24.52|0.597| |Kentavious Caldwell-Pope|16.29|0.589| |Russell Westbrook|33.61|0.564| |Kyrie Irving|27.23|0.561| |John Wall|34.16|0.549|
Obviously because Russell Westbrook dresses fine as fuck 90% of the time. 
"Two separate sentences/thoughts, buddy, separated by “Even if” which implies the first is possible.   Say it’s Russell Westbrook and Steven Adams. You could absolutely surround them with 3 Ingles as starters. So yes you can.  But EVEN IF you didn’t want to, you could use the third as a reserve who plays 30 minutes. "
Newsflash: James Harden will get more out of his teammates than Russell Westbrook. 
"Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Lebron James, CP3 Paul George"
"I was watching some highlights from the 2012 regular season and Russell looked somewhat like an elite defender (something that a number of NBA execs thought of him as at the time). There are a few examples of D Wade completely shaking Westbrook out of his boots but then when Wade goes to shoot, Westbrook makes some insanely athletic moves to put up a good contest of Wade's shots. Unfortunately he kinda got lazy on defense and now when he tries he's sorta out of practice with defensive techniques stances. You could tell againt Ricky Rubio that Westbrook was rusty on the defensive end (although he didn't guard him that bad after the comments). "
"Could that possibly be the result of the superstar point guard hogging the ball to try to get assists? I still don't understand why people deny that Russell Westbrook is a statpadder, it's a fact of life."
https://www.si.com/nba/2017/04/11/thunder-sam-presti-kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-nba-playoffs
" Never forget Russell Westbrook in his 3 seasons as the main star on his team has missed the playoffs (2015), Lost in 5 to the a team that lost in the second round to a team that ended up losing the WCF (2017) and lost in 6 to a rookie even though he added Paul George to his squad (2018)   "
"Idk why you think i think you're offended.   i think you're using the warriors as a scape goat for bad play. if you're too tired to run an offense, to set a pick, make a cut, you need to come out of the game in my opinion, at least for a bit. i mean damn, at least stand near the field of play so someone might think you're a threat. running 4 v 5 so RW can get a breather and stay on the floor, you might as well just hand the ball back to the other team.  i shouldn't have used curry as an example, i could've said almost any basketball player in the history of basketball. i have NEVER seen a player do this.   I've seen RW, in the last moments of the 4th qtr, take shot after shot after shot after shot, in closely contested games. And they're bad shots.   The thunder don't pass the ball, bodies don't move, it's a fucking iso fest. I blame a large part of that on RW. Here is an article that better explains what I am getting at https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/11/27/16702738/nba-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-problem  I will also continue to look for the video montage of RW passing the ball and then just standing idly by somewhere between the 3 pt line and halfcourt.  Let me reiterate, RW isn't a bad guy, bad player, bad person, bad friend. I think he is a bad TEAMMATE. When i have to play on a TEAM with him, he rarely does anything to help the rest of us do our job. He's done almost everything to this point on his own, and it's like he expects everyone else to do it on their own too.  EDIT: Can't find the original video but this is what I am talking about buddy https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7iq2tn/coach_nick_i_have_studied_many_nba_offense_for/  EDIT2: Nvm the guy linked the whole video in the comments"
Can’t wait for the BR quote graphic:  “I am a bad teammate” - Russell Westbrook 
Jokic &gt; Russell Westbrook?
Russell Westbrook. 
"It’s pretty wild! Here’s Sports Illustrated famous Top 10 player rankings from 5 seasons ago:  1) LeBron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Chris Paul  4) Tony Parker  5) Russell Westbrook  6) Tim Duncan  7) Dwight Howard  8) Dwyane Wade  9) Kobe Bryant  10) Carmelo Anthony  Only 4 of these guys (LBJ, KD, Russ, CP3) are likely in your Top 10 today.  2 of these guys (Kobe, Timmy) are now retired, and 4 of them (Parker, Howard, Wade, Anthony) are shells of their former selves and any of them would be lucky to be considered amongst today’s Top 100.  In comparison...  Players that are now widely considered to be in (or on the fringe of) the Top 10 and their ranking in 2013:  • James Harden (11)  • Steph Curry (15)  • Kyrie Irving (20)  • Kawhi Leonard (37)  • Anthony Davis (41)  • Giannis Antetokounmpo (Not in NBA)  • Joel Embiid (Not in NBA)"
"REPORTER: James, what did you think about Russ making fun of you a bit at practice today?  HARDEN: I was mad. I'm gonna destroy him next time we play for real. Nah, I'm just playing. It's all in good in fun.  BREAKING NEWS - James Harden and Russell Westbrook feuding. Harden ""mad"". Says he will ""destroy"" Westbrook."
"“I felt like getting locked down by joe Ingles while dropping 5 points and 3 assists while Russell Westbrook attempted 46 shots was the clear path to a championship. Plus Cancerous Carmelo and 29% Roberson gunning from deep, Oklahoma City is a top notch free agent destination, we’ve just got a bright future here lads”."
Russell Dino-walk-brook is best Westbrook 
"Nope. Lebron dominating the ball and offense does not make him the better player.  Playing an offense where one guy dominates everything is an obsolete and inferior style.  Don't blame KD for being able to bring out the best in his teammates.  Unlike Lebron, KD does not need to dominate the ball to be dominant.    If carrying a heavy load is the determining factor then Russell Westbrook is the best player in the world.  Or then AI would be a top 5 player all time.  But being a 1 man army does not make you the best. Basketball at the highest level is played with 5 guys working together to maximize each others talent.  It is not about 1 guy dominating the entire offense.  And what type of impact did Lebron have on defense?  Why are you totally ignoring defense?  In the last 2 Finals KD was just as unstoppable on offense then Lebron.  In fact he was more unstoppable since he put up a 68% TS vs 62% for Lebron.  Now add in KD's defensive impact and its obvious who the better player is."
Can't wait for our games against OKC. I love Westbrook. He is so fucking intense.   I just hope Joel and Russell don't kill each other.
No votes for Russell Westbrook? That dude is an athletic freak. 
yes.  no team will ever win with russell westbrook as their main guy and they have basically no assets at all in the future.  they will end up trading wb PG adams and whoever else to kickstart their rebuild
"Russell Westbrook would be Kam Chancellor 2.0. 6'3"" safety who can bring the boom and is the heart of the team."
"I adore the way Russell Westbrook and Sam Presti have put this franchise on their backs and lead this team since KD left us. That was the lowest OKC fans have felt since the franchise arrived there and what followed was a tidal wave of great news for OKC fans. Russell's certifiably bananas MVP season, Russell re-signing with us ASAP and then immediately trading for George with the intent of selling him on the OKC culture and forging a friendship with WB. And by god they fucking did it, the madmen. Now just focus on forging a great chemistry among this group over the next three seasons and putting a winning roster around Russ and Paul. Awesome time to be an OKC fan!"
Russell Westbrook has an anonymous reddit account confirmed.
"Man, no offense as this is not my intention, but I got kinda sad to see the '(explained further in tweets)' with no links/transcripts of them whatsoever. So, if you don't mind, I'll post all them all in here for others who can't access/search all of this that easily.  Twits explaining:  &gt; In response to some questions about passer rating, here’s a thread about the history of valuing assists, how passer rating was born and what it captures. (Links at the end) #thinkingbasketball 1/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; I’ve always been disappointed in assists by themselves - they need context when used to measure impact or skill. Assist:turnover ratio was often cited in the past, but it’s not always helpful. 2/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; A previous (unpublished) version of the passer rating regression actually pegged ast:tov as a slight *negative* — too much conservatism might indicate an unwillingness to try risky passes that are high ROI. It’s the dink and dunk of quarterbacking for basketball. 3/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; The aim of my first major passing study in 2010 was to divorce assists from “shot creation.” For example, Brevin Knight crushed MJ in assists, but Jordan created far more shots for teammates by causing the D to react. This led to the birth of BOX CREATION. 4/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; The key insight from box creation was that too much scoring cannibalizes chances for teammates (bc the defense reacts to the threat of a scorer with doubles and stunts) BUT, too little scoring and the defense won’t react. There’s a balance at the heart of offensive stardom. 5/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; The ability to quantify creation gave birth to a more comprehensive version of usage called OFFENSIVE LOAD. Load includes passing &amp; creation, not just shots and turnovers, so it estimates a player’s total “direct involvement” in the offense. 6/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; In 2017 I started tracking detailed passing tendencies for players. It’s hard to reduce passing to one dimension or an overall score, but I think of it as the composite of all the possible types of passes. eg outlets, lobs, skip passes, touch passes, etc. 7/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; PASSER RATING is an attempt to measure this overall passing ability. Few if any excel in every component of passing, and time and circumstance will influence passing ability. The key insights of passer rating are: 8/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; First, a high ratio of assists to load is a major indicator of passing skill. The more a player accrues assists per involved-possessions, the more likely it is that he is finding the easiest shots for his teammates. 9/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; The second is obvious - layup assists are generally an indicator of good passing. They are the highest EV spot on the court and finding them regularly *as a percentage of one’s overall assists* is generally a positive. It indicates less dink n dunking to outside shooters. 10/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; There also seems to be a relationship between height and passing (cue @ZachLowe_NBA ). Specifically, when the other signals are strong and the player is tall, he is almost always an excellent passer. 11/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; I do think there’s a positional bias in the current version — guards pick up more idle assists — that I haven’t been able to adjust for but would like to in a future version. For now, I recommend some mental curving for tall, efficient guards who grade out well. 12/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; Finally, my aim was to create something historically retrospective. With the granularity of the new data we have today, I think ""modern"" versions of this could be even more precise/illuminating. Thanks for reading. Look forward to more conversations on this.

"In case you’re wondering, LeBron James started in 999 of his first 1,000 career appearances. His lone appearance off the bench came on December 11, 2007, during his first stint with the Cavaliers. James had missed the team’s previous five games with a sprained left index finger and made his return on the night in question to help spark the Cavs to a 118-105 victory over the Pacers. It was the only game in his career in which he didn’t start.  Tim Duncan started in 998 of his first 1,000 career games, with one bench appearance coming during the 2003-04 season and the other coming during the 2009-10 season.  Former Trail Blazer Buck Williams rounds out the top five, as he too started in 998 of his first 1,000 career games.  In case you’re wondering, Russell Westbrook came off the bench the first 17 games of his career, so he won’t be joining the list. Kevin Durant and Chris Paul could, though. While each still has a long way to go before hitting the 1,000-game plateau, Durant has started in all 725 of his career appearances while Paul has done the same through the first 843 games of his career.

I was thinking James Harden and Russell Westbrook. Both great at rebounding and passing and also pretty great defenders who can score when they want basically.
"Two other points:   1. Russell Westbrook is probably not the type of player that would allow him to play his type of game.   2. He’s probably still rusty from playing on bad teams for so long, he probably picked up some bad trends it takes time to correct. "
"You misinterpreted his comment. He said Kawhi struggles with DeMar after someone said he'd clamp him down. Their most recent game, DeMar DeRozan dropped 26 on him on 57% shooting.  For their 8 meetings, DeMar Derozan averages 20.3 points, 3.3 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 2.8 TOVs on 46.9 FG%.  Kawhi averages 12.1, 6.9, 1.9 and 1.4 on 44.7 FG%. If you want to add steals 1.8 for Kawhi and .9 for DeRozan.  I'm not saying Kawhi hasn't improved offensively against DeRozan but if we're using the cut off you used of 2015. DeRozan has shot 50% against him while averaging 23.25 points and having 2-2 in said games.  While Kawhi shot 46.34% while averaging 16.75 points. So DeRozan has both the offensive edge and defensive edge.   If you use that same time frame for Russell Westbrook or James Harden instead of DeRozan, you'll see they struggle and neither has average 50% shooting on him during that time. 42.59% while averaging 28.1 points for Harden. 38.93% while averaging 23.86 points for Westbrook. Now they both average more rebounds and assists the DeRozan but it shows DeRozan can score on Kawhi way more efficiently than other stars."
"Curry didnt start playing in 14-15. The year before he won 51 games with David Lee being the teams 2nd best player. Westbrook couldnt even win 50 with PG.   And the year before that he won 47 games and actually won a playoff round, something westbrook has never done since being the “man”. 2 first round exits for little russell."
Happy Russell Westbrook day!

During his last years Kobe was one of the most shat on players in this sub. These were James Harden and Russell Westbrook level rips people would do on Kobe. 
I love Russell Westbrook.
* 1) LeBron James * 2) Kevin Durant * 3) James Harden * 4) Kawhi Leonard * 5) Anthony Davis * 6) Stephen Curry * 7) Russell Westbrook * 8) Giannis Antetokounmpo * 9) Paul George * 10) Joel Embiid 
"1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Steph Curry   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard  6. Russell Westbrook 6. Anthony Davis   7. Giannis Antetokounmpo   8. Chris Paul   9. Jimmy Butler   10. Paul George  Kawhi needs to be top 5 at least. He gets a lot of flak for how he sat out last year (and deservedly so), but that doesn't take away from his game on the court. He's suffocating on defense and has a complete game on the offensive side.  Dame is a top 15 player to me. Fantastic shooter and scorer, but leaves a bit to be desired on the defensive end. He's stepped up his defensive game, but he's no Chris Paul when it comes to D. On top of that, CP3 is a better floor general who can run an offense and get others to score. This makes him more valuable overall since he improves the entire team, whereas teams who play the Blazers can focus on stopping Lillard in particular.  Embiid is fantastic early on in his career, however we need to see his high level of play sustained. I don't think he's quite there yet, but with another strong year under his belt this year I think he can crack the top 10. He's a tough matchup for anyone, but others have gotten the best of him whereas guys like Jimmy Butler and Paul George are permanent threats. It's tough to compare a center to a wing and argue their value. All of Butler, PG, and Embiid are fantastic defenders, but I think Butler and PG can shut everyone down whereas Embiid still struggles against some matchups.  Butler and PG make the list due to their suffocating defense paired with a very strong offensive game. They're similar players overall that just do it all and always find ways to score."
???? Singler's older than fucking Russell Westbrook? How long did that man stay in college???
Not a bad list.   Personally mine would be   1. Lebron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. James Harden  5. Antony Davis  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Russell Westbrook  8. Kawhi Leonard  9. Joel Embiid  10. Damian Lillard.   Really just comes to perception.   The 10-20 range however is really tough   
"In a 1 on 1 sport, Russell Westbrook might be one of the greatest players to ever live. But in the 5 on 5 NBA, I don't think I would pick Westbrook ahead of 10 other guys if I wanted to win a conference finals game. Again, he's one of the most entertaining players to watch on a nightly basis, but there are other guys I would take ahead of him.  Idk what the argument is for Dame Lillard as a top 10 player given that he's 0-10 in his last 10 playoff games. If you're a top 10 player on a healthy team I expect you not to get swept by the lower seed missing their 2nd best player. I think there's a better argument for two other point guards (CP3 and Kyrie) than there is for Dame.  Embiid has more to prove to me. His struggles defending Al Horford and then going up against Aron Baynes showed some weaknesses in his game that make me put guys like Paul George and Kyrie Irving over him. Not hating, just a TBD based on health and how he improves in his first fully healthy offseason. "
 * 1.) Lebron James   * 2.) Kevin Durant  * 3.) Stephen Curry  * 4.) James Harden  * 5.) Kawhi Leonard   * 6.) Anthony Davis   * 7.) Russell Westbrook  * 8.) Joel Embiid   * 9.) Giannis Anteokoumpo   * 10.) Kyrie Irving 
"Agreed.  When I said we ran into the Rudy Gobert wall, what I meant was: his presence shuts down Russell's attacking game and frustrates the Russell-Adams pick-and-roll. Instead of adjusting, Billy didn't make any changes. It ended up having Russell look silly and uncomfortable on the court (the first time I've ever seen him look scared or hesitant on the court). And then since PG didn't have any penetration to work with, and because Ingles got in his grill and didn't give him any airspace, he got shook as well.  We have more weapons to work with this year, so hopefully Billy finds an answer to how to keep Westbrook's game alive with Gobert on the court. And with hopefully healthy Roberson and Noel added to the team, I think we can win a gritty defensive grind-it-out fest with them, as long as Westbrook and PG don't get shook again. Donovan, Rubio, Ingles, and Gobert were all deep deep in their heads."
Using this comment to try out the table formatting:  EDIT: If anyone can explain how to format tables I'll try and post it here  EDIT 2: Not quite right but the website's crashing now so I'll take it (this has all players with 3+ FGAs).

"I love John Wall as a dark horse MVP, he’s fully capable of pulling off a Derrick Rose/Russell Westbrook-type season that got them their MVP, especially in a wide-open East."
"I’d like to say my favorite player Russell Westbrook, I think if he made just a few tweaks he could be so so much better. "

Russell Westbrook
Grown men acting all entitled and demanding that another man stay or need advance notice. That’s your Russell Westbrook. 
"Russell would be deandre with better defense, passing, and maybe speed. Wilt would be a taller prime Dwight with a much better post game.  West I’m not 100% sold on a good comp, but I’ve hear him being considered to be a good shooter from what would be 3 point range, so I guess Lowry but taller and better on d. Elgin, I think, would be like prime lance, maybe, since they have similar size and Baylor is a great rebounder. Probably a better scorer, though. Oscar would be closest to Westbrook, since top notch scorers and rebounders playing the point guard aren’t exactly common"
"You could've just said ""Fuck Russell Westbrook, he's garbage as fuck"" and it would've been a better post than this"
"Westbrook is more talented, but Chauncey was a better leader. I guess it's like Wilt vs Russell in a way. "
"Here's the last 9 MVP awards, I think you'll notice a trend and which one doesn't fit...   * 2008-2009 LeBron Jame MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2009-2010 LeBron James MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2010-2011 Derrick Rose MVP: ....LeBron led the league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2011-2012 LeBron James MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2012-2013 LeBron James MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2013-2014 Kevin Durrant MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2014-2015 Steph Curry MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2015-2016 Steph Curry MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2016-2017 Russell Westbrook MVP: Led league in value over replacement player. (Durrant led the league in win shares per 48).  If you provide more value than the next closest player in the league you pretty much get Most *VALUABLE* Player. The only exceptions to that rule in the last 10 years are Kobe Bryant in 2007-2008 and Derrick Rose in 2010-2011. Personally, I think LeBron should have won both of those MVP awards."
"NBA rookie of the year predictions - Deandre Ayton, Luka Doncic or a dark horse?  Kevin Pelton: With NBA summer league in the books, we've gotten our last look at rookies until training camp. With rosters more or less set, we also know what kind of opportunities this year's draft picks will have to play and potentially take leading roles for their squads. So now seems to be a good time to revisit what looks like a wide-open race for Rookie of the Year.  Mike, given all that, who's your Rookie of the Year favorite?   Mike Schmitz: Luka Doncic. As you wrote in a 5-on-5, Doncic was one of summer league's biggest winners without even playing a game.  As we anticipated before the draft, no other top-tier prospect has looked like a surefire franchise-changer thus far, and Doncic -- as was the case prior to Vegas -- is my favorite to take home 2018-19 ROY award.  Doncic is the most ready-to-contribute prospect in this class despite not turning 20 until next February. Over the past three seasons, Doncic has logged 1,686 EuroLeague minutes, 2,257 Spanish ACB minutes and 262 minutes at the FIBA senior level, while even mixing in a couple of NBA preseason games.  Although he's yet to play an NBA game, you could argue that Doncic has more high-level experience to his name than new teammate Dennis Smith Jr. (3,162 combined NBA and NCAA minutes) and a handful of other 2017 one-and-done draftees. Having faced off with the likes of Kristaps Porzingis, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Russell Westbrook, Evan Fournier, the Gasol Brothers and other pros, Doncic's transition should be relatively smooth.  And the 6-foot-8 Slovenian sensation is truly in an ideal situation to maximize his talents. At his best as a ball-screen facilitator, Doncic has dynamic lob-catchers in DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Powell and floor spacers in Wes Matthews, Dirk Nowitzki, Harrison Barnes and Ryan Broekhoff. If he struggles to break down athletic defenders, Doncic has ball-handlers like Smith, J.J. Barea and Jalen Brunson next to him as well.  Having an offensive guru like Mavs coach Rick Carlisle at the helm is ideal for Doncic, as Carlisle is likely to use him in creative ways. The Dallas coach has already talked about playing Doncic some as a playmaking, small-ball 4 for stretches. And the fact that the Mavericks are hoping to make a playoff push during Dirk's final years -- having given up their protected 2019 first-round pick in the Trae Young trade -- also bodes well for Doncic's ROY chances.  Deandre Ayton and Marvin Bagley III should have some monstrous scoring/rebounding games, and long-armed bigs Jaren Jackson Jr. and Mohamed Bamba should show flashes of long-term potential, but Doncic is a legitimate triple-double threat who should have an immediate impact on winning while maintaining the impressive efficiency he's shown throughout his career.  Kevin, who is your ROY favorite, and do you have an early over/under for Doncic triple-doubles?  Pelton: Although I agree with you that Doncic is likely to be the most valuable rookie, I'm going to go with Ayton as the favorite.  After all, voting in the past has tended to reflect who puts up the best per-game stats much more than who does the most to help their team win. With other scoring threats in Dallas, that's less likely to be Doncic, and his playing time may also be limited as the Mavericks try to manage wear and tear after Doncic played far more at a younger age than prospects who went the traditional college route. That might hurt his chances at triple-doubles, too.  Without much help from his team's guards, Ayton averaged 19.5 points and 14.0 rebounds per 36 minutes this summer. He can seem to be having relatively little impact on the game and still end up with a double-double because he's such a dominant physical presence in the paint.  If the Phoenix Suns figure out how to use Ayton's scoring ability, with more talent around him than in Las Vegas, he's got a chance to lead all rookies in both scoring and rebounding. That should all but assure him Rookie of the Year.  Naturally, Doncic is my second choice. Do you have Ayton second?  Schmitz: Your points are well taken, KP. I do think that Doncic can provide enough value as a passer and rebounder to outweigh some expected lulls in the scoring department, but it's hard to argue against Ayton being the most productive rookie in terms of buckets and boards, and he's the clear No. 2 on my list.  Plus, we should consider how important a developmentally-focused coach like Igor Kokoskov will be for Ayton as a rookie. Although he's a rookie himself, Kokoskov will find ways to get Ayton in empty-side pick-and-rolls for lobs and quick-hitting dunks off deep seals in the post.  The likely challengers Schmitz: After the top two, things open up a little bit. Who do you have No. 3 on your list?  Pelton: Trae Young. I wouldn't put Young third in terms of, say, chances of making the All-Rookie Team. But when it comes to winning Rookie of the Year, Young's boom-or-bust potential becomes a positive. It's a long shot -- his favorite kind -- but there are scenarios where Young carries over the exceptional playmaking we saw from him this summer while finding his shot on a consistent basis, and if that happens, it's possible he's both the best and most productive rookie.  After all, we just saw something similar from Young at the college level last season as he defied relatively low expectations to lead the NCAA in both scoring and assists as a freshman.  What do you think about Young's chances and who do you have No. 3?  Schmitz: I agree that the boom-or-bust factor certainly comes into play with Young. He has more opportunity to win the award than the rookies who won't have the role or freedom to go off for 30 points and 10 assists any given night, regardless of efficiency. With winning not a 2018-19 priority in Atlanta, he'll have the luxury to play through mistakes and defensive shortcomings while putting up points and assists. As you said, we've seen what he can do statistically when given volume on a team not exactly loaded with talent.  That said, I'm not quite as close to ""boom"" status on his boom-bust spectrum. I still have some concerns about Young's ability to score efficiently at the NBA level, and I'm not sure he'll be able to get to the free throw line as much as he did in college. When his free throw attempts dried up at Oklahoma, his true shooting percentage took a big hit. I agree with you more or less, but I'm not quite as bullish on Young's rookie campaign. Therefore, he's just outside my top five.  I rank Bagley No. 3. Although we didn't see it in Vegas or Sacramento, Bagley is a walking double-double, like Ayton. His hunger to score, athleticism and aggression on the offensive glass should lead to some big scoring and rebounding nights, even if he doesn't always make others better or impact winning.  I don't think he's a better prospect than Jackson, Bamba or Wendell Carter Jr., but as you said earlier, production matters in ROY voting -- even if they're empty calories. It's hard to ignore his 21.0 points and 11.1 rebounds per game with a 65.2 true shooting percentage at Duke. I like that Bagley doesn't need much offense run for him to get his stats, and the Kings will certainly do everything they can to justify taking him over Doncic and a host of other interesting prospects.  Did Bagley crack your top five, and who do you have No. 4?  Pelton: We generally agree about Bagley. I don't want to overreact to his poor summer-league performance, and he's got a better opportunity to play big minutes and be featured in the offense than the likes of Jackson, Bamba and Carter. So I'd put Bagley fourth. Who do you have in that spot?  Schmitz: I have Carter. I do have concerns about his potential lack of opportunities to score in Chicago, given some of his offense-first teammates. He's not likely to put up points like an Ayton or Bagley, but his talent and potential for immediate impact given his physical profile and all-around game are undeniable.  We've been high on Carter since we first evaluated him as a 15-year-old, as we ranked him fourth in our initial 2018 mock draft in October of 2016. He's proven capable of scoring efficiently inside and outside, he protects the rim, and he rebounds at a high level.  Even if the roster may seem a bit crowded, it would be wise of the Bulls to feed Carter as many minutes as possible, as he truly has a chance to be one of the best prospects from the 2018 draft class.  Pelton: I like Carter much better as a prospect than a Rookie of the Year candidate. If he can beat out Robin Lopez for playing time, Carter's still going to be fighting for touches and shots with Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine, Lauri Markkanen and now Jabari Parker. So I think it will be tough for him to crack double-digit scoring.  My last spot in the top five is going to Kevin Knox, about whom my feelings are more or less reversed. As I noted, Knox wasn't nearly as effective in summer league as you would think from watching him play -- or listening to people talk about his performance.  The explanation, naturally, is that most of Knox's value comes from scoring. And while the New York Knicks do have some other options in Trey Burke, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Enes Kanter, I think Knox is much more likely to be a go-to scorer this season than Carter."
"Just googled it, you mean this?  &gt; Asked what rookies have caught his attention this year, he didn't mince words.  &gt; ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  &gt; ""I don't really listen to comparisons,"" Simmons said. ""You can compare players and whatever it is, but at the same time, everybody is their own player.""  &gt; ""Coming off a broken foot is definitely not an edge, but people are always going to say what they want to say,"" Simmons said. ""But at the end of the day, this is my first year in the league. If you're a guy coming from overseas, you're still a rookie and you can be 30 years old. So there's a rule in there.""  &gt; ""Who would I pick? Me, 100 percent,"" Simmons told ESPN at the Ritz-Carlton in downtown Philadelphia on Saturday.  &gt; ""I think I have been playing solid all year,"" he continued. ""If you look at the numbers, you will see. People who know the game know.""  &gt; ""He put me in position as the point guard, and I don't think he thought it would work out this well as it has,"" Simmons said. ""I think it is a lot of credit to Coach for sticking me in that position and trusting me.""  &gt; And although the Rookie of the Year award may be the first personal goal he would like to obtain, he has loftier goals in sight.  &gt; ""Championships,"" Simmons said. ""I want to be the Defensive Player of the Year ... MVP. There's a lot of accolades I want to get, but I ultimately want to win a ring.""  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23089422/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-says-100-percent-rookie-year  Doesn't sound cocky, sounds like every athlete ever. Faith in himself, competitive, lofty goals, but credit your coach, object to direct comparisons, just say you're chasing the greats. ""No other rookie impressed me"" is twisting his words."
"I said KD was better than 2006 Kobe, you said it was because Kobe had a shitty supporting cast. You said the reason that KD was better was because he had Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka, while Kobe had Smush and Kwame.    So I used 2003 Kobe instead. Why is 2014 KDs stats still so much better than 2003 Kobe's?  "
"One player had a point guard named Russell Westbrook and Surge Ibaka in his prime at power forward to ease the burden, the other player had Smush Parker and Kwame Brown. "
Russell Westbrook is NOT a class act nor does he care about the troops
"Yeah, Russell Westbrook and Devin Booker always come to mind for me. Like, just for the meh stat lines. Although Booker was on a stacked Kentucky team."
Russell Westbrook is a ball hogging stat padder ~~all over again~~ every year 
Bulls - MJ  Cavs - LeBron  Bucks - Kareem  Celtics - Bill Russell  Lakers - Magic Johnson  Spurs - Tim Duncan  Rockets - Hakeem  Kings - Oscar Robertson  76ers - Dr. J  Pistons - Isiah Thomas  Gets tough here  Warriors - Stephen Curry (Has he passed Rick Barry yet?)  Heat - Dwyane Wade  KD has potential to go here for the Thunder somewhere. Above Wade maybe? But I would say many people will consider Payton the best in franchise history. Or even Westbrook because of the MVP and commitment to the franchise idk.  Might do the rest later but this is a lot of work
Teen Wolf played by Russell Westbrook
"He doesn't have to, but he's not going to be a household name like he seemingly wants to be if 98 percent of basketball fans don't know what his voice even sounds like.  He can be the quiet superstar, but there's a reason that doesn't stick out as much as Russell ""I got my wardrobe from a Wizard of Oz set"" Westbrook."
"Yup, this whole thing stemmed from the nice cars Russell Westbrook was getting shuttled around in. Shut the fuck up already, this is getting infantile now. "
36% is barely above the league average so I would not call him elite either. Russell westbrook jacks a lot of threes and has made a bunch does that mean he is an elite 3 shooter? Nooooooooo
"Russell Westbrook as Michael Corleone in Godfather I and II actually works perfectly:  “Kevin, you’re my older brother and I love you. But don’t ever take sides against the family again. Ever.”   “I know it was you, Kevin. You broke my heart. You broke my heart.”"
Replace Colin Farrell in In Bruges with Russell Westbrook and sap the movie of all of its humor.
"We've all indulged our binge-eating impulses at some point, but Thanksgiving-like dinners right before a basketball game is over the top. Perhaps even a little dangerous, what with all the running on a full stomach and potential puking that could follow.  Turns out Russell had similar concerns.  ""I'm like, 'Steven, this your pregame meal dawg'"" Westbrook recalled. ""He [Adams] goes, 'Mate, in New Zealand, we eat fish heads, we drink a little beer, we have a fist fight, we go back to hotel, take big [expletive] and then we go [play].'"""
"&gt; ""Leonard and his traveling companions noticed other All-Stars — notably Oklahoma City point guard Russell Westbrook — were using private luxury cars to get around, instead of the standard transportation provided by the NBA. They wanted the star treatment, too,"" McDonald wrote."
Kobe is about 6’5. Russell Westbrook is considerbly shorter.
"Whether there was any truth to it, for KD's whole time in OKC the public perception of him was that he was this abnormally nice person. He had the whole MVP speech where he thanked his mom in tears (You the real MVP!). There was also the juxtaposition between him and Russell Westbrook who was perceived kind of as KD's opposite, intense and angry all the time. "
"Move Russell Westbrook off the list, and Harden wasn't top 5 the last season Kawhi was healthy.  Also, he's a top 3 player when 100%. He's an efficient Kobe with Pippen's defense"
Russell Westbrook if the game is within 3 under 6 seconds and he's missed 6 straight.  It's like bricking shots gives him extra powers in the clutch.
"Number of seasons with one team since Dirk entered the league:  20 - Dirk Nowitzki  16 - Manu Ginobili  11 - Mike Conley  10 - Russell Westbrook  10 - Marc Gasol  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_players_who_have_spent_their_entire_career_with_one_franchise  All of them could be considered stars at some point in their careers minimum.  EDIT: Added ""since Dirk"" because that is what I was replying to and there was minor confusion."

"Completely agree with this comment. I didn't believe this infographic so I went back and wrote down every top 10 pick that became an All-Star from the 2000-2015 drafts. Draft position and number of All-Star seasons noted in the parentheses next to the player's name.    **2000** Kenyon Martin (Pick #1, 1x All-Star)   **2001** Tyson Chandler (Pick #2, 1x All-Star) Pau Gasol (Pick #3, 6x All-Star) Joe Johnson (Pick #10, 7x All-Star)  **2002** Yao Ming (Pick #1, 8x All-Star) Amar’e Stoudemire (Pick #9, 6x All-Star) Caron Butler (Pick #10, 2x All-Star)  **2003** LeBron James (Pick #1, 14x All-Star) Carmelo Anthony (Pick #3, 10x All-Star) Chris Bosh (Pick #4, 11x All-Star) Dwyane Wade (Pick #5, 12x All-Star) Chris Kaman (Pick #6, 1x All-Star)  **2004** Dwight Howard (Pick #1, 8x All-Star) Devin Harris (Pick #5, 1x All-Star) Luol Deng (Pick #7, 2x All-Star) Andre Iguodala (Pick #9, 1x All-Star)  **2005** Deron Williams (Pick #3, 3x All-Star) Chris Paul (Pick #4, 9x All-Star) Andrew Bynum (Pick #10, 1x All-Star)  **2006** LaMarcus Aldridge (Pick #2, 6x All-Star) Brandon Roy (Pick #6, 3x All-Star)  **2007** Kevin Durant (Pick #2, 9x All-Star) Al Horford (Pick #3, 5x All-Star)  Joakim Noah (Pick #9, 2x All-Star)  **2008** Derrick Rose (Pick #1, 3x All-Star)  Russell Westbrook (Pick #4, 7x All-Star) Kevin Love (Pick #5, 5x All-Star)  Brook Lopez (Pick #10, 1x All-Star)  **2009** Blake Griffin (Pick #1, 5x All-Star) James Harden (Pick #3, 6x All-Star) Stephen Curry (Pick #7, 5x All-Star)  DeMar DeRozan (Pick #9, 4x All-Star)  **2010** John Wall (Pick #1, 5x All-Star) DeMarcus Cousins (Pick #5, 4x All-Star) Gordon Hayward (Pick #9, 1x All-Star) Paul George (Pick #10, 5x All-Star)  **2011** Kyrie Irving (Pick #1, 5x All-Star) Kemba Walker (Pick #9, 2x All-Star)  **2012** Anthony Davis (Pick #1, 5x All-Star) Bradley Beal (Pick #3, 1x All-Star) Damian Lillard (Pick #6, 3x All-Star) Andre Drummond (Pick #8, 2x All-Star)  **2013** Victor Oladipo (Pick #2, 1x All-Star)  **2014** Joel Embiid (Pick #3, 1x All-Star)  **2015** Karl-Anthony Towns (Pick #1, 1x All-Star) Kristaps Porzingis (Pick #4, 1x All-Star)  So over a 15-year period, 46 All-Stars were drafted in the top-10 of an NBA draft. This gives a 30.7% chance of drafting an All-Star with a top-10 pick (46/150). If you only look at top-5 picks, the percentage creeps up slightly to 37.3% (28/75). Most of these players have made multiple All-Star games, and there is still time for younger players drafted in the top-10 after 2012 or 2013 to develop into All-Stars, so these percentages might be an underestimate. It's obvious that the top of the draft will give you the best chance at drafting an All-Star caliber player, and the results back that assumption.   When looking at the number of All-Star games each player played in, the data show that 41.3% (19/46) of the All-Stars drafted in the top-10 only made 1 or 2 times. These types of players (Harris, Deng, Iguodala, Noah, etc.) aren't necessarily players an average fan would consider ""All-Star caliber"" but were good enough during their peaks to be selected once or twice. This percentage may be skewed a little higher than it should be as a few of the younger players taken in the 2012-2015 drafts are just entering their primes and will undoubtedly be selected to more All-Star games in the future, but this effect may also be canceled out by new players who have not yet made an ASG and are selected only once or twice in their careers.     A lot of people assume that the moniker of All-Star means that a player is a top-10 or top-15 player in the league, but the fact of the matter is that 24 players are selected as All-Stars each year, and sometimes that number is inflated due to injury replacements. In fact, out of the 46 players who were drafted in the top-10 and have been selected to the All-Star team, 47.8% (22/46) have been selected 5 or more times. I chose the cut-off of 5 ASG selections arbitrarily, but the idea behind it was that a player must be an All-Star for the better part of a decade to be considered a ""perennial All-Star."" To the average fan, these are the players people typically classify as ""All-Stars"" because they make it to the ASG year after year. This percentage might be a little low as a few players drafted between 2009-2015 still haven't made 5 All-Star games, but I would bet they do by the end of their careers (DeRozan, Lillard, Embiid, etc.). However, the total number of players drafted in the top-10 who are selected as an All-Star could increase, which would also impact this percentage.     **TL;DR**  A lot more top-10 picks become All-Stars than people think (30.7%). A good amount (41.3%) only make it to the ASG once or twice in their careers, but more (47.8%%) end up becoming ""perennial All-Star"" players that we typically think of when we talk about All-Star players."
Russell Westbrook staring intensifies
Russell Westbrook still hasn’t figured out how to pass the ball to teammates when they’re in a rhythm or stop going 1on3 at times.   He’s been a pro for years.
"If you think he should have to comb through film for each dunk he’s going to post a picture of to verify whether it actually happened, YOU are insane. It’s nba star Russell Westbrook going up for a dunk, hey I should use that to promote this event called dunk week. It’s that simple.   And whether it’s an 11 billion organization or an 11 million organization, that means jack shit for how much you’re going to pay for a social media guy to post on twitter for you lmao. It’s a fckn Twitter handle, get a grip. "
"I mean there are reasons to be low on DSJ but spouting off his FG%/3FG%/FT% isn't the most informed way to go about it. Tons of rookie one-and-done lead guards are inefficient, just look at Kemba Walker (36/31/79) or Russell Westbrook (40/27/82) or John Wall (41/30/77).   And it's not like DSJ was alone in terms of poor efficiency among the 2017 guard class outside of Mitchell. Fultz (41/0/48) and Ball (36/31/45) and Fox (41/31/72) and Ntilikina (36/32/72) and Monk (36/34/84) all struggled."

"People hate on Lonzo like he's the worst shooter ever, but he shot better from three last year than Russell Westbrook did ( 30.5% for Lonzo vs 29.8% for WB). Ben Simmons, meanwhile, is less of an outside threat than Timofey Mozgov is. That's not a joke, btw. Mozgov was 4/18 from three last year. Simmons was 0/11."
"I was at a restaurant in Scottsdale, AZ, in the early spring/late winter of this year. As I first walked in, I immediately recognized Tyson Chandler. I did a double-take, as I couldn't believe that someone I had seen so often on T.V. and on 2K was right in front of me. I don't normally get starstruck, but BALL IS LIFE, folks. Tyson was sitting in a booth, talking to someone wearing a baseball cap. I couldn't see who that was. My fiancée knew how much this meant to me, as I often try to get her into basketball (Prime Derrick Rose compilation videos, anyone?). She encouraged me to walk up and say hello, so I did. As I approached the booth, I was able to see who Tyson's lunch companion was: NBA legend Jason Kidd. I walked up to the table and, apologizing for interrupting their lunch, expressed my admiration. As a Bulls fan, I wanted Tyson to know that I appreciated his contribution to the team. 2001-2006 was a tough stretch for Chicago Bulls basketball. Both of them kindly shook my hand and told me thanks. When I sat down, my fiancée observed that I was zoned out-- clearly starstruck. I explained to her that Kidd and Chandler were teammates of the 2011 NBA Champion Dallas Mavericks, and how important it was that they beat the Miami Heat, how special their brand of basketball was, and how special their fraternal bond and reunions as teammates must be. Kidd obviously had been let go by Milwaukee at the time, so he certainly had all the time in the world to have brunch in Arizona. I heard he has a home there? The waiter shared my enthusiasm, and said, ""you should have been here last week, Russell Westbrook was here."" I would have literally lost my marbles if I was. "
"In late 2011 Chris Paul was traded in a 3-team trade to the Los Angeles Clippers. In my theoretical ""what if"" scenario, my question is: could OKC have traded for CP3 by including Russell Westbrook (and most likely other assets?). If so, what would the deal look like?"
"This dude put Pau Gasol, James Harden and Carmelo Anthony as the top 3 picks at the #3 spot.  How does he leave off Jordan?  Now if you say he is putting some what more recent players (but the had guys that were MJ's contemporaries on there) then the #4 spot is also messed up.  He had CP3 (valid), and then Russell Westbrook and Mutombo both made it over Wade.  You can make a cause for any of these guys but I would give the nod to Wade over Westbrook and Mutombo."
And the award for most FGA attempts in any zone? LAbron with 710 attempts in the RA on a 75% clip.    He also owns the award for most FGA in the season with 2090 FGA.    EDIT: Top 3 for the season (FGA totals)    LeBron James - 2090   Russell Westbrook - 1848   James Harden - 1834    
"Kobe said it himself that Russ is the person who reminds him most of himself today.  &gt;“When I turn on the TV and I watch players play, the player that plays with the same kind of emotion and grit and competitive intensity is Russell [Westbrook],” Bryant said of the All-Star guard. “Russell is going hard. Doesn’t matter who he is playing against, doesn’t matter what the odds are, he’s going, that’s a guy, he is going 110 percent every single time.”  Blog bois obviously know more about who reminds them of Kobe than Kobe himself though."
"Man if you watch his YouTube compilations you would think the guy was a fat Russell Westbrook, which would be somewhat true "

You got it. Gobert did shut down MVP Russell Westbrook/Paul George/ Carmelo Anthony and Steven Adams. Defense is a huge part of basketball.
Nobody will ever win anything of they have Russell Westbrook on their team.
"Lol whatever dude, a 9/10 top pick is like a prime D Wade or AD or KD type of player (LeBron is a 10 out of 10 of course). Any of those will destroy the 2018 Jazz with Russell Westbrook as teammate."

c'mon man we don't have to do this here.  everybody knows that Westbrook is a perennial All-Star All-NBA and MVP.  I'll take Ingram but seriously we don't have to shit on RWB every second especially right now.  We know that nobody will ever win anything with Russell Westbrook on their team. 
How could you hate Russell Westbrook? You've been watching to much Colin Cowherd haven't you.
Thunder will definitely make it over the Pacers if anything... can’t not have Russell Westbrook playing on Christmas
"Russell Westbrook has been top 5 in MVP voting the last 4 years (ever since he missed half of the 2014 season to get three different knee surgeries).    Only LeBron James can say the same.     Westbrook was an MVP caliber player long before he actually won his MVP, and while KD was still on the Thunder. "
In 2012?  Chris Paul Russell Westbrook Tony Parker Deron Williams  Then I'd probably put Rondo up there.
Russell Westbrook. Too easy.   
"&gt; guaranteeing me 32/6/6 (those are roughly his numbers before his return with the Wizards) - that's 5 points higher than LeBron.  First of all, it was more like 5 assists a game, not 6.  Second, yeah he put up 4.6 more points than LeBron on 4.1 more shots a game.  LeBron has had FOUR seasons where he posted better shooting efficiency than MJ's *most efficient season ever*, including the last two seasons.  &gt; and he's not that much worse than LeBron as a passer   given that LeBron is considered by many to be a top 5 passer of all time, that seems laughably untrue.  &gt; considering he had 10 triple-doubles in the 11 games he played as a point guard  TIL Russell Westbrook is one of the best passers of all time.  Yes, MJ posted 10 triple doubles in 11 games.  The Bulls also went 5-6 (they went 42-28 the rest of the season)."
Bill Russell. Westbrook isn't a GOAT candidate... at all.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/94vf3o/kareem_abduljabbar_been_in_south_africa_wnba/e3ofxxp/

James Harden also came into the draft as after his sophomore season and draymond spent 4 years. klay was a junior and Russell Westbrook was a soph.  Edit: grammar 
"In the case of +/- and defensive stats in particular, the eye test and other non-statistical context (or, less common statistical context) is key. Does a guy have an amazing +/- despite not really seeming *that* good (or vice versa)? Check the lineups he’s playing with, there’s every chance he’s getting carried or brought down by his teammates. 2016 Draymond Green is a good example of this. Very good player, obviously, but his record-setting +/- numbers were also the result of having a ludicrously talented team around him, and rarely playing garbage time which is where those types of stats can get muddled.  With defensive stats, a lot of them are wholly or partially box score-based. So a guy like LeBron James might look good on a lot of those stats because he gets a lot of rebounds and blocks, but rebound numbers are extremely situational (see also: Westbrook, Russell) and his blocks are often chase downs where he can use his athleticism to offset any questionable technique rather than more typical half court sets, there’s a reason you don’t see him listed among top rim protectors very often. It’s often a matter of what you value more personally (one-on-one D, ability to switch, ability to stick to a system, raw athleticism, the importance of defensive rebounding) as to who you would consider a good defender, defensive stats aren’t often capable of answering those questions for you."
Russell Westbrook?
"By that logic we could say we saw how LeBron struggled against solid defensive teams with very adept scorers in last years playoffs, and OKC is the leading team in terms of that. Instead of Bojan Bogdonavic and Victor Oladipo pestering LeBron, it'll be Paul George and Russell Westbrook. If you say the obvious ""Cavs aren't the Lakers"", this OKC team is different than last years in terms of personnel too. Add Roberson, a premier defender, and subtract Melo, who was a very big negative in the role he played."
What did Russell Westbrook say?
"Russell Westbrook is not without a doubt a top 5-6 player in the NBA, lol"
"Russell Westbrook is still the most athletic good pg in the league, Dwight Howard is quite the specimen. "
"2000s All-Decade Draft Team  Starters  G: Steph Curry  G: James Harden  F: LeBron James  F: Kevin Durant  C: Al Horford  Bench  Russell Westbrook — Chris Paul — DeMar DeRozan — Kyle Lowry — Jrue Holiday — Goran Dragic — LaMarcus Aldridge — Kevin Love — Blake Griffin — Marc Gasol  2010s All-Decade Draft Team  Starters  G: Kyrie Irving  G: Paul George  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Anthony Davis  Bench  Damian Lillard — Bradley Beal — Victor Oladipo — Klay Thompson — Jimmy Butler — Nikola Jokic — Kristaps Porzingis — Karl-Anthony Towns — Joel Embiid — DeMarcus Cousins  ...wow, this is tough. I guess I’d give the ever so slight edge to the 2000s. The 2010s is way deeper (not to mention guys like Gobert, Green, Wall, Simmons, Mitchell, etc. aren’t even listed), but I like the 2000s starters just a little bit more. LeBron on the same team as KD, Steph, and Harden would be nasty. If it were a 7-game series, it’d definitely go 7. But I’ll take the 2000s, barely."
Russell Westbrook and [Bruce Brown](http://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/165875/bruce-brown)
"And that tends to lead to some really fucked up ratings, as in order to make some players have an overall that actually reflects how good they are, they have to have individual ratings that straight up do not make sense. Just as an example, Russell Westbrook is without a doubt a top 5-6 player in the NBA. However, in order for him to get to that, they ended up giving him ratings that put him at an A- for perimeter defense. As a frame of reference, Andre Roberson and Paul George, two of the best wing defenders in the NBA, are barely above that at an A, and Steven Adams, one of the best rim protectors, has an A- for his post defense.  I like Westbrook, but anyone who says that he's remotely close to that good on defense is either lying or is delusional."

"Hahaha what is this link suppose to say? I love Iverson dude, but those are simple but nice dunks. Just google Russell Westbrook top dunks and .. .. it’s just sad I don’t even wanna continue"
Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook. There's a couple smaller players but they are so random no one will have any idea who they are. 
Russell Westbrook and Marcus Smart. 
"Well you say ATHLETIC PG, and athletically they are both magnificent athletics in their own regards because not only did Rose jump high, he was crafty around the rim; whereas Russ jumps super high as well but maybe not as crafty as Rose was, we come to the argument of PG. A POINTGUARD in my definition is someone who distributes the ball and facilitated movement. In that case, I’ll give it to Russ because I mean.. .  . 2x triple double seasons. In a row. And Rose was kinda a good passer but isn’t really known to be creative at getting his teammates open. So to answer your question, DEREK ROSE by definition of the most Athletic PG we’ve ever had; NOPE. Russell (triple-double) Westbrook is the most athletic monster pointguard beast I have ever seen.   Then there’s the rage of Russ"
Russell Westbrook.  His tenacity is unmatched
For a moment I read   &gt;Looks like another baby coming for Russell and **Ninja** Westbrook. Congratulations to the family.  For some reason it didn't feel that weird.
"Russell Westbrook, the epitome of driving hard inside and scoring "
"Players in the top 10 of assists per game last year: Russell Westbrook, LeBron James, James Harden, Rajon Rondo, Ben Simmons, Chris Paul, Draymond Green, Jeff Teague, Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard.  All 10 of their teams made the playoffs last year, and all 10 have been all stars  Obviously it's possible to put up empty stats but Jose's weren't. He was on an, albeit not elite, but winning team. 13 points is not a lot but his efficiency was elite. If he was slightly more selfish and put up 16/8 on 45/38/95 would we even be having this conversation?"
"Yeah, a lot of these teams seem like they'd be worse than the sum of their parts. Golden State would continue to be dominant because you're basically swapping out Klay for PG having Russell Westbrook come off the bench as a spark-plug, and giving them a shitload of depth, but man, I really like that Celtucks roster. "
Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook
"Come on, why involve Russell Westbrook in this. "
I know I just shortened Russell to Russ . Bill Russell Westbrook
"this is a highlight-driven sport, i don’t see what’s wrong with that. are you going to tell someone who watches a lot of kyrie irving or russell westbrook highlights that there’s some important part of those guys’s games that don’t show up in the highlights?"

I read “Russell Westbrook Blocks **KG**” and got really confused. 
Russell Westbrook in the last game of 2018 attempted 19 three pointers.
1.) Russell Westbrook  2.) Paul George  3.) Dirk   4.) Tim Duncan  5.) Lebron James  6.) Nick Collison  7.) Larry Bird  8.) Michael Jordan  9.) James Harden  10.) Steve Nash
"You just shifted the whole argument of my post. I'm not specifically talking about this issue, Jordan is not hurting the league by defending Lebron against Trump. I mean in general, him talking about things that could divide the fanbase and make the entire league and other owners have to take sides could hurt the league. Look at the NFL with the anthem issues, the owners aren't all on the same page and it looks bad. Jordan can't speak on other teams players because he could get fined for colluding. He can't even personally give props to Russell Westbrook. "
I think if we can endure a thousand shit posts about how Russell Westbrook should be playing in the G League - we can handle some political dialogue
"OKC in 6   Seriously who would pick 34 year old Cp3 and Harden over Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook? Plus people forget we had a lot of good role players at that time including Andre Roberson, Steven Adams, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter, Dion Waiters"
Where is Russell Westbrook?
10. Damian Lillard 9. Kyrie Irving 8. Jimmy Butler 7. Russell Westbrook 6. Stephen Curry 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. James Harden 3. Kevin Durant 2. Anthony Davis 1. LeBronto  Note: Did not consider Kawhi because we have not seen him play for so long and we don't know how his injury will affect him 
"This is a bad list dude.  1. LeBron-Top 3 player of all time, no doubt about it  2. KD- Limitless scoring ability and comes up big in big games. He'd be even better if he played defense and rebounded like a 6'11, 240 lb monster instead of a 6'6, 200 lb wing.  3. Steph- The greatest shooter of all time and one of the best players ever when he's hot. He's only below KD because of some of his ugly playoff performances.  4. Harden- Reigning MVP, his numbers would be viewed as even better than they are if not for guys like Westbrook normalizing us to triple doubles and gaudy statlines. Likely Finals MVP if CP3 never gets hurt.  5. AD- Best big man in the game, bar none. Can take over a game in the way that ~3 big men in the league can, perennial DPOY candidate and the only thing sustaining New Orleans basketball.   6. Kawhi- Maybe the best wing defender of all time when healthy and a lethal scoring option. Raptors will have the best player in the East as long as Kawhi is 100% and  #7 doesn't take a big step forward. He's outside the top 5 because of that health question.  7. Giannis- One of the most freakish players in the NBA with great defense and scoring abilities. If he gets to 35% from 3 he'll jump into the top 5 with little debate. He's back at  #7 because he still hasn't won a playoff series. Hopefully a new coach will help him get over that hump next April.  8. Kyrie- One of the best isolation scorers in the league and one of the best playoff performers in the game. Guys ranked ahead of Kyrie sometimes struggle in the playoffs because of tighter defense and better scouting, where Kyrie seems to thrive in that atmosphere. He also proved he can be the best player on a winning team last season despite an injury to Hayward on opening night. With four guys who shoot 39%+ from 3 around him next season, Kyrie should only improve as a player.  9. Russell Westbrook- Like Kyrie, Westbrook is one of the best one on one players in the whole NBA and can have nights where he's a top 3 player in the NBA. He's at 9 because his amazing personal performances haven't translated to playoff success. If he improved as a shooter (He shot worse from 3 than Marcus Smart last season) and reigned in some of his bad habits (like tunnel vision) then he would be higher.  10. Joel Embiid- Potentially all time great big man if healthy, with rare ability on both ends of the court. If healthy he will 100% be a top 3 finisher for DPOY next season. Only reason he's not higher already is that he struggled against Aron Baynes and Al Horford in the playoffs last season and struggled with his conditioning down the stretch. Hopefully his first healthy offseason will help with those things."
"Youre acting like the majority of this sub thinks westbrook isnt one of the best damn point guards in the league. Is he not allowed to be criticized just because hes an exciting player who sets records? If he really is a flawless player who plays a winning style of basketball, why has he been bounced in the first round 2 years straight. Russ is a god damn superstar and anyone who watches basketball knows that, but at the same time any one who has watched even just the last 2 OKC playoffs also knows that maybe, just maybe, Russell taking 10 three pointers in a quarter when he doesnt shoot them well at all, is not the greatest idea."

"&gt; All his teammates say otherwise. And surely you don't think he's the most immature player in the league. What's the most immature thing he's done, compared to what Kevin Durant has done? Lol...  Please provide me examples of players talking shit about another player.  It doesn't happen.  Of course his teammates are going to say they support him -- if they say otherwise they further erode team chemistry.  You don't go after the leader -- especially not an egomaniac like Westbrook.  You'd get kicked off the team faster than you can blink.  &gt;e has a bone to pick with a few reporters, namely Barry Tramel due to how he reported on KD (""Mr. Unreliable""). I firmly believe that you're basing your opinion off of very few clips of him being rude over a decade. Seriously watch his other media highlights where he answers questions respectively and sometimes make some funny jokes with the media  So it's just one reporter?  That's funny, because I've seen him sarcastically and angrily respond to an entire troupe of reporters at pressers.  &gt;That is an objectively false and sensational statement.  Yeah?  Do you know a lot of other players who take 28 foot 3s with 10+ seconds left on the shot clock?  By all means provide me with those players.  Do you know a lot of players that shoot worse than 3-17 in a quarter?  By all means, show me.  I'm open to being wrong here -- but you have to say more than ""it's objectively false"".  Westbrook takes -- quite literally -- some of the worst shots I've ever seen a player take in the NBA.  They're baffling.  Even the announcers who usually have a bullshit excuse when a player does something often are left speechless when he gets it in his head to shoot.  &gt;Can someone get me stats on how many times he's done that? And while you're at it, can you compare it to other players in the league. Not denying that Westbrook takes some pretty bad shots, but you're pretending like he takes them every other possesion. Again, selectively looking at and amplifying the worst of him.  I am?  Please tell me where I said this instead of strawmanning my position.  That does nothing but strengthen my argument.  3/17 in a single playoff quarter is something you're really going to have to prove isn't damning in this case though, because we're talking about playoff success and that is absolutely an anathema to winning playoff series.  &gt;Again, that is an objectively false statement considering the fact that he's consistently the highest energy player in the game. He's a hardworker when it comes to winning, and if you've watched all the times OKC beat the Spurs in the playoffs, you would agree.  Lol, trying to make a dig at my team to make it an emotional argument instead of objectively addressing the issue?  That's a cornerstone of a terrible argument.  Also tends to fall flat when the ring count is 5 to 0, 4 if you're counting active Spurs.  lol  https://www.sbnation.com/2017/11/22/16693192/russell-westbrook-defense-thunder-controller-nba-2k  lol  https://thebiglead.com/2017/03/24/is-russell-westbrook-padding-his-rebounding-stats-by-leaving-his-defender-stats-say-he-is/  lol  **Westbrook ranks dead last in the NBA in contested shots among players averaging 30 or more MPG by a considerable margin. Hilariously, the only two players who have contested less 3P FGA’s are Rudy Gobert and Whiteside, who have contested 53 and 64 respectively. Russell Westbrook is at 69 while having playing [sic] close to the same amount of minutes…Yes, DeAndre Jordan has contested more 3P FGA’s this season than Russell Westbrook.**  HIGH ENERGY  &gt;And so you have an opinion, but it's very clearly based on you selectively picking out the worst parts of Westbrook and amplifying them. Nevermind the fact that all players in the NBA have their shitty moments.  What's funny is that you claim I'm so biased and that you're much more objective, yet you've offered exactly 0 statistical evidence to argue the point.  You're just gainsaying my comments and pretending like you're winning the argument.  Again, that's objectively terrible especially when you're mixing it in with strawmen and emotional appeals.  &gt;All of Westbrook's teammates and former teammates have commented at just how selfless and great of a teammate he is. And I'm willing to bet that anyone who actually watches Westbrook play, not just going through post game threads, streamable highlights, and twitter opinions, will disagree with you.  So now you're ad homineming me by claiming I don't watch the games, okay, well, we'll throw that onto the logical fallacy pile.  In the meantime, you're making your first point yet again -- and as we all know, NBA players are SUPREME judges of talent -- as evidenced by how terribly players who become coaches are at scouting and evaluating talent.  You managed to fit an appeal to authority fallacy in as well, and in this case it's frankly a terrible one.  &gt;Nevermind the fact that all players in the NBA have their shitty moments.  Most of them, especially MVPs, actually learn and adapt their game.  If anything, Westbrook has become worse over time with his shot selection and tunnel vision."

I wanted the Sonics to take Jarryd Bayless over Russell Westbrook
Well I was just using common sense because I imagine that is something that would piss people off and you can kind of see it in KDs body language during his stay with the thunder. The thing is Russell Westbrook is pretty good with player relationships so I doubt we’ll ever hear them bad mouth him. Maybe I’m wrong( I guess it just hard for me to imagine players loving the idea of standing around and watching Russ take contested 3s in crunch time) but even if I am these types of decisions only hurt his team. 
I don't think OKC fans need more fuel for the argument that Russell Westbrook is the GOAT human being. There are many young men on this sub that would gladly sacrifice their rear end for Russell's happiness. 
"Pointing out logical fallacies doesn't make you correct, though. People can make flawed arguments with a sound basis. Just like someone else can make a logically sound argument based on information that is false.  An argument from a false premise perhaps:  Stat-padding is bad basketball.   Russell Westbrook pads stats.   Russell Westbrook plays bad basketball.  This argument is logically sound, but does nothing to support the very first claim that stat-padding is bad basketball. That's what's called **an opinion**.  We all took logic 101. Pointing out logical fallacies isn't as helpful as you think"
"It’s true about DeAndre. If Lillard leaves Portland for a bigger market, he will become very famous. Same with Lowry. Russell Westbrook plays in OKC and he won MVP. I think Kyrie Irving has got a lot more famous now since Boston is a bigger market than Cleveland and also, he has a movie Uncle Drew. Who do you think is the most famous between these 3:Kyrie, CP3, Westbrook? "
"I don't think that's necessarily the best way to evaluate players.  Klay Thompson makes the Warriors better than Russell Westbrook would in his place, but that doesn't necessarily make him the better player overall.  The existence of Steph, Durant, and Draymond improve Klay's efficacy by allowing him to hide his deficiencies better."

"I'm genuinely curious, if Melo has a pretty good season this year playing for the Rockets, is that going to lend more credence to the notion that playing with Russell Westbrook makes his teammates worse?"
"I hate Russell Westbrook.  I think he exemplifies everything that is wrong with basketball, and sports honestly.  He is insanely selfish, attention-seeking, possibly the most immature player in the league, throws tantrums on the court, is generally rude and abrasive to media who are just trying to do their jobs.  He tunnels harder than any player I've ever seen, including Kobe ""get out of the way"" Bryant, he has the worst shot selection this side of Antoine Walker, and he never seems to truly take responsibility for the losses the team inevitably accumulates when he goes [5-17](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2018-nba-western-conference-first-round-jazz-vs-thunder.html), [6-23](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201704160HOU.html), or goes [3-17 in a single QUARTER of a playoff game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201704190HOU.html).  And can we talk about a guy who shoots from 30 feet with 14 seconds left on the shot clock?  Sure he makes them occasionally... like 1 in 8 tries, if that.  He's a hard worker?  Sure.  When he has the ball in his hand, or when he's hunting for a stat.  If there's not a box score change in it for him, he essentially dozes off on the court for long stretches of time, even if it means leaving Steph Curry wide open.  So yeah.  I hate Westbrook.  I think he is an impossibly selfish star who cares more about individual accolades than playing the game the right way.  I think he's a childish, angry man who begs for the limelight only to scoff at it to show how edgy he is like some kind of 17 year old who hates their parents when they're in public.  I think he represents a facet of the game that's on display every time you go to your local Y and there's a former DI college player who's more athletic than everyone else in the gym and takes 20 shots in a game to 11, while only passing the ball when he's falling down, out of control, with no ability to chuck a shot at the rim because at this point he's getting triple teamed by the other squad who's up by 8 points and is laughing at his errant faith that his 25 foot heave is a better shot than a teammate who's wide open.  At the end of the day, Westbrook is a guy who has been given every fucking gift in the world to be a monster star of the sport, and he only uses that to chase triple doubles and personal glory.  It's not all about ego, either.  LeBron has a huge ego, obviously, but look at how vastly different their leadership is of the team.  The Thunder fans want to blame every single player and every single coach except the guy who's the MVP and supposed to be leading them, which is an entire other post that just reflects poorly on how Westbrook could take 80 shots in a game and fans would defend him endlessly for it.  It's funny how so few of the truly great players of the sport need excuses about teammates to be made for them."

"Anthony Davis has the best chance objectively. He has the narrative of being that next guy and ""revenge"" on Boogie Cousins. If AD puts up insane numbers being a top 4 or 5 seed, that's him.  The Media will definitely try to push LeBron James all throughout the season, but I don't see LeBron putting up the numbers or getting the necessary amount of wins to get the MVP.   Sadly, neither KD or Curry are going to have out of this world seasons, especially with five all stars in the line up.  Kawhi is a dark horse, but he's competing with AD and LeBron.  James Harden isn't winning another MVP. He's a one MVP guy, and for whatever reason the Media doesn't like giving this man votes. I honestly think he should've been MVP the year Westbrook won MVP, but its whatever.   People have seen straight through Russell Westbrook. No matter how many TD's he gets, it won't matter. No MVP. However, if Westbrook shows he can make players around him better, and he raises his basketball IQ, then I can see him getting another MVP before he retires  Giannis is another dark horse, and if his team gets a top 3 seed in the East, then definitely. He also has to put up monster numbers at whatever position he plays, which isn't hard for Giannis to do. The thing holding him back is that the Bucks don't as many games as they're supposed to , but that could change with Coach Bud.  &amp;#x200B;"
"Kawhi Leonard  Giannis  Russell Westbrook  Just seems so wide open for Kawhi if he plays like he did his last healthy year in SA. Now his team will be a possible 1 seed while he’s putting up 25+ PPG and playing great defense.  Giannis would be my favorite if wins and seeding wasn’t involved. If Giannis can carry the Bucks to a 3 or 4 seed, while putting up similar numbers to last year, I could see him taking it.  Russell Westbrook put up the huge numbers and won it in the 2016-2017 season carrying OKC to the 6th seed. I can see OKC being a top 3 seed with the addition of losing Melo, and he’s bound to put up a triple double average once again. I think Westbrook has the best chance in the West. (Maybe slight bias)  Edit: this is in numerical order, meaning I think Kawhi has the best chance."

Rose won the MVP at 22 and tore his ACL the first time at 23. He was better than Russell Westbrook at that stage in his career and we see the numbers Westbrook is putting up in his prime.  I don't think we ever got a chance to see prime DRose.
Russell Westbrook because what do stats mean when the results aren’t there and I don’t want to hear any excuses or stat lines there is no reason to get embarrassed like they did this year
Cp3 is pretty overrated here. Theres a decent chunk of this sub who thinks he is currrently better than russell westbrook. 
"This line of thinking, whenever we talk about ACL tears or other injuries, is so fucking annoying. It’s like if you aren’t Russell Westbrook or Derrick Rose level of athlete you “don’t rely on speed and explosiveness.” That is flat out not true, especially with Kristaps. One of the best offensive rebounders in the league (often grabbing them over and through other bodies), who also creates his own shot at 7’3”, and relies on beating big men off the dribble, or finishing over them in the lane ABSOLUTELY relies on speed and explosiveness. That is what makes him The Unicorn. This isn’t fucking Lamarcus Aldridge we are talking about.  Edit: some words"

"Highjacking the incredibly awesome meme express to say, if you didn’t do so, give the whole article a read. First, it’s very well written. Secondly, you get a ton of insight into PG and WB and their relationship.    Examples:  &gt;Thunder reserve guard Raymond Felton, however, had learned enough about George over dinners and card games and long flights to see the effect the organization had had on him. “I knew how he felt about playing with Russ,” Felton says. Consider the gravity of that statement:      ...   &gt;Yet when the time came to decide his future, George didn’t hesitate to sign up for four more years of the Russell Westbrook experience. “I understand him,” George says. A year before, he didn’t.       ...   &gt;“You’ve gotta learn,” Westbrook says. “Learn about their family. Their journeys, what they’ve been through, what they’ve learned, their mistakes. You’ve gotta sit down and have a conversation and understand a little bit about them. Then, the basketball stuff will come easy.”       ...     &gt;Yet as the Thunder trailed in a first-round series they would go on to lose to the Jazz, George was struck by a swell of ownership. A sense of permanence. “I knew what I was feeling,” he says. Elimination—in one of George’s worst games of the season, a 2-of-16, six-turnover debacle—only affirmed it. “I wanted to come back for this,” he says. “I like what we have. I like what we’re up against.”     ...       &gt;“It honestly takes [being] out there in a battle with him to understand and to appreciate what he brings to the game,” George says. From that vantage point, George could see how Westbrook handled being the focus of every opponent’s scouting report. There is never a question as to whether Westbrook will go hard on a given night, only as to whether he stomps the pedal through the floorboard in the process, careening off the edge and taking the Thunder with him. “I think there’s a fine line when he gets like that,” Thunder coach Billy Donovan says. Risk is what supplies the voltage behind Westbrook’s breathtaking game. There is no scoring spree without a certain level of abandon. One way or another, it’s easy for the Thunder to get swept up in the momentum of it all. “You rally around a guy like Russ,” George says.      I could keep going on and on but should stop. Lots of great content in there.        Edit:  &gt;”I think ther’es a fine line when het gets like that,” THunder coach Billy Donovan says.      No shit Billy. If only you knew someone in a position to do something about that.  "

"Allen may well be an excellent young big, but he hasn't proven himself to be better than Wiggins at this point. The only thing Dinwiddie was more efficient than Wiggins at was free throws and thats what drags his TS% up. Wiggins was better from the field and better from three.   Enes Kanter had a WS/48 of .198. Russell Westbrook had one of .166 and Ben Simmons had one of .162. We only won 29 wins last year while OKC had 48 and the 76ers had 52.

"What are talking about? If you want to say he “disappears” in the playoffs I guess we’ll just ignore his playoff per game averages of 27.6ppg, 7.0apg, 5.5rpg, and 2.0spg in his time with Houston.  As for your “head back and flailing the arms” argument (I’m being generous with what I’m considering valid points for an argument) last season Harden shot  1.17 more free throws per game than Giannis Antetokounmpo. He shot a mere 0.25 more per game than Russell Westbrook in 2017, and DeMarcus Cousins shot .06 more than Harden the year before that. If you really think he’s “ruining the game with his ref baiting” then you actually just don’t like the NBA, because it isn’t this huge disparity that r/NBA would have you believe. You are just like everyone else who picks up on these narratives from r/NBA and runs with them like they are actual, valid reasons not to enjoy watching one of the most talented players in the game.

Why do you say that Towns has had a huge offensive workload? Like he's had Russell Westbrook or James Harden's usage? Last year Towns took less shots than both Wiggins and Butler. Does Butler's huge offensive workload stop him from playing defense?
"I guess that’s the whole point I disagree with though. Just looking at past history the only time narrative alone has worked was Russell Westbrook, and the historical novelty of the triple double was a huge part of that. There hasn’t been another time in the last 30 years where someone won MVP that wasn’t on a really great team."
"* Held back by what? Obviously things weren't perfect for him to maximize his ability. That Thunder team wasn't very deep, especially on the offensive end, and there are of course, by now, well-documented issues of playing alongside one Russell Westbrook. Obviously playing with the Warriors is going to make it easier for him to do what he does. With that said, the Thunder were still a very good team. I mean, LeBron proved to be a resilient offensive player in 09 and 10 playing with Mo Williams and Varejao. Why is Durant then struggling with a much better offensive cast? Durant is one of the greatest players of all-time, no doubt, but his +/- metrics never painted him as the best player in the league (in fact, a lot of times you'd find Durant much lower than one would think). While guys like LeBron, Curry, CP3 consistently dominated the stat. Even guys like Harden came out looking much more impressive offensively than Durant. Durant is a wonderful scorer, one of the best ever, but his game doesn't really lift the team around him as much as elite playmakers can. What you see in the scoring column of the boxscore is mostly what you get from Durant offensively. He can push on the break and make some passes every now and then, but nothing game-breaking. While that's not the case for the aforementioned guys above.  * Well, LeBron and Wade had comparable playoffs in 2011, all things considered. Maybe Wade performed slightly better, especially against tougher competition, but LeBron was clearly a level above in the regular season, which is a much larger sample size. "

"I think you’re confusing being someone who can generate stats with being a good player.  It would make perfect sense, you’ve been watching Russell Westbrook for a long time.   Ask Hawk fans if they think Shroeder is good. "
"Had to be safe, googled “Russell Westbrook Naked”.   "
It’s not informative enough because it doesn’t state that “Russell Westbrook will not play v. Golden State.”  That’s literally what the OP was asking. That article doesn’t tell us anything new. 
"&gt;http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24959999/oklahoma-city-thunder-russell-westbrook-progressing-not-cleared-full-contact  &gt;He wasn't cleared for full contact as of 2 days ago by ESPN Royce Young. That's as credible of source you're gonna get.  Strange. I couldn't find where it said ""No, he's not playing"". Link that one, thanks.  :)"
"The first result when you google ""Russell Westbrook tattoo"" is an article with the title **Westbrook doesn't have any tattoos, but 'when we win, I'll get one'** but it's funny how your first instinct was to go to image search. "
"You could have searched ""Russell Westbrook tattoo"" but whatever rocks your boat. "
"I had to double check Westbrook. Very happy no ones around to see me searching for ""Russell Westbrook shirtless"" on google images and then scrolling through multiple ones.  With that being said, holy shit he looks good. "
"Well I should maybe rephrase it as getting better upon leaving. Oladipo, Kanter, Sabonis, Harden, idk if there are more.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/12/13/16770062/victor-oladipo-russell-westbrook-okc-effect   There’s some reading for ya! "
Yea he also didn’t play in the 4th quarter because he only needs 3 quarters to beat you death offensively. If that’s not offensive greatness than why don’t we just go with Russell Westbrook garbage triple doubles then
"Giannis is in another leaue in terms of athletic ability. They have the same height and wingspan but that's literally it. They play absolutely nothing alike, it's an awful comparison. Giannis has Russell Westbrook type explosiveness in a 7 footers body. Bruno does not have nearly that type of leaping ability or speed"
**1st Team**  * Steph Curry * James Harden * Kevin Durant * LeBron James * Anthony Davis  **2nd Team**  * Russell Westbrook * Kyrie Irving * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Kawhi Leonard * Joel Embiid   **3rd Team**  * Damian Lilliard * Donovan Mitchell * Lamarcus Aldridge * Paul George * Karl Anthony-Towns
lol at this archaic like of thinking. Russell Westbrook is one of the top earners endorsement wise and he plays in OKC. internets and 24/7 coverage has made physical market size irrelevant. 
"I think his best example was Westbrook. Russell plays with high energy all of the time and nobody ever says that his bad performances were because of exhaustion. Does he get gassed? Yes. But he still gives it his all.   I don’t believe the whole gassed argument. Now if we’re talking injuries, that’s different. But being gassed doesn’t sound too credible.  If a guy looks gassed, it’s probably because he was out until 3am the night before champaignjng and campaigning. "
"I mean all homerism aside I think Jimmy Butler and Russell Westbrook would bounce well off eachother. Extremely dynamic and unique personalities don't often mix but they both love to fight and I always felt Russ needs kind of a ""Hit me Jordan"" Kerr moment to really check himself at times.  Something a coach can't do but someone who works as hard as Jimmy can.  Sucks though cuz that pairing isn't happening for atleast 5 years but we had the opportunity to draft Jimmy, but instead we got the most hated former yhunder player before KD, Reggie Jackson. "
Don't forget to wish a Happy Russell Westbrook day homie!
"I was basically jumping on the bandwagon of the multitudes of people down voting your opinion and didn't feel a need to bring up anything more b/c it was already proven to be a not so popular hot take.  You bring up FGA's but don't mention the fact that Jordan regularly played all 82 games of almost every season where he was not retired or hurt. Of course he is going to have more shot attempts. Look at Lebron who only did it once in his career.  Also, why focus on FGA's for someone who has 6 titles. It's not like he's Russell Westbrook. There is no reason to mention FGA's when we can look at TS% or FG% which show he is clearly efficient.  So back to my original point. It sounded to me like you were just trying to tear him down for something that didn't make a whole lot of sense.  But please continue, I probably won't take a part in this conversation anymore, but you are clearly invested in trying to make yourself sound superior to me."

Depends tremendously on wether you are the one fighting for the rebound and boxing out or just the guy picking up the ball. And even the best guard rebounders are not comparable to big guys. If Steven Adams and Russell Westbrook would really fight for the rebound Adams would win 10/10 times. 
"[Wojnarowski] Sources are saying Russell Westbrook has completed medical school in record time, clearing himself for opening night against Golden State."
"If you think he's going to miss opening night, National TV against the Warriors, you don't know Russell Westbrook. "
Of course there's a KD stopper.  There's an easy way to stop KD from winning a ring.  Just sign Russell Westbrook.
"Also, you don't need to be like Jimmy to win.  You don't need to constantly denigrate your teammates in order to prop yourself up.  KAT could do that, but that is obviously not part of his personality.  He is more of a team basketball type.  LeBron props up his teammates and have fun with them. KG used to do the same, still props up young guys.  Dirk and Steph Curry are good natured, easy going, and look like they have fun out there.  Russell Westbrook seems to love his teammates.  Heck, the ""work ethic"" questions KAT faces would seem more apt aimed at James Harden.   You don't need to be like Jimmy Butler to win.  The failure of Thibs and Butler to recognize that is why neither will last on the Wolves and is why Butler is a disgruntled employee on his way out."
"Umm Cristiano Ronaldo... You know the Guy with More Instagram followers than LeBron James, Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and the official NBA account combined"
okc still hasnt gotten russell westbrook back and likely just lost their best defender until the all star break
"I was prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt too.    But sneaky fun fact, we make fun of his shooting, but he was technically a better 3pt shooter than Russell Westbrook, .305 to Westbrook's .298.  On only 31 fewer attempts.  "
And that’s what I’m saying. Take Philly for example. Russell Westbrook is a perfect fit for that city. Undersized guy who runs right at the defense and dares them to doubt him. That’s Rocky. That’s one reason Derrick Rose is still so loved in Chicago. He plays like someone from Chicago. 
"&gt; What if embiid tears his ACL?  Terrible injury setback but the main concern I have is with his feet and back, also his contract has injury clauses written in so if he's not a max level player it's not as damning  &gt; What if simmons never gets a shot?   His ceiling without a shot is a taller, better on defense Russell Westbrook without tunnel vision if he continues developing in other areas, so that's not the end of the world.    &gt; What if Fultz never gets over the yips?  If Fultz can't shoot then he's a bust at least for why we drafted him.  He doesn't fit with Ben/Joel if he's not at least a capable shooter  &gt; What if games are stupid. Saying ""what if hayward never comes back"" is stupid.   Completely hypothetical what if games are stupid, asking what a team would do in a realistic situation given previous events however is valid.    &gt; Every indication is that Hayward is getting back to the player he was.  Considering we're arguing this in the comments of a post talking about how he's feeling back pains during this recovery process, I'm not so sure it's going as smoothly as advertised.    &gt; If you want to have a real conversation about it, come back in a year when we can properly asses how he has recovered.  We're allowed to discuss projections for the future, otherwise what's the point of talking about any rookies on here?    &gt; In the meantime, stop posting what ifs to neg a team.  I'm not posting off the top of my head completely hypothetical what if situations, I'm pointing out a very real and valid concern, if you can't see the difference that's on you my guy.  "
It’s crazy thinking almost the entire NBA probably gets this reference. It’s funny thinking of Russell Westbrook watching Pokémon as a kid. 
"- Blake Griffin replacing LJ - Russell Westbrook replacing Barkley - CP3 replacing Bogues - Embiid or Steven Adams replacing Ewing - Porzingis or Giannis replacing Bradley  I think Kevin Hart as Bill Murray is set in stone.   Let’s get Hannibal Burress in the Newman role then.    Game announcers: Kevin Harlan, Doris Burke  Might as well have Danny Devito reprise his role.  "
"I agree. But the shift in what is required from bigs doesn't mean  that their former dominance will carry into the current era. PG play is certainly crucial to have playoff success. The only exception is if you have player at another position who can assume the traditional responsibilities of a PG, like LeBron (who for all intents and purposes, *is* a point guard in the traditional sense) and Harden.   Capella gets his easy points as a result of....phenomenal PG play! Capela is arguably a top five center I'd say. And yet hes not even in the conversation for top 25 player in the NBA, while all of the top five PG's are firmly entrenched in those rankings. There's no way in hell you'd want to start a team with Clint Capella over a great PG because you *know* that Capella is dependent on PG play to excel offensively.   Being the better team is often a case of being the more fortunate team in sports. That's just the way it works. You just tried to downplay Curry leading the Warriors to a title by them taking advantage of injury circumstances as if it's unusual to do so. Teams had been taking advantage of the Warriors injury circumstances in years prior, and Cleveland took full advantage of their injury circumstances in 2016.   No ofc Embiid should not have been benched. It's just telling that the 76ers had their best stretch of basketball with Simmons given the full reigns of the offense while being surrounded by four shooters who didn't stop the ball. Ofc Embiid is not easy to defend, but he is *easier* to defend than great guards are. Remember that you have to first enter the ball to Embiid in the post for him to initiate offense and then he has to work against both a great initial defender and another shadowing him for two points at a time. He's a struggling playmaker out of double teams, so he doesn't make his teammates better and he turns the ball over at an alarming rate.   Sure, Curry is an anomaly. He also possess the single most valuable skill in the NBA today - off the dribble shooting, and he just so happens to be the GOAT at it. His best season came *before* Cousins and Durant and when Draymond/Thompson were downplayed as unable to exist as stars on their own teams, so don't use that all star team spiel here. Nobody predicted the Warriors would be as good as they became in '15 and '16. As far as him being an anomaly, so are Chris Paul, James Harden and Russell Westbrook who have all pushed their teams to greater success than the bigs of today's league by no coincidence. Again, look at what Harden and Westbrook have done with relatively minimal talent around them in '15 and '17 respectively. Think Towns, Jokic, Embiid could do the same? They can't. At least not yet. Davis can and has, hes the lone exception."
This is the right answer. Also check out Russell Westbrook highlights. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

"I mean Kobe was the same way. Took horrible shots, had mediocre fg% and heavily relied on free throw attempts to be successful, so Harden wasn't the first modern superstar to play like that.   Harden is well criticized for taking plays off on defense but he's not nearly as bad when he's engaged as people make him out to be. He plays such a large role on offense that he conserves energy on defense. Westbrook has also gotten really bad about that in recent years.   https://nbamath.com/russell-westbrooks-defense-is-finally-a-problem-for-the-oklahoma-city-thunder/"
"undoubtedly the best 3 year span of drafting  2007 draft: Kevin Durant at 2  2008 draft: Russell Westbrook at 4, Serge Ibaka at 24  2009 draft: James Harden at 3"
"r/nbastreams is the best place to watch games if you don't want to buy a league pass. You just have to navigate through the ads.  The league is split into 2 conferences, West and East. All teams from each conference play each other during the regular season and the top 8 from each conference go to the playoffs. Winners of each conference play in the finals.  Which team should you support - OKC. Why - Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Steven Adams. The Lakers look fun this year though with a young squad and LeBron "
"So where do you put him between: Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony (he's ass but he's at least able to coast on popularity), Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, and Joel Embiid?"
"The title is wrong... should be ""How Russell Westbrook Limited Kevin Durant...""﻿"
"How does what you describe in 2001 mean players today are better? They did that with Shaq because literally no one could stop him. That is dominance that is not seen today. That can be used to say that he is actually better than players today. They are different styles of play but basketball is basketball. We can still directly compare the skills these players have, it's not like we are comparing the 60s to today. Russell Westbrook puts up 30 on shit efficiency, so I don't know what bringing up AI should prove. Kobe got 81 on 46 shots, Russ put up 46 points on 43 shots... Trust me, players today are not just automatically better. Another example, today there is so much more focus on threes because they are worth more, when in Kobe's time the mid-range dominated. Does this mean a player is better because of that? No, they just have different specailizations. And Kobe's specialization was good enough for 5 rings and an MVP, and to average 35 PPG which is way beyond what any player in the league today has done.   Different does not mean better. "
"Do you even know how DBPM is calculated? DBPM is borderline useless when it comes to evaluating lockdown individual perimeter defenders like Kobe.   DBPM is entirely dependent on box score stats like rebounds, steals, and blocks. That's why it's called defense *box* plus minus.   For example, in 2017 Russell Westbrook - 4.7 DBPM, Kawhi Leonard - 1.5  You're really arguing that DPBM is a better way of evaluating Kobe's defense than his 12x all-defense selections?  "

"They had a right to veto the trade, and it was fair. I got Russell Westbrook in return. So i wouldn’t say i did anything wrong since there was a very ugly thing you had to do if you got the last place and Russ actually won me the 9-10th place game"
OKC. Russell Westbrook
I’m just here for Russell Westbrook
"My answer is Rose. Let's set each one's MVP season as their ""prime"" for comparison.  Rose: He carried his team to 62–20 season. Second round playoff exit because of his injury.   Westbrook: Middling 47-35 season. First round playoff exit.  Look at the Thunder's [roster](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/OKC/2017.html), and look at the Bull's [roster](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/2011.html).  SG: Ronnie Brewer vs. Oladipo SF: Deng vs. Roberson PF: Boozer vs. Kanter C: Noah vs. Adams  Notable Bench Players for Bulls: Korver  Notable Bench Players for Thunder: Ilyasova, Sabonis, McDermott, Jerami Grant  A comparison of their [stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Derrick+Rose&amp;player_id1_select=Derrick+Rose&amp;y1=2011&amp;player_id1=rosede01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y2=2017&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;idx=players).  I really think Rose was a player that could score at will, and Russ doesn't really have that quality for me. Russ leaves it all on the court, but his shot selection is really suspect sometimes. And he's a historically bad 3 point shooter based on his volume of 3's. Westbrook has more assists than Rose for MVP seasons, but westbrook had a comically high usage rate also (41.7%) compared to rose (32.2%). If you're handling the ball 10% more I'd hope you'd have more assists. Rebounds for Westbrook are impressive too, but you can credit Adam's for the boxouts to generate those rebounds. It's part of their game plan to have Russ rebound so he can take off in transition (to the detriment of adam's stat sheet and the benefit of westbrooks). Here's a graph depicting [this](https://imgur.com/a/qjTfV). I also have an issue with Westbrook literally doing nothing off ball, but this post is long enough. I'm definitely biased as a Bull's fan, but I'd give the edge to Rose."

"&gt;  His [Kobe] shot selection ... Like he said Westbrook is the most like his  So can we agree now that this was completely incorrect  and that Kobe said nothing about his shot selection being like Westbrook and only about the intensity, emotion and never say die competitive spirit ?  Westbrook's game is fundamentally [built](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2704880-the-secrets-behind-russell-westbrooks-extreme-physique) around [his extreme athleticism, energy, endurance and speed](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/10/11/16455146/russell-westbrook-great-point-guard-debate-thunder), though vision, mentality , technique etc all will play a part. Kobe started with athleticism (not near Russ there), but increasingly focused on fundamentals and footwork. Kobe had more of iso, post and mid-range game than Russ and was a better defender, especially one on one. The era, style of play and system (eg kobe playing in the triangle for most of his life) will always make things difficult to compare. Kobe is a slightly better three point shooter, but especially when you compare relative to each's era. I'd argue for Russ as a better rebounder etc. You don't see Russ with as many jab step pump fakes as late Kobe, who was possibly the best difficult shot maker of all time.  Yes, there are similarities in the pressure exerted on the opposing team, in making things happen, in being a primary scorer for his team, in  creating chances, but as well in not being perfect in distributing those chances, occasionally missing teammates or taking ""what the"" shots . Live by the Kobe, Die by the Kobe was a saying has an analogue with Russ, even if neither statement was a perfect match.  But break down Kobe's shot selection in transition, in the post, near the basket, jump shooting, mid range, 3Pt, in a broken play, etc and I think you will find significant differences with Russ in the shot selection , distribution and effectiveness.       "
Russell Westbrook will average another triple double this season consecutively.
"&gt; When I turn on the TV and I watch players play, the player that plays with the same kind of **emotion and grit and competitive intensity** is Russell [Westbrook],” Bryant said of the All-Star guard. “Russell is **going hard**.

Russell Westbrook doesn't even have the same *kind* of game as Kobe. It's the **mental attitude, of competitiveness and going hard every time in any situation.**  Other's too say it's the mentality, the competitiveness, the going all out on court every single time, the ruthlessness. eg [John Wall](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/john-wall-says-russell-westbrook-most-kobe-bryant-todays-game-one-way)  I'm sorry, but I believe Kobe, John Wall etc in this regard and not you."
Russell “Magic” Westbrook 
Lookin like prime Russell Westbrook at age 20...so sick
"&gt; Not really. Reggie can lead an offense and also technically can play solid defense for a full game. His problem is thinking he's Russell Westbrook, when really even Russell Westbrook is barely Russell Westbrook, and Reggie Jackson most certainly is not even close.  Ehh... no. I think your information is out of date. Jackson effectively ran an offense for one season, and that was 2015-2016. Now he's so gimped that he can't score effectively in any fashion anymore. He he was able to manage something in the realm of acceptable on defense before his injuries piled up--he was never *solid*--but now he's a complete catastrophe as a defender. The Pistons have been immensely worse with him on the floor this season.   &gt; Reggie was straight chuckin', and the whole team was on him for it.  That's nothing new. It doesn't help that his coach for the past three seasons was the ultimate enabler.   &gt; If he just ran the offense  What do you mean by this?   &gt; His big head just gets in the way, is all  His big head *and* his poor health get in the way. Jackson was a viable starter when his freakish athleticism was still a thing. He hasn't had that in more than two seasons now; without it, he ranges from barely acceptable to absolutely terrible. Of late, he's been solidly on the latter end of that scale. With it, he is (or was, for one season) an above-average starter but still nowhere near as good as he believes. "
1 play before this he got a Tech. 1 play after this he got a charge.  This 3 play sequence is peak Russell Westbrook
"No, today is Russell Westbrook day"
"Dwyane Wade is the 3rd best SG of all time, fuck are you talking about? He was a Finals MVP and won a ring by himself even without LeBron. He was talked about being robbed of an MVP in 2008 a few seasons b4 LeBron cane to Miami.  Chris Bosh was a 25 and 10 player for a shitty Raptors team, not in the runnint for MVP but he was an All Star and a franchise player.  James Harden was a bench player and  6MOTY when he was on OKC, and only became the player he was seasons after he left. Kevin Durant didnt play with an MVP caliber James Harden.  Russell Westbrook was the best player Durant has played with and even during Westbrook's prime after Durant, all his flaws are showing up in the playoffs with his inability to win."
"I was wondering to... A 'one-off' in other contexts is something that exists within itself alone.  So the Alan Moore' 'The Killing Joke' is a 'one-off' in the Batman series.  It exists outside the regualr story line.  &amp;#x200B;  I was curious too.  Is Steph the greatest '1' (point guard) 'off' player, who plays off the ball a lot, meaning like a combo shooting/point guard, or mroe generally, play-maker/scorer.  In which case, that is putting him in company with MJ, West, Iverson, LeBron, ect.   &amp;#x200B;  But I think it means 'anomolous'.  Like Shaq. We'll not have anther Shaq. Or Wilt. Or Russell.  Or Magic. Of the Big Ok (though Westbrook is a bit of the second coming of the Big O).  &amp;#x200B;  LeBron and MJ have obvious cases, but Dr. J preceded MJ and shared many similarities, and Kobe is MJ light.  But MJ was also anomolous for his contributions off the court.  The marketing/branding.... that was a once--in-a-lifetime thing that paved the way for other players.    &amp;#x200B;  I mean.. Curry is what, 9 or 10 games in, and he spent his summer 'working' on his 3pt shot (the greatest 3pt shot the leauge has ever seen) and now he's dropping 6+ a game on over .500 shooting at the highest volume the league has ever seen?    &amp;#x200B;  What are the chances that we'll see something like that again?

"I was wondering to... A 'one-off' in other contexts is something that exists within itself alone.  So the Alan Moore' 'The Killing Joke' is a 'one-off' in the Batman series.  It exists outside the regualr story line.  &amp;#x200B;  I was curious too.  Is Steph the greatest '1' (point guard) 'off' player, who plays off the ball a lot, meaning like a combo shooting/point guard, or mroe generally, play-maker/scorer.  In which case, that is putting him in company with MJ, West, Iverson, LeBron, ect.   &amp;#x200B;  But I think it means 'anomolous'.  Like Shaq. We'll not have anther Shaq. Or Wilt. Or Russell.  Or Magic. Of the Big Ok (though Westbrook is a bit of the second coming of the Big O).  &amp;#x200B;  LeBron and MJ have obvious cases, but Dr. J preceded MJ and shared many similarities, and Kobe is MJ light.  But MJ was also anomolous for his contributions off the court.  The marketing/branding.... that was a once--in-a-lifetime thing that paved the way for other players.    &amp;#x200B;  I mean.. Curry is what, 9 or 10 games in, and he spent his summer 'working' on his 3pt shot (the greatest 3pt shot the leauge has ever seen) and now he's dropping 6+ a game on over .500 shooting at the highest volume the league has ever seen?    &amp;#x200B;  What are the chances that we'll see something like that again?

If Derrick Rose never got hurt he’s Russell Westbrook. 
Like the difference between Russell Westbrook and Lance Stephenson
"Not really. Reggie can lead an offense and also technically can play solid defense for a full game. His problem is thinking he's Russell Westbrook, when really even Russell Westbrook is barely Russell Westbrook, and Reggie Jackson most certainly is not even close.   Did you see BG demanding the ball on the last handful of plays before he finally just grabbed it, brought it up the floor himself and canned a three and then a two? Reggie was straight chuckin', and the whole team was on him for it. If he just *ran the offense* and then tried to get open behind the arc (where he actually is a solid crunch-time option) then he'd be just fine.   His big head just gets in the way, is all "
"Tony Parker going off for 40+ and single-handedly destroying the Thunder in 2011/12 after Westbrook and Durant spent the week saying he couldn't hang with Russell. The trashtalk was there too, very uncharacteristic."
"That's because nobody could tell they both are good players because Russell ""Blackhole"" Westbrook told them to stand in the corner and shoot if he passes to them."
&gt; Russell Westbrook and KD were a Klay Thompson away from being what the Warriors are now.   So Harden isn't even as good as Klay Thompson?
And you’re saying Russell Westbrook wouldn’t play like he does with a different coach despite him playing the exact same with other coaches... it’s the player Russ is and Brad Stevens wouldn’t be able to do shit about it
"Restricted FA isn't good enough.  And maybe the problem isn't teams have enough options to retain players, maybe some teams have TOO MANY options to acquire players.  Warning: Big ol' wall of text incoming.  If you break down the top 50 highest paid players in the NBA - and remove restricted free agents, which is about the *only* tool teams have to retain players - it leaves only about half the league that have signed one of those players to an unrestricted contract.  So that's just half the league, out of the entire pool of free agents over the past five years when players get the choice of where to go that have even managed to sign *one* of those players.  As I mentioned in my previous comment, some of those are mostly due to egregious overpays:  George Hill for $19 million/year to the Kings, Chandler Parsons for $25 million to the Grizzlies.  One step below that, there are some good players who were paid probably well above their value in order to either stay with their team or jump ship to another: Nicolas Batum for $24 million to stay in Charlotte, Paul Millsap for $30 million to go Denver, Harrison Barnes $24 million to leave the Warriors for Dallas (although he's somewhat lived up to it), Mike Conley for $30 million to stay in Memphis - fine, maybe fringe All-Star players paid like All-NBA guys just in order to either woo them away from elsewhere or convince them to stay.  You could argue Conley earned it, but he's the exception here, not the rule.  Remove those guys, and now only about 1/3 of the league is left who have been able to sign a max-contract player who is a true, bona-fide max salary type of player.  Want to guess which markets have the most, AND objectively *best* of those players?  Counting Chris Paul's sign and trade, Houston has three big UFA signings  (although one is Ryan Anderson), convincing Harden to re-up.  Golden State has by far the biggest two with Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.  Boston also has two with Gordon Hayward and Al Horford, and that's not even their biggest acquisition of the past two years...  Lakers landed LeBron - enough said.  Miami has been successful in their own right, keeping Chris Bosh from leaving to Houston and keeping Hassan Whiteside.  They're also riding landing BOTH LeBron and Bosh in free agency - I can certainly see why a Heat fan might not think acquiring good players outside the draft is difficult for a franchise.  Do you notice anything about these teams?  It's the same big markets that have historically always had success luring high profile players.  The largest exception at the moment appears to be Oklahoma City, who probably against expectations managed to re-sign Russell Westbrook and Paul George.  It may have just been the perfect storm of events leading to both of them - Russ left alone in the wake of KD leaving and then apparently convincing George to stay along with him this offseason - good on them.  But this sort of thing happening is so rare.  This is just in free agency - we're not even getting into players forcing trades, which even more favor a select few destinations.  Butler ain't getting rumored to the fucking Hornets.  Or Bucks.  Or Blazers.  It's always Miami, California, Boston, New York, Texas.  With players forcing their way to teams outside of free agency even, teams in these locations have way too much of an advantage to obtain and retain high caliber players.  Small market teams need a tool to balance the scales.    The Designated Player Extension was supposed to do that in theory, but it doesn't appear to have any impact on players' decisions, and in some cases seems to even be canceled out by money players will save by not paying as much in taxes in some states.  It's not enough."
"It doesn't lower his value, it just makes his true value unknown. With that good of players around him, it's basically impossible to expose any flaw in curry's game. Even his defense is negligible next to KD, Klay, and Draymond. Put him on the Kings and his defensive limitations will stick out like Isaiah Thomas. He might be easier to target and not have the same energy he has now on offense.  Russell Westbrook and KD were a Klay Thompson away from being what the Warriors are now. Because they didn't have a Klay Thompson, Russell took it upon himself to be the 2nd and 3rd option when KD was bottled up. That is what we all now know as ""bad Russ"". For all we know, Damian Lillard could score like Curry if he had no pressure on the rest of his game. Again, I'm not saying that Steph Curry is not the greatest shooter of all time, or that he is of lower value to his team. I just think that we have never seen Steph encounter the type of adversity other all-time greats have. All we know is offensive-savant Steph Curry. I'm just saying his greatness is hard to judge because he's basically only been injured or on a superteam his whole career."

"Yeah, but imagine having Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook all on the same team.  That'd be crazy if that ever happened in real life."
"LOOOOOOOL man you're cute  Is there any way you can try to take a set back and read what I wrote? Russell Westbrook was not playing early in the season.   Would it be acceptable to you if they were down by 20 early-mid second quarter? I can honestly say even if the Lakers played Portland with the same scenario (3 games in 4 nights, LA has 3 days of rest) and LeBron sat out I would have a very hard time believing they would be down 20-30 by the half.    But hey clearly missing your best player is a good enough reason to be down 30 points. Not judging effort, not judging defense, not judging coaches perhaps taking a time out to slow the pace. It's all gravy, I don't have Harden so it's fine to lose by double digits first quarter."
Ben's working on that Russell Westbrook Triple Double
"So now you’re gonna twist my words. I didn’t say it’s a curse, I’m saying it’s not always gonna be some superstar that’s drafted. Many teams have gotten fucked over with their first pick. Even then, one good player doesn’t make a whole team good. It’s a stepping stone. Every team needs a good player anyway because the owners making “hundreds of millions anyway” just isn’t true all the time. If Russell Westbrook had left after KD, no one would’ve cared about the Thunder. A lot of people were already giving up on them.   It’s used a lot when talking about why Seattle lost a team too. Attendance to games is a huge deal. Watch a Pistons game from the last two years and look at how many seats are empty. I’d be willing to bet the Blake Griffin trade wasn’t so much to make the team competitive as it was to hopefully sell seats again. "
Remember somebody posted a topic literally yesterday asking what was up with Klay Thompson's shooting this year? It might have been in the Russell Westbrook shooting 9% from 3 topic. But then somebody posted saying he'll eventually have a game where he just goes off and gets his % back in line to the norm....and that's actually what happened the same exact day.

WTF. I like Russell Westbrook now. 
The good deeds of NBA superstar and former MVP Russell Westbrook always goes unnoticed smh 
In this list (&gt;1500) Russell Westbrook is still ranked 261/269. Only active players worse than him are Dwyane Wade (Who has taken about 1600 3s at 28.8% in his 15 years in the league) and Corey Brewer who is 2nd to worst overall (1700 3s/28.3%/10 years in the league which is the same as Westbrook).   Rounding out the bottom of the list is none other than Charles Barkley. Took just over 2000 3s over his 15 years in the league and shot just 26.6% lol

Bro does anyone remember that amazing post some guy wrote about Russell Westbrook. Then some professional blatantly stole it and published it as his own on a sports writing website
I thought that was Russell Westbrook. 
I'm not saying every Jazz fan yells the N word. I'm saying it's pretty clear from [many sources including the salt lake tribune](https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2018/04/30/commentary-its-sad-but-russell-westbrook-is-right-about-some-jazz-fans/) that word is said often in that arena. 
"So, Russell Westbrook with an elite jumper."
"It depends on the player. Some guys add things to their games late in their careers. See: Brook Lopez, 3-point marksman. Other guys never really develop at all. I don't think it's reasonable to establish an arbitrary point of no return.   Hell, if Russell Westbrook can start setting screens and willingly playing off-ball at 29, anything is possible.   One way to evaluate it is to look at the player's progression each year. If he remains the same exact player for 4+ years, odds are he is what he is. Guys who try to add things to their games in the offseason can always improve. "
"&gt; why do you think Oladipo regressed from his time with fucking Orlando?  He didn't, that's why. Oladipo had the most efficient year of his career (to that point) in OKC. He reached new career highs in FG%, 2P%, 3P%, eFG%, and TS%. He was adapting to a new role and didn't have the ball in his hands nearly as much, and he still played well. Your memory of his lone playoff series in OKC colors your perception of who he was in OKC.   Meanwhile, playing with Westbrook improved Oladipo's work ethic and set the stage for the player he became in Indiana, by his own admission:  &gt; [“He’s \(Westbrook\) a future hall of famer no question, and in order to get that, I’m going to have to put in the work and put in another level that I’ve never worked before. That’s what I did this summer and it’s paying off for me.](http://www.indianasportscoverage.com/victor-oladipo-discusses-what-he-learned-from-russell-westbrook/)”  &gt; [“Going there and seeing him do that, just seeing his year overall last year definitely helped me realize that I gotta put in a lot of work to get on that level,” Oladipo said. “So, he definitely helped influence my growth both on and off the court. He was an amazing resource, especially last year, to learn from him. And I apply it to everyday life today.”](https://newsok.com/article/5575892/oladipo-credits-westbrook-for-his-breakout-season)  Next:   &gt; Why do you think Harden wasn't a starter in OKC but was an mvp candidate two years later?  Because OKC wanted Harden to be Manu Ginobili and Thabo's defense fit better with the starting lineup than Harden's playmaking. Harden was awesome in OKC and showed steady improvement. The mistake was trading him, not holding him back.   &gt; Why do you think Reggie Jackson and Dion Waiters became number one options after they left, but were considered second stringers while they played alongside Russ?  Because they...didn't? Reggie isn't the number one option in Detroit, and on those rare nights when he is, it's because they don't have anyone better, not because Reggie is a legitimate number one option on an NBA team. Reggie had the most efficient seasons of his career in OKC and hasn't shown any substantial improvement since he left. He's still the same guy he was in OKC. And if you're asking why Reggie Jackson was Russ's backup instead of the other way around, I can only conclude that you *are* Reggie Jackson, because he's the only person in the world who thought that was a debate.    As for Dion, no shit he wasn't a primary option on a team with Russ and KD, nor should he have been. He didn't start because he wasn't better than Russ or KD and, like Harden and Thabo, Roberson's defense fit better with the starters and Dion's ball dominance fit better with the bench. He didn't become the primary option, either...he just returned to his Cleveland usage levels.   You won't find a single informed person who thinks that OKC should have kept Reggie or Dion, both of whom signed bad contracts on mediocre teams that aren't going anywhere.   &gt; PG left here because he didn't HAVE a star to play with ... While KD left there because he couldn't play with the one he had. Just chew on that for a bit.  By KD's own admission, Russ was the thing he liked about OKC, it was everything else that drove him away.   One last note: what do Harden, Oladipo, Reggie, and Waiters all have in common? Harden left after his age-22 season and the other three left after/during their age-24 seasons...i.e., right around the time when they were entering their primes. You would *expect* them all to improve after leaving, especially Harden...because of their ages, not because of Russ.   Blind hatred is no way to follow sports, man. "
Is Victor Oladipo a better basketball player than Steven Adams? Who's more valuable to a team that already has Russell Westbrook?

"I think he looks terrible in that. But he's Russell Westbrook and I'm me. I don't think it's about looking good enough to pull that off, it's more about identity."
"This is an interesting point. It's just crazy to think that for instance, Russell Westbrook (that nasty ankle sprain) processed instantly all that dread over what it means for his career and yelled louder because of it "
A shoot-first PG who can't shoot isn't valuable unless he's Russell Westbrook.
The Russell Westbrook
Westbrook has had 5 knee surgeries (if you count the PRP injection that kept him out for a little while):  https://www.sbnation.com/2018/9/12/17851948/russell-westbrook-knee-injury-surgery-history-thunder
"Few  things here. First of all, bad is not terrible, there are tiers here. None of these guys are elite, but none of them are remotely as mad as Young has been so far. Second, Playoffs are a little different than regular season. Third, good to elite teams tend to get stuck there, and that was my original point: That if your best player is atrocious on defense that's the best your team can get.   &amp;#x200B;  But let's look at the guys you mentioned. (Except Harden because he has never played point defense in Houston - he's played on bigger players. Beverly and Paul and even Gordon have defended the point. Sliding him up defensively is not an option with the short and slight Young, so I don't think Harden's relevant here)  &amp;#x200B;   All these guys are established players so let's looks at the last three years (if you don't believe in defensive metrics, then I don't have much way to argue). Average defenders are a zero on this scale.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  |Player|PIPM multi-year (defense)|RAPM 3yr Avg (defense)|RAPM Playoff 3yr Avg| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Russell Westbrook|\+0.11|\+0.61|\+0.23| |Steph Curry|\-0.46|\+0.96|\+0.78| |Damian Lillard|\-0.76|\-0.15|\-0.92| |Kyrie Irving|\-0.93|\-1.25|\-0.89| |Worst player in NBA|\-2.76 (Derrick Rose)|\-3.26 (Jamal Crawford 2018)|\-1.74 (Rodney Hood 2018)| |Trae Young (TINY SAMPLE)|\-2.59|Not yet released|Not yet released (also no playoff experience)|  &amp;#x200B;  So what I would say to your pushback is that Westbrook and Curry aren't even bad defensive players at all. Not great or anything, but a little above average. Lillard and Irving aren't very good. Irving is far worse in the regular season, but tends to be a little better when it's on the line. Even these players aren't terrible defenders though. The next line is where you see terrible defenders. That's where Trae's defense is right now. Irving is the best counter point, but even there his only ring came next to the greatest player all time playing at his peak. Lillard hasn't been able to make it very far in the playoffs, and I would argue a fair amount of that is because they're bad offensively without him, but very bad defensively with him.  &amp;#x200B;  Young has a long way to go to be even in the Lillard and Irving category, and I might contend if they are your best player your ceiling is the second round."
"2014-5  mad 55-win squads in the west  anthony davis and russell westbrook trying to will their teams onto the right side of the bubble  the warriors were unbelievably fun but didn’t seem inevitable  portland (why are they the 4th seed?!) looked amazing before wes matthews got hurt  lebron’s return to the cleveland, the 60-win hawks  the process starting to get controversial  even my wizards were on fire in the first half of the season before rasual butler cooled off and nene stopped being a good  the clippers blew a 3-1 lead after winning of the best first round series ever  etc "
"&gt;Yet he never gets any calls and players blatantly are let off the hook when hard fouling or hitting him with dirty, cheap shots.  Lin has a career free throw rate of 38.6, which would rank exceptionally among guards in this league. He gets to the free throw line on an average possession on par with Russell Westbrook and prime Derrick Rose. This season in particular he has a free throw rate of 54.9, which is better than James Harden.  I would argue to you that Lin is not treated so differently, but that we are specifically looking for cases of differential treatment in order to push the narrative that he is viewed as an outsider. Every single incident will blow up on this sub, whereas other cases of dirty play are not as highlighted unless at the expense of (or committed by) a well recognized player.  Lance Stephenson tripped John Henson last season. No outrage.   The NBA taking precautions to protect a player because of their race is highly problematic."

"&gt;Goes for all sports. Tom Brady won NFL MVP last year in a season where the 9-7 Seahawks would've gone winless without Russell Wilson.    That's different. Brady is kind of the face of the NFL, and might end up as the Greatest QB of all time, if he isn't already.   &gt;  But in the NBA, Harden or Westbrook has accomplished NOTHING yet, apart from some individual statistics. Without LeBron, Cavs never was even a playoff team, and he's also the best player in the world. But the league catered to a good revenge story in Westbrook, and then a pity story in Harden. That ain't it chief"
"-Lebron won 2 rings and 2 MVP's in Miami after losing to Dallas.   -Stephen Curry won 3 rings in Golden State and 2 MVP's (and you know the KD stuff)   -Kobe Bryant retired scoring 60 in his last game.   -Russell Westbrook has averaged a triple double for the past two years.   -Also everyone is shooting 3 pointers now.          -Some of the best players in the league include Lebron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook and Joel Embiid.   "
"Sure.  1. LeBron went back to Cleveland and won a championship over the Golden State Warriors when the Cavs came back from a 3-1 series deficit to win.  2. KD joined the Warriors two weeks after  #1 happened.  3. A man named Giannis entered the NBA. He's kind of a superstar now.  4. The Celtics traded all their star players for what turned out to be a haul of high draft picks which they used to add Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and then trade for Kyrie Irving from Cleveland.  5. Kawhi Leonard demanded a trade and went to Toronto  6. LeBron James went to the Lakers this past summer (this should be higher but w/e)  7. Chris Paul teamed up with James Harden in Houston.  8. Russell Westbrook won MVP two years ago by averaging a triple double.  9. Paul George teamed up with Westbrook in OKC.  10. The Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs are both chilling in that 5-8 range in their respective conferences."
"Warriors a dynasty  LeBron to Cleveland then LA  The #1 overall pick in the 2017 draft forgot how to shoot  Huge emphasis on 3 pointers   Teams are finals contenders: Warriors, Raptors, Bucks, Celtics  Superstar players: LeBron (LAL), Kevin Durant (GSW), Steph Curry (GSW), James Harden (HOU), Giannis Antetokounmpo (MIL), Kawhi Leonard (TOR), Anthony Davis (NO), Russell Westbrook (OKC)"
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/report-kevin-durants-frustrations-with-russell-westbrook-led-to-departure/amp/  He said he was frustrated with Russell’s style of play.
A lot of people here liked him because he is white. The rest of us liked him because he's shown that he's an incredibly skilled all around player at every level that he has played at (including going up against Russell Westbrook and the OKC Thunder at the age of 17). 
Russell Westbrook is too. He posts videos of himself singing to her songs in the car.
That's Russell Westbrook
I feel like Jimmy Butler and Russell Westbrook are in a competition for the worst end game decision making. 
Russell Westbrook’s favorite point guard is Rust Westbrook. 
"Because the league doesn't enforce the dress code when players wear extremely tight or revealing clothes that wouldn't be allowed in any other ""professional"" setting?  How is [this](http://files.starstyleman.com/uploads/russell-westbrook/12687.jpg) professional?   It's not, but since it's not Timbs and a baggy t-shirt the league doesn't care because it's not thuggish. "
D'Angelo Russell Westbrook
"Pause  In no system can you go from from 27 on elite defense to 15 in another system.  Just watching Kawhi you’ll see that he has/had elite athleticism and an automatic shot. that’s worth more than 15 points in any system.  Look at Russell Westbrook, Kawhi isn’t nearly as athletic as him, but Russell Westbrook average *way* more than 15 relying almost solely on athleticism.   "
"You still don't get it.  Tony Allen an elite perimeter defender, but below average offensive player does not get anywhere close to the max.  Andre Roberson an elite perimeter defender, but below average offensive player does not get anywhere close to the max.  Robert Covington an elite perimeter defender, but below average offensive player does not get anywhere close to the max.    James Harden and elite offensive player, but below average perimeter defender gets the MAX.  Russell Westbrook and elite offensive player, but below average perimeter defender gets the MAX.  Damian Lillard and elite offensive player, but below average perimeter defender gets the MAX.  Kyrie Irving and elite offensive player, but below average perimeter defender gets the MAX.  Do you see a pattern?  Elite offensive players who play below average defense gets Max dollars.  While elite perimeter defensive players with below average offense get nowhere near Max dollars.  Its painful obvious which skill is more valuable.  Its painfully obvious that individual perimeter offense is MUCH MUCH MUCH more valuable then individual perimeter defense.    If perimeter defense was just as valuable as perimeter offense then guys like Tony Allen, Andre Roberson, and Robert Covington would be getting MAX contracts."
"My biggest takeaway from this is that someday, Russell Westbrook is going to be a big fat bastard.  Look at how magnificent those current fat bastards were"
Bill Russell? or Westbrook?  Because if you're talking about Bill the answer is: who knows. Blocks and steals weren't tracked in his day and there's the very real possibility that he got some triple doubles through less conventional means.
"&gt; Yet in the last two years, Russell Westbrook has averaged a triple double in both seasons. Yet Westbrook is often slighted for averaging a triple double being called a stat padder, ball hog etc, and Robertson is still held in high standards.  Now post the stats showing how close Oscar Robertson was to averaging 4 triple-double seasons - pacing brings up more questions  Did you post this because you were so triggered from people putting Oscar over Curry? lol"
"&gt;a Lebron-sized Russell Westbrook is just Lebron minus the IQ.  Also without the efficiency, the scoring ability, the shot, the passing ability and many other things.    "

"How is Trevor Ariza one of the best defenders? His defensive rating was 104.3, which is average on the roster. The defense is going to be fine cuz Harden is almost league average defensively and Clint Capela is their defensive anchor. Losing a fringe starter and a bench player is not going to make the Rockets defensive scheme collapse. Their defense will be effective since they have their core intact and they added a solid player in James Ennis. Yes the Rockets probably won’t win 65 games again but don’t expect them to be worse than the Thunder, who have yet to win 50 games under Russell Westbrook. "
Here's a top 20 by Winshares:  1	LeBron James	116.1  2	Kevin Durant	104  3	Chris Paul	102.3  4	James Harden	102.2  5	Stephen Curry	88.6  6	Russell Westbrook	82.1  7	DeAndre Jordan	73.6  8	LaMarcus Aldridge	69.7  9	Kyle Lowry	68.1  10	Blake Griffin	67.3  11	Kevin Love	66.7  12	Dwight Howard	62.9  13	Anthony Davis	62.5  14	Pau Gasol	59.7  15	Marc Gasol	58.7  16	Jimmy Butler	58.2  17	Damian Lillard	58.2  18	Paul Millsap	57.2  19	Kawhi Leonard	56.3  20	Dirk Nowitzki	55.9

DEFENSE  everyone's way too tall... Boogie might work in the middle. Defensive Ends like Steven Adams would be good. Linebackers.... everyones too tall or too light. Too confusing.     &amp;#x200B;"
More like any team that plays good defense Warriors just happen to play good defense. The one who's gonna benefit most from these rules are easily Russell Westbrook IMO

So... is Russell Westbrook Naruto?   Does this mean we get an epic KD-Brodie showdown in the WCF?
"Bc they can't shoot like Trae and Steph? ""Pure Guard"" doesn't exist anymore, it's obvious teams pick up raw combo guards and then teach'em all they need but they aren't pure point guard anymore. For example, nowadays,  do u prefer select a Rajon Rondo type of player or a Russell Westbrook type of?  I really want a team build an old style roster with a pure point guard who leads the floor, shooting guard and SF who can create their own shots (not only catch and shoot like today) and two bigs who can play the post, doesn't fear spacing offense. Those who u give'em the ball when offense is slack. Thinkin about that the only team with this combination is Philly. Hope they can bring back old tough line up to highest levels. "
"Steal numbers are NOT indicative how good an overall defender someone is, just how good they are at getting steals.   Is Russell Westbrook the best PG defender in the NBA? Because he's 2nd in the league in steals per game behind Paul George.   I agree that Tyus is an underrated defender, but he still very much has his limitations, largely due to his relative lack of athleticism. However, he plays smart and within his skill set, which is good positioning and the ability to read passing lanes. "

Why Dennis Smith Jr. and Frank Ntilikina will be two of the worst players the league has ever seen.  Why Russell Westbrook will never get a threepeat.
shows how fake Russell Westbrook is ... the second you move off his team he forgets you exist
It says nothing. I picked KG because he was 3 times the player of gary payton and offered way more than him.   By your metrics you'd take horford over russell westbrook just because he's a big who can defend. Or you'd take gobert over kyrie irving. 
Ofcourse if you pick a player that was 3 times as good as gary payton you'd side with him thats my point. Who would you rather have russell westbrook? Or Al horford? See how that comparison sucks?   Gary payton and KG don't belong in the same class so ofcourse anyone would side with KG
Russell Westbrook averaged double digit with no real shooters in OKC. Assist numbers can be gained through many ways. Clarkson was considered a scorer before this season and an inconsistent one at that and is still considered an inconsistent scorer.
"that announcer's enthusiasm is infectious. ""the harlem globetrotters got nothin' on russell westbrook -- nothin'!"""
"we literally didn't though, when we blew them out, the only player who played above average was russell westbrook. we just played good defense, made them uncomfortable, played the passing lanes, and we blew them out. our offense has been much improved since that night."
"""Does Russell Westbrook HATE his team mates?!?!"""
"OKC would not have even gotten a conference title without KD. You think Russell Westbrook carries that team to beat Tim Duncan and Kawhi without KD? OKC just never had a team that really sucked (other than their first year) because they inherited their seeds of success from Seattle.  If Curry had went to the Cavs after the finals loss, I'd been pretty devastated, but none of the real fans who stuck with the Warriors through the years when we were objectively bad would have been mad enough to repeatedly shit on him after he carried us from mediocrity to a championship team. To be more realistic, if Klay leaves to another playoff team after next year because of the cap space situation, good on him. I'd wish him luck, and I'll even root for him when he's not playing against us. "
"Russell Westbrook is a career 31.2% shooter from 3. Hardly excelling and lower than Embiids 32.8%  KD, Steph, Harden are all perimeter players whereas Giannis, AD, Embiid are PF/C with Simmons being the only perimeter player.  "
"You're listing the stats from the Finals that Jason Kidd didn't win.  Not only that, but those statlines still aren't as impressive as Curry's.  The numbers I listed are from the respective Finals in which the team won, who cares about the NBA Finals that they didn't win?    James Harden isn't even a PG, he's a Shooting Guard who just happened to be put into the PG position.  Russell Westbrook is legit terrible compared to Curry.  Seriously, just look at Westbrook play.  He hardly ever moves off-ball and he never sets any screens.  Not only that, but he's statistically worse in offensive efficiency and even defense."
Kobe is a top five player of all time and the best I've ever seen  Russell Westbrook is underrated when it comes to all time rankings. If Steph is in the top five then Russ is at least top ten.
"Paul Pierce is lucky to be top 100. Players today already better than Pierce. KD, LBJ, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Dirk Nowitzki. Arguably better or going to be better. Paul George, Giannis Antetokuompo, Carmelo Anthony. Recently retired players better, Kobe, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett. I'm already at 15 and most of these players aren't even in people's top 10. We haven't gotten to Ewing, Barkley, Shaq, Bill Russell, Wilt, Kareem, Dr. J, Moses, Hakeem, Jordan, Bird, Magic, Stockton etc.... He's lucky to be top 15 at his position. How he going to be top 50 all time?  Shaq played with Lakers until 04. From 04-05, to 13-14 when Kobe went down with an injury, they were the Kobes. Even after that, they were still the Kobes but he was injured. Prime vs prime, Shaq is in the same lague as Kobe. Probably above him. Career though, Kobe's longetivity destroys Shaqs.  Paul Pierce pre KG did not have more success than Melo. How is this even upvoted? Until Melo went to the Knicks, he had made the playoffs every year of his career. Boston missed the playoffs multiple times with Paul Pierce as just the guy. They made one ECF during the East's weakest year. Then lost to the Nets. Then won 24 games before getting KG and Ray Allen. No. Melo had way more success than Paul Pierce pre-KG and Allen. Paul Pierce never made all NBA second team before KG and Allen. Melo did it twice. 4x third team to Pierce's 3 times. Paul Pierce may be the most overrated player in NBA history. His loyalty makes people think he is better than he was.  Why would I be talking about Melo? He's not having a tribute. And we will see. I think they will hang his jersey and call it a day. Maybe have him speak at halftime or some bullshit. It won't be like Kobe's.  What? IT literally just said it was unexpected. He hasn't been butthurt at all. You are crazy. This shit has to only be upvoted by salty Celtics fan.  Paul Pierce was a middling star that got carried by KG and Allen once they arrived and is only considered good through revisionist history when looking at the numbers and wins, he wasn't good. He was never in the same stratosphere as Kobe or LBJ. He only was elevated to their level after beating Kobe in the Finals on KG's back."

I'm pretty sure I've seen Russell Westbrook break every dress code guideline at the same time. We live in dangerous times...

"Interesting that Russell Westbrook isn't in the top 20, shows how much efficiency matters."
"Yes. There are 4 back court spots and 2 wild cards. So even with your list:  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Russell Westbrook (he doesn't deserve to make the team over DD or KI in this hypothetical based on his play so far, IMO) 4. Chris Paul  We still have two wild card spots and they make it, because we can fudge the numbers and call Jimmy Buckets a 3 and put him in as a front court player. "
"&gt;That could be said for any person on this thread  Yes it can. If you didn’t watch a player play, haven’t studied a player’s tapes, then you have no authority to speak on their game. Stats don’t tell you anything. Stats tell us that Russell Westbrook was the best player in the league last year.  Pure skill wise he is above and beyond and that is why he’s considered the GOAT."
Why are you guys downvoting Russell Westbrook? We are weak compared to him
"I hope both sides of the issue are brought up in that meeting. The Clippers/Rockets game was fun to watch, but yeah it got out of hand and players needed to calm down. Players also need to quit constantly complaining about not getting a call because it is annoying. But Westbrook and Russell techs were legit unnecessary, especially Westbrook's double tech within 1.36 seconds. "
"**Thunder**  **Adams** - The big homie, the one you bring along incase they have a big ass dude too. Plus that motherfucker is strong.  **Grant** - Hes got reach and looks strong as shit  **Westbrook** - Its Russell fucking Westbrook, he'll just keep coming at you with the force of a 1000 suns, dat heart, dat energy. Plus he's from South Central so you know he's down as fuck  **Melo** - He's not the one. He grew up in Bodymore, tried to fight KG, and he stuck Mardy Collins so hard that the cameras picked up the sound it made.  **Roberson** - Possible DPOY so you know he's strong. Good reflexes and good hands.  **PG** - He looks like he could do some damage and doesnt he have a rod or some metal shit in his leg?? Shiiit all he has to do is throw some kicks lol  **Collison** - The token white guy whos just there to record and shout **WORLDSTAR**"
"Thing is I put ""russell westbrook wingspan"" into it, first result it gave is 203cm, I doubled checked that with DraftExpress and it was accurate. Is this like the only damn time Google doesn't round it up lmao"
On the same night as Westbrook gets ejected twice.  #D'Angelo Russell Westbrook Lopez
"He is my second favorite player after Russell Westbrook. I guess I like superstars who are ""disliked""."
No Russell Westbrook is and it is not close.
"&gt;Fire trash refs and filter in new bodies with high expectations. You'll find people.    Where? They ref in the NBA for a reason.   &gt;The expectations of an NBA Ref is so low that you can challenge a player to a fight and never be fired.  How often do NBA players cuss out refs without getting fired? Recently, NBA players who get involved in altercations with players (Incredibly rare) get suspended, just like players do. Why isn't equal punishments enough in those situations?  &gt;They had the chance to review the foul for Russell Westbrook and didn't.  Uh... no they don't?   &gt;They ejected Westbrook angrily tell them they missed a call.   Do you have the transcript for what he said? I doubt he said ""You missed that call"" lmao  &gt;Again, one of the ""best refs in the world"" challenged Tim Duncan to a fight on the court and many are dialing up Techs like they're the ice cream man. It's not really a prestigious group of individuals  How long ago was that? Do you have more recent examples? Because I'm fairly certain that NBA officials get abused more than players do, and nobody gets fired over that. "
"&gt;What a fantastic solution! Then we can hire all the refs out of the Euro leagues. Then when we fire all them because they're even worse, we can hire all the NCAA refs!  Fire trash refs and filter in new bodies with high expectations. You'll find people.   The expectations of an NBA Ref is so low that you can challenge a player to a fight and never be fired.   &gt;People here somehow don't realize reffing and NBA game is impossible. The issue isn't the refs, it's the job. The NBA has the money to hire more per game but doesn't, and also doesn't enforce anti-flopping rules which also makes refs jobs harder.   They had the chance to review the foul for Russell Westbrook and didn't.   They ejected Westbrook angrily tell them they missed a call.    Do we add in an additional ref to be the hype man for the technical fouls?   &gt;Firing the best refs in the world won't magically make the reffing better, and I'm mystified how that's become a popular opinion here.   Again, one of the ""best refs in the world"" challenged Tim Duncan to a fight on the court and many are dialing up Techs like they're the ice cream man. It's not really a prestigious group of individuals    "

I’m going to go with Westbrook and see if I can breed the tallest and most athletic offspring to eventually create a Steven Adams sized Russell Westbrook
"I'll give this a go. My rules: 15 front and 15 back court players (not looking at conferences bc who knows what conferences will be where).

Front court:  * Lebron James * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Kevin Durant * Anthony Davis * Karl Anthony Towns * Draymond Green * Joel Embiid * Kristaps Porzingis * Kevin Love * Kawhi Leonard * Paul George * Jimmy Butler * Gordon Hayward * Nikola Jokic * Jayson Tatum  Back court:  * Steph Curry * James Harden * Russell Westbrook * Kyrie Irving * DeMar DeRozan * Klay Thompson * Damian Lillard * John Wall * Chris Paul * Lonzo Ball * Ben Simmons * Andrew Wiggins * Devin Booker * Donovan Mitchell * Victor Oladipo  Methodology:  Q1. Who are the freebies?  Front court: Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo. Back court: Steph Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving.  Q2. Who are the strong picks?  Front court: Karl Anthony Towns, Draymond Green, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Kevin Love, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jimmy Butler.

Does that mean Russell Westbrook and Kevin Love aren’t born yet
"I agree with you, businesses will usually only give them free shit if they benefit from giving athletes free shit.  The adage “if it’s free you’re the product” rings true here.  If I knew Russell Westbrook ate regularly at a place in OKC I’d probably be more incentivized to go there, so he would definitely bring in more business than they give out."
"He may be playing literally for his stats, but to be able to rack up triple doubles and average triple doubles is wicked impressive.   If Jimmy Buckets wanted to 'rack up stats' like Westbrook does, I highly doubt he's as successful.   On top of that, even with Russell 'racking up stats', the Thunder finished 6th last year in the West. Jimmy could barely make it out of the East as the 8 seed. I don't think there's any question regarding Russ over Jimmy or being in the top 10."
1. D Rose 2. kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry 4. James Harden 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Russell Westbrook 7. Anthony Davis 8. Giannis 9. Jimmy Butler 10. Lebron 
"Top 5 are Lebron, KD, Kawhi, Steph, and Harden. AD falls into the 6/7th spot imo, competing with Russell Westbrook."
"&gt; It’s hard to blame Durant though. He only had Russell Westbrook and pretty much nobody else on that team, it was awful. How are you supposed to win a title with just Westbrook? Westbrook and Serge Ibaka and that’s pretty much it. You can’t win a title with three dudes. It was just him, Westbrook, Serge, and then I guess Steven Adams too. You can’t win a title with those cats, you just can’t. Not with just him, Westbrook, Serge, and Steven Adams. I guess you throw Andre Roberson in there too. But there's no way you're winning a title with just him, Westbrook, Serge, Steve Adams and Roberson. You need a bench, all they had coming off the bench was Dion Waiters, and he’s good I guess, but apart from that it was just Enes Kanter and he’s good too, but that’s it. Durant and Westbrook has to carry those teams, their only help was Serge Ibaka, Steven Adams, Andre Roberson, Enes Kanter, and Dion Waiters coming off the bench. That’s it! It was just him and Westbrook pretty much, and then all those other guys, but then that was it.  "

"Magic used to have these tweets where he would say something like ""This NBA season has been great. Kevin Durant he has been playing at an MVP level."" Then he would have a second tweet that would be like, ""Some other players playing like a MVP are Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, James Harden. More players like LeBron, Giannis and Kawhi have also been MVP worthy."""
"Not sure why your getting downvoted, ever since 2013 we've had KD shooting 50/40/90, Steph leading the Warriors (which had been a historically awful team for 30+ years before they drafted him) to 67 wins, Steph shooting 50/40/90 while leading the league in scoring and leading his team to an all-time record of 73 wins, Russell Westbrook averaging a triple double for an entire season, etc.   Some of the most statistically unprecedented MVP seasons ever have come after LBJs last one in 2013. When you look at how impressive they are and the fact that they were being done in the western conference to boot it really shouldn't be that surprising that Lebron hasn't won very many first place votes; he really hasn't had any case for them over those other guys since 2013. Luckily the voters have recognized that quite clearly it seems. "
"Oh my god, get Russell Westbrook more help right now!!!!!"
"&gt; [Russell Westbrook gets the spot for now. Westbrook’s impact as a scorer, playmaker, and rebounder plus the way he’s carried the team during its playoff push as Paul George and Carmelo Anthony both struggle give him the razor-thin edge over everyone else.](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/4/9/17213702/james-harden-mvp-all-nba)  Even though I disagree it's an argument"

"Our pettiness aside, I say that *hoping* you guys lose in the second round because I’d rather play **anybody** but Russ in the playoffs - Rockets included.   He just goes to a whole other level against the Warriors and it is straight up terrifying.   I’m fully aware that I’m just a hater but Russell Westbrook - as much as I can’t stand him - is a transcendent basketball player and I will never argue that."
"Coming from Experience of watching Rondo for years (He might be the prototype to Russell Westbrook, attitude towards the media, bad 3 point shooter, Triple Double fiend ) Assists are easy to stat pad especially as a point guard, Rondo used to do it all the time, it was the biggest complaint about him(that and his attitude). When you are forcing things it just makes it look worse"
Russell Westbrook had to grab twenty boards in his final game to average a triple double... SAD!   /s
You just said that Russell Westbrook is not even remotely a good offensive player. You’re alone in thinking so. Why do you think that is?

"I know I know - I was just being a dick about semantics lol.  And to make it clear, I absolutely hate Russell Westbrook - like loathe the guy. I am a straight up hater. BUT I will not take anything away from him. He is a transcendent, incredible basketball player and, as a Warriors fan, nothing terrifies me more than Russ - not even Lebron. But Russ is the only one I’m afraid of - not the whole team.   He won’t take the leap to the next level until he can see those guys missing shots, and continues to feed it to them regardless instead of playing hero ball by himself. He needs to empower his teammate and I think that is literally the ONLY thing missing from his game. And that’s what Steph does so perfectly - [almost to a fault](https://youtu.be/QZnHqVVyulU) sometimes haha. "
"Your argument seems to be that it’s bad for the team. If that’s the case, then why do they win 82% of the time that he has gotten a triple double? To me, it seems like that the **majority of the time, it is good for the success of his team.**   Your comparisons for TS% are like apples and oranges. Of course KD and Steph would be more efficient in their scheme at Golden State. With a better team, Harden got to the line more and still averaged nearly identical stats to Westbrook last year, with Russ edging him out in productivity.   I’ll give you that he shoots a lot, but so did Kobe and MJ. Some nights it’s 30% and other nights it’s 65%. What you’re not acknowledging is the fact that Russell was the only one on that team that any defense had to worry about, yet he still had some of the best clutch time performances in recent memory last season. The playoff series against the Rockets is proof of that. The Thunder just couldn’t hang when Russ was off the court. He made them better.   Could he hustle more on D? Absolutely. He has trouble closing out, but he still was 5th in steals per game this year. Hard to say he’s one of the worst off ball defenders. However, I think his shortcomings on D are offset by the fact that the defensive scheme runs through Dre. With PG and Dre on the floor, that leaves Westbrook with the second best guard to man up against. Open shots are a trade off for the opportunity to score on the ensuing break, a stat that the Thunder was known for prior to Dre’s injury. They still managed to finish 4th in the league this year for fast break points per game in his absence.   I think part of the reason we haven’t seen triple doubles in this volume before is just simply the fact that we haven’t seen a PG like Russell before. It’s hard to average a triple double. You need a high usage, and also the ability to grab rebounds. Lebron being an exception because he has the genes to play any position. But for a 6’3 guard to out rebound bigs on a nightly basis is just unheard of.  I think the negative opinions on Westbrook just stem from not watching him. He got this rep early in his career and people latched on to it. Again, he still averaged a triple double this year while recording almost half as many. He wasn’t trying to get to that 10 mark every game. Some nights he just had monster performances in the rebound or assist column. Hate on him for hustling, but he’ll have the last laugh."
Last night might have been the quintessential Russell Westbrook game 
"Average a triple double? Maybe they're not as driven as him. Personally, I think Russell Westbrook is probably the most competitive player in the NBA and this is an accolade that he's obviously very passionate about. I don't think anyone else cares that much. For Russ, it'll be his legacy since he's not winning a ring anytime soon (or ever)"
"I don’t get how this sub rates players? Is it by talent or by accolades?  If it’s by talent do you seriously think your average superstar like Westbrook, Harden and Kawhi couldn’t go to Robertson’s time and put up way better numbers and be so much more athletic than the rest of the league?   If it’s accolades why are players like Wilt who only got 1 ring ranked over players like Shaq, Kobe and Duncan who got more rings in a far harder era with 4 times the teams? And if accolades is your barometer why isn’t Bill Russell your goat, no one comes close.  Like I get if you think Russell achieved more than Kobe, Shaq, Duncan etc. but do you seriously think if we dropped them 3 in his time they wouldn’t dominate the league?"

Russell Westbrook will go down as one of the most memorable basketball players EVER even if he doesn't win an NBA ring.  That is quite an accomplishment   
"Your right, unless you're a person in the meeting room, your shouldn't critique a player. Maybe he's supposed  to leave his [defender open](https://thebiglead.com/2017/03/24/is-russell-westbrook-padding-his-rebounding-stats-by-leaving-his-defender-stats-say-he-is/), who knows."
"Russell ""Even Numbers"" Westbrook"
If Russell Westbrook doesn't steal MVP from Harden this year there is no God.
"""A lot of people make jokes about stat padding turnovers. If people could get 3.000 turnovers every career, they would. If people could get f****** 2.500 turnovers, they would.""  -Russell Westbrook"
"whoa.  Russell westbrook is a legend and hall of Famer already, greatest all around though?  stop.  Is he one of the most versatile offensive players ever? yes.  let's end it there"
"I don't think it's underrated at all actually (this coming from a huge Dirk/Mavs fan). Most people who watched it recognize how huge of a playoff run the Mavs had that year. To put it in perspective, these are the stars the Mavs beat handily during those playoffs:   **1st Round 4-2 (POR)**: Brandon Roy, LaMarcus Aldridge  **2nd Round 4-0 (LAL)**: Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Andrew Bynum  **3rd Round 4-1 (OKC)**: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Serge Ibaka  **Finals 4-2 (MIA)**: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh   Not to mention Dirk was the best player on the planet during that run. Simply unstoppable."
"I’m gonna call it bullshit, because it is.  The NBA should be doing more to avoid their legacy going up in smoke life this.  It’s not even just stat padding, the game is just soft.   Can’t wait until my kids eventually ask me about  the great Russell Westbrook.  "
Can we officially change the name of triple doubles to Russell Westbrook?
Im gonna go ahead and say it. I don't even care who downvotes. I'm going out on a limb to say Russell Westbrook is a pretty decent at the game of basketball.
"Random? That's Westbrook's shooting stats against Rubio's team from last season (MVP season) and this season. Look up Basketball Reference [head to head stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/h2h_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Ricky+Rubio&amp;player_id1_select=Ricky+Rubio&amp;player_id1=rubiori01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;idx=players).  My point is that Rubio doesn't struggle against Westbrook as much as other defenders in the league.  This is OP's comment: ""Rubio has historically had a tough time playing against WB.""  Which is not true judging by stats. They played each other 17 times and he scored 30+ only 4 times. Westbrook has never scored 40 or more against Rubio."
"Historically? What?   There has been plenty of times where the wins and seedings have had no impact on who won it, even historically. Hell the very first MVP of the NBA Bob Petit was awarded the MVP award with his team facing a great record of 33-39.    Well you can say "" oh come on, that was when the league was all new! It has not been relevant since then on any great players right?""    Say hello to 75/76 season Kareem, winning the award with a team record of 40-42. They DID NOT QUALIFY FOR THE PLAYOFFS.     Or how about since we are on the flavor of the Houston Rockets, we take up Moses Malone in 78/79. Finishing with 47/35, qualifying for 7th best in the league...He does practically the same again in 81/82 season,  with the Rockets going 46-36, qualifying for 8th best in the league.    Or how about something more recent? Like 87/88 season where a young Michael Jordan, wins the MVP award for the Bulls, with a record of 50/32, qualifying for 8th best in the league.   And of course we have the 6th seed Westbrook from last year winning it.    So just to summarize - Historically there has been PLENTY of times where wins have had no influence on who won the MVP.     What can we say then with that new information? Well we can say that it just happens to be, that if you are sitting with an MVP caliber player like Wilt, Russell etc, having an MVP caliber year, you are most likely going to be a very highly winning team naturally based on your MVP caliber player, playing MVP caliber basketball.   That is a lot more sensible to conclude, than to simpyl disregard all the times you have been wrong throughout history on what has mattered and claim that it is simply exceptions.   "
Can we keep loving Russell Westbrook? I like it when we all love Westbrook.
"Bro what are you talking about. This was a good team with numerous win streaks that also broke other teams win streaks that year.   Caron Butler was coming back.   We defeated Brandon Roy, kevin Durant, james harden, Russell Westbrook, Kobe Bryant, pau gasol, Phil Jackson, lebron james, Dwayne wade, and chris bosh.   We beat the heat three games in a row.   And to top it off, okc lost 4-1 Against the heat the next year.   And you're gonna sit here and talk about how there's no way we would have beat okc?   This was an elite team with fabulous chemistry, defense, and perfect role players around Dirk.   Twopeat team for sure. With a chance at a Threepeat.   What do you mean lightning in a bottle? You don't beat 7 nba greats with lightning in a bottle. You don't slaughter and sweep an nba great and nba coaching great with lightning in a bottle. You don't beat three future MVP players with lightning in a bottle. You don't beat perhaps the greatest nba player of all time three games in a row wit lightning in a bottle. You don't discount that you have one of the top scorers in nba history as lightning in a bottle.   I'm with you bro because your a mavs fan. But please realize the greatness of what dirk nowitzki accomplished. It was not luck. Do you realize that out of 14 years, dallas was the only other team outside of la and San Antonio to reach the finals in the western conference?   What's pitiful is that espn creates this narative in our head that it was about how the Miami heat let the series get away, instead of it being about how the Mavericks took it by sheet force. Which in my opinion is why there are too many who believe that this was a finals win out of luck.   Nonsense.   Excuse me please for the long tirade. I feel a general frustration towards when I feel Dirk and this accomplishment of that team does not get enough respect.  And I have a good intentions in trying to inform a fellow fan that the narrative out there that the media and other teams try to brainwash us into that the year was luck - is total, completely, utter, unequivocal, BULLSHIT.   Thank you.   "

Infinite overtime for eternity and NBA locks down permanently until the result of the 2018 playoffs round one are determined. Russell Westbrook is 55 and is averaging a quintuple double in the playoffs.
"The historical context of the saying ""cotton-pickin"" isn't racist. It's like a way to ""cuss"" without cussing. No one that ever says it means anything racist by it including the black people in the south that say it. It's not innapropriate. It's not a ""poor choice of words"". It's a common saying in a region of the United States and to not say it in front of black people would actually be racist.   You may not be alone in your opinion, but your opinion is trash and it's a product of weird reactionary witchunts popular on social media where they look to take innocent things and make them racist. It's fucked up and this announcer who loves this team and loves Russell Westbrook is going to have hordes of people from shitty sites like Twitter and World Star calling him an evil racist and other horrible insults. It's fucking shameful."
&gt;just because many people can and did do something doesn't mean it's not associated with an ethnicity/race in a derogatory way.  Just because someone says its racist doesn't mean its racist. Please explain to me the logic you use to jump to the conclusion that this phrase is a negative on Russell Westbrook. Explain the steps please.

2017-18  [Russell Westbrook OKC (376)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/)  Derp
Professional stat-padder Russell Westbrook gets the 16 rebounds needed to average triple-double in another season destined to end in a second round exit.
"I have a theory. Russell Westbrook is an amazing basketball player. Arguably the best player in the league. However, I believe that he will never win a championship. I picture him to be the Allen Iverson of our generation. He’ll be an amazing player, he’ll wi mvps, but he won’t get a ring. I know this is due largely to the fact that the top teams in the west are so good (and decently young). I just don’t see him winning a ring. Ever"
"Girl: Babe, come over, my dad isn't home. Before you do though, can you please bring 16 rebounds.  Russell Westbrook:  "
i thought you guys had a russell westbrook problem?
Russell Westbrook stat padding with cotton smh
You're right. Russell Westbrook is a terrible basketball player. Actually you've changed my mind. Oscar Robertson was the ultimate stat whoring troll. 180 triple doubles. What a selfish taint. 
i love that name  russell westbrook. it just rolls off the tongue
Russell Westbrook made the triple double stat a common thing. It’s not special anymore 
"“Some Run, Some build Runways “  Russell Westbrook Air Jordan commercial"
"You know you are delusional as fuck when you think Russell Westbrook and Steph Curry will finish on equal ground by the end of their careers lol. Curry peaked higher, has more rings, more MVPs, and is on pace to win a shit ton more in his career. "
can confirm lol  http://www.nba.com/article/2017/04/04/russell-westbrook-ties-oscar-robertson-triple-double-record
Russell “Kakashi Sensei” Westbrook   Except he didn’t turn into the glove in this situation but Kawhi
"Nope. Rondo's trip dubs were eye catching, but not game changing. Russell Westbrook started the high scoring triple doubles in 2015 when KD was out for the season. When Russ masked up and got like 6 in a row, that's when everything changed"
"B/c saying ""Russell Westbrook is out of his cotton pickin' mind"" implies that Russ picks cotton which is obviously something no one in their right mind would ever want to do when talking about an African American due to the long and bloody history surrounding Black Americans and the Cotton industry.  Go ahead and use it when talking to someone who isn't black but I don't think it's that hard to mind that phrase when talking about an African American."
"for the sake of /r/All, is Russell Westbrook black or white? "
"This is why I see Russell Westbrook as a cultural icon. He hasn't impacted the game as much as Curry has with the 3 ball, but he is pretty damn close. I'm sure every little league coach is telling their players that size is not an excuse to not be an animal on the court. I love my MVP"
"If a literal douche bag could play in the NBA and average a triple double, EVEN IT wouldn't want to be compared to Russell Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook from the West Coast tho.
"&gt; I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES  "
Is Russell Westbrook the best player in the league? I've been in a bangkok prison camp for 77 years
Russell Westbrook 4 MVP!! (Triple doubles are the only stat that matters)

"k listen up you little shit  I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns. This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES  "
"Russell ""Statpadder"" Westbrook boxed out Melo for the rebound. LOL!  https://streamable.com/2d2i4"
I learned the game from Russell Westbrook you can never test me.
"The stat inflation was also an exaggeration or useless talking point. There's no realistic argument that Jazz home bookkeepers padded his stats, as there's a very small variance from his home totals and away.   I can't find the post of the guy who broke it down, but he was something like 0.5 assists more at home than away. Guys like Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook have more of a variance in home/away performances.  Again, if John Stockton's career was as a Celtic you'd be sitting her arguing he's at the level of Magic, but he played for Utah so he gets undercut and excuses are made.  Fun fact, if you only count assists Stockton got on the road, he's still 7th in All Time Assists.  He's a quiet unassuming guy, who just was excellent for a long, long, time.   Not just good, not just above average, he was excellent for two decades.  Edit:  Found it...  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/70kope/contrary_to_popular_belief_john_stockton_did_not/?st=jfvw7y8a&amp;sh=157604d7 "
Russell Westbrook is better than Oscar Robertson.
&gt; I'm saying maybe we are overrating Russell Westbrook  Flair checks out
&gt;TIL Russell Westbrook is the only NBA player to average a triple double over a season and not make all-NBA first team
just got out of a Turkish prison... so this Russell Westbrook guy is the best in the NBA right?
I'm saying maybe we are overrating Russell Westbrook if he can take Victor Oladipo and make him look like a scrub then add Melo &amp; PG &amp; a grand total of one win

"He's really going for it, it isn't subtle.  That said, staring at Russell Westbrook (I'm counting his stats manually for fun) has made me realize how integral his rebounds are to the Thunder's style of play. So many breaks start with the ball in his hands. Very different than the Dubs play"

RUSSELL WESTBROOK REBOUND TRACKER: 15 REMAINING
"Recent context does matter though. Guys like Allen Iverson were looked upon more favorably 20 years ago than a Russell Westbrook is now. Player evaluation has shifted more towards efficiency and advanced stats than it was in the past. All looking back further does is tell you how things *used* to be, not necessarily how they *should*."

"Here are some career playoff average numbers for your head top:  Player | Playoff Career PPG |Playoff Career TS% ---|---|---- Allen Iverson | 26 | 47 Paul George | 17 | 56 Demar Derozan | 21 | 49 James Harden | 21 | 59 Russell Westbrook | 25 | 52  That's 3 MVPs if you include Harden along with Derozan and Paul George who are fringe MVP contending type of players.  Not that many players average 20+PPG in the playoffs and those who do usually don't do it on good efficiency.   The players that do it on good to great efficiency are usually all-time type of players like Durant, Lebron, Jordan, Bird, Kareem, Shaq, Kobe etc.  So yah, Derozan isn't an all-time great but his playoff performances are not out of place for historically VERY GOOD NBA players.

"I def not gonna get into hypotheticals, that’s retarded. Russell Westbrook has been absolute shit and has 2 pts in the 4th quarter the last 2 loses. You wanna be a dick sucker and refuse to criticize that’s on you  Just because people play different positions doesn’t mean they can’t be compared. Anthony Davis outplayed Dame Lillard and it ain’t arguable. Gobert (and everyone else practically) outplayed Russ and that’s worthwhile to bring up  You’re so pissed lmao. The mans playing like garbage and being outplayed by a rookie and Ricky Rubio!"
"And people still wonder why KD wanted out of OKC.  You can call him a bitch or whatever for going to the Warriors after they beat him, but now he gets to play in a system where he gets plenty of good touches and has solid, unselfish options around him.  In OKC, he knew if he threw the ball to Westbrook, he probably wasn't going to get it back, which forced him into tough shots and ISO situations.  Russell is an amazing player, but his style of play is not conducive to championship basketball. "
russell westbrook 
Maybe that has something to do with playing most of his minutes with Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook?

"Royce Young of ESPN took a look at this pattern of failure after the Pistons loss, and found (along with a mean that has been screaming for some Thunder regression since last season) an approach to late-clock situations that still treats the Thunder as Russell Westbrook Plus Some Guys:  Westbrook has always been a serial freelancer in those situations, taking the set play and tweaking it to his own liking.

"Westbrook has way too much influence on how the Thunder operate offensively (check his usage ratings). Whether you blame him and/or Donovan for that is your own call. At the same time, you have to think about the fact that russell westbrook doesn't let other guards who play with him shine. Think about it: Harden, Reggie Jackson, Oladipo. He's not a great team player in that regard, and he's the only relevant guy still here from that original okc finals team  That being said, I do feel like Donovan is one of those guys that was just better as a college coach. This team he has now should be getting better production, even if melo is kind of washed up now. There's too much potential going to waste, and he's effectively being a worse version of what Scott Brooks was"
"But if the same issue has persisted through two coaches it might not be them, it might be the players. And who is the constant through both of those coaches? Westbrook. He has to be willing to listen to and implement the coaches plans and if he thinks it's the Russell Westbrook show he won't do that. "
"Russell ""Binky"" Westbrook "
There is a glaring difference in rebounds. Someone other than russell Westbrook needs to grab a board 
"Sure let's look at it than:   Although you gave me the bullshit that AD should technically achieve higher elevation for his team, how come offensive rating is higher when Russell westbrook is on the floor than Davis?   https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01/on-off/2018  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02/on-off/2018  Before you use teammate difference: Last season, when Russell Wesbrook had far inferior teammate than current Davis', he STILL achieved higher offensive rating when he was on the floor.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01/on-off/2017   That's funny right? Despite Anthony Davis ""playing the right way"" Westbrook elevates his teammates FAR more offensively, WHILE ALSO having a the stronger offensive rating when he is on the floor.   Btw? Even if you try to argue the inconsistency of on/off, RAPM STILL gives RW a strong lead over Davis.  Good time to mention, offense was absolutely average when AD was on the floor last season:   https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02/on-off/2017   Actually, even if you want to use Box stats, RW FAR eclipses AD. So what are you talking about, dude?   So AD is such a great elevator that his teammate is almost fine offensively without him? Okay"
"Let me give you a rundown of Thunder's offensive plays: 1. Westbrook/Adams pick and roll 2. Westbrook/Melo pick and pop 3. Westbrook/George pick and pop 4. Pin down for George 5. Melo isolation (10 jab step, fadeaway midrange shot) 6. Westbrook isolation up top (can't capitalize on it, even with a missmatch) 7. George isolation All this is happening while our other players are standing, bent over, on the perimeter. This ""offense"" has no movement. It literally consists of the most basic PnR combinations known to basketball. At some point you have to blame the coach for the lack of creativity. At times I really doubt Donovan's coaching ability at all. This dude is the most passive coach in the league, even fucking Lue is more vocal on the sidelines. He stands in front of our bench with his hands crossed, not giving any input or instructions.  I really want to see how far we can go with this type of offense, a.k.a I want to see when Donovan will be fired for his underachieving. 2016: he (not directly) chokes away a 3-1 lead with a much better roster than now 2017: lose in the 1st round (I'll give him a pass since our team was ass last year and we faced a good Rockets team...) 2018: 48 wins with Paul George, Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook in your team. So far, not looking good in the post-season.  Westbrook absolutely needs to learn to play off-ball, but that won't happen without a proper coach. I feel like he still lacks some fundamental basketball skills. I look at guys like Curry or Irving, they are constantly moving, forcing the other team to scramble. This Thunder offense has zero movement, and Russ is a big part of that."
"Westbrook didn’t need to score in game 2, Paul George was hot.  Game 3 was a bad game, it happens. He’s Russell Westbrook. He’s not exactly the measure of efficiency and shot selection. "
"Hey Russell Westbrook, number 0 of the Oklahoma City thunder, you should think about sucking on a baby's pacifier because you do an excessive amount of whining!"
"The Thunder Big 3 have been getting destroyed by the Big 3 of Rubio, Mitchell, and Gobert.   Russell Westbrook is a top 10 individual talent, but I think I would take 10+ players over him if I wanted to start a team with legitimate championship aspirations."
Can we finally admt that Russell Westbrook is overrated? Didn’t KD have the same problem with Westbrook’s atrocious shooting percentages?

"It's a good thing OKC fans were able to rattle off those Lillard jokes earlier. I'll admit he did have a pretty rough time against double and triple teams.  Unfortunately for those same fans, however, Russell Westbrook is currently 5-17 with 8 turnovers facing single-coverage in the game that usually decides the series, a 1-1 Game 3.

Are you Russell Westbrook 
"Here's the article:  - - - - -  &gt; Through two playoff games, the Jazz have limited the Thunder's transition opportunities by committing what are commonly refered to as ""Euro-fouls,"" when they intentionally hack whichever Thunder player is leading a fast break, usually Russell Westbrook.  &gt; They've executed five so far, four on Westbrook and one on backup point guard Raymond Felton. It's a straightforward concept: Utah would rather use one of its five fouls per quarter to ensure Oklahoma City is taking the ball out instead of running it down the court. For now, the Thunder seem not to mind the hacks all too much.  &gt; “You got to keep pushing it,” transition aficionado Corey Brewer said. “If they’re going to foul him, we’re going to get in the bonus.”  &gt; To OKC's credit, the Jazz haven’t capitalized perfectly on their Euro-fouling opportunities. Shooting guard Donovan Mitchell reverted to peak-rookie mode one time and fouled Westbrook when they were already in the bonus. And Utah hasn’t used the strategy all that often, yet.  &gt; But Utah is notoriously good at not fouling and has avoided the bonus well this series. In fact, those two Westbrook free throws following Mitchell’s brain cramp are the only two freebies OKC has shot off non-shooting fouls this series (excluding the intentional fouling inside the final minute of Game 1's eight-point Thunder win). The Jazz have stayed out of the bonus altogether for three of the series’ eight quarters and haven't reached it earlier than with 2:56 remaining in a period.  &gt; “Just being able to get him out of transition, because [Westbrook] is elite when it comes to transition,” Mitchell said. “So, just trying to limit that as much as possible. Get guys back on defense, but it’s not as easy as it looks.”  &gt; It could become a tad less complicated once Utah gets more familiar with the Thunder, though. And as the series continues, it’s conceivable the Euro-fouls could start to pile, given the Thunder’s makeup.  &gt; For all the offensive talent on the roster, this team has been one of the NBA’s worst at scoring when the game is slow. Oklahoma City averaged only 93.3 points per 100 possessions while in its half-court offense this season, 21st in the NBA, according to Synergy Sports. The Jazz, meanwhile, allowed only 91.3 points per 100 while defending in the half court, third-best in the league, per Synergy.  &gt; So, Utah is taking a chance based on the most basic of mathematics. The most important aspect of finding success on the break is simply getting there. The least efficient transition offenses are still more successful than the best half-court ones. And the Thunder know how to convert potentially long possessions into quick ones, streaking ones.   &gt; They averaged 11.0-second possessions on ones that followed defensive rebounds this year, making for the NBA’s eighth-quickest offense in those scenarios, according to inpredictable.com. Their possessions that followed turnovers took 8.9 seconds, seventh-fastest in the league. Maybe as the series goes on, the Jazz can put more and more of an emphasis on taking that away.  &gt; Oklahoma City averaged 108.8 points per 100 possessions in transition this season, per Synergy, vastly better than when opponents turn the attack more viscous. It’s why, after all, OKC coaches and players scheme for Westbrook to grab boards, when the league’s arguable fastest player can grab and go without having to worry about fielding an outlet pass. The Thunder averaged an inconceivably high 123.6 points per 100 on possessions that follow his defensive rebounds, according to data filtered by pbpstats.com.  &gt; When Utah pulls those Euro-fouls, the Thunder lose that effect.  &gt; So maybe this happens more as the series continues, considering Utah is already a disciplined team and players will grow more comfortable with OKC’s and Westbrook’s habits with each game. If the Jazz are able to stay away from non-shooting fouls in other scenarios, Euro-fouling could be worth it — especially considering there’s no defense against it.  &gt; “If they’re going to run and foul somebody, they’re going to go ahead and do that…So yeah, it moves you one foul closer to the bonus,” Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. “But there’s really nothing you can do.”"

"Tomorrow  "" Would any team be better with Russell Westbrook? """
"Russell Westbrook's flaws, is his lack of off-ball movement. When he hands the ball off to another player, lets presume Paul George, he'd just slow walk back to half court, and whoever is guarding him would simply try to apply pressure or double team PG forcing a pass back to westbrook. It happens with a majority of his team mates, he rarely makes the pass if it doesn't end in an assist. "
"Firstly, My question is how many Allstars in the league are known for their off ball movement apart from the warriors team?  Secondly, how much of this is westbrooks fault. Aren't their any plays in the okc playbook that has him moving off ball?   Lastly, your points about oladipo, KD and pg are all wrong.  Pg statistically had a pretty similar season as last year before he joined.  Oladipo was nothing special in Orlando, you're gunna blame westbrook for that too?  Oladipo even said he learned a lot from Russell with his time on the Thunder. It definitely shows in the way he plays for the pacers now, especially with how he uses his speed and acceleration to force defenders to give him enough space to stop on a dime for open js.  "
"&gt; Jordan's weak 3 point shooting would be a massive weakness in today's NBA. And he would not get better. His jump shooting style was not build to shoot 3 pointers. He held the ball way too high and used way to much upper body to shoot.  Exactly why Russell Westbrook is one of the league's most impactful players right? Exactly why Giannis is one of the league's best, right?   You think MJ used too much UPPER BODY? Did you not watching his form? If anything  he used his legs too much, causing more flat shots. His elevation is incredible in his jumper. You haven't watched anything dude.  Get outta here."

"Not sure if it's behind a paywall but here is the article in case anyone can't read it:  Nanae Yamano, an Oklahoma City Thunder superfan who happens to be a stay-at-home mother in the Tokyo suburbs, had never been to an NBA game before this week. She had never been to Oklahoma City. She had never been anywhere outside Japan.  She didn’t know how she would handle watching her favorite team in person—an idea was so far beyond the realm of imagination that she had no reason to believe she would ever find out.  “And then this happened,” she said.  This was the long series of unlikely events that culminated with Nanae Yamano sitting courtside at the Oklahoma City Thunder’s playoff game on Wednesday night as the team’s honored guest.  It all started last month when The Wall Street Journal published a story about Yamano, whose Thunder artwork had become so popular online that it reached her subjects: the Oklahoma City players were sharing it around the locker room. They knew who she was. They did not know she was a 43-year-old mother who lived very, very far away from Oklahoma City.  The NBA contacted Yamano after the story and offered to pay for her trip to a potential Thunder playoff game. She got a passport, but she didn’t allow herself to get too excited. “We didn’t even know if the Thunder would make the playoffs,” she said.  When they clinched a spot in the last week of the season and home-court advantage on the last night of the season, she had to get halfway across the world faster than she expected. Her original flight was canceled. Her rebooked flights were delayed. She finally made it to Oklahoma City after a full day of traveling, and her chauffeur took her directly to the Thunder’s arena.  It was 3:30 a.m.  The rest of her pilgrimage was surreal in pretty much every way. She was recognized on the street by fans. She was officially welcomed on the JumboTron immediately after the Kiss Cam. She was introduced to Thunder players, local dignitaries and the halftime performer Red Panda. She was presented with two No. 0 jerseys—one that said “WESTBROOK” and one that said “NANAE-SAN.”  The same person who was used to watching the Thunder on her iPad found herself watching the Thunder from NBA commissioner Adam Silver’s seats.  Her carefully planned itinerary started with a personal invitation to City Hall by the mayor of Oklahoma City. She visited the Thunder offices and took pictures with team employees. She tweeted many photos of many buildings and was fascinated by “No Firearms Allowed” signs in windows. She dined at the steakhouse where Thunder players are regulars, and she apologized profusely when she couldn’t finish her enormous slab of meat. The next morning, after clearing her plate of fried green tomato eggs Benedict, she was treated to a guided tour of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum, where she admired John Wayne’s Buddhas and Ronald Reagan’s cowboy boots.  It might not be long before Yamano’s art is hung in museums here given the way her work has been embraced by the city.  She turns her iPad into a sketchpad after every Thunder game, and the results are undeniably adorable. Oklahoma City staffers print their favorite Yamanos from Instagram to hang around the office, and they watched her draw in chalk on a wall inside the team’s arena upon her arrival. They spoke with Yamano through her translator, Reo Onishi, an NBA writer in Tokyo, but she also understands English well enough that she’s funny and charming in both languages.  Before the game, as she giggled and gasped and generally convulsed with joy meeting the strangers she’d only seen on social media, she realized she wasn’t exactly meeting strangers. “It seems like I know everybody,” she said.  What she did not expect was for everybody to know her. Or for someone to approach her as she walked around town and say: “I follow you on Instagram!” Or for her fans to want autographs. She had never signed her work before, and she was blown away that she had fans.  It would be reasonable at this point to ask how any of this actually happened.  Yamano was bored doing laundry one day in 2012 when she turned on her television and found herself mesmerized by Russell Westbrook and the Thunder even though she didn’t know who Russell Westbrook was or what the Thunder were.  But that one game was all it took to enthrall her. Nanae Yamano became obsessed with the Oklahoma City Thunder, and the deeply enigmatic Russell Westbrook became her artistic muse.  She watches every game without having to clear her schedule—“I have no schedule,” she says—and usually by herself with her husband at work and her son at school. As the game approached on Wednesday night, she realized she was going to be surrounded by 18,000 of her people.  “Maybe I can hide my craziness,” she said, “because everyone else is crazy.”  She walked into the arena hours before Game 2 of the Thunder’s series against the Utah Jazz. The only people around the court that early were there to watch Westbrook or to watch Yamano watch Westbrook.  Westbrook always ends his warmups by shooting corner 3-pointers until he makes one and sprints away, and Yamano was asked by the small army of Thunder and NBA employees around her to predict how many shots it would take. She said he would make his fourth.  He missed the first. He missed the second. He missed the third. He made his fourth.  Westbrook went through his entire warmup routine on the other side of the court without acknowledging Yamano. “He was exactly the way I thought he would be,” she said. There had been whispers of a post-game summit with Westbrook, and it seemed plausible that he was aware of her presence and couldn’t wait to meet her. It also seemed plausible he didn’t have a clue who she was.  But of all the basketball teams in all the world, she picked the one that perfectly embodies this city of booms and busts, and she got the full manic Thunder experience when they lost to the Jazz. She didn’t have to be told that Westbrook would not be in the mood to meet.  Andre Roberson came instead—she loves Roberson and Steven Adams almost as much as she’s inspired by Westbrook—and enveloped Yamano in a hug. There was no need for an introduction. He already knew her work, and she already knew he was a hugger.  She presented him with a beautiful wooden box handcrafted by her husband. Inside was a book of 82 drawings that she’d printed on a 7-11 copy machine—her depiction of the Thunder’s season. She told him it was for the team. As he flipped through the pages, Roberson said he was going to keep it for himself.  “I know we lost,” he said, “but did you enjoy the game?”  Nanae Yamano was so overwhelmed by the game that she couldn’t even draw afterward. That any of this had ever happened, she said as she left the arena, was like her version of the American dream.  She was barely able to sleep before she woke up early the next morning. She was leaving Oklahoma City after two magical days and flying right back to Tokyo.  Nanae Yamano had to be home in time for Game 3.  "
He's not as athletic as Westbrook. He's an incredible athlete but Russell is a different breed
"You guys will never win a ring with Russell Westbrook on your roster. The upside though, is that he’s a career guy and will surely retire a Thunder. Enjoy your decade of shortcoming friendo."
Can we all just agree that Russell Westbrook is first team? Shit
"How can you play 35 minutes and only get 2 assists? He has 13 for the series while Rondo has 37! I know they're different styles of players but come on. Russell Westbrook used to get shit on for being selfish and a chucking ball hog but Dame never gets the same treatment. He doesn't make his teammates or his team better when it counts. Yet no doubt he'll still have a chip on his shoulder because the only person who considers him an elite PG is himself.   Dude has more turnovers than assists this series. Serious questions need to be asked of him, IMO.  He actually thinks he should be first team all NBA? Hilarious. "
"as others have said not much they can do with their current contracts. agree with you on the part where okc needs to win a title for russ   im going to go through each player and their contract on a case by case basis cause i have nothing better to do at this hour   (all salaries are for 2018-19)   Abrines, Álex  $ 5,455,236.00 (RFA 19) He's been solid for them in his time on the thunder, will most likely not be a big demand for him on the trade market. Staying with them for the time being    Adams, Steven $ 24,157,304.00  (UFA 21)  Have to keep him, even if they do trade him he has a trade kicker i believe     Anthony, Carmelo  $ 27,928,140.00 (UFA 19) (technically PO 18 but he's accepting that during the press conference after their last game)  His big money is on the books for next year and there's still a NTC so no point in offing him    Brewer, Corey N/A (UFA 18)  Your favorite player that you didn't know was 6'9"" will either try to get big moolah manning heavy artillery or sign a vet min on a contender. In OKC's best interest to retain him for min    Collison, Nick N/A (UFA 18)  He's staying. Wether its with the roster or the franchise (retirement) Collison will be on the team next year     Felton, Raymond N/A (UFA 18)  Same case with Brewer, your favorite humanoid english muffin should re-sign on the cheap    Ferguson, Terrance  $ 2,118,840.00 (2YRT 19)   Best young asset/trading chip on the team, in the best interest of the FO to maximize his value while still on his rookie deal. That usually means keeping a player, but if tax is too much and/or they don't see 2kFerg as a core piece in the future and/or a better long-term opportunity arises he gone    George, Paul N/A (PO 18)  IF instagram thots aren't enough to lure him to LA (the Clippers also have/can make space for a max and thats a more playoff-ready team at their current state compared to the Lakers) he is getting the proverbial Brinks truck from OKC. Need to do it to win now, but as OP said, if they don't do much in the playoffs 2019 will most likely be the same story b/c they'll have the same team more or less.      Grant, Jerami N/A (UFA 18 (pretty sure))  A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. Some borderline tank team that may try for an 8th seed (looking at you, Chicago) could throw some money ($7 mil+) at him if his playoff performace is decent, and i would bet said money that OKC would't offer something comparable     Huestis, Josh N/A (UFA 18)    Being honest I barely know anything about him. Re-sign on the min?    Johnson, Dakari  $ 1,378,242.00 (RFA 19)   I know more about him than Huestis in that Dakari went to Kentucky. If they want to alleviate their tax bill they could dump him for a top-55 protected second   Patterson, Patrick  $ 5,451,600.00 (PO 19)    Solid bench player, but at their current state his contract is a bit TOO much to make moves. Will most likely accept for 2020 so he's on the books until then.     Roberson, André  $ 10,000,000.00 (UFA 20)    Again, same with 2pat, but beefed up a bit more. Not having him REALLY hurts this playoffs, so hopefully in the 2019 postseason he can be of use       Singler, Kyle  $ 4,996,000.00 (NGT 19)   Why.   At least his contract is non guaranteed past 2019, so if they want to acquire an asset for the asset chest Singler is more or less an expiring deal. Buying him out wouldn't help b/c they are hard capped      Westbrook, Russell  $ 35,350,000.00 (UFA 23)   The cog of the city. Can't trade him; have to work with him to maximize his prime    On their 2 way guys PJ Dozier is a solid b i g  g u a r d, try and bring in some new meat on the other spot next year    Asset chest is pretty dry with regards to other's picks. Owe their 2020+ to Orlando, so can't make many moves with that due to Stepien rule. Their seconds are next to nothing; same goes for their Euro stashes.           **TL;DR** Come back next offseason"

"James harden plays in the same conference as Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, etc"
"There it is: The Rockets flair and the ""narrative"" bullshit. Here's the cold hard facts: When Russell Westbrook gets the rebound to push the court, OKC is significantly better. Objective metrics say so. OKC is also [the best transition offense in the country.](https://stats.nba.com/teams/transition/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals)       You can hate Westbrook all you want, and discredit him, but you're factually incorrect in your suggestion that Westbrook getting the rebound hurts OKC's offense.  "
"Not the second part, but the fact that he misses so many shots has allowed for Steven Adams to become a monster.  Paul George has also had, by far, the best 3-point shooting year of his career this year on massive volume (7.7 per game) with the % of his 3-point shots coming off of assists (80%) and from the corner (20%) staying almost exactly the same as they have always been, suggesting, to me, that there is probably something about receiving a Russell Westbrook pass that makes it better to shoot off of than a normal NBA player's pass."
"[Undersized SG slasher who will spend the early part of his career trying to be molded into a PG and will struggle because he doesn't possess the instincts and vision to be a successful NBA PG.  You're talking about a 3* prospect out of HS who even in HS was an undersized slashing SG.  Westbrook is a slashing Monta Ellis type of SG but Monta Ellis has a track record of being a big time scorer who can create his own shot but Russell on the other hand never scored more than 22 Pts since the end of his HS career.  Westbrook is not comparable with Randy Foye another undersized SG who was attempted to be molded into a PG because Randy Foye is a stronger and more athletic 2 who enjoys to draw contact but can shoot from the outside and create his own shot.  Westbrook has emerged as a Top 10 pick although he was considered a player who could've gone between 16-25 just 6 weeks ago and him possibly going to New York at #6 or anywhere in the lottery will draw a microscope to his progression.  Russell unlike the other Guards in this draft class doesn't have something he's so good at that it can keep him employed in the NBA,his defense is good sometimes but it's been overlooked that Ben Howland teaches his players great zone defense and Russell is potentially a product of that defensive scheme.  Russell has quick hands and can get a steal or two but how he'll be able to fair in a man to man defense against much stronger PG's such as Baron Davis,Deron Williams,Jason Kidd,Chauncey,etc on the defensive end is in doubt.   **I'm sorry but Russell Westbrook will be the 1st player from this draft class who will be out of the league.**](http://www.insidehoops.com/forum/showthread.php?t=93314)"
"The narrative around Westbrook, for most of his career, is that he was a black hole offensively and his inefficient way of playing limited the talent of good players that were on his teams (i.e. KD leaving and having one of the most efficient seasons of his career, Harden leaving and becoming a superstar, etc.). Now that there is another superstar that has seemed to come, coincidentally or not, the moment he leaves Westbrooks team. Context is important with each one of those players but the underlying factor is unequivocally Russell Westbrook.   But Oladipo is a different case than Harden or KD. I think he benefitted from being with Westbrook for that year, as he understood what it took to be a superstar in this league, because he definitely didn't learn that from being on the Magic. So I think Westbrook shouldn't get any flak for Oladipo. He was just a late bloomer"

"&gt;1st. LeBron James- 99 first team, 1 second team vote (Sherrod Blakely- CSN New England), 0 third team, left off 0 ballots &gt; &gt;1st. Russell Westbrook- 99 first, 1 second team vote (Flavio Tranquillo- Sky Italia), 0 third team, left off 0 ballots &gt; &gt;2nd. Stephen Curry- Voting breakdown: 1 first team vote (Flavio Tranquillo- Sky Italia)-93-6, left off 9 ballots  I don't think it's ridiculous to put Curry on the 1st team over Russell (and I thought Russ was the MVP). Curry's just one of the three-best players in the world. If that's how you pick All-NBA, then that's fine with me.  Alternatively, having Durant and Kawhi on the first team over LeBron isn't that ridiculous if you view team success as more important than being the best player in the world. I disagree, but it's ok if you're consistent.  I'm also ok with someone saying Anthony Davis isn't a center since he splits his time pretty evenly.  The issue is that the criteria are left up to the media person. If the NBA defined these terms, you might end up with better results."
"Year  |  ROY  |  Notable Players | Conclusion -------|-------|-------------------|-------------- 2000  |  Mike Miller  |  Kenyon Martin, Jamal Crawford, Michael Redd | Conclusion: No, not even worth arguing 2001  |  Pau Gasol  |  Joe Johnson, Tony Parker, Gilbert Arenas  |  Yes, but this one is very close, and this is just my personal opinion. Gasol is just over parker for me. He has had such a long peak and still today a formidable starter 2002 | Amar’e Stoudemire | Yao Ming, Carlos Boozer | No, this is another close one. But I believe Yao Ming edges this one out. Even though Yaos career was short, but in the time he played he dominated the game 2003 | Lebron James | Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh | Do i really have to say it? 2004 | Emeka Okafor | Dwight Howard, Loul Deng, Andre Iguodala | No, Not even close 2005 | Chris Paul | Andrew Bynum, Deron Williams, Andrew Bogut | Yes, Deron williams would have been the only one close, but his career seemingly fell off a cliff. 2006 | Brandon Roy | LaMarcus Aldridge, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Paul Millsap | No, however if injuries didn’t derail his career he may have been. But there is just to much talent in this class to say he undoubtedly would have been the best 2007 |  Kevin Durant | Al Horford, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley |  Yes, one of the best scorers of all time. Move along 2008 | Derrick Rose | Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, DeAndre Jordan | No, another story of what could have been but injuries took that away from us. Rose is my favorite player, but to say that Westbrook has not had a better career so far would be false. 2009 | Tyreke Evens | Blake Griffin, James Harden, Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Jrue Holiday | No, but looking back was that an unbelievably stacked class of guards. And Tyreke Evens had the best rookie year. Makes you think. 2010 | Blake Griffin | John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Paul George | No, but This one is hard to judge because Blake Griffin was not actually drafted in this class, but all 3 of these guys are better then Blake Griffin 2011 | Kyrie Irving | Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard | No, aside from all the Kawhi drama this year, he is a Top 10 player in the league, and a defensive monster. No question on this one. 2012 | Damian Lillard | Anthony Davis, Bradly Beal, Draymond Green | No, Anthony Davis is a beast on both ends of the floor and in conversations for DPOY and MVP 2013 | Michael Carter Williams | Rudy Gobert, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Viktor Oladipo | Yeah No, just refer back to these three names 2014 | Andrew Wiggins | Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Aaron Gordon | No, Embiid is on another level above everyone else"

Name a better duo than Russell Westbrook and childish outbursts 
I’m ready for the Russell Westbrook show again 
WHY DID RUSSELL WESTBROOK DO THIS?!?!?!?
"Russell did what he could. He took some bad shots but it didn't help that he couldn't trust any of his teammates. George seemed too passive and refused to shoot, while Carmelo rode the bench. Adams came to play and Westbrook fed him a few times, but no else could be trusted. "
"Russell Westbrook ties himself for second most FGA in a playoff game with 43 (since 1984, which is as far back as bbref takes it). #1 is Jordan with 45."
"Does Steph Curry, the best shooter in the history of the NBA, shoot as many 3's as Russell Westbrook? "
"Tonight we witnessed Russell Unstoppable Force Westbrook meeting Rudy Immovable Object Gobert, and finally answered the age-old question.  As incredible as Beastbrook has been this game, Gobert just kills him at the rim. It's unbelievable. No one can stop Westbrook when he's locked on with a full head of steam, but he will run the other direction when Gobert is there."
"Rotational forward Carmelo Anthony yelled out, ""Meh. $28 million."" Series leader in net rating Alex Abrines gave a look of disappointment and disgust. Laker-on-loan Paul George yelled out, ""We got a [choking noises] squad now."" And before Billy Donovan hit the hot seat, former NBA great Russell Westbrook hugged him and said ""They made some shots. Too comfortable. But I'm gonna shut that shit off next game though. Guarantee that."""
"Carmelo Anthony yelled “I am the worst player on the court”.  Russell Westbrook gave a look of genuine derangement.  Paul George belted out “I’m going to a different [expletive] squad”.  And before Corey Brewer hit the locker room, ex-OKC star Kevin Durant hugged him and said “You can’t win a championship with those cats”.  "
"Russell Westbrook is great, but he's really not that great. He's like the really athletic kid that is somehow uncoordinated.  I know this is a bad take just let me have it."

Russell Westbrook.  What the fuck.  This is like last nights game all over except they might lose with a 40pt RW performance.
"What sucks for Thunder fans is that Russell Westbrook showed the fuck up for this series but PG and Melo didn't. The 2 games that PG showed up they won convincingly, the rest they lost. "
"I don't like Russell Westbrook, but goddamn do I respect him."
"Not that i feel bad for beating them, i just feel bad for them having to deal with the constant “Is Russell Westbrook a top 20 player?” shit"

Our mayors have fun with basketball. Every day is Russell Westbrook day. 
According to r/nba that team will be trash and never win anything because “Russell Westbrook is not a winning player”
"Russell Westbrook: ""delet this"""
I can confirm. Similar happens with Russell Westbrook
"I think that the common comparison has been AI and Kobe for various reasons and I would agree with that.  I think the natural extension of this discussion is... can you win with Russell Westbrook?  I think Westbrook has a unique set of skills that OKC has to accommodate. And looking back now, it seems as if PG13 and Melo wasn't the right additions.  I admire OKC's aggressiveness to get PG13 and Melo and field a team with marquee names... but -- with hindsight, obviously -- they may have missed the mark.  At this point I think the OKC front office should just say ""Fuck it"" and just construct an AI-era team. The kind of team that AI took to the Finals. Just load up the roster with unsexy names that exist to purely compliment Westbrook for the remainder of his contract.  Basically, you want a team of Andre Roberson's and Steven Adams'. Tough, gritty, defensive-minded players who can let Westbrook do his thing (and not feel obligated to feed a PG13 type player). And players who are decent shooters just to keep defenses honest.  And then just roll the dice, play loose, have fun and see what happens."

"I don't think the take is necessarily wrong, but the explanation is. Russell Westbrook is terrible off ball, and other ball dominant players benefit from not having him clog up the court when they are isoing. This isn't really any different from any other ball dominant player that can't shoot 3s, but it is more noticeable with Westbrook because he has played with at least 3 excellent iso ballers who clearly have benefited in that area after moving into situations with more space."
"I'll fully admit bias towards Rose but I think it's a mistake to presume that the basketball hall of fame should use the same ideas as the baseball hall of fame, ie total mass career achievement.  Basketball is a sport that features explosive super human heroics and moments of pure post-mortal ascension that I think in and of themselves warrant consideration when they are truly unique. If Tracy McGrady only ever did 13 in 33 I think that should have been enough.  Ditto Vince Carter's Olympic Superman dunk.  Derrick Rose's entire MVP season was one such ascension. In a time where people were talking about it being the greatest point guard era ever, he had weeks upon weeks of absolutely emasculating and destroying his supposed peers one after another despite being basically the only non boozer offensive presence on a team that started Keith Bogans.  In one two week period he faced and destroyed prime Chris Paul, prime deron Williams, prime Tony Parker, Russell Westbrook, Jason Kidd, and rondo, then not far removed from outplaying LeBron in a playoff series. His matchup stats were godlike. His clutch stats made Kobe look like a marginal chucker. It was a brief peak, but one of the highest ever achieved. He should be in the hall of fame."
"Well yeah, it is a big deal. But it shouldn't be that big of an excuse when you've got Russell Westbrook and Paul George."
Russell Westbrook doesn't give a damn.
No but Russell Westbrook is better than all of them

Kobe got all of the same hate as westbrook. Jordan got tons of hate for being a shit team mate. Shaq got tons of hate for ""low effort."" KG and Dirk and Paul Pierce and Allen Iverson and Tmac and many other guys got all kinds of criticism for being ""great but not a guy that can carry you over the finish line.""

"&gt; Than reigning MVP Russell Westbrook  Ballhog, brickbrook should not have won that MVP. "
I know this is one big euphoric upvote party for our fans after the slander of russell westbrook that took place this week lmao 
"Is it bad that I can really dislike my own fanbase a lot of times? I feel like a hater but I still love my team, but I also love basketball as a whole probably more so I appreciate good players and good plays. I got into an argument with a coworker yesterday before the game who said that the Jazz had the three best players in the series, if not the best FOUR. I was shocked like my man you're telling me that almost all of our starting five is better than Paul George? Than reigning MVP Russell Westbrook? Sometimes talent just wins out and kicks your ass and that's exactly what happened last night. At our highest peaks, the Thunder just have more absolute talent than us. That doesn't mean we can't and won't still win, just that our obsession with talking shit on Westbrook or PG is misguided and shows that you let emotions get in the way of rational basketball observation. whatever take note we're winning game 6 thanks for coming OKC "
"If it was at all a fair series, Russell Westbrook would have been suspended last night. Be grateful you have a star the NBA is desperately trying to protect from himself. "
"Thats like saying you could be the best player in the league because you won the MVP, but come playoffs you get bounced in the 1st round. Like Russell Westbrook. Big moments should be considered more than overall averages."
"Lakers, since they'll have Paul George, Russell Westbrook, AD, Kawhi, my grandmother and all the other stars. Plus with their young talent it'll be an excellent place to get wins."
Russell Westbrook is a mini tank. Bully is not the correct word. 
I mean theres obviously a whole bunch of confounding variables which can be attributed to each individual case. But the one constant is Westbrook. The pattern is there and it is undeniable.   Maybe its unfair to blame Russ but does anyone have *any* example of any players who've played *better* with Russell then without? 
"How do you explain KD's efficiency increasing significantly? There's an obvious pattern with players getting better after leaving OKC.   Russell Westbrooks style of play is great, if your name is Russell Westbrook. He will either score, or set you up so that he can get an assist. How is anyone meant to realize their potential in that ""system"" "
Russell Westbrook may be an odd fellow but he can steam a good ham. 
"&gt;Russell Westbrook would be wise to switch to shooting guard. Great player, but isnt able to take care of the ball and is a poor-decision making   Yeah because you want the guy who shoots worse than Lonzo Ball from 3 taking your your shots. NEPUUUUUUUU"
It's a testament to how good KD and Harden are that a guy like Russell Westbrook is arguably the worst of a former big three. Westbrook is bonkers.
"k listen up you little shit  I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns.  This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"
"Yeah, it doesn't matter if you shoot at a terrible efficiency all the time, because once every 5 games your shots will happen to go in and everyone will have to eat their words. ^/s  That being said, he clearly feeds on our hate, so let's keep showering him with praise. All hail our lord and savior, Russell Westbrook."
"Russell ""Ima shut that shit down"" Westbrook vs. Donovon ""see yall next year"" Mitchell"
I’m honestly terrified of Westbrook getting over his fear of Gobert and just driving his mind out early.  Because eventually the refs will call something. Then it’ll all come down to 3s.  Because you’re right. Russell won’t make 3s like that again.  The Gods wanted it tonight.
"Because I wasn't trying to give a comprehensive assessment of his performance in a throw-away one-liner post, lol. I was just pointing out one aspect of the game that was humorous to me.   This game? All you can muster all this emotional fervor for is a meaningless basketball game? When so much shit is going down in the world, and you can actually be making a difference if you put your mind to it? And all you can do is police Russell Westbrook comments on reddit, lol.  See what I mean? That was sarcasm."
Nah man didnt ya know? r/nba is full of kids who hate Russell Westbrook and discredit him at any opportunity.
&gt;Hopefully no one shows this video to Russ and he isn’t playing with even more motivation.  do u guys really think a professional like Russell Westbrook cant get himself up for a playoff game?

Russell Westbrook MYTHICAL
"Injured guard Andre Roberson yelled, “There you go Billy D!” Sharpshooter Alex Abrines gave a look of pleasant relief. Playoff P belted, “We got a [expletive] benched Melo now.” And before Russell Westbrook hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Carmelo Anthony hugged him &amp; said, “Ay Russ dey say I gotta come off the bench now.” "
"2nd Half:   Russell Westbrook 33 pts, 12/23 FG, 5/7 3PT  Paul George 21 pts, 8/16 FG  Outscored Jazz by 11"

"The jazz blew a 25 point for two reasons.   1. Russell Westbrook showed himself and his true abilities for the first time this series, and had one of the best individual performances I’ve ever seen in the playoffs in that second half.   2. Foul trouble for Rudy. Now, the lead began the instant Gobert picked up that 4th foul and had to be substituted. I won’t go so far as to say PG and Russ are scared of Rudy, but it **entirely** changed the way they were able to play when he was not on the court (and Favors also had 5 fouls).   If that 4th foul call on Rudy was legit, I’d be less salty. I’m still upset Rudy had a stupid, unnecessary 5th foul. But that was an absolutely horrendous, game changing foul call. As horrendous as a few on Favors were. The referees did impact the game tremendously with incorrect decisions, and in concordance with my first point, led to one of the best comeback victories I’ve ever seen in the playoffs. "

"Oklahoma City Thunder general manager Russell Westbrook proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Russell Westbrook and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Benched forward Carmelo Anthony yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Russell Westbrook gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Russell Westbrook yelled out, “We got an fucking squad now.” And before Westbrook hit the locker room door, former NBA great Russell Westbrook hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Tonight, we saw both the brilliance and shortcomings of Russell Westbrook. He bricked a bunch of shots early that helped put OKC in a huge deficit, but also showed how he can take over a game when he's on fire. Scoring 45 points on 39 shots pretty much sums Westbrook up as a player. He's simultaneously a fantastic scorer, inefficient, flawed and capable of taking over like few players can. The sort of volatile player that causes this sub to overreact immensely when he's doing either good or bad."
"That's because all Westbrook does is empty calorie shite and uncontested rebounds, put Andre Ingram in for Russell and OKC wins by 50 smh"
Not today....   Compliments of Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook is the greatest player to ever play basketball in all of human history. Don't even think about @'ing me.
Nobody beats Russell Westbrook 4 times in a row!
"*Twas the night of game five, and the first half was rough*  *Westbrook was bricking, and PG was packing his stuff*  *But then Thunder stuck, and everything changed*  *Melo was sitting, and Westbrook was deranged*  *With the season on the line, he played his best*  *Felton's fat ass watched on, and beat his chest*  *As the series goes back to Utah, he has only one thing to say*  *My name is Russell Westbrook, fuck you r/NBA*"
Owning Russell Westbrook in Fantasy is just as exciting as roulette. You'll never know if youre getting Worstbrook or Bestbrook.
Russell Westbrook just dad dicked /r/nba
I fukn love Russell Westbrook.  His mentality never changes.
After the game Russell Westbrook had just two words after his performance:   “Fuck /r/nba”  
I just saw Russell Westbrook absolutely Destroy the Jazz tonight. That’s the Russ everyone wants to see.
"fuck EVERY single one of you that slanders Russell Westbrook. Sure, comment about his stat padding or inefficiency all you want, but that man leaves absolutely everything on the floor. His pride is immeasurable and he won’t go down without a fight. Even if we lose this series, I am DAMN proud of him, Paul and the rest of the squad. "
Russell Westbrook
WP Utah Jazz.  Russell Westbrook and Paul George just played out of their minds to save the series.
Russell Westbrook will never be an NBA champ
"Huge disagreement. His offensive rating is one of the worst all time for Hall of Fame point guards. He was the Russell Westbrook of his time. Guys like Curry and Nash not only had the necessary ability to score when others couldn't, but led very efficient offenses"
He's always had a post up game. It's a mixture of Gobert being a bad matchup and Russell Westbrook playing 800 mph.
"His headliner after game 1 (in which PG scored 34) was ""Does Russell Westbrook make his teammates worse?"" "
" &gt;The fact that you're also comparing one of the greatest facilitating point guards of not only this generation, but all time to Russell westbrook is laughable.  actual impact is irrelevant, fact is they are suspected of being said ballhogs because of their supposed ballhogging. Downvoted for bad logic"
"i thought i was quite obviously joking. i do think he's overrated but i spend .000025936290% of my time thinking about russell fuckin' westbrook. that said, when i do think of him, i think how much it must suck to be a teammate of this hoggish mountebank"
"Kobe averaged 19.5 FGA with a 31.8 USG% while Russ averaged 18.4 FGA with a 32.7 USG%.   The fact that you're also comparing one of the greatest facilitating point guards of not only this generation, but all time to Russell westbrook is laughable.  "
"Pretty poor reasoning. I'm not implying Kobe was a ""ballhog chucker"" but Russell Westbrook led the league In assists and you'd be hard pressed to find someone who didn't think he was a ""ballhog chucker"" .  "
"&gt;End of the day the ultimate barometer for these things, fair or not, is team success. And right now, the prevailing narrative is that Westbrook lead teams don't go deep into the playoffs.  It's not just that.  I honestly think WB would be fine if that were the case.  Right *now*, the case is that Westbrook ACTIVELY deteriorates teams chances of advancing.  Now, I know every single kid on /r/nba in all of it's reactionary glory is going to downvote me for this comment because Russ scored a lot in games 5 and 6.  I'm not talking to them, or about them.  Because despite those performances every single scout and analyst in the league watched Russell Westbrook completely vanish in Games 3 and 4, to the point where he was at times one of the worst players on the court.  He couldn't hit a shot and was a sieve defensively.  Reddit seems incapable of remembering anything past the last 48 hours -- but I GUARANTEE you in games 3 and 4 there were a ton of knowing looks being exchanged in NBA offices, press boxes, etc.  Westbrook was putrid the series.  Sure he scored a lot in games 5 and 6 -- like always, when Westbrook senses his team is in trouble he starts hoisting at an unbelievable rate.  82 shots in 2 games.  Furthermore, Westbrook took two of the worst shots in NBA HISTORY in Game 6, almost consecutively.  Both 30 foot airballs that had no chance of going in, with time left on the clock, from a career 30% 3 point shooter.  Of course it gets lost here where people have no fucking clue how to analyze basketball, but every single manager and GM in the league watched Westbrook chuck up those heaves.  They know.  They know what that says about his leadership.  They know what that says about every other player on the team.  ""I trust myself to hit this shot, which has roughly a 12% chance of going in, more than I trust you guys in a close game.""  That's not a leader.  That's not how a teammate who elevates the level of play of his franchise plays.  I don't care HOW poorly your teammates are playing, if you 1v5 every single 4th quarter (4 buckets on *18* shots last year in Q4 anyone?), you're going to lose.  KD and Steph laughed at Russ on the bench because they know precisely what he's doing.  And every single coach and analyst in the league knows that also."
Shoutout to Russell Westbrook and the Orlando Magic for obscuring how good Oladipo could be.  I knew that dude was gonna be good.  
"I really enjoyed how thematically differently the two teams functioned.  The Jazz look like a family playing together.  They all seem selfless and they are willing to do their part to help the team.  On the other hand, OKC is a collection of individual studs.  Aside from Adams, the star scorers all want to win the game by themselves.  I think Russell Westbrook is one of the best basketball players in the league but also one of the worst teammates to have on a potential championship level team."
That's called Tuesday for Russell Westbrook
Marcus Smart is like literally the opposite of Russell Westbrook
Has anyone ever said Russell Westbrook is bad for the NBA?
So Lebron's game plan for game 2 is to turn into Russell Westbrook?
"Thompson was a solid pick at 4.    The last 10 years of #4 picks:  Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, Porzingis, Aaron Gordon, Cody Zeller, Dion Waiters, Tristan Thompson, Wes Johnson, Tyreke Evans, Russell Westbrook  TT was the second big man picked, after Kanter and ahead of Valanciunas, Vesely, and Biyombo.  In that context, he was a solid pick."
"Echoing what the TNT crew said, it’s hard to get into rhythm when someone brings the ball up the court and passes it up when there’s only five seconds left on the shot clock. Harden has to let those guys get into rhythm first. Hero ball is fine and necessary at times, but if you aren’t smart about it, it’s usually detrimental to them team (e.g., Russell Westbrook). It was on display last night with the multiple shot clock expiration infractions."
Number of assists don't necessarily correlate with playmaking abilities. Case in point: Russell Westbrook.
"This kind of rhetoric really bums me out. These stats are in a vacuum. Yeah, Jordan shot 50 percent beyond the arc in a series in 1991. Do you know how many 3 point shots he took in that series? **FOUR.** He took four three pointers in five games and made two. Give me a break.  If you want some stats that paint a more accurate picture, MJ averaged 1.1 three point attempts per game in 1991 and averaged a paltry .312 percent. Russell Westbrook has essentially an identical career 3 point percentage (.311) to what Jordan shot the year you cited.  Over his career, MJ averaged 1.7 three point attempts per game. Lebron has averaged 4.1 over his career and 5.0 this season. The game has changed and I personally feel that MJ would have become a solid three point shooter in todays game. But in witnessing dominant mid range shooters like DeRozan, Westbrook, Simmons, etc. fail to develop a sufficient three point shot, I can certainly accept the argument that he may not have.  MJ's career assist average was 5.3 to Lebron's 7.2. He averaged **25 shots** a game. Lebron is averaging under 20 a game. Was he dominant? Yes. Did he force shots? Oh hell yes.  And if we want to talk about a less than adequate supporting cast as a reason to hold the ball and jack up contested low percentage shots, then look no further than the current Cleveland Cavaliers squad. But that doesn't seem to stop Lebron from averaging **8.6 assists per game** in 2018. Jordan, playing with a cast (and coach) of future hall of famers from 1991-1998, never averaged more than 6.1 assists per game.  MJ was a great basketball player and should rightfully be in every GOAT conversation. But to suggest his game was perfect and to not acknowledge his weaknesses is some [Luvabulls shit](https://www.nba.com/bulls/entertainment/luvabulls/1516)."

I think in a few years the John Wall and Russell Westbrook contracts are going to look awful.
Kobe isn’t a top ten player of all time and Russell Westbrook deserves half the blame for KD leaving since he’s a ball hogging piece of shit
*Russell Westbrook liked this reddit comment*
The worst possible thing KD could have done for his career is stay with Russell Westbrook. 
"I'm sorry, was MVP Russell Westbrook and OKC cast of players not good enough for Durant? They were up 3-1!! *sigh*.."
"The one thing I keep thinking about when watching this game was KD and Harden just kept trading haymaker for haymaker. My dream is for one day Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden to play on the same team again. Man f*ck the Thunder this could have been their dynasty and they botched it so badly."
"In the 2018-19 season, assuming everyone is healthy and the teams stay as is, I think there are only threats to the Warriors on-route to a 4th championship in 5 years. In order:  - Boston Celtics - Deep roster, with great versatility and a great coach. Celtics are the only team since 2014-15 season to not have a losing record against the Warriors (have actually beaten them in Oracle arena twice iirc). If they play GSW in the finals, Warriors win in 6.  - Cleveland Cavaliers - Aging roster, but still has a lot of weapons. Oh and, LeBron James is still the best player in the league. If they play GSW in the finals, Warriors win in 5.  - Houston Rockets - One of the best teams in the league, but they play a shit ton of iso ball with Harden and CP3. As great as Harden/CP3 are, they match up poorly against GSW. Harden/CP3 just cannot guard Steph/Klay and be expected to also run 90% of the offense. Oh and .... no answer for Durant. If they play GSW in the playoffs, Warriors win in 5.  No one else is even close to contending with the Warriors, unless some major trades/FA moves are made. This Warriors team is the best team in NBA history. A 73 win team (with 3 All-NBA players) adding a Top 3 player in FA is outrageous.  P.S - If LeBron / Kawhi / PG13 (2 out of 3) go to Philly, I can see them being competitive. If all 3 of them team up in LA? Gonna make it real interesting.   P.S.S (or P.P.S?) - LUL Thunder. Sorry, but hell no. Russell Westbrook is a hell of player, and plays extremely exciting basketball. But not winning basketball. Let alone the waste of a roster spot and 28 mill that Carmelo Anthony is ... The Big3 of Russ, PG (if he stays) and Steven Adams will get this team to the postseason, but they'll fail everytime. Russ cannot win consistently the way he plays. He needs a coach that has the balls to tell him to cut out his stupid plays (pull up 3's for no reason, iso ball for 20 seconds only to get a terrible shot off, play defense, etc...) "
"Let's pretend that KD stayed.  Here is OKC's lineup:  Russell Westbrook  KD  Steven Adams  Al Hortford  Andre Roberson  Off the bench:  Oladipo, Sabonis, McDermmott  KD took the harder road by joining GSW.  "
Russell Westbrook.
Might have to nerf that team by throwing in Russell Westbrook
Kevin Durant took the easy way out and decided to join a 73 Warriors team after he blew a 3-1 series lead with Russell Westbrook.

"That curse was named Russell Westbrook, he's moved on :P"
Russell Westbrook is so fuckin bad my dudes

"It's not an accident; Russell Westbrook is the player the team has been built around, and he's the face of the franchise. What is anybody supposed to think about OKC, looking in from the outside.  Personal opinion on Russell Westbrook:  * He's insanely athletic and usually makes good use of it.  * As a corollary, he's one of the best at driving to the rim.  * He's a great passer.  * He has horrible habits (entry passing and walking around in the backcourt, chucking, stat-hunting, taking contested shots from range instead of driving)  I totally understand why fans love him; he's driven and enthusiastic; the team rallies around him, he's been loyal when KD/Harden have been ""disloyal"", and he's an unusually talented player even for the NBA. But his style of basketball is extremely demanding, not always wise, and doesn't let other players play their game successfully. You're either playing the system designed around Russ and excelling (like Steven Adams and Andre Roberson) or you're at odds because the way he plays is inflexible."
"Jordan was seen as a ""russell westbrook"" during the late 80's the man can put up stats, especially points, but he's an awful teammate that can't win in the postseason."

"&gt; If a defender doesn’t have quick enough hands to strip the ball, or if he isn’t big or athletic enough to challenge the offensive player at the rim, he’s shit out of luck. We don’t give an out to slower and smaller players in any other context on a basketball court. When Russell Westbrook blows by Kirk Hinrich, Hinrich doesn’t get to grab his jersey just because Westbrook is faster. And Isaiah Thomas doesn’t get to climb on DeAndre Jordan’s back for a rebound because “it’s not fair” how much bigger Jordan is. So why do we put up with charges?"
"Highlights from the article:  &gt; I don’t want offensive fouls to be eliminated from the game. There obviously have to be measures in place that prevent offensive players from just lowering their shoulders and plowing through defenders on their way to the rim. I don’t want post defenders to be helpless against someone like Shaq backing them down with reckless abandon, nor do I believe LeBron should be allowed to steamroll Steph Curry on the perimeter. My gripe is with the plays in which help-side defenders run to a spot on the floor, plant their feet, and grab their nuts because they know they can’t make a legitimate play on the ball.   &gt; **This wouldn’t mean the end of help defense, by the way. If charges were banned, defenders could still get into the same position they already do, only now they’d have to actually play defense instead of strategically falling over. Defenders could do what Roy Hibbert does all the time, which is maintain a vertical plane, challenge guys at the rim, and even draw offensive fouls if the player trying to score is out of control.**  &gt; But, you might be saying, Hibbert can only make that play because he’s enormous. How are guards coming from the help side supposed to stop slashing small forwards from dunking on them?  &gt;They aren’t! That’s the point! **If a defender doesn’t have quick enough hands to strip the ball, or if he isn’t big or athletic enough to challenge the offensive player at the rim, he’s shit out of luck.

Russell Westbrook. 
and giannis and Westbrook   giannis went from 6'9 to 6'11 and Russell Westbrook is a good 6'5
I believe this is a complete list for all seasons:  * Larry Bird * Wilt Chamberlain * Billy Cunningham * Walt Frazier * Tom Gola * Draymond Green * James Harden * Grant Hill * LeBron James * Magic Johnson * Nikola Jokic * Michael Jordan * Jason Kidd * Fat Lever * Oscar Robertson * Maurice Stokes * Russell Westbrook 
"&gt;Some part of Durant knew he'd already punched his ticket. ""It felt like that whole thing was set up for me to leave,"" he says, ""especially after they blew a lead in the finals, because I damn sure wasn't going there if they'd won. But after Game Seven, I called up my agent and said, 'Damn, dude, Golden State – what if?'    https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/1/4/14169748/kevin-durant-could-be-in-boston-free-agency-warriors-celtics-thunder-russell-westbrook-al-horford  "
"Ideally we'd be able to keep one of Abrines or Ferguson and have them off the bench instead of Brewer but obviously if Cavs demand both for LeBron you don't say no  We'd also have the MLE to get a solid backup SF instead of Huestis, someone like Glenn Robinson III probably  So in a perfect world it would be something like:  **PG:** Russell Westbrook  **SG:** Andre Roberson  **SF:** Paul George  **PF:** LeBron James  **C:** Steven Adams  **Bench:** Felton/Abrines/Robinson/Patterson/Grant"
Russell Westbrook has averaged double-digit assists the past three seasons.  Led the league this year. 
"In the Quadrilogy Era (2014-2015 through 2017-2018), here are their stats:  I've included all 25+ PPG scorers during that time period.  Regular Season:  * Stephen Curry - 26.4 PPG on 65.0 TS% * Kevin Durant - 26.5 PPG on 64.0 TS% * Lebron James - 26.1 PPG on 60.2 TS% * James Harden - 28.9 PPG on 60.9 TS% * Anthony Davis - 26.3 PPG on 58.6 TS% * DeMarcus Cousins - 25.9 PPG on 55.5 TS% * Russell Westbrook - 27.7 PPG on 54.2 TS%  Playoffs:  * Stephen Curry - 26.8 PPG on 61.8 TS% * Kevin Durant - 28.6 PPG on 59.5 TS% * Lebron James - 30.9 PPG on 58.0 TS% * James Harden - 27.9 PPG on 57.9 TS% * Anthony Davis - 30.5 PPG on 59.3 TS% * DeMarcus Cousins - Undefined * Russell Westbrook - 28.7 PPG on 50.7 TS%  All things considered, Curry is probably the best scorer. His volume is right there, and he is the efficiency leader of the pack for both regular season and playoffs.  With that said, for this playoff run specifically, Lebron has currently been a better scorer than Curry and Durant."
"Because people wear cool band shirts of bands they have never heard all the time. They wear them because they have cool designs and look cool and the actual music is irrelevant since they are picking the shirt out because they like the look of it, not because they are fans or want to promote the band’s music or whatever.   Yes, there is a chance I am totally wrong and Russ is a huge slayer fan. There is also a chance you guys are wrong and he has never listened to Slayer, and picked that shirt off the rack for an emo-themed outfit that he wore once before discarding and you guys are just disagreeing because you got upset that I “assumed” his music taste.  But if you were forced to bet your mother’s life on one of these two options:  A) Russell Westbrook likes/knows of Slayer B) Russell Westbrook has never listened to Slayer  ...you know damn well which one you’d choose lmao"
Was having a debate about who's the GOAT and how it's impossible to say because there's so many different factors in each era when some dude told me Michael Jordan is the same skill level of Russell westbrook but since he played in the 90s he had an easier time . Am I insane or is that so wrong?
I would Say:  1- Lebron  2- Steph Curry  3- Kyrie Irving  4- Russell Westbrook  5- James Harden  
"It already happened with Russell Westbrook in 2017, last year. They gave him the MVP by stat padding, while his team finished as the 6th seed. It was not a complete shit team, like the teams that didn't even make the playoffs, but nobody expected them to win their first round series, which proved to be right.  But the level Lebron is playing, it should be celebrated. He is doing the one-man show at a level that has not been seen before by any other one-man shows, like Allen Iverson. Iverson had a great game in game 1 of the 2001 Finals, but couldn't do much else in the rest of the games. But Lebron will surpass that, and will actually complicate the rest of the games for the Warriors."
Russell Westbrook isn’t as cancerous as people like to suggest
Why wasn't Russell Westbrook suspended?
"Never did I say the OKC big 3 was as good as the heats in every sense statistically, I'm just saying that they were absolutely legitimate contenders with two top-10 players in the league, and a solid big man. I'd love Adams on the cavs. Durant, Westbrook and Adams would be considered a solid big 3 on any team, even though Adams isn't an all star. He's still young, and is a great rim protecter that is overlooked. He is currently 24, Bosh in Miami was in his prime, so yeah, he'd have better stats. Bosh was better than Adams, most notably on the scoring end because he attempted twice as many field goals and was more of a 4 style of play than a 5. But he was better. KD and Russ were also both in their prime when they lost to the warriors in 2016.   You're comparing Russell Westbrook to D-Wade for what reason? Russ was on KDs initial team, d Wade was on the team Lebron went to. May as well compare Steph and D Wade. Never once did I compare the two. That was my argument, lebron had no one near Russ' level on his team before his departure. That's why I brought him up. He had all the reasons to leave. I realize when the thunder had harden, Russ and KD that they were all developing, but Lebron was also still developing in his Cleveland years, and he still carried a team with no all-stars to the finals. No one he played with in his first stint here went on to be anything special at all. Mo Williams was an all star reserve for one year in 2009 with LBJ, and never was again. Harden and Westbrook both went on to be MVPs. "
"Iverson never sniffed an MVP outside of the season he won (that probably should have been Duncan's), and there's legitimate questions as to how much he really contributed to winning basketball. Reggie vs Iversion kind of like comparing Russell Westbrook vs John Stockton. Westbrook's numbers look much better and he was much better his MVP season was better than Stockton ever was, but over their careers Stockton is clearly the better player."
"This is very true, but Westbrook is far too hated for people to see it. Durant has always been overrated if you considered him close to LeBron. LeBron respects KD as a talent, but in his heart of hearts, he knows that he's going to be mentioned alongside Jordan/Russell/Wilt, while KD will go down with the Hakeem/Moses/Malone/Dirks at best.  Westbrook was debatably OKC's best player in 2016. Westbrook is as close to Durant as Steph is - meaning that on some nights they look better because Durant cannot impact a game consistently on a superstar level if his shot is off and even sometimes when his shot is on, you don't even know how many points he has. People will believe what they want, but since 2015, there has always been a cluster of Durant/Westbrook/Steph behind LeBron for 2nd best. Unfortunately, Westbrook doesn't get his due mention and Durant is considered to be better than he actually is by a lot of people."
How much more does Kyrie want to be involved?  Stop it.  2016/2017 Usage Percent 1.	Russell Westbrook • OKC	41.7 2.	DeMarcus Cousins • TOT	36.5 3.	DeMar DeRozan • TOR	34.3 4.

"""If anyone signs up for wearing dresses, it'll be Russell Westbrook.""  Lol."
"No I'm saying the best player needs to be the one attacking and playing aggressive at the end of the game.   &gt; I will never understand this logic, there is a reason Russell Westbrook and James Harden are not on this stage right now. lol Allen Iverson would have definitely took the shot, but Allen Iverson also has no rings.  I will never understand your logic. There is a reason Jordan is 6-0 and Kobe is 5-2 whereas LeBron is soon to be 3-6"
"So LeBron made a mistake by passing it to an open teammate rather then going for a contested shot? I will never understand this logic, there is a reason Russell Westbrook and James Harden are not on this stage right now. lol Allen Iverson would have definitely took the shot, but Allen Iverson also has no rings. "
Russell Westbrook
"Stats it goes to Wilt....Winning it goes to Russell...both it goes to Jordan.  Even Kobe has 5 titles.  He wouldn't be a top ten player if he didn't.  When you're talking about legacy Winning matters, a lot.  If legacy was just about stats Westbrook would be a top 10 player of all time.  I get this carrying your team stuff, but unless it turns into wins who cares.    Lebron wants to be the leader in every way possible to his team.  In the East that's fine, but in the finals it's not.  Jordan wasn't out there trying lead his team in every statistical category.  He had two main jobs, score and defend at those two jobs he dominated.  If he would've tried to lead in assists and rebounds too, he wouldn't have won 6 titles.    If LeBron had Phil Jackson and listened to him he'd be in the argument with Jordan.  Give LeBron, Brad Stevens right now, and let Stevens coach....The Warriors wouldn't win another title.  Ty Lue is a joke."

"To be fair its hard for lower salary players to call out higher salary players; there's a power dynamic. Imagine you a bench player trying to call out Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Joel Embiid, or John Wall. They probably have the influence to get you removed from the team. At the end of the day most players just decide that it's probably best to just let it go and play ball; it's a dream job anyways, best to not risk it.   And this is why the Warriors culture is special, it started with Draymond and Steph, they don't care about that power dynamic shit, it's all about making the right play. Then it's contagious, and spreads to the rest of the team."
Watching a total of like 42 Russell Westbrook-less minutes over 5 games against Houston in 2017 I don't think anyone wants to see that. 
....[Russell Westbrook](https://youtu.be/NIvvybP1oV0).  edit:  Zaza is the worst.
imagine if russell westbrook sent out the mooch to talk for him
"I think the way this isn't so crazy is because how Russell Westbrook affects your team.  If you had to pick any player to drag some scrubs to the playoffs, WB is great.  If you had to pick a player to work with 2 other all stars, WB isn't so great."
"There is no path to a Russell Westbrook championship. I don't even mean with the Thunder as currently constructed, I just mean overall as a concept. He's not smart enough as a #1 option, and he's not passive/agreeable enough to play with as a #2 or #3 option.  Even though he's ""better"" than a lot of players in this league, I would honestly rather have a ""worse"" player like Khris Middleton or Gary Harris on my team. Those guys are at least building blocks that you can put better stars around, but Westbrook's me-against-the-world play style just will never get it done in today's league."
Russell Westbrook is not a top 30 nba player 
Probably Russell Westbrook since he relies a lot on his insane athletism and his Shooting is the worst out of everyone on the list except Draymond Green (Who can impact the game defensively way better than WB). 
The Russell Westbrook special huh
Hey! It was only 34.6 ppg in 2017. Stop trying to Russell Westbrook LeBron’s numbers.

"Lol thunder drafted KD, Russell Westbrook and James harden in 3 consecutive drafts and they didn’t win shit"
"Y'all had Russell Westbrook, Paul George, and Carmelo Anthony in 2018"
Most important doesnt mean most impressive. Ask Russell Westbrook if he'd rather have his MVP or a FMVP and you'll have your answer
"And if you want to be down with OKC, then fuck you too  Russell Westbrook, fuck you too"
"Oh man, I saw an OKC game last year in Houston when Westbrook dropped 50. It was hilarious whenever he scored. ""russell.....westbrook"""
"Anthony Russell Russell James James James Jrue Chris Kevin Donovan Davis Westbrook Westbrook Harden Harden Harden Holiday Paul Durant Mitchell, of course."
"To say Harden completely choked this whole playoffs in general is crazy. Also I know journalists, personalities, and analysts are supposed to bait. But I was watching The Herd today and they put Harden’s beard on Russell Westbrook. It looked pretty funny but the message was that they both don’t show up for playoffs. It was terrible.  "
"To me, Zo is the best player in the world. ... I don't know if he can beat [LeBron James and Russell Westbrook] one-on-one, but I know he can beat them five-on-five."

Russell Westbrook was top 4 last season
I don't remember Lebron being up 3-1 in the Western Conference Finals against the Heat the year before he joined. I also don't remember teammates of his specifically having a problem with him continuing to feed into his recruitment throughout the season and likely into the playoffs. (http://nba.nbcsports.com/2016/07/07/report-russell-westbrook-other-thunder-players-bother-by-kevin-durants-relationship-with-draymond-green-during-season/). Nor do I remember the Heat winning 73 games that season. 
Ties in with mine that LeBron is a more physically gifted and talented version of Russell Westbrook.
"The supermax contract is a tool that shackles teams to mediocrity for years unless it's doled out to a top 5 player. The contracts given out to John Wall and Russell Westbrook that will pay them $40 million a year in their mid 30s will be seen as disastrous within a year or two. That's one reason that the Bulls traded Butler and the Kings traded Boogie, because giving those guys supermax contracts would've severely injured the franchise for years to come. "

"Russell  Westbrook...He's had people talking about ""uncontested rebounds"" to discredit a triple double. "
"You're a moron. Typical Warrior-hating millennial...yeah, KD should have with that selfish -A-hole, Russell ""Black-hole"" Westbrook"" or maybe if he chose Boston where he would have earned more money. And have you pulled your head out of your ass long enough to notice how much better of a defender he has become since joining the Warriors? Or how involved he's become in bay-area tech companies. Get over it, dumbass!!!"
FYI it's FG attempted not missed.   Also some of the data seems wrong. Russell Westbrook has 335 made layups this year. 
Watch game one of the finals as Breen is introducing the matchup. Are you seriously gonna claim that you’ve never heard “today’s matchup is LeBron James and the Cavaliers against Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder?”  https://www.cleveland.com/livingston/index.ssf/2018/05/lebron_james_and_the_cleveland_1.html  Here’s an article from not too long ago that uses this.
"I'm only hurt because the Cavs have a harder road to a title.  He's the one who made burner accounts to argue with kids on Twitter and would rather have everyone act like his decision didn't happen. He's clearly insecure with his decision.   And yea, it's pretty weak for him to say he couldn't ""win with those cats"" when one of them is Russell Westbrook. I'm not saying he shouldn't have gone to golden state, of course it was the right move, but it's sad that he is so clearly uncomfortable with it. "
"Reason why i H.A.T.E the warriors: as a huge lbj fan, when they lost the 2015 nba finals against the warriors without irving and love, all i can remember is a drunk and possibly high, draymond green singing about how the Cavs sucked. 2016... been a thunder fan since 2011.... fucking 3-1 up. the thunder, durant and Westbrook were 1 game away from their second finals.... guess who choked? We all know what happened, durant pooped his pants and shot worse percentages that the so called (rightfully) inefficient, crazy, immature, low IQ, Russell Westbrook. Seeing how curry celebrated, I was like don't matter well be back next year.... 2016 finals... warriors 3-1 up, pissed as hell what I see it's a China klay being China klay, telling the reporters LeBron got his feelings hurt and that this is a man's game.... ok klay... what we all witnessed was the best comeback of sports history and LeBron fullfills his promise to bring a chip home... remember who got his feelings hurt going to the locker room as soon as the buzzer went off game 7 Oracle arena ????? KLAY THOMPSON, this is a man's game... huh. Having all.of that one of my favorite players, a guy who I've been following, cried for (no homo), been angry at, been supporting for so many years... DECIDES TO TAKE THE HARDEST ROAD AND GOES TO THE TEAM WHO BEAT HIM, WHO MADE HIM THEIR BITCH. I guess durant ""can't win with those cats"" ?  That's why you needed to team up with the best shooter of all time, the second best shooter of all time, and a DPOY right? Ruining what made the NBA fun. Ruining the sense of pride and accomplishment a championship brings to a city. Thank you Kevin Durant, I am witness of your ""greatness"". We all are, I will make sure your "" legacy"" it's not more than a lie and the story of a coward and a traitor, thank you for betraying the great OKC fanbase and thank you for ruining the opportunity of LeBron James to shut the ""6-0"" haters, like he said, he doesn't care about a win lose percentage he does leave everything in the floor, something durant will never do. Fuck that team and everyone who follow that mentality and justifies it. rant ended. "
"Because Russell Westbrook is the most selfish, inflexible star in the league and it is impossible to win with him? "

"I'd like to take a moment, on this day, to thank Kevin ""The Servant"" Durant for leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder on July 4th, 2016. Not for going to the Flubs, but for leaving. The Bitch is all numbers, especially his favorite number, 2nd, and him leaving gave Russell Westbrook an opportunity to pursue history. Remember all of our 4th quarter meltdowns last year? It's because Russ would always defer to Skin n Bones. Look at Russ's clutchtime stats this year, it's remarkable. Little Nipples makes history by taking the hardest road, Russell ""King of the Prarie"" Westbrook makes history by breaking a 55 year old record that may never be broken again. Kevin is cursed, it's why he got injured, and now Steph is injured, he'll come up second again this year. And to top it all off Trump takes away our Szechuan sauce, damn. So thank you Mr. Durant, for being the real MVP, the real Ms. Durant, for getting your unclutch ass outta town.

"I know what you mean.  Remember when Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden were all on the Thunder together?  It's insane that it's allowed."
Never tell me that Harden is better at basketball than Russell Westbrook 
I'll hit this quickly: any metric that ranks Russell Westbrook above Kobe in their careers is not one that I'll agree with
Name a more iconic duo then Cam Payne and Russell Westbrook 
"He's going to the Lakers alongside Lebron. They will trade Luol Deng, Lonzo Ball, some small filler contracts and a 1st round pick to the Oklahome City Thunder in the summer of 2019 for Russell Westbrook.  "
"Eric ""Russell Westbrook"" Gordon"
I see Russell Westbrook has put on stilts and is playing as an imposter Durant.
"No. We can't just insert link and justify our points. When Kyrie sat Lebron did fine. When Lebron sat Kyrie did not. The reason being is he couldn't make the same reads LeBron did. Execution of Ty Lue's iso+pace offensive scheme requires a lot QB on the playmaker's part. It isn't always just a pass (i.e Russell Westbrook) but the pass to the pass, and understanding defensive schemes. It's not just a LeBron-ready playbook, but one which can work for guys like Rondo, CP3 and the like who just knows what the defense is doing, great at communicating and truly are coaches on the floor. "
"No sane person can put Wilt Chamberlain as a top player. He couldn't lead his team to as many championships as other great players. He is the ultimate stat padder. Like a center version of Russell Westbrook.  By this measurement Russell Westbrook will be included in a list of top 10 players in 20 years, ""because he averaged triple doubles consecutively!"""
"I'm pretty he meant Bill Russell, no one is putting Westbrook top 7 all time, lol."
"Hope thats bill russell in your list. If thats westbrook, im obliged to call you out"
"yea but at the same time PG was playing next to Russell Westbrook and Melo, so his counting stats went down"
What? Lonzo and Ingram is incredible cast supporting two stars? You need to chill. We have Russell Westbrook and Steven Adams. 
"To me, Zo is the best player in the world. ... I don't know if he can beat [LeBron James and Russell Westbrook] one-on-one, but I know he can beat them five-on-five."
"Not even close to the same level of disparity. OKC were an amazing, projected 58 win team with James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Kevin fucking Durant. The Spurs were the Spurs with Tim Duncan still being All NBA first team and All defensive team. "
"I read your pg one and it’s clear You’ve published a rough draft.   I’m all about shitpostint, but if you went to be taken seriously as a writer, you can’t be saying random shit. The burden of proof lies on you for any allegations or claims you charge  &gt; Russell Westbrook is clearly not a player PG enjoys playing with.   You say this incredibly targeted statement, but then move onto melo. Why does he not enjoy playing with him? Has he said it before? Do you have a video compilation of him ignoring Westbrook?  Regarding other parts of the essay, you’re just putting in random names and hopes. Demarcus will more than likely not heal properly, and no, pg-boogie-Zo isn’t a good combo.  Boogie needs the ball to be effective, but he doesn’t play into the system that Luke has the lakers run. Fast paced high offense/high efficiency shots. Two way players, switching constantly with multiple forwards; positionless  Be more specific about your point, your article is a ton of baseless speculation "
"I think he's going to be a fantastic player. I see shades of Russell Westbrook in him. Fierce, big time competitor who isn't afraid to take the big shots"
"Hasn’t stopped James Harden or Steph Curry from winning MVPs, heck or even Russell Westbrook. "
“No team with Russell Westbrook could ever win a championship”
Wow Russell Westbrook is really gonna hate Utah even more then
Walmart Russell Westbrook and I mean that in the most respectful way. Obviously not a top 5 player but their games and attitudes are similar. Love this dude

Trae Young might be worse than Russell Westbrook

"If I didn't follow basketball, I'd picture Russell Westbrook III as an accountant."
"I think if he had to go against a more physical guard like John Wall, Russell Westbrook, or Mike Conley, he'll get torn to shreds."
"You really can’t blame Durant for going to the Warriors. The Thunder got him no help outside Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Steven Adams. And Serge Ibaka, Andre Roberson, Dion Waiters, and Nick Collison. It’s a miracle that he was able to nearly win 60 games with those teams. "
"Harden, James and Westbrook, Russell. "
For the same reason people don't say Russell Westbrook (10 APG) is a better passer than Ricky Rubio  (5 APG)

"And before you try to argue I'll spare you the trouble.  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. James Harden  5. Kawhi Leonard (yes even coming off injury)  6. Russell Westbrook  7. Anthony Davis  8. Giannis Antentokounmpo   9. Chris Paul  10. KAT, Paul George, Jimmy Butler   "
I'm not a Warriors fan and I just don't think it's true. I think that even from a basketball standpoint that he also loved the way that they played. Russell Westbrook to Steph Curry is night and day when it comes to ball hogging and selfishness. 
"Russell Westbrook, drafted. James Harden, drafted. Serge Ibaka, drafted. Andre Roberson, drafted.    Kevin Durant, drafted, first max contract retroactively increased without salary cap room.    Kevin Durant, signed 2016, highest salary cap increase ever.  "
"Russell Westbrook: 4 turnovers in the last 2 minutes in Game 6 with terrible defense.   Both of them choked that lead away, partially because their system is based on hero ball."
"Man cmon this is so reductive. Obviously he does not have the personality of a russell westbrook, that is given. But if he was on a large market team it would DEFINITELY help himself earn endorsements, bigger shoe deal, etc. The marketability of a player is not a single factor issue. Holy fuck what is with posts taking the most narrow-minded, simplistic point of view on in a issue; I genuinely can't tell if people are being intentionally obtuse or don't bother thinking for more than 5 seconds before posting some dumb strawman argument."

"Yeah at least drafting wise he doesn't really have many busts at all.  He got there in 2007 and has drafted in the lottery 5 times: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Steven Adams, and Cameron Payne.  That's 3 MVPs, 1 quality starter and 1 bust.  I'd take that ratio all day."
"Lol, they are just angry about their dream trio of PG, LeBron, and Kawhi potentially falling kaput. This off-season tease could be far worse than the LeBron rumors of 2010/2014, RW following KD rumors of 2016. Imagine what happens if PG stays put...  I don't know if the media creates the narratives to try to guide players to certain places or if they are generally looking at those places to start or just for hot takes - people like Stephen A. make me think the former - https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/10/2/9440925/kevin-durant-los-angeles-lakers-free-agency-2016-stephen-a-smith - https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/01/31/big-possibility-russell-westbrook-follows-kevin-durant-to-lakers-says-stephen-a-smith/?utm_term=.690524dd8ac1  I think Clippers end up with Kawhi for 12, 13, + if he agrees to extension. "
"'big market' is overrated in this day n age with social media. Very overrated. There was a list recently dropped with player endorsements. CJ Mccolum in oregon has more than Kristaps Porzingas in NY.   Also Russell Westbrook is a star out of oklahoma. Could he make even more and be a bigger star in NY? Maybe. But he's already a star; simply going to a big market is not gonna MAKE you a star.   Which goes back to my question of 'who?'. Not rhetorical, but literally who: already a star, doesnt care much about winning (bc you're coming to BK), and is willing to leave 60 mill on the table. Oh and is even available as a free agent! Oh ans he's good enough for us to even care...  Im looking at every team roster.....  Kemba, He's probably getting traded, but ok thats 1. He's from NY.   Deandre Jordan? Not a needle mover  Giannis? Doesnt strike me as the type, and thats the ultimate pipe dream  Who else? All the young stars on rookie deals will be matched, all the existing stars are either locked up or they value winning."
"&gt;He ran a sprint three-quarters the length of the floor in 3.04 seconds, beating times posted by Russell Westbrook and John Wall at previous combines  John Wall?"
Oh you mean when Russell Westbrook was Hitler and Harden was Jesus or when Harden was Hitler and Lebron was Jesus?
"LeBron James: King Ding-a-Ling  Michael Jordan: Asses Up, Tongues Out  Steph Curry: Long Range Cumshots  Anthony Davis: Brow-Beaten  Russell Westbrook: Fast and Hard  Jimmy Butler: Jimmy Buckets Scores  Paul George: Rated PG-13"
I wonder what would happen if Russell Westbrook opened up a restaurant in Houston. 
"Oh wait, Elgin Baylor actually averaged 38PPG the year Wilt scored 50PPG but only played in 48 games due to his Army commitment so he didn't qualify. Walt Bellamy was second and averaged 31.6, Bob Pettit averaged 31.1, West averaged 31.0, Oscar averaged 31, Richie Guerin averaged 30ppg. So thats 6 players that qualified averaging 30+ ppg and there's Baylor who averaged 38ppg. So yeah I think players numbers were up. Take this into consideration, Russell Westbrook lead the league in FGA this season with 1687. Compared to the 61-62 season that would put him in 8th place. Over 100 shots behind the person in 7th place who was Jerry West with 1795 FG attempts. "
Flashy in regards to being quick in the same way to Russell Westbrook or Allen Iverson

"You’re not gonna get many non biased opinions on Russ on r/nba. The way people talk about him on here is if he’s Elfrid Payton or Clippers Lance Stephenson. Not really surprising many of the people on here haven’t played any real form of basketball and just look at the stat sheets. LeBron has said nothing but praise about russ and they’re actually pretty tight, anyone with a brain knows Lebron would KILL to have Russell Westbrook on his squad. Media/ r/nba “analysts” love to shit on him while all the legends and players basically adore him. Durant literally on a burner shitted EVERYONE outside russ and yet he’s the reason KD left. "
What if Kevin Durant and James Harden didn't Leave OKC and stay with Russell Westbrook?
"Not really an interesting battle. One team has Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Karl Malone, David Robinson, Charles Barkley, Steve Nash, Kevin Garnett, Allen Iverson.

"Look at some footage of Zhaire Smith and watch how his legs hit the ground after all his dunks / acrobatic moves.

Pretty much done voting cause you said Russell Westbrook isn’t that good. 
In some ways he'd get a lot more love if he was in a smaller market.   Midwestern people *love* players who pretend to love their flyover cities and stay on small market teams.   Look at all the adulation Russell Westbrook gets for not even being *that* good.

He has elite playmaking but other than that what does he do at a star level? Not shoot, not rebound, not defend. What you're getting RIGHT NOW is a 19 year old that won't be able to defend any guards and will struggle from beyond the arc for a while. He has a good form and has potential to become a knock down shooter but he isn't right now. "

"**1. Steph Curry**-You can argue about health issues or streakiness in the playoffs but Curry's peak is higher than almost any other player in the NBA. He's the best shooter in NBA history, bar none, and he's also a good passer. His defense isn't spectacular but I even think he's improved on that end as well. There's a reason the Warriors are the Warriors and it starts with Steph Curry.  **2. Chris Paul**-CP3 has been a great player for a while and helped push the Rockets over the top regular-season wise. His passing, shooting, and defense are all elite, and if he were healthier in the playoffs he'd have a case for the top of this list imo  **3. Kyrie Irving**-Another guy who has questions on injury history, but Kyrie has done something that no other PG has proven: the ability to absolutely shred the best defenses at the highest levels of the game and on the biggest stages. I think the questions about whether he can play without LeBron were killed and buried deep this past season and, if healthy, could be the best player on an NBA champion next season.   **4. Damian Lillard**-Lillard suffered from a rough postseason but deserved every bit of that all-nba first team selection for his great regular season. He'll even deserve the MVP votes that he gets. His defense, like most of the guys on this list, isn't great but he's got scoring ability from all 3 levels, he's clutch, and he's coming off one of the most productive stretches of his career. If he performed better this past postseason I think we'd be talking about whether he's a top 10 player or not.  **5. Russell Westbrook**-A controversial selection here, but Westbrook is probably the player you'd take if you had to pick one guy to take a 20 win team and try to make it a 50 win team. His athleticism is endlessly ridiculous and he can lock in defensively unlike most PGs. The only challenges are his shooting and shot selection (as evidenced by 17 3s in the final OKC game of the season despite being a 30% three point shooter this season). There are also questions about whether he plays well with others on the basketball court, but with an individual talent like his it's not too much of a knock.  "
"I'm 34 and I feel the opposite - Jordan is the GOAT.  I think we get hung up on numbers. I don't consider Jordan better because of more rings, or because he averaged 30+ in an era of 88 - 85 games.  It's impossible to say how each might perform with different 3 point lines or handchecking, etc.  Numbers aside, watching Jordan play vs LeBron, Jordan had more gravity and presence.  He was always THE focal point.  He didn't disappear for stretches or for entire playoff series at any point.  He was always the fiercest competitor on the floor and unfalteringly confident (in that regard, Kobe and Russell Westbrook are closer to Jordan than LeBron).  There was a story maybe last year where a mom had driven ~100 miles to take her 2 kids to see LeBron play for the first time.  LeBron took the night off for rest.  When asked about it, LeBron said something along the lines of ""I've been in the league 15 years.  I've proved myself.  I've earned the right to take a night off if I want to.""  Jordan, when asked why he always plays so hard, said something along the lines of, ""Somewhere in the stands is someone who is seeing me play for the first time, who will only see me play this one time in their lifetime.  I'm going to show that person who I am, the player I am, that the hype is real.""  I think LeBron is the GOAT athlete and the most physically gifted person to ever play the game.  GOAT player?  Not even close.  Leading up to this year's finals, regarding the Cavs chances of winning, I heard a lot of ""Anytime you've got LeBron, you've got a chance.""  With Jordan, regardless of the circumstances or the actual result, I (and seemingly everyone else) always felt that Jordan finding a way to win wasn't just something that had a chance of happening, it was an inevitability.  Ultimately, it's a scorer's league, and aside from being arguably the best all-around player of all time, Jordan was much less argubly the best scorer of all time.  In a game that's going to come down to the last possession, I take Jordan over LeBron every time."
Russell Westbrook
"I think Lebron should go to OKC instead going to L.A where he could team up with Paul George,Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony"
You're severely underestimating evolution. Russell Westbrook would be Michael Jordan reincarnated. Plus Kevin Durant and Ibaka blocking everything in the paint. Lol. 
"Russell Westbrook couldn't lead a team with two stars and a veteran star past a rookie led team in the first round.  Ben Simmons, a rookie, together with basically another rookie in Joel Embiid (first healthy season), lead their team to the second round.  Ben Simmons's triple doubles are actually meaningful while Westbrook's seemingly are not.  Are Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid top 15 players? Only Embiid. And there are many people disputing this.  Are Russell Westbrook and Paul George top 15? Yes? At least one? Both?"
You are personally attacking the people who disagreed with you. You don't make rational arguments in favor of Westbrook either.  Russell Westbrook wasn't the MVP of the last season.
"Westbrook averaged a triple double and lost in five games in the playoffs, harden on the other hand nearly averaged a triple double and was a much better player that brought his team high amounts of success considering they had a 4-2 exit against the spurs who probably would have beat the warriors if not for kawhi being injured by zaza. This season he had help and they did not improve at all, they improved their record by 1 game and went from losing 4-1 in the first round to 4-3, atleast last year they lost to the rockets, this year they lost to the fucking jazz with paul george and russell westbrook. last season he carried his team for sure, but westbrook did not need to carry them as hard as he did, he just stat padded for the accolade like someone does in 2k. The highest usage rates of all time include two russell westbrook seasons, seasons where he had one first round exit and one where he missed the playoffs other people in the top five include kobe from 2005-06 where he lost in the first round, michael jordan in 1986-87 where he got swept in the first round and 2001-02 allen iverson who lost in the first round."
"First, a supermax contract is a very specific thing, and only four players (Stephen Curry, James Harden, John Wall &amp; Russell Westbrook) have it.  Second, LeBron's salary is less than Steph Curry's, so it's weird that you are claiming LeBron's being ""greedy with personal income.""  Third, taking less money to make it easier to be on a championship-level team only enriches the owners, and collectively hurts the negotiating position of every other player in the league. If you're ok with that, I guess it's easy to understand why you'd be a Warriors fan."
"Yeah if you play on a fucking stacked team. Not everyone has the luxury of having a Steph Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson on their side.    Try telling AD the regular season doesnt matter. Or Russell Westbrook. "
"If we are judging this off of highlight videos, then Russell Westbrook is the GOAT... and if we are judging this off struggles and overcoming them, then Russell Westbrook should be considered for that too. He lost KD and everyone thought the team was done. Then Russ averaged a triple double and carried his team to the playoffs and became MVP. Then people still trashed him and said he did that because he had no teammates. So he did it again with better teammates.   For clarification, I do not believe Russell Westbrook is the greatest of all time. This is just to show that you can’t claim someone is the best all time then only back that up with saying highlight reals and overcoming a struggle is why they are the GOAT. "
"You don't think the Pacers would have been interested in Kevin Love last summer? When they got Oladipo and Sabonis that was seen as a very poor return for PG at the time (it's since worked out like gangbusters, of course). I'm quite sure the Pacers would have *much* preferred Kevin Love, a multi-time All Star and former champion, who at the time was under contract for two more guaranteed years. At the time getting Love would have been seen as a far better return than Oladipo and Sabonis was.   The Cavs wanted to do the trade, but once they heard from LeBron that getting PG wouldn't get him any closer to committing long term, it spooked them. Keep in mind that all along PG has maintained he wants to go to the Lakers, so any team that traded for him last year (even the Cavs) was going to be running the risk that he could just leave after a year. The Cavs main selling point for PG re-signing with them would be getting to team up with LeBron long-term, but if *LeBron* wasn't willing to make that commitment, then they couldn't count on using that to sell PG. They very realistically could have traded Love (and maybe some picks, I don't know) to get PG only to then have both PG and LeBron both go sign with the Lakers this summer, leaving the Cavs with nothing.   I'm not saying that this is what *would* have happened, but from the Cavs point of view they at least had to be worried that this *could* happen. If LeBron, even with PG and Kyrie on the team, wasn't willing to give a commitment, then the Cavs would *have* to hedge their bets. LeBron really didn't give them a choice.   Also, to give some context to how much security trading for PG gave teams last summer, keep in mind that trading for PG also didn't get Russell Westbrook to commit to the Thunder last summer either. After trading for PG Russ still didn't sign his extension. It wasn't until the Thunder then also traded for *Melo* that Russ signed his extension, and presumably that's because PG has always been seen as just a possible (maybe even *probable*) one year rental. Russ probably didn't want to commit long term even with PG because he knew PG might leave in a year anyway, so what would Russ be committing to? But once the Thunder also added Melo, surely Russ then thought at least if PG leaves he'd still have one other star, and also that with three stars on the team it would make PG more likely to stay.   We all look at these things now with the benefit of hindsight and can now see that Oladipo and Sabonis was a much better return for PG than Love would have been, just like we all now know that getting Melo was a bad move for the Thunder rather than a good one. But that is not *at all* what the majority of people thought last summer, not on either count. "
this is the next step and a good direction. but you are kidding yourself if you don't think most games aren't gonna end with russell westbrook storming the lane over and over trying to draw a foul until he gets one and hits a free throw to end it. gay.
"What's going to happen next year? Or the year after that? You think free agents are going to want to live in OKLAHOMA? to play with Russell ""I only pass to get triple doubles"" Westbrook?   Also you're going to be paying him an insane amount of money in the upcoming years. Gotta be realistic man"
"Lol would've been embarrassing for Russell Westbrook last year. They hand them out in the second round.   Edit: Why am I being spammed with ""Dirk"" I'm aware..."
"Potentially a slightly more potent Russell Westbrook since he isn't taking bad shots in the playoffs but they might be able to force him to not take many good shots either.  But yeah, Big Rondo like everyone says."
"We got robbed of potentially one of the best rivalries of all time.   Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden (Serge Ibaka)  VS  Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green (Andre Iguodala)"
Russell Westbrook is currently the most overrated player in the NBA and he should not have won MVP
"Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, and Damian Lillard  Someone is gonna be very pissed at not starting, and they all have hella big egos "
Russell Westbrook for sure  John Wall  Avery Bradley  Andre Roberson
Russell Westbrook + Paul George + Carmelo Anthony
"Is that an indictment on Russell Westbrook? Team had horrible injury luck. WCF is when they had their best chance - against the greatest team of all time, records wise."
"Even if they weren't all in their primes at the same time, they'd still win in no more than 5 games.  If you take the 2000 season with prime 28yr old Shaq, prime 29yr old Penny, prime 28yr old Hill, and young up and coming 19yr old T-Mac, they'll still win in a gentleman's sweep.  The only slight cause for concern would be how Shaq would be able to guard the perimeter in PnRs but look at that length. Penny, T-Mac, and Hill are all 6'7""-6'8"" with long arms and all supremely athletic.  Grant Hill was more or less the Lebron of the 90s and well on his way to carrying the torch after Jordan retired. People like to say if AI and Kobe had a baby, it'd be Russell Westbrook. Well Penny Hardaway would be like if Jordan and Magic had a baby. It was crazy how good he was in only his 2nd season (made All-NBA 1st team). Supremely talented offensive player that can score in a myriad of ways on the break, in the post, and from the perimeter while have Magic-esque passing and vision. Then have the most unstoppable force since Wilt in the middle? No chance for the Warriors."
"Yea if Kevin Love, Russell Westbrook, CJ McCollum, and others can be really prominent figures in their markets so could Kawhi. If he was at all likable and camera friendly."
Yet how many times have people said that counting stats don't translate directly to good defense?  Look a DeAndre Jordan or Russell Westbrook. He may have been a defensive beast but you'll need a better argument than that. 
"The Warriors are not a juggernaut unbeatable team, despite what everyone says. Houston took them to 7. Cleveland could have easily won games 1 and 3. The Spurs were gonna win game 1 last year, and the Cavs choked game 3 and the series last year as well. They simply out-execute their opponents when it comes to crunch time, it's not like they blow you out of the water like everyone makes it seem like they do. Yeah, they're the most talented team, but they are definitely beatable. Also, Kyrie Irving is more conducive to winning than Russell Westbrook, and I would not trade Kyrie for any point guard in the league straight up except for Steph."
Russell Westbrook would get crossed up if he went to the local YMCA.
"Russell Westbrook is a G League level player.  Don't @ me.  Serious answer, yes I think he can win a title as the main guy and no I don't think he leaves.  I feel like he's a lifer kinda guy."
"Why are we giving Doncic a pass for bad career decisions?  According to our resident experts on Euroleague in r/NBA, teams are very flexible with lineups (so that Doncic just came off the bench in his last game despite being Real Madrid's superstar), and even stars can't expect to play heavy minutes, 20 at max.  Euroleague is more a team game than a game with dominant superstars like the NBA, say they.  Also, they excuse his rather terrible shooting numbers with the constant refrain that Doncic has played so many games, against grown-ass men, that he's tired out and we aren't seeing his true potential.  So why is Doncic electing to play in games that literally no scouts care about and don't matter outside Spain? What would be wrong with him asking for like a week off to take care of this literally life-changing event, that will affect the next 4-5 years of where he lives, how he develops? Why doesn't he participate in the workout game himself? Get fresh, schedule a workout to show off for the scouts, fly back in if his team really really needs him?  It wouldn't impact Real Madrid's success anywhere near say Russell Westbrook taking care off some business during a Thunder playoff game, per the above paragraph's facts.  Interesting that  Doncic elects to play in meaningless games, that gives his fans (or stans) ready-made excuses for poor play, rather than stepping up to the moment to solidify his draft position."
"How many times have you watched him? Twice? This year, from 0-3 feet away from the basket Brandon Ingram's FG% was 60.7% and Russell Westbrook's was 61.1%. On top of that, Westbrook's last four seasons were all worse than Brandon this year from 0-3 feet away. Westbrook couldn't even get above the 60% mark over the last four seasons and that includes his MVP season. So basically Ingram is already a very good finisher and he'll only get better as he fills in and becomes stronger.  "
If you’re asking who’s better then to me it’s... 1.) Russell Westbrook 2.) Steph Curry 3.) CP3 4.) Dame 5.) Wall/Kyrie
"The PG trade was a good gamble, because even though the Pacers have a star in Oladipo now, he wasn’t going to break out and get this good on the Thunder with Russell Westbrook. He really got a chance to take over a team in Indiana and he proved he could be a number one option."
"I think all the top 15 players off all-time are generational players. Kareem for sure, hell the NCAA banned dunking bc of him that's mind-boggling, plus he has an unstoppable move.   Hakeem as well - post moves that were unstoppable and cannot be replicated by big men and guards  Shaq - his dominance is once in a generation thing. No-one else will ever be that physically dominant in basketball compared to the other 7 footers.  Kobe - Not MJ, but closest anyone will ever come to his airness. The NBA has not had a player like Kobe since he came into the league. Kobe is the epitome of effort and will. How can arguably the greatest laker of all-time not be a generational player. He's iconic.  Oscar - LeBron loves him and admires him. 1st guy to avg a triple double, and was until Westbrook. That is generational player  Russell - the greatest winner of all-time, obviously falls into this category also is an icon for breaking down racial barriers  Duncan - why fundamentals matter and the moist stoic guy in basketball ever  Dr J - his dunking revolutionized how we view dunks today  Jerry West - the logo, way ahead of his time  Durant - 7 feet with his handles and shooting, obvious yes  Westbrook - relentless ferocity. The most athletic point guard we might ever see.  "
Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook are the mostly likely candidates. I can see Kemba Walker staying with the Hornets   
Russell Westbrook.  Watch Bodie and The Freak turn every game into a track meet
Westbrook. His comp to me seems to be bad Kobe.  Not exactly in playstyle but in his my way mentality. Kobe would actively choose to be Bad Kobe depending on his mood and the talent around him. Russell doesn't appear to have that switch
Russell Westbrook has a signature shoe with Jordan who is owned by drumroll.... Nike. 
Or Russell Westbrook
But there also was the 2nd part with dwayne wade where he mentions being comfortable trying to win with Russell Westbrook 
There would be 10 fan casualties per game. Russell Westbrook would lead the league in kills per game

RUSSELL WESTBROOK
"He met the love of his life Russell Westbrook, different situation. "
"&gt;Here’s the problem with the stretch: because of massive contracts for George and Russell Westbrook, plus smaller but still significant commitments to Steven Adams, Andre Roberson, and now Jerami Grant, 2018-19 isn’t the only year the Thunder are in cap hell. Granted, once Anthony’s contract comes off the books next summer, the nine-figure luxury tax bills end. But the Thunder would still be in the luxury tax going forward.  &gt;And stretching Melo would make that worse.  &gt;Adding $9 million in dead cap weight in 2019-20 would really hurt OKC’s ability to add talent with the mid-level exception without drawing huge luxury tax bills. By deferring Melo’s contract over three years, the Thunder would make 2018-19 easier to swallow while making it harder to add help for Westbrook and George so long as they have them.  &gt;By using the stretch provision, Melo would remain on the books so long as George is committed to OKC. As such, the argument against stretching Melo is that by sucking up the pain now, you actually make it more likely the Thunder can legitimately compete for a title during George’s contract.   Since people don't like reading articles. Melo is going to be on the Thunder next season. "
Russell Westbrook 
"Because Westbrook doesn’t contribute as many wins to his team as Jokic. Look at all the advanced stats. Jokic is up there with freakin’ LeBron James and Steph Curry   He’s also largely inefficient and he’s a stat padder. Jokic doesn’t care about TD’s. In fact, he hates when people ask him about it. All he cares about is winning. That’s the difference. Russell would rather get a rebound to secure a TD than win a game. "
"Too Lazy to format but here's the list:  * Seattle/OKC - Durant, Westbrook, Harden 3  * Golden State - Curry, Chamberlain 2  * Cleveland - LeBron 1  * Chicago - Rose, Jordan 2  * Charlotte - Kobe 1  * Phoenix - Nash 1  * Minnesota - Garnett 1  * San Antonio - Duncan, Robinson 2  * Phladelphia - Iverson, Barkley 2  * Orlando - Shaq 1  * Utah - Malone 1  * Houston - Olajuwon 1  * Los Angeles Lakers - Magic 1   * Boston - Bird, Cowens 2  * Portland - Moses, Walton 2   * Milwaukee - Nowitzki, Erving, Kareem, 3  * Buffalo Spirit/Los Angeles Clippers - McAdoo 1  * New York Knicks - Reed 1  * Baltimore Bullets/Washington Wizards - Unseld, Pettit 2  * St. Louis/Atlanta Hawks - Russell, Cousy 2  * Cincinatti Royals/Sacramento Kings - Robertson 1  Edit:  Thanks /u/jakegabel6 , /u/powerelite"
"I mean... Oklahoma City isn't winning a title with Westbrook, he's too selfish.  Look at the series with Utah, he got so obsessed with Ricky fucking Rubio and it cost them.  James Harden and Russell Westbrook are two in the same, they're chasing stats and money, nothing more.  "
"* At the end of the day Paul George took the money route. No one would match an OKC offer and any extra endorsement money, I guess, wasn't guaranteed to be begin with. * Gatorade clearly will run his commercials even if Paul George OKC gets bounced in the first round out of the playoffs.  * So Paul George didn't meet with the Lakers...How to read into this? Dealing with an angry or ticked off Russell Westbrook is probably not even worth it, in my opinion. So why not just forgo even meeting with the Lakers when you're gonna be about the money anyway. * Going to the Lakers makes a competitive Western Conference even more competitive but does not put Paul George in any greater position to win a Championship. (No guarantee that LeBron would have joined - anyone actually think about Isaiah Thomas recently and that ledrama that would occur if LeBron returned?) * Paul George does not want to be the man. That's why he doesn't mind staying in OKC where the pressure is less and now OKC fans will have to be even more forgiving of any of his lackluster performances this year...because Paul George did after all decide to stay."

Russell Westbrook was probably the worst 3 point shooter in the league last year. 
How long are people gonna upvote this comment on every thread even remotely relevant to Russell Westbrook. 
Yeah you just need a Russell Westbrook and your good to go 
"You missed the number one thing, trade Russell Westbrook"
People need to realize some people actually like to play with Russell Westbrook 
No he turned down geting beat by Lebron again w/ Myles Turner and Lance Stephenson as his best teamates.   Looks like contrary to popular belief there are people who do like riding shotgun with Russell Westbrook. 
"LA didn’t care about Paul, they were using him as bait to get another big star... while OKC and Russell Westbrook treats him like family.   What would you rather have?? Hey Paul sign with us so we can get Lebron!! Or friendship bracelets with Russ and a few extra million dollars "
He was trapped in a cardboard box after being lured by Russell Westbrook with Reese's pieces
"Russell ""Naruto"" Westbrook with the reliable Talk no Jutsu"
Regular season doesn’t matter anymore. This post season showed why. I think OKC is talented but I am not convinced that Russell Westbrook can win a championship with his ball dominate style of play. 
"Exactly. Oladipo was unproven at the time and PG was a bonafide superstar. Then Oladipo broke out (and won MIP in the process), while it was looking like PG was about to dip after just one year on the Thunder. Now we know that PG's time with the Thunder endeared him to the team, the city and to Russell Westbrook, and it was enough to get him to buy in on a max contract. Meanwhile the Pacers have a star guard of their own and never would have retained PG in the same way that OKC did.  So yeah, that entire timeline is perfectly reasonable. Which is weird to say about /r/NBA."
Russell Westbrook
Not have Russell Westbrook  Have Russell Westbrook
Not have Russell big dick Westbrook
OKC has Russell Westbrook. Indiana had... um... Myles Turner
Not have Russell Westbrook
Not Have Russell Westbrook lol
They didn’t have Russell Westbrook 
"He's still friends with Westbrook apparently.  [Kendrick Perkins wanted them to speak to each other, because he felt as if people tryed to make the beef between them more serious than it actually was](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/07/15/paul-george-says-kevin-durant-and-russell-westbrook-are-buddies-again/?noredirect=on). So KD and Russ had a good conversation and PG confirms they are buds again."
"Sam Presti yelled, “There you go!” OKC Fans gave a look of pleasant surprise. Russell Westbrook belted, “We got a [explicit] squad now.” And before Paul George hit the locker room door, ex-Thunder Nick Collision hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so similar.”"

Well Russell Westbrook isn’t in Indiana...
"Russell Westbrook said ""We kept our fucking squad!"""
"I want to see Russell Westbrook go on The Herd, similar to how Baker Mayfield went on. It would be hilarious, but it would never happen. One can dream."
Because Russell Westbrook is his best friend 
"Russell ""Naruto"" Westbrook with the powerful Talk no Jutsu..."
Russell Westbrook was a fishing enthusiast from the beginning off-season up until tomorrow morning
He genuinely enjoys playing with his good friend Russell Westbrook 
Because basketball requires a lot more skill than football...that doesn't make basketball players better athletes.  Russell Westbrook is a freak NBA athlete but he's only above average compared to starting NFL receivers. 
"If that happens, if Utah wins an even number amount of games, and the Thunder lose and odd amount of games, and one player on Utah gets injured, and if Russell Westbrook is averaging a triple double that season, as well as Royce O’Neale playing more than 15 minutes per game.  I will post on gone wild with the names of all the White players on Utah’s roster"
"I am not a fan of all point guards / ballhandlers who can't shoot... ***except*** Ben Simmons. I think he's going to be a Top 5 player in the league during his entire prime. He's just such a unique player.  But I'm not at all a fan of guys like DeAaron Fox, Dennis Schroder, Elfrid Payton (who is?), Reggie Jackson, Kris Dunn -- and then even extending it up to stars I don't like Russell Westbrook, John Wall, or DeMar DeRozan NEARLY as much as the average NBA fan. I think they can be *fine* in the absolute right circumstance but it involves tailoring your entire roster to accommodate their lack of shooting."
"i understand what youre saying but dont shit on kids like that.  he's got a couple years of high school left and is already playing on the same court as pros (because of his name, sure, but he held his own).  its too early to just say he wont get drafted.  we would have never seen russell westbrook or anthony davis if players were given up on recruiting when they were sophomores.  i dont know if he'll make it to the league but i do know we get another couple years to watch and see what happens."
"Russell Westbrook has had some pretty crazy recovery moments only to have back-to-back triple double seasons.   Injuries off the top of my head:  1. ) Pat Bev. and the meniscus tear (3 surgeries on his knee I think?)  2.) [That nasty dent in his face](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--LU9mL0IK--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/kgpwt1z3yzo6bqpzlf96.jpg)  3.) [That one times he seemed to summon Thor-esque lightning while wearing a mask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czm8sh73P5A)"
Russell Westbrook had an academic scholarship to Stanford. Based on his shot selection you wouldn’t think he’s that smart 
"These videos are so stupid. He's guarding Russell Westbrook, the most explosive PG in history. Of course he's gonna get scored on and make mistakes.  Then it's also selective and doesn't show all the defensive plays he made in the series. He not only guarded Westbrook, but Durant too for some stretches too.  "
"Was playing highlights last night with a friend of mine I haven't seen in almost a year. Used the Russell Westbrook highlights, my boy used the current Kevin Durant highlights. Was meant to post this last night but forgot to because I got so high and had one of the most intense highlight watching sessions I've ever had in my life (lots of shit talk, emotions ran high, good times)."

"Of course he’s a starter. AND of course you want him on a certain team construction and playing style. He’s not a superstar like Bron who can fit perfectly on literally any team. He can’t do everything with the ball in his hands like Nash could. He’s a role player.   He’s a *good* role player, but a role player nonetheless. Hell, even superstars with some limitations like  Russell Westbrook really need a team around them that’s designed in a certain way to maximize his talents.   For example, you really want the ball in Rubio’s hands. He’s not a great fit next to a ball dominant player who controls a slow, penetrate and kick to shooters, half court offense like Bron. "
"James Harden, with Russell Westbrook close behind."

I googled ""Westbrook defense"" and [this](https://nbamath.com/russell-westbrooks-defense-is-finally-a-problem-for-the-oklahoma-city-thunder/) was the first article to pop up. And this was in the PLAYOFFS. Westbrook isnt a good defender bud."
"John Wall, Russell Westbrook, LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, and maybe Derrick Rose. "
"So this isn't really talked about, but players don't usually get that much better at passing.  The most they usually improve by is one tier (Examples: from bad to ok, ok to good, or good to great).  If you look throughout NBA history players that were great passers like CP3 came into the league as at least very good passers.  The only possible exception I can think of is Russell Westbrook (who had the all time weirdest development), but even that is arguable depending on how bad you think he was at passing coming into the league and how good he is now.  You might as well ask how good will Doncic be if he develops crazy athleticism."
"assists really do not mean he is unselfish, especially if they only really pass when its for an assist opportunity   his 2017 season for example, his teammates were not bad enough to necessitate that astronomical usage rate which he took  e: also he has been rightfully criticised about his playstyle forever now, the years when he was taking a similar number of shots to KD and making far less of them were very valid criticisms of his game  &gt; That was the worst point guard, in a Championship Finals, I’ve ever seen. He was too wild. He was taking off-balance shots. You have to come out and set the tone with Kevin Durant … Russell Westbrook has gotta set the tone with Kevin Durant.  Magic Johnson after one of his 2012 finals games, he simply lacked the floor general ability"
"You haters can hate Russell Westbrook all you want, but the entire state of Oklahoma will have your fucking head if you step foot here. That is all."
Russell Westbrook wins a championship
"Haha last season for sure, you could open a thread about someone seeing Gordon Hayward at an Applebee’s or some some shit and the comment section would still devolve into Russell Westbrook insults "
Isn't this most of our Russell Westbrook threads already

DBPM is a really bad stat. Nash was a poor defender but he's going to get hurt by not accumulating defensive stats (and also offensive stats since DBPM rewards offensive rebounding). He was also on shit defensive teams which will bring down his number (obvious he hurts the defense but the Suns supporting cast were loaded up on offense and DBPM has a team adjustment).  There's a reason Russell Westbrook is a monster in DBPM despite not being a good defender (gobbles up stats and plays for a great defensive team).
"I can't speak for everyone else, but the on-court issue for me is a lot more complex than what you're describing here.  The good part of Russ is that he's such a force of nature offensively that just having him on your team gives you a very high floor.  He can single handedly carry an offense in a way that only a handful of players can.  But, there's three features of Russ's game that I think put a ceiling on his team that is hard to break through, even adding other stars.  First, he's not a good distance shooter, and he shoots threes aggressively.  That's bad because the poor efficiency from distance is a killer.  But, far worse, is that he's not a threat away from the ball.  Russ *has* to make the play for your team because if anyone else does, the defense will ignore Russ and play 5 on 4.  In other words, Russ is a great team mate for role players and shooters, but tough to play with if you're a play maker.  Second, he's prone to making critical mistakes defensively, which isn't surprising given that [he's admitted](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/russell-westbrook-says-he-doesnt-watch-film/) he doesn't watch film.  If you've watched Kobe's ""Detail"" you have some idea of how elite players use film.  Film is *especially* important on defense because it's how you pick up little tendencies and anticipate plays as they're happening.  Third, his rebounding is a gift and a curse.  It does allow him to start the break quicker, which is nice.  But, it also costs his team against teams with good perimeter shooting.  If the ball bounces wrong and the offense gets the rebound, Russ will leave his man *wide open* while he chases the board."
"I don't see how Westbrook passes any of the following without a title (all of these players led teams to titles):   1) Michael Jordan  2) LeBron James  3) Magic Johnson  4) KAJ  5) Kobe Bryant  6) Shaq  7) Bill Russell  8) Wilt  9) Tim Duncan  10) Larry Bird  11) Oscar Robertson  12) Hakeem  13) Durant  14) Moses Malone  15) Dr. J  16) Jerry West  17) Isiah Thomas  18) Steph Curry  I think that's very fair to say, there's no way a title-less Westbrook is going down in history above any of those guys.  So Westbrook is in a pool with a bunch of other guys, some champions, some not, for those last two slots.  Here's a sampling of ones without rings in that conversation:   Elgin Baylor, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, John Stockton.  Here are some with rings:  Scottie Pippen, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, David Robinson  I love Russ as much as anyone, but there's no way he's jumping past most of those names on stats and strong playoff performances alone. He needs to lead a team to a title to do that. The top 20 players of all time are the very very very best to ever do this.  While it's absolutely a team game, the very best players ever have found a way to lead a team to a title, or they've come damn close multiple times.   "
Russell Westbrook on a farm  But it's mostly a statistics thing. There are way more people in big cities that like basketball so there's a higher chance that they play the sport and want to make it to the NBA. 
You’re Russell Westbrook?
OKC's offense is the Russell Westbrook show.  Everyone gets career lows with that team.
"The thing that really ignited my passion in the NBA being from the UK was [this article about the 50 greatest moments of Michael Jordan's Career](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1524098-celebrating-michael-jordans-50th-birthday-with-his-top-50-career-moments#slide1) and going through and watching all the career top-10s on the [NBA youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhyANGHDDH8&amp;list=PLlVlyGVtvuVmZEMZBPdM61wry1SV040h7)  The NBA Finals mini-movies on the channel are also really great if you can find them, and the [top viewed videos of all time are good to go through as well](https://www.youtube.com/user/NBA/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid)  From there I kind of just read little bits here and there where I could, and I watched the Starters show on the NBA channel as well, as it was an easy introduction into following the league, and getting to know some of the players.  As far as picking a team is concerned, I've always felt that when you have a real passion in a new sport, you don't always choose a team, so much as a team chooses you, as corny as that sounds.  For me it was watching the all-star game in 2015, and seeing Russell Westbrook of OKC stand out, and that led to me watching the team, and getting invested in his performances, and then the team as a whole.  For most newbies who don't have a local team it's almost always their first favourite player that grips them and makes them a fan. So really, the best is to watch whatever games you can, find out what kind of basketball you like to watch, and who you like to watch and go from there.  Some big players right now to try to catch would be LeBron of course, Russell Westbrook, Giannis Antetokounmpo of Milwaukee, Steph Curry of Golden State, James Harden of the Rockets, Anthony Davis of the Pelicans, and Joel Embiid of Philadelphia.  When the season starts up again in October there'll be plenty of streams available to watch, and of course national TV too (I'm assuming you're in America)  Also playing NBA 2K is a really engaging way of getting into everything. Another common way for people to become a fan of a team is that they were drafted by or played for a franchise in MyCareer mode on 2K.  There's a number of beginners guides too if you google for them"
"&gt; Setting up teammates for some easy, open high percentage shots will contribute to more wins.  He does this all the time, every single game. He led the NBA in assists last year, and has been top 4 for four straight seasons. He's one of the best passers in the league; he constantly creates wide open 3's off the drive and kick, and he's deadly in the pnr.  Outside of LeBron James, there is no other player in this generation that can create as many shots for himself and others as Russell Westbrook."
"Paul was willing to help recruit a better player to Boston (Kevin Garnett) and go from being ""The Man"" to ""The Big 3"" and it resulted in a championship for Boston.  Whereas Melo got jealous of Linsanity and refused to accept that he wasn't as good as Russell Westbrook or Paul George."
[I hear Russell Westbrook was a farmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOgBg2up7Jg)
Russell Westbrook has the better legacy on the team with the triple double seasons but KD is obviously the better player.
&gt; Thunder: Russell Westbrook*  Kevin Durant
"Yeah, watching Curry just running and running and running every single play.  Melo doing that? No way.  I think I read once that Curry averages twice the distance ran on court that all the other starters average. That's the pinnacle of off-ball work in the league. Melo's probably at the other end of the spectrum.  It's funny though - I'm actually more surprised by how little Russell Westbrook works off the ball. If any dude had the motor to out distance Curry, it'd be Russ. Instead he just kind of sits out in three point land waiting for the ball back or an easy alley-oop."
"""yo E, don't say what's up to that bitch ass *****"" Russell Westbrook."
"&gt; He has also never played on a team with someone like CP3 who can tell him straight up “look at me, you are not the captain here” and keep him in check. Not only is CP3 a high enough caliber player where he can tell Melo that and Melo respect it  He played with Russell Westbrook last year lol"
"Better offensive system, better coach, will have a better attitude and actually motivated, not playing with Russell Westbrook. "
"Probably not but I feel like OKC would probably be a better team with Kawhi instead of WB, imagine the defence with Kawhi, PG, Roberson and Adams.  I mean obviously OKC is the Russell Westbrook show so the entire team dynamic would be different if he leaves so it's hard to tell how good they'd actually be but still that team looks scary to play against on paper."

"I semi predicted it, I didnt shout it out with full confidence all the time though. But i deep down knew Russell Westbrook would always stay with OKC. My dad was constantly saying both him and KD would head off to LA because every big player wants to play there, etc. So i never argued with him. However, all my close friends including a handful who browse this sub, know I always said Russ will stay in OKC. My only reasoning in the back of my mind was because he was barely recruited out of HS, barely got to UCLA and outside of bball everyone said he was a family man and had a select few friends, he never posted ""his opinion"" on social media, it was always him singing, charity, or his family. Based off that he always just seemed loyal and content to me, and very mature in what he wants in life. Also his brother went to college here and met a ton of friends, just always felt it deep down in my plums."

"Fiancé and I once saw Russell Westbrook in LA, she remembers what he looks like but not his name... seems like a similar situation. "
Russell Westbrook averaging a triple double in November 2016. It's up there in my most controversial comments ever. 
"https://www.expressnews.com/spurs-nation/article/Kawhi-and-the-Spurs-How-it-all-fell-apart-13094522.php  &gt;The first cracks in the low-maintenance veneer came in 2016, when Leonard made his first All-Star game — in Toronto of all places.  &gt;Leonard and his traveling companions noticed other All-Stars — notably Oklahoma City point guard Russell Westbrook — were using private luxury cars to get around, instead of the standard transportation provided by the NBA. They wanted the star treatment, too.  &gt;Leonard’s trip to China in August of 2017 seemed to spark another change in him. Everywhere he went on the NBA ambassador junket, Leonard was mobbed by fans wearing his jersey and other Spurs gear.  &gt;“I was surprised at how many Spurs fans there were, for me not ever going out there,” Leonard said upon his return stateside. “It’s just shocking to see how big they support the NBA.”  &gt;The experience also stuck with Leonard’s personal management team, including his uncle, Dennis Robertson. His advisers began to see Leonard’s potential as a top-shelf star and global brand."
Russell Westbrook
James harden is better than Russell Westbrook. Still a debate but this was when the trio we're on the thunder.
Russell Westbrook doesn't play winning basketball.
Russell Westbrook  Chris Paul (yeah i know you didn't include him idc)  Kyrie Irving  Damian Lillard  John Wall   Kyle Lowry   Mike Conley   Kemba Walker 
Russell Westbrook
"This will not be well received, but Russell Westbrook. He's a great player to take a bad team to respectability. But I dont think you can win a title with hin as the focal point of the offense. I actually think he might be more individually talented than Steph but he struggles to have an impact against teams where his overwhelming athleticism isn't as much of an advantage. He singlehandedly wins games but also singlehandedly loses them more often than other guys who are franchise cornerstones. I think he's maybe at the bottom of the top 10 in terms of who I'd build a team around right now"
Oh Russell Westbrook is an average finisher in the paint. I can see this with the eye test but I'm sure there are people who would argue he is above average. 
"James Harden&gt;Russell Westbrook  Even before the trade, he had shown he was a better all around player and distributor than Westbrook. He had that really good series against the Spurs in 2012 that showed his superstar potential. He definetly shit the bed in the finals which probably made the organization pick Russell and Ibaka over him. He was a better version of Manu Ginobli even at the time.  On the other hand, Westbrook was the superior player athletically and had matured into a star faster. He did almost shoot the team out of the 2011 west Semis against Memphis and the 2011 west Finals against Dallas, and has shown over time to not make his teammates any better."
1. LeBron   2. KD  3. Steph   4. CP3  5. DWade  6. Carmelo Anthony   7. Chris Bosh  8. Vince Carter  9. Dwight Howard  10. Pau Gasol   11. Russell Westbrook   12. Harden  13. Manu Ginóbili   14. Tony Parker  
"When KD left I said Russell Westbrook would average a triple double that year, and somehow I was right. "
"Seeding seems a little funky. What if it were more like:  (1) Anthony Davis / Kyrie Irving vs. (8) Giannis Antetokounmpo / Klay Thompson  (4) Russell Westbrook / Joel Embiid vs. (5) Kawhi Leonard / Damian Lillard  (2) LeBron James / Jimmy Butler vs. (7) Steph Curry / Karl-Anthony Towns  (3) Kevin Durant / Chris Paul vs. (6) James Harden / Paul George  Granted, I think the winner is still James / Butler, but at least this way we get to see LeBron vs Kyrie in the finals lol"
Having a look at the list of starters from last year and trying to put it some sort of rough order for it to make sense (ordering bottom 20 was quite difficult):    Top 10:  GSW: Steph Curry  HOU: Chris Paul  OKC: Russell Westbrook  BOS: Kyrie Irving  WAS: John Wall  POR: Damian Lillard  CHA: Kemba Walker  TOR: Kyle Lowry  MEM: Mike Conley  PHI: Ben Simmons    Middle 10:  UTA: Ricky Rubio  IND: Darren Collison  MIN: Jeff Teague  SAS: Dejounte Murray  DEN: Jamal Murray  MIL: Eric Bledsoe  MIA: Goran Dragic  NOP: Rajon Rondo  LAC: Milos Teodosic / Patrick Beverly  LAL: Lonzo Ball    Bottom 10:  ATL: Dennis Schroder  CLE: George Hill  BKN: D'Angelo Russell / Spencer Dinwiddie  DET: Reggie Jackson  DAL: Dennis Smith Jr.  CHI: Kris Dunn  SAC: De'Aaron Fox  NYK: Trey Burke / Frank Ntilikina  ORL: DJ Augustin  PHO: Elfrid Payton
"Which is why NBA players not going toe to toe competitively AKA off *the* NBA court make us look unworthy to play basketball. I saw that Jayson Tatum Joel Embiid Mo Bamba one on one video. Jayson Tatum looked like 6'8 Michael Jordan and Joel Embiid was playing like a 2K create a player 7 foot point guard with 99 in all stats and all hall of fame badges. I also saw tape of Russell Westbrook, considered an average at best three point shooter in the league, not missing during warmups at around 3 steps back from the 3 point line. Lebron James playing in UCLA was hitting fadeaway 3s, and James Harden was 1v1ing a couple YouTubers and draining shots after crazy moves while the only effort put into it was having to think about it. "
"k listen up you little shit  I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns.  This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"
I don't have the stats right now but if I recall he was efficient at the rim on UCLA. The difference is he avoids contact because the lack of his physical strength against nba caliber players. He also has a problem of jumping from too far away on his layups which was a similar problem for Russell Westbrook. I think he can get back to being efficient at the rim and three point line. 
"Steph and KAT get their worst matchup and Kyrie turns into god and AD puts the locks on KAT. 1 seed upset.  -Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis advance  In a close one, the old man strength of LeBron edges young Giannis and Klay.  -LeBron James and Jimmy Butler advance  Dame and Snek's reluctance to call travel in a game of 2v2 gives Harden the ultmate edge. No Dame time tonight.  -James Harden and Paul George advance  Westbrook will not lose to KD in this situation. He'll murder everyone if it that's what it takes.  -Russell Westbrook and Joel Embiid advance   ---  Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis vs LeBron James and Jimmy Butler  To Kyrie's dismay, LeBron's ego decides to play father to Kyrie one more time for old time's sake but that leaves Jimmy guarding AD on an island and that presents a matchup too tough.  -Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis advance  Much like in college sports when a underdog tops their rival, a letdown game is imminent. Harden's 8 steps stepback prove to be too much in the end.  - James Harden and Paul George davance   ---  Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis vs James Harden and Paul George  Following suit, no one wants to be the bitch who calls travel in a 2v2. But Anthony Davis's condor length still blocks Harden after he takes so many steps on his patent stepback that he ends up near midcourt. Still, PG has the chance to win it taking advance of his size matchup and well you know the rest.  Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis win"
"Russell Westbrook, has an electrifying playing style.  "
Russell Westbrook. His team is in the ***west***.
"Russell Westbrook, thunderous dunks."
"OKC Jazz Game 6 had the best quarter of basketball.  In the third quarter of that game, Donovan Mitchell and Russell Westbrook had an epic duel and both scored more than 20 points.  They both could not be stopped, even by great defense on both ends."
"Tbh, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, and Draymond Green immediately come to mind."
I love Russell Westbrook. I'm a recovering hater of Kobe lol
Kobe Bryant and Russell Westbrook. I see so much hate for these two. We’ll never see another player like either of these two. It’s sad that so many people resort to hating on them rather than appreciating the things they do
"I like the Nuggets. They’re exciting, they’re young, and Jokic is the real deal. I think they’re going to make a big jump this year.   I always root for the Thunder. For some reason, I have a soft spot for Russell Westbrook. Paul George has always been one of my favorite players too. In general, I feel like they’re going to get it together, and they just might play the Warriors well. I just think that for some reason.   I always like the Blazers. I wish they hadn’t gotten swept. Dame is amazing. People always compare him to Kyrie. They’re totally different players, and I think it’s unfair they’re pumped together. Best classic jersey and colors in he NBA.   In more limited doses, I’ll root for the Pelicans and Wolves. I like Jimmy Butler. I want them both to do well.   I still don’t like the Rockets, but I want them to have a better record than the Warriors.   I hate the Clippers. Obviously I hate the Lakers.   I want the suns and Booker to aspire to greatness. I think they’ve got the talent to figure it out.   Hot take...I don’t like the spurs. I never have, save for when they played in the finals against the Heat. I always feel like us Celtics fans have a weird obsession with the spurs because they’re regarded as unflashy and hard working, committed to teamwork and selflessness. Sure, they are that. However, they’re not the Celtics. We are all of that as well, but not in the same way. I like Pop. I never cared for the players. Timmy was great but boring. I hate Parker and Ginobli. In other words, I don’t necessarily hate the spurs, but I hate it when every Celtics fan pledges allegiance to them as their western binkie because they regard them as playing similarly. However, of course, I will root for them against the Warriors, Lakers and Lebron teams (which of course are now the Lakers). "
Russell Westbrook? By all accounts he's one of the most generous players in the NBA.
every single year Melo has spent not playing next to Russell Westbrook he’s been an above average player. 12 of those 15 he was an all star. in 2017 he put up 22/6/3. i can’t wait for him to go to Houston and produce at a high clip again so this nonsense stops.   d wade was an exceptional player but injuries have caught up to him to the point where the Heat are iffy on re-signing him. 
"this has been going on for years now, since espn and a lot of idiots were actually pushing bron to win finals MVP in 2015  and nowadays every time you cite his failures it's ""he averaged/almost averaged a triple double!!!""  but in the same breath shit on russell westbrook who has completely eclipsed lebron in triple doubles despite playing 6 less seasons and has dealt with meniscus/knee injuries."
"I don’t even get this “make up the money lost with shoe deals”, Russell Westbrook has a MONSTER Jordan contract in Oklahoma City, James harden has a multi hundred million dollar adidas deal while being in a football state, this isn’t 1984, location doesn’t affect your marketability that much, if Kawhi thinks Nike is gonna offer him an 80+ million dollar contract to make up what he left in SA, just because he’s in LA, he’s going to be disappointed "
I imagine Russell Westbrook reading this thread and then immediately building a time machine to 1961. 
This is like an all star showing up to some rec league and playing like he gave a shit. Can you imagine Russell Westbrook filling in one Tuesday night for the team full of factory workers from florida whose 5th guy had to pull a double. This would be his stat line 
Hhhaaa he can guard the lesser athletes like Russell Westbrook! Got damn you must watch an NBA the rest of us don’t have access to.

I'd definitely rather Beverley. Russell and him are similar but at least Russell is relatively effective off ball.  Once you get past like 25ish it's all a bit of a wash and about team fit. Would I rather Schroeder or Jones? Probably Tyus because I know he'll happily accept a limited role and he'll play hard on defense. Is he a better player in a vacuum?

"Read. The. Post.    &gt; Moving over to the defensive side, it is pretty obvious Kobe was the far better defender. He was first team All Defense in both of these seasons, and his advanced stats where higher than Stephs. From an eye test standpoint, [Kobe hounded the ball handler and routinely picked up players from near halfcourt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTITRJp2bhI). Steph on the other hand was a mediocre defender who was routinely beat by the faster, stronger PGs like Russell Westbrook. Steph is a smart defender and plays passing lanes well, but his physical stature limits his ability on that end. "
"I have a slightly different approach to ranking players, so I'm not going to tell you that Larry was #5 all time or anything like that. I just say that the only other guys in Larry's stratosphere are MJ, Magic, Russell, Kareem, Duncan, Lebron, and maybe/probably Wilt and Shaq. If I'm putting them in order Larry's going somewhere in the middle of those guys.   Sorry that I came at you, but honestly your question struck me as either ill informed or disingenuous. Larry's clearly better than every single one of those guys you mentioned not named Lebron. Larry's a 3x MVP, a 2x finals MVP, 10x all NBA (9 first team), 3x all defense, and I've never seen a top ten ranking that didn't have him in it. Lebron's the only guy in that list who hangs with that. Larry went 50-40-90 twice. He was clutch as fuck. You ever hear anybody say they'd take Steph or Harden over Magic? Of course you don't, and I've seen people in these comments try to say that Westbrook is better than Bird was.  So I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be a stuck up dick, I just can't believe what I'm reading here."
"You know Carmelo Anthony played for the Thunder last season right? 2Pat will score closer to his career average of 7/4 this coming season.   They also have 2 time scoring champion Russell Westbrook and another great scorer called Paul George. Steven Adams averaged 14/9 last year and Dennis Schroder averaged 19/6, and he’s coming off the bench for OKC. All we need 2Pat to do is shoot the 3 ball at 38%, move the ball and play defence. Watch a few Thunder games this season, you’ll see what I’m saying."
Westbrook is the greatest stat-padding player of all time (GSPOAT).  It has been confirmed multiple times with tons of evidence.

"The Ringer had a great article about this during his MVP season. I'll try to find it and link to it here.   The problem is that Westbrook fans often think his critics are saying""Westbrook's style of play makes the team worse"" when what they're actually saying is ""the team could be so much better if he tweaked a few parts of his game"". A slight but significant difference.    Edit: here is the article - https://www.theringer.com/2017/3/9/16042800/the-russell-westbrook-problem-54e59db48117"
"Harden was a sixth man mostly, Oladipo just didn’t fit, Sabonis was a late round rookie and wasn’t supposed to do anything, Melo was the third option compared to the first option in NY, and PG considering he was the second option to Russell Westbrook played really good, quit trying to shit on Russell for the love of god."
"Curry and Durant are insanely underrated, especially Curry. If you look at the advanced stats, just look at the number of players with a better season than Curry or Durant's peak to figure this out.  **PER**  * Players higher than Curry: Wilt Chamberlain, Lebron James, Michael Jordan * Players higher than Durant: Wilt Chamberlain, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, David Robinson, Shaquille O'neal, Russell Westbrook, Dwyane Wade, Tracy McGrady, Chris Paul, and Kareem Abdul Jabaar.  Curry Rank: 4th, Durant Rank: 13th  **TS%, &gt;20 PPG**  * Players higher than Curry: None * Players higher than Durant: Stephen Curry, Charles Barkley, Amare Stoudemire, Kevin McHale, Adrian Dantley  Curry Rank: 1st, Durant Rank: 6th  **WS/48**  * Players higher than Curry: Kareem Abdul Jabaar, Wilt Chamberlain, Lebron James, Michael Jordan * Players higher than Durant: Kareem Abdul Jabaar, Wilt Chamberlain, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, Al Cervi, David Robinson.  Curry Rank: 5th, Durant Rank: 7th  **BPM**  * Players higher than Curry: Russell Westbrook, Lebron James, Michael Jordan * Players higher than Durant: Russell Westbrook, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, James Harden, David Robinson, Kareem Abdul Jabaar, Dwyane Wade, Charles Barkley, Kevin Garnett, Tracy McGrady, Shaquille O'neal, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird.  Curry Rank: 4th, Durant Rank: 15th  In addition to these stats, Curry has the 2nd highest +/- in NBA history in 2015-2016 (only behind 2015-2016 Draymond Green), but has the higher +/- per 48 minutes in NBA history for his 2016-2017 season.  RPM has only been around since 2013-2014, but Curry has the 2nd highest in that time in 2014-2015, behind only Lebron James' 2015-2016 season. Durant is the 12th player in terms of best RPM seasons.  It seems pretty clear that Curry is in that Top 3 group with Lebron/Jordan, while Durant is pretty safely in the Top 15 players going by the advanced stats. "
"MVP's are a popularity vote. There is no statistical correlation to it, or Russell Westbrook would have won again. "

"I think Joel Embiid will be in the league for maybe 3 more seasons before leaving due to injury.   I think Tobias Harris is a top 20 player.   I think ITs stats were empty and that he has nothing to contribute to a contending team. He isn't some underdog awaiting a spectacular comeback, he actually just had a linsanity type year and will never be a valuable contributer again due to height and lack of defense.   JR Smith did nothing wrong. If he attacked the rim it would have been a heads up play and smart. But they were tied and the coaches didn't call a time out. Their job is to manage strategy.   Russell Westbrook is selfish. Having a killer instinct is no excuse to not be capable of slowing down and making the best play. He is a professional and an adult.   The Celtics won't be a top 3 team in the east. Once Kyrie and Hayward are back there will be a serious personnel issue with how to manage touches. One or both will make some snarky comment to the press and they will feud.   Kawhi isn't doing any of this stuff, but he is such an introvert that he is letting everyone else talk for him. I don't even think he meant for any of this to happen. He just couldn't say no to his people or speak up for himself.  "
"Oh for sure. My frustration has been that people criticize Westbrook for things like ""not making teammates better,"" ""stat padding,"" or ""hogging the ball,"" when *for the most part*, in context, those aren't accurate.   You nailed the *actual* issue, and several stemming from it. I'm not sure that he's not defending well because of position, I think sometimes he's not doing much *at all.* When you play at 150% speed throughout an entire game, you expend insane amounts of energy. This is Westbrook's strength, but it's also his weakness. A lot of times, like you mention, when he's not contesting 3s or defending, he's kind just moving at 60%-70% speed. So sometimes, I don't think he's neccessarily hunting rebounds, I think he's just gassed from carrying weight, and he elects to go for burst plays for steals, or positions himself to get a rebound, so that he can do *something* on defense, but in reality, I think he's just tired. This isn't an excuse for him either, because we have *seen* him lock people down. Russell Westbrook can play really good defense. He just doesn't do it, and that's frustrating.  What I *HOPE* happens this season, is that he's able to mentality relax, and physically discipline himself. He has a good team, and no looming offseason. Grant/Adams/PG/Roberson, combined with a newly, potentially seriously revamped bench with Schroder/Noel (due to roles, not talent) affords him that opportunity. Shot selection, off ball movement, defense, he has the skillsets on his team now to allocate energy to those things. He can let PG run the offense and move off ball. He can defend better because he's doing that. He doesn't have to launch 12 3s because he's doing that. He has a roster this season that bodes well for his improvement."
"""Russell Westbrook misses 16 fast break layups, winds up with 16 orebs and 0 drebs."""
"I mean he's kind of right on paper in that you don't have that offensive star who can go super saiyan and carry you against all odds (Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant/Steph Curry, Damian Lillard). Those types of performances are central to the playoffs and all respect to Mitchell but I'm not willing to give him that yet.   Nonetheless I want absolutely no part of the Jazz."
"The effort is coming up with an entire rebounding scheme just to stop one guy from getting a stat. Then you would have to alter how players get back on defense and such, and you still have to worry about Melo and Adams. George chillin on the other side with less defenders to stop him, somebody else ready to cut. I want you to come up with an answer for all of those factors for a scheme that is effectively able to prevent Russell Westbrook from Achieving a triple double. Cause that's the game plan."
"Again, Russell Westbrook is the most underrated superstar ever exists.  "
"Everyone's just jealous because Russell Westbrook is the best player in the game, period. Wrecked shop all over the Warriors, the Rockets, and the Spurs. You can all talk about your jedi mind trick spreedsheets you want, the only real advanced stat is Russell's triple dubs and winning. He's the most ""advanced"" player of all of them. Funny how Kevin Durant is a nobody now that he whined his way out of OKC."
"Don't forget this gem:  &gt; My reason for making this post is to make as fair an argument as possible as to why Russell Westbrook is not a winning basketball player and does not deserve to be recognized among the all-time greats like Durant, Lebron, Wade, Curry or Chris Paul, for example.  This guy made a thesis to shit on Russell Westbrook but called 2nd round legend Chris Paul a ""winning"" player lmfao "
"&gt; Please don't immediately write me off as a hater here.  --  &gt; If you traded Russell Westbrook for Goran Dragic, Victor Oladipo, Eric Bledsoe, Jrue Holiday, etc... I think OKC would have more wins right now "
"""Russell Westbrook with a career high 16 offensive rebounds and Carmelo Anthony with 63 missed shots"""
"&gt;If you traded Russell Westbrook for Goran Dragic, Victor Oladipo, Eric Bledsoe, Jrue Holiday, etc... I think OKC would have more wins right now because they would allow Melo and PG to play their game instead of watch Russell's game.  Nephew..."

"&gt; In every year since 2012, one advanced metric has correctly predicted the NBA’s MVP. The player who finished first in Value Over Replacement Player each of the past six years, from Kevin Durant to James to Steph Curry to Russell Westbrook, has also gone on to win the MVP.  Yeah who even cares about history before then. In fact let's retroactively take away Iverson's 2000-2001 MVP and give it to VORP leader Steve Francis."
You don’t trade Russell Westbrook over Reggie Jackson lmfao. That let’s me know that you didn’t actually watch those Thunder teams.
"Agreed but the reason is the following season Harden's team was a huge disappointment and Harden showed the worst defensive effort of his career meanwhile Stephen Curry had arguably the greatest offensive season of all time and led the Warriors to the all time regular season wins record.   Rockets fans would've gotten laughed off Reddit if they claimed Harden deserved 2015 MVP, which is unfair because the MVP is a single season award. But people will carry the discussion into the following season and try to discount the MVP if he's not doing as well as the previous season, a la Russell Westbrook this year. "
CP3 went 30-15 without Blake Griffin in 2016. There's been a hair of slippage(particularly on defense) the past 2 years but my guess is he can still do it   The list to me is   Without question:   LeBron  Durant   Curry   Harden   Very likely:   Kawhi Leonard   Likely:   Chris Paul   Definitely within the realm of possibility:   Giannis   Anthony Davis   Russell Westbrook   Other category worth mentioning:   Rudy Gobert----him alone can anchor a top defense if you can avoid having a bottom level offense it's probably enough   Dame and Kyrie Irving  Victor Oladipo   Joel Embiid(look at his on/off data even when it's him without Simmons)  Jimmy Butler: probably not enough for 50 quite but good god was that an abomination of a supporting cast he carried to the playoffs last year
"&gt;Outlet passes are a lot harder than Russ just outrunning everyone  Yes, an outlet pass which is taught in the like 5th and 6th grade basketball is harder than Russell Westbrook outrunning everybody. JFC, these arguments have gotten even dumber in the year since he won. "
Are we gonna trust a team that has Russell Westbrook as their main creator?
"Assists used to be more for guards and rebounds were more for forwards and centers. The difficulty in point guards getting triple doubles is due to the inability to get 10 rebounds. Nowadays, there are more 3-point shots being taken which results in balls bouncing farther away and therefore rebounds much more often being caught by guards. This is why we see more triple doubles, because guards much more easily get rebounds. The pace of the game is also a big factor. Notice that not many centers get triple doubles because the fact that assists are mainly for guards hasn’t really changed much.  It also helps that the guys getting all these triple doubles are literally like point forwards, they have really good height and/or hops and they also can handle the ball and pass the ball extremely well. Guys like Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook are like the perfect triple double specimen, great passers that very simply reach 10 assists who are also tall and quick enough to get up for boards and track down missed 3 pointers."
russell westbrook is a K/D/A player
"We've got a sample size of almost 3 full seasons of Russell Westbrook-led teams now, under two different coaches and 3 distinct sets of supporting players. Every time, he gets crazy individual stats but his team has never broken 48 wins. One missed playoffs, one first round gentleman's sweep, and a probable 6-seed this year. Westbrook isn't a ""problem"", but he definitely hasn't shown he can lead a top 10 NBA team."
"Russell ""Michael Cage"" Westbrook"
"I acknowledged that Russell had MVP stats. Wilt did too. My point is that team record was obviously a factor. I mean if you were going for a pure stats approach, wouldn't you think 50 and 25 would win easily?  And why are you comparing the 1962 season numbers to Harden and Westbrook? Again, my point is about the criteria that have generally gone towards answering the question ""who is the MVP?"" "
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there.  Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared.  It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy.""  My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."
"Not to the extent that Russell stays back, sags into the paint to grab the boards. In his most recent 18 rebound game they literally stood there on a FT miss and let him just grab it when they could have got the rebound. I'm not saying other people don't box out so players can get rebounds. I'm saying that Westbrook and his teammates do it to another level which is obvious. If you don't see that then you don't know what you are talking about. "
"If stats won Russell Westbrook MVP last year, they should win LeBron MVP this year. "
"&gt;Whose to say he's guarding shooters anyways?  You are saying Russell Westbrook, your PG who defends guards, isn't guarding shooters...? You are arguing that perhaps Rudy Gobert and DJ are guarding more shooters?   What if he's playing defense so well that players aren't shooting over him?  Seriously...?  &gt;What if he's playing the passing lanes instead (he's up there in deflections and steals, I'd say comfortably top 5 in both stats).  He's not top 5 in either, this year or last (he's close though). And I don't see how that would be a trade off with contesting shots? Rebounds is a more direct trade off with contested shots.  It's a trade off the Thunder are okay making, but that doesn't mean we need to pretend it doesn't happen or that it doesn't influence his rebounding numbers.   "
Bill Russell also averaged 19 and 23 and Wilt averaged 50 points. Both would easily win mvp unanimously over both Westbrook and Harden
"Yeah harden is going to win, I think cavs fans see that. After all, winning more games is more important than playing more games, even if one of them won more games by adding a star PG while the other led his team in points, assists, rebounds, and games played. Lebron might be more valuable to his team and on a real contender, but he’s no Russell Westbrook. Clearly harden is the mvp. It’s not been up for debate for months."

"He’s also only the 8th player to ever average 16/8/8  The other players in history to do this are Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, James Harden and Russell Westbrook "
"The only player who is definitively better than Westbrook is LeBron James. Russell absolutely belongs on the same elite tier as Harden, Curry, Durant, Giannis, and Davis. "
"Al Horford = Russell Westbrook confirmed, thank you"
"Ya know most of the thread about G-League salaries increasing focused on ""fuck the NCAA"" and about young guys skipping college but I really don't think it's going to make much of a dent on that. Hopefully it becomes a viable option for guys who truly do not want to go to school but first of all there's only 400 spots and the NBA is not going to want it exclusively filled with guys they can't call up (under current rules) and wouldn't be able to contribute anyway if their backup point guard went down. There's thousands of NCAA scholarships compared to 400 G-League spots and there's always going to be later bloomers like Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Kawhii Leonard who weren't immediately on the NBA radar.  So maybe it goes from the 1-2 guys that are skipping the college path right now to maybe 10-15 which is great if it works out for them! But it's not an immediate system overhaul and even then there's still going to be top guys who opt to go to college where they can choose where they can play (instead of being forced to move to Reno or Sioux Falls), possibly close to home, in front of screaming crowds. 6 months ain't that long to wait for a pay day especially when there's potentially millions down the road vs $35K."

Shot better from 3 than Russell Westbrook this year.
"&gt;The floor has opened up. Giants such as Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar can’t dominate. Human-sized speedboats such as Harden, Curry and Russell Westbrook have taken control. And we like that.  Really disagree with this part of the article, there's almost nothing more exciting to me than watching a dominant big put a team on his back and decimate. A LeFuckYou three to steal a lead or a Skyfucker from just past the half court is exciting, but watching Shaq muscle his way through 3 defenders, dunk on them and then stare them down as he jogs back gets me hyped like nothing else "
"Like you said, a lot of people (like me) agreed with him.  There were days when like the half the front page was some inane quote from Steven Adams, Russell Westbrook, or Evan Turner.  We don't need a post with every ""hilarious"" quote from a post-practice media session on a random weekday in November.      I think a quote like OP's is worthy of a post because it's the playoffs, and it's an interesting (non-meme) quote.  But I would much rather have the rule in place and miss out on a couple posts like this to avoid dozens and dozens of quote posts a week during the season."
"From the article: &gt;Remember, when the three came into the NBA in 1979-80, it was considered heresy by many. Now we can’t imagine basketball without it. The floor has opened up. Giants such as Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar can’t dominate. Human-sized speedboats such as Harden, Curry and Russell Westbrook have taken control. And we like that.  &gt;A four-point line — say an arc near halfcourt — would open up the game even more. And imagine the crazy comeback possibilities. A game would never be over until the final horn.  &gt;When you think about it, why even have an eight-second halfcourt rule? The violation is never called. Why not five seconds, to make pressing defense a real factor?  &gt;Indeed, why have a halfcourt line at all?  "
"1) Harden 2) LeBron 3) Giannis 4) Anthony Davis 5) Steph Curry (missed a lot of games, but you can clearly see how much he impacts their team when he's out) 6) Lamarcus Aldridge (not saying he's a top 7 player, but his impact on the spurs was undeniable this year) 7) Damian lillard 8) Victor Oladipo 9) Russell Westbrook 10) Jimmy Butler   Really wanted to include Gobert, he'd probably be 11 or 12 on this list for me"

"I love Russell Westbrook. Westbrook can get to the rack like it's nobody's business. He instills a sort of distinct fear into the big men that are assigned to him. I personally love the way that Westbrook is able to penetrate his opponents. Time and time again, they put up a fight, but their attempts prove to be futile as they struggle to stop him from getting inside. I always likened the determination in Westbrook’s eyes to a large stallion seeing a fresh pile of rolled oats after a long day on the racetrack. He just can’t wait to dig in. But the best part about Westbrook? He always attacks the hole strong, finishing hard, and with authority. You just *know* he’s gonna put that triple in your double."

Hell, I remember the Thunder having leads with him on the floor and them disappearing when he went to the bench.  |||Shoo|Shoo|Shoo|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|FG%|3P%|FT%|MP|PTS|TRB|AST|STL|BLK| |1|Russell Westbrook|.388|.265|.800|38.9|37.4|11.6|10.8|2.4|0.4|"
Russell Westbrook is the Drake of the NBA.  Everyone on his team suffers statistically while he takes all the opportunities to make himself look good.
"Is Russell Westbrook still young?  Isn't he the same age as Steph Curry?  Nobody refers to him as ""Young Steph Curry."""
"I really like Russell Westbrook. I just think he needs to slow down a bit and not force his game so much. Sometimes it feels like he just gets in his head too much and wants to do everything. With the right coach, he can really clean up his game and improve his efficiency. "
"Ok sure. I'll take Yao's body, but with Russell Westbrook's speed and quickness.   He has Andre Miller's low post moves, shoots from outside like Steph, and shoots from midrange like dirk. He finishes at the rim like Westbrook. He rebounds like Jason Kidd. He handles the ball like Allen Iverson.  And he has Kevin Garnett's demeanor."
Kawhi actually finished 3rd. It's was 1. Russell Westbrook 2. James Harden 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Lebron James 5. Isaiah Thomas
"&gt; Is Russell Westbrook the point guard version of Josh Smith?  That one actually gave me pause, ever so briefly"
&gt;Is Russell Westbrook the current Jerry Stackhouse?  &gt;Should the Thunder waive Carmelo Anthony?  &gt;Have both Simmons and Mitchell already surpassed Westbrook as better players this season?  &gt;Westbrook trade value in the offseason?  &gt;Is Porzingis' ceiling LaMarcus Aldridge?  &gt;Is Russell Westbrook the point guard version of Josh Smith?  &gt;Andrew Wiggins vs Andrea Bargnani  &gt;Where is Elon Musk's car attached exactly?  &gt;[Request] The egg drink from Napoleon Dynamite  OP's post history

"He’s like a shitty version of Russell Westbrook. He tries to do everything at the expense of his teammates. In the regular season, he had plenty of bad games and it did cost us some wins but he was generally pretty good and he won us a few games with that type of play as well. In the playoffs, when he hasn’t been playing well at all, it’s not the time for that type of play.   The most egregious thing tonight was probably the pick and roll with Giannis. We ran it quite a bit and Giannis was open on his way to the rim, but Bledsoe just absolutely would not pass the ball to him. Once he was headed to the rim he was taking the shot, even when he had two guys on him and basically no chance of actually scoring. That type of play is directly responsible for two of our losses this series, he just doesn’t know when to stop shooting or when to take smarter shots."
My life is trash and it's reddits fault. And Russell Westbrook. And Trump. And the mods.
