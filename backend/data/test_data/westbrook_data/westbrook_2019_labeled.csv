gt Kyrie Irving LeBron James Russell Westbrook are all more entertaining to me  I can dig it  I definitely respect that  I guess it all depends on what style you prefer to watch  Great shooting will always be on top for me  I think its the satisfaction factor,1
Kyrie Irving LeBron James Russell Westbrook are all more entertaining to me the problem with Steph to me is that he is entertaining to watch but sometimes a lot of his highlights are threes where he just catch and shoots off a screen which I find boring,0

i think anyone averaging a triple double is impressive irrespective of russell westbrook,1
The only reason Harden is sometimes listed as a shooting guard is because hes taller than all our other guards If youre saying he cant be a point guard because hes taller then Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook then you probably need to rethink the way you watch basketball,0
True still early in the season but it will happen and its frustrating GSW will be doing it Russell Westbrook Joel Embiid lots more to come,-1
Well it depends how your team is constructed Obviously if youre the Knicks or Hornets youd wanna draft Russell Westbrook instead of Draymond Green If youre a 201314 Warriors team and already have a first and second option you take Draymond Green,1
Its funny because Russell Westbrook is doing the same thing and no one is complaining,0

At 39 Jordan was taking 186 SPG for 20 PPG I think thats pretty good for an old fogie  For context Klay Thompson this past season averaged 180 SPG for 215 PPG Thats just a hair under your standard And hes only 28 Russell Westbrook was worse 202 SPG for 229 PPG,1
Seems a bit of a stretch to compare Westbrook and Bill Russell in terms of offense either Lebron is much better than both of them,1
