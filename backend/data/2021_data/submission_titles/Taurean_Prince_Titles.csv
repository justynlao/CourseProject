"[Andrews] Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert, Rodi Kurucs and Taurean Prince -- all part of the James Harden deal -- are all now OUT tonight against the Knicks, Steve Nash says. They are not in Madison Square Garden."
"Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince did not practice, per Bickerstaff. Trade is still held up by a player who hasn't passed a physical. It has to be LeVert, hes the only one left. Could the trade fall through if LeVert has an undisclosed injury that makes the Pacers not want to trade him for Oladipo?"

[Moore] Was interesting to hear Taurean Prince explain how chronic his ankle injury has been over the past few years. Prince had surgery this summer and said that has made it so he can walk around in the mornings without pain. Says his ankle is back.
"The Cavs traded Taurean Prince and a 2nd rounder for $18M of Ricky Rubio. The Lakers traded Kuzma, KCP, Trez, and a 1st rounder for $44M of Russ."
