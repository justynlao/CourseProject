[Highlight] Fantastic steal and hustle by Alex Caruso to retrieve the loose ball and dish it off to Devontae Cacok for the finish:
"[Charania] Former Lakers forward Devontae Cacok will sign with the Brooklyn Nets, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium . The 6-foot-7 forward will go to training camp and compete for an open two-way spot."
[Nets] The Brooklyn Nets have waived forward Devontae Cacok
"[Charania] The Spurs claimed former Lakers/Nets forward Devontae Cacok off waivers and will convert Cacok to a two-way contract, per sources."
