[Shiller] Steve Kerr announces that Kevon Looney will start at center tonight in place of James Wiseman
"[Slater] Steph Curry, James Wiseman and Kevon Looney will return tonight against the Knicks. Warriors haven't had a traditional center the last 10 games. Looney will start."
[Slater] Sources: Kevon Looney will be re-evaluated in two weeks for his sprained left ankle. So sounds like he'll probably miss around seven games. Expectation within Warriors is James Wiseman will return sooner. There aren't immediate plans to add another center.
