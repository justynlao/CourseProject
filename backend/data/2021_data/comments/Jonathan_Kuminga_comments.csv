Bj and Davion way too high there bud    Cade Cunningham   Evan Mobley   Jalen Green  Jalen Suggs   Jonathan Kuminga   Moses Moody   Keon Johnson   Jaden Springer  Jalen Johnson    Franz Wagner
"Don’t sleep on Franz Wagner. I would take him higher than anybody you have after Jonathan Kuminga on your board. He is top 10 on my board for sure . The combination of versatility, playmaking, defense and scouring on the wing is to valuable in today’s nba. He will at least be a high level role player!"
"If Jonathan Kuminga ends up in Cleveland and hits his ceiling, the Cavaliers are going to have a very nice young core."
48% chance the Thunder get Jonathan Kuminga as a result of the trade.
"if Steph and Klay are healthy they have a great chance. that's the two greatest shooters the NBA has ever seen. they always have a chance. James Wiseman and Jordan Poole should be much improved as well, not saying they're gonna be all-stars but they should be solid contributors. Andrew Wiggins is much better suited to being a third option, and Kelly Oubre is much better suited to a 6th man role if they decide to resign him. the Dubs 2nd round pick from this year Justinian Jessup is doing really well in the Australian league averaging 15 ppg and shooting 40% from 3 on high volume, he'll be coming over next season and could be a decent bench player.   all that said the Dubs can potentially have two lottery picks to add to the bench as well. if they added a backup wing and backup pg in the lotto like Jonathan Kuminga or Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell they could have a deep bench."
"Barring a direction change based on the new ownership, the team seems to be barreling forward with KAT + Russell as their foundation of the future. That is in part why they took Ant Man #1 over LaMelo--too much overlap between LaMelo and Russell.   With that in mind, the top picks in this draft mostly seem to present the same issue once you add Ant Man to the mix.   With all that said, wouldn't it behoove the Wolves to look at trading back to add some more immediate punch to their team? There's going to be a rebuilding team or two that desperately needs some foundational talent and is going to get unlucky in the lottery, if the Wolves could trade back to 5th-8th they could nab someone like Jonathan Kuminga, Jalen Johnson, Scottie Barnes, or Corey Kispert that would pair great with the core they already have.  Here's three potential deals I could see  A package involving Al Horford + #5  Larry Nance Jr. + #6  Marvin Bagley  + #7  These all help the Wolves get more veteran help to be more competitive in the next year (when they'll owe their pick unprotected) while still drafting a high level talent that better compliments the core they already have invested in."

"Kuminga has very high potential but he’s also super raw and Jonathan Wasserman was talking about how in the G league he played a bit selfishly - wanted to get his own shots, didn’t pass a lot unless it would lead to a nice highlight. Also shot poorly from 3.  He could absolutely be great but it’s probably gonna be a 3-4 year process"

"They already have Wiseman.  Honestly, the Warriors did the righ thing tanking in 2019-2020 and trading D'Lo for Wiggins and the T'Wolves draft pick. They will likely get another highnpick in this deep 2021 draft class.  A Jalen Suggs or Jalen Green or Jonathan Kuminga or Scottie Barnes."
"Id have to say Shaq.  Its geuninely hard enough to just find a guy who can match his measurements without factoring the athleticism factor. At least with Lebron there are a number of guys who are around his height and weight and are even mobile and athletic, even guys like Jonathan Kuminga and Scottie Barnes in this draft are comparable if you just look at their bodies. They are just *nowhere* near as skilled and coordinated as Lebron, but if you were to put Luka Doncic's skills into one of their bodies you'd end up with a Lebron like player. While I think that should count as being a freak of nature, for the purpose of your comparision it doesn't count.  Same thing with Giannis. There are other near 7 foot lanky freaks in the league, the difference is he worked insanely hard on his body and improved his skillset massivley to become a player archetype that has never been seen before. But he didn't come into the league as a chiseled 7 footer.  Shaq is just so absurdly big and strong. Its unbelievable that a guy his height and weight posessed that much agility and coordination, the dude would dance like a 5'5 breakdancer despite being 7-1 and pushing 400 pounds. On top of that he avoided major injury and had an 18 year career playing 1421 games (regular season and playoffs) which is unheard of for players his size"

"Kai Jones and Alperen Sengun will both fall outside of the top 15.     Jonathan Kuminga will fall at least to the Warriors at #7.     Rockets/Cavs will take Green/Suggs leaving Mobley to the Raptors, who will win a ROY in Toronto."

"Where does he fit in?   Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Kuminga, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chume Okeke, Mo Bamba.   That's before adding in their 8th pick, looks like Franz Wagner currently.   Honestly, I think they should be looking to wheel and deal Harris and/or Ross."

Key word hyped. He had a talented skill set and potential and he has certainly done everything possible to try to position himself as the #1 pick but there are also players with enormous upside like Evan Mobley and Jonathan Kuminga that teams may be more willing to take a flier on

"If this was 100% Healthy Porzingis and Year 4 Wiseman, Year 3 Jonathan Kuminga, and the 2nd Round Pick, the Wolves may consider.  Otherwise, no."
Scottie Barnes and Jonathan Kuminga both read to me as Raptors type forwards but they seem to be pretty top heavy at both positions as is. I think if he were to fall to them best case scenario is Suggs. I think they’ll just ride Lowry and Vanvleet out and eventually transition into a Suggs - Trent Jr backcourt when they’re ready.
"The draft is a 4-5 player class with the best prospects being Cade, Jalen Green, Evan Mobley, Jalen Suggs, and Jonathan Kuminga/Scottie Barnes.  I believe Cade is 1A, and Jalen Green is 1B. This draft has a lot of wings + premier role players in the back end of the draft, and surplus of vertastile bigs. But if you watch Beal/Lavine/Brandon Roy, you can see a lot of similarities in his game. Super advanced scoring feel, his athleticism also takes him over the top, dude just glides when he finishes.  The dude scoring is just effortless, and he averaged 17.9 PPG against grown professional G-League players at 19.      [The man is just money, look at him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8YWVkr8D6w&amp;ab_channel=CPH2K)"
Jalen Green and Jonathan Kuminga off the top of my head.
"I have been aware of Jonathan kuminga for 3 years, and extensively read up on all of the top prospects.  I know who he is, and know that he is considered boom or bust (which is completely worthless analysis btw). But that still doesn’t explain why posting a g league stat line proves anything to anyone"
Anthony Bennet/Dion Waiters/Jonathan Kuminga   Sounds about right. I sign off on this pick!

tbh jalen green and jonathan kuminga are probly the only prospects that actually played the best possible competition
Scottie Barnes or Jonathan Kuminga don’t look at my flair
There's seems to be a definite top 6 in this draft.  Cade Cunningham - Evan Mobley - Jalen Green - Jalem Suggs - Jonathan Kuminga - Scottie Barnes
"In my unbiased opinion, I think Detroit should look at prospects Jonathan Kuminga and Franz Wagner to put in that roster, along with someone like mo bamba, instead of Cade Cunningham"
"&gt; Always making the playoffs with low-mid 30 wins  Idk why people keep saying this, we've made the playoffs exactly twice since Dwight - last year and the year before. Everyone acts like we've been the 8th seed for a decade. It's bizzare. Even before the bubble playoffs (so literally ONE playoff appearance) people were saying the same thing...  The other years we didn't just miss out of the playoffs either, we were straight bad (bottom 5 every year except 2016 (11th, still bad) and the playoff appearances) and then unlucky with draft slots and terrible trades by the previous FO. If you look at our drafts since Dwight, we've always moved down or stayed put and just out of reach of franchise talent.  https://i.redd.it/ncc5bvz3rx671.jpg  * 2013 - Oladipo (good pick but bad trade by previous GM desperate to make moves to keep his job)  * 2014 - AG - we miss out on Embiid by one pick because we move down in the draft.  * 2015 - Mario - we miss out on Porzingis by one pick * 2016 - Pick becomes Sabonis, but traded by previous GM desperate to make moves to keep his job * 2017 - Jonathan Isaac - good pick, but we miss out on the PG we desperately need (Fox) by one slot, again because we move down * 2018 -  Bamba - we miss out on the PG we desperately need (Trae) by one slot, again because we move down * 2019 - Chuma - Great pick * 2020 - Cole - Good pick * 2021 - We probably take Kuminga, missing out on the perimeter scorer we desperately need (Green/Suggs/Cade) by one slot, because we move down...again.  It's silly to try and say retrospectively they should have drafted a Devin Booker (13th pick) or an MPJ (14th pick) or SGA (11th pick) with a 5th pick. We've simply been unlucky and haven't had any franchise talent simply fall into our laps like some of these other teams. The trades made by the previous FO deserve the criticsm and Hennigan should have been canned much earlier, but it is what it is."
"It's not a good comparison. Cade Cunningham is widely believed to be a lock for #1, but not everyone agrees (Sam Vecenie of the Athletic)  &gt;While Cunningham is by far the most likely pick here, I don’t think we should necessarily write this in stone yet. The one thing that every person in basketball says about Troy Weaver is that he absolutely does not subscribe to group think. He said in a post-lottery presser that they’ll look at five guys and then make the best decision. It’s worth taking him at his word. After the lottery, I got texts from multiple sources that said the Pistons are also thought to be fans of Jalen Green. So look, I’m mocking Cunningham here. Pistons fans who want Cunningham shouldn’t have a meltdown based off this. But this isn’t like 2019 when Zion Williamson was a done deal and everyone in the basketball industry knew it. Cunningham is considered the likely choice here. He’s the overwhelming favorite. But everyone seems to be acting like this is unequivocally a done deal, and I’m not totally convinced of that as of right now, an hour after the lottery.  Most people have Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley at similar levels, with some adding Jonathan Kuminga to that mix. Since yesterday, Rockets fans have generally be in favor of drafting Jalen Green, followed by Evan Mobley, and Jalen Suggs a distant third."
"I know it frustrating but Jonathan kuminga has the potential to be really special. 6’8”ish (although some sites say he’s 6’6”) but has the potential to be a great two way player with the right development. Him (potentially), okeke, Fultz and Isaac is not a bad core"

"I'm trying to point out that it's *not* that easy to compile a collection of useful future assets.   Yeah, it's *even more* difficult to put together a championship-caliber team out of those assets (some will turn into a pumpkin at midnight. You'll pay the wrong guy, or somebody will get hurt, or somebody will leave in FA, or you'll draft a bust.)  But it is not *easy* to collect assets.   Detroit was terrible this year. It's been 14 years since they had a 45-win season. They have two playoff appearances in the last 12 seasons. They're short future picks. They don't have much cap room this offseason. They have some intriguing young players, but nobody that looks like a future star.  That's really common.   Your team's not any good, and you're missing future picks, and you've got a full cap sheet.   What's the Cavs' path to relevance? They're never going to have cap space. They don't have anybody who actually looks like the #1 guy on a contender. They've been fucking *awful* for the last three years. What's the path? Hope Jonathan Kuminga is a lot better than he looked this year? Hope they win the lottery *again?*   What about the Pacers? How are they going to get off of this treadmill of mediocrity? They probably won't keep both their FAs this year (would make them a tax team)...They could *try* to blow it up, or they could try to keep making moves on the margins until they're good enough to lose in round 2...but there is no path to a legitimate contender right now.  That's a whole division. Milwaukee and a pile of crap."
"I don't blame him.  This whole one and done ""student athlete"" thing is an insult to everyone's intelligence.   Everyone knows these guys aren't there for an education. I don't understand the value in even pretending that these guys are actually getting one.  I can't wait until all the best prospects just go the Jalen Green/Jonathan Kuminga route and just go to the G-league."
"&gt; “So the more likely path — and the path that I think, as an owner, I feel most comfortable with, quite frankly — is to bridge the gap to the future,” Lacob said. “We’ve got three or four contracts and big players that are still in their early 30s, still have quite a bit of time to go, especially in this day and age. If we can kind of have a Wiseman and a Kuminga and a Moody and a Poole (help in the meantime). They don’t have to be awesome next year. With a great investment in our player development staff, we just want them to show great potential.”  [Source](https://theathletic.com/2742823/2021/07/31/exclusive-joe-lacob-discusses-jonathan-kuminga-pick-and-his-win-now-develop-now-plan-for-the-warriors/?amp). I don't know if you're being sarcastic because while it seems clear to me (based on what the FO has both said and done), I know the idea that they should be trading for a win-now player is popular on r/nba."

"Nah. That ain't it. It's just that GSW fans are loaded to the tits with young bandwagon fans so there is a disproportionate number of posts about Jonathan Kuminga relative to what he's shown so far. There's more upvoted posts about Kuminga than Cade Cunningham, why is that?  Combine that with the fact that I actually watched him play last year, so I feel like I'm in a good position to talk some basketball with some real fans. Raptors fans are too high on Barnes and consider him the next coming of Giannis. It's also a lazy comparison.  Anyway, you can carry on getting baited for clicks by the beat writers in The Bay. As, I said, he'll be a good player and has a good head on his shoulders. But if you think his game has shown the capability to be a 2xDPOY, you're on several."
"Jonathan Kuminga ambled past a horde of nephews as he surveyed the spectacle of the offseason on r/nba. Cascades of shitposts. The off-color 'shipping of Jordan impersonators. Paul Pierce posing with twerkers.  ""I'm too old for this sub,"" Kuminga said."
"So Nike got Cade Cunningham, Jonathan Kuminga, and now Scottie Barnes. Adidas got Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, and Evan Mobley already.  That just leaves Josh Giddey as the only sneaker deal-less of the Top 7"
You can't win with logic here. You're the bad man for coming at a franchise for pacifying their weak azz stars. (Yeah KAT is as good as Andre Drummond fluff stats on poor teams). I would've traded Kat to the Knicks for both of the firsts this year and they keep Jonathan Kuminga (hope I spell it right) plus them picks u got a deep young team. But now they got two former all stars mentoring Anthony Edwards on how to fall off.

I still think he’s gonna be a great player and 3-6 are pretty much interchangeable to me, plus that’s where I had him before the draft anyway. I also think Cade or Jalen Green going #1 would be fine"

"It's honestly not surprising how awesome Jonathan Kuminga has looked.  Actually, IIRC we were both on the same mindset that JK was the best BPA at the 6th spot, and I said it was basically set in stone not drafting him would be a huge mistake.  &gt;I just don’t get it, he clearly is good at basketball, he’s not some uncoordinated bumbling doofus, he was playing against grown professionals on the worst team in the league and took a ton of shots he probably shouldn’t have been taking. Dude is great at drawing contact, has shown the ability to create his own shot from anywhere on the floor, he’s just an awesome prospect IMO. Barnes has way more question marks imo, I’d take Kuminga 10/10 over him, but I also totally understand why teams like Barnes.   &gt;   &gt;What’s the argument for anyone else over Kuminga? Sengun is the only one I can make an argument for, and he might not even go top 10. Bouk has the same problems as Kuminga except he’s older and has lesser physical tools, Moody is way more limited, Mitchell is older and lower upside, who’s the guy that’s going over Kuminga at 5 or 6  [https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA\_Draft/comments/oqxo2y/hedo\_on\_a\_mission\_he\_predicts\_sengun\_at\_8/h6fi9cu?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/oqxo2y/hedo_on_a_mission_he_predicts_sengun_at_8/h6fi9cu?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  To be honest, I really don't understand why OKC chose Giddey over JK. I wonder if it's something we'll look back from years from now on. GSW lucked out drafting someone like JK and Moses Moody though, they got two excellent two-way wings that could definitely help fit and establish their death line up 2.0"
Poku (not ironically)  And Jonathan Kuminga.  I really believe it
"Kuminga, hachimura, Jonathan issac, lamelo ball. Lamelo and kuminga all nba potential. Issac dpoy and all star potential, he gotta get out of Orlando ASAP tho.

"&gt; Jonathan Kuminga (GSW) possible steal at 7  I know we live in a era of overhype over everything where people feel they're out there to ""prove DOUBTERS wrong 😤"", but I don't know if I'd call a very exciting seventh pick a *steal*. It's still a very high pick in a draft that seems sneakily loaded with good talent. Like if I remember correctly he fell off from the top 5 on some mocks - which are fun but bs anyway - in the weeks leading up to the draft because nobody really knows how to value performance in the G League, but still no one ever denied (DOUBTED????) he's very talented.   If there's a steal in the mid-high first round I'd say Sengun. Dude literally fell in Houston's lap. Who knows how he's gonna fare in the NBA, but inside center's value is at an all-time low :-/"

"I dunno, $100,000 is a good chunk of money, and a lot of these guys come from really poor backgrounds where they really need the money right away. If he's good enough to make it in the NBA, he'll get his chance at the real big money either way. And if he's not, then more exposure from college isn't necessarily a good thing.  Put it this way: would you rather be BJ Boston or Jonathan Kuminga right now?  Edit: that said, it is really strange that he picked this league over the G-League or an overseas one."
"In addition, Jalen Green and Jonathan Kuminga going top 7 in the draft shows that the Ignite can maintain and increase a high school player’s NBA prospects."

"&gt;  and looking at our 2015/16 squads, we had Barbosa/Livingston/Iguodala/Speights/Ezeli coming off the bench with some David Lee, Ian Clark etc.  &gt; The only player who could be on that level next year is Poole, if he keeps developing. JTA is a good piece but he's more of a Draymond and needs people to work with. We also don't have a big as talented or important as Bogut  Poole? Are you fucking serious? You also have Iguodala, Otto Porter Jr., Moses Moody, Jonathan Kuminga, Bjelica, and Looney. That’s very comparable to what you had then."

"The Golden State Warriors are the perfect team for a Leeds United fan. First of all, both teams have gold and blue as their colors. This means you can be aesthetically consistent in the clubs you support. Also Leeds United gear can double as Warriors gear because they’re the same colors.     Theres also an interesting San Francisco connection between the clubs. The San Francisco 49ers (NFL) own 37% of Leeds United and the Warriors are also based in San Francisco. This would be an interesting thread of continuity between teams you support.    In terms of basketball, the Warriors have one of the most entertaining players of all time in Steph Curry. This is a great time to become a Warriors fan because they’re coming off a disappointing season where they missed the playoffs (so you wouldn’t be glory chasing), but are in a solid position to bounce back with one of their best players in Klay Thompson returning after missing two entire seasons with injuries.    Speaking of Klay, he’s also a very exciting player to watch and has one of the hottest hands in the league. He holds the NBA record for most points in a quarter with 37. Make sure to watch a video of that if you haven’t seen it already. He’s also an interesting personality off the court (look up Klay on a boat).    Finally, the Warriors are a solid team to root for because they have a mix of veteran players and young promising players. Their core is getting up there in age and has a few more seasons to contend for a championship before they pass the torch to guys like James Wiseman and Jonathan Kuminga. This mix of talent means that the Warriors can be competitive for many years to come."
Acting like all these guys aren't gonna take less to play with Jonathan Kuminga.
"""TLDR: Unless a player at the level of a Beal, Dame, PG, Kawhi, etc, requests a trade and says the Warriors are one of their preferred destination, we will be keeping James Wiseman, Jonathan Kuminga, and Mody Mooses""   I'm not a big fan of Lacob, but this doesn't seem like an unreasonable position to have."
"Woj doesn’t have sources? MTII also:    *They were ready to take Arkansas' Moses Moody at No. 7. But as the whispers suggested, Jonathan Kuminga, once considered a top-five pick, was sliding a bit. When Kuminga fell to the Warriors, they went ahead and jumped on the good fortune. The picks of Josh Primo and Ziaire Williams pushed some of their desire players down the board. Moody fell right to them. Based on their board, they essentially got two top-seven picks.*"

I'm partial to Jonathan Kuminga due to his tools despite his shooting.   For the Warriors I think there's growing talk of drafting Josh Giddey out of Australia.

"He isn't even in the league yet, but Jonathan Kuminga. Supposedly a top 5 pick right now in the draft. He doesn't really do anything well and is 'only' a great athlete, not elite. I wouldn't touch him in the top 10 personally. A lot of 'ifs' need to go his way for him to be a good player."

"Yeah, good for you, don't give in Andrew - Jonathan Kuminga  probably"
Fair enough.  Michael Jordan and Jonathan Kuminga?
Kum &amp; Go should do a sponsor deal with Jonathan Kuminga. It’s the greatest opportunity for both if them.
"He also compared Jonathan Kuminga to Jordan Bell and then when he thought the microphones were muted he laughed and said ""hurr hurr, you like that Jordan Bell (comparison)?"""
And your 2028 MVP…. Jonathan “Kum Bucket” Kuminga!
"The Warriors traded Robert Parish for the right to draft Joe Barry Carroll ahead of Kevin McHale.  That kinda hurts less than ""traded a player we got in trade for a guy we would have lost in free agency if we didn't trade him for a solid two-way wing and also Jonathan Kuminga"""
"James Wiseman definitely. His biggest problem was on the defensive side, as raw as he was he still got buckets on the back of his physical gifts and he also shows the potential to have a real jump shot.   Jordan Poole, the Warriors 2019 28th pick, took a massive leap from his terrible rookie season. In his rookie season injuries forced him into heavy playing time he wasn't ready for and he put up some of the worst numbers in the league for any player getting regular minutes.   His shooting splits his rookie year were 33/28/80, contributing 8.8 points a game. He reportedly is one of the hardest workers on the roster and the next season, especially in the back half, he was a really effective NBA player and a much needed offensive outlet next to Curry.  That 2nd year his splits improved dramatically, 43/35/88, scoring went up to 12ppg while playing (slightly) less minutes. He had some great games and some great highlights. In the 2nd to last game of the season the Warriors sat Curry, Draymond and Wiggins. [Poole dropped 38 on the Pelicans.](https://youtu.be/xAGf5WjekW8)  Then this season they drafted probably the most athletic young player in the 2021 draft, Jonathan Kuminga. He doesn't have a jump shot (though the form looks OK), he's pretty raw but he has tremendous upside. He also has shown a little bit of an ability to pass, which for a guy like him who will likely be drawing help defenders, is an important ability.   [This was the Summer League highlight that probably shows off his potential the best.](https://youtu.be/mYdEFa95r2I) Crosses up his defender, takes off from right inside the free throw line, launches, hangs, and throws down a monster jam.   Finally there is Moses Moody, who the Warriors selected with the 14th pick. A young player with good length, Moody projects to be a good to elite shooter in the league, has the length to defend multiple positions, and most importantly for the Dubs right now has a natural feel for the game. He's only got average athleticism but he's no Duncan Robinson. Last season showed the Warriors how important it is to have guys who are feared outside the 3pt line, that early season lineup was barely middle of the pack **offensively** when Curry was on the floor (which is crazy) and historically bad when Curry was off the floor.  Poole, Wiseman, Kuminga, and Moody can become great players. I think the Warriors *nailed* the 2021 draft. A great high ceiling player and a more win now player who still has a good ceiling. They brought on some of the best player development coaches in the world this off season, including Kenny Atkins, Jama Mahlalela  and DeJan Milojević.   These young players are all on long rookie deals and those kinds of high upside cost controlled contracts are so important for a team like the Warriors who already have a veteran core making big money.   People are severely underestimating what the Warriors can accomplish over the next several season."
Basically Jonathan Kuminga
"&gt;If Andrew Wiggins went back as the best current player and the money to make the deal work, the reward for Philly would, or could, be some combination of 2020 No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman, and 2021 lottery picks Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody.  lmao?!"
I made a case a little while ago how Jonathan Kuminga would be a good basketball player but shows nothing of Kawhi Leonard and that the comparisons by GSW beat writers were lazy.   And I learned that day that the GSW sub has the most subscribers of any on Reddit.
Jonathan Kuminga.
"The wolves were always going to have to pay to get rid of Wiggins, the end of that contract is atrocious. Most people thought they'd have to pay way more than Jonathan Kuminga to get Wiggins off the team and make room financially for players that play up to their contracts. Wiggins is solid, if he was getting $20 mil a year any team would want him. He's not worth $33 mil a year."
Jonathan Kuminga
if I had to build an entire team and I had no other pieces I would only just go for players with development. I'd just take a swing on anyone who could become a super star and figure out the rest and just let them play. There's no reason to draft for fit at this stage just figure out what you have  So I would take  G Cade  G Jalen Green  G/F Josh Giddey  F Jonathan Kuminga  C Evan Mobley   Bench   G - Jalen Suggs  G Bones Hyland  G - Josh Primo  F - Scottie Barnes  F Jalen Johnson  F Ziaire Williams   C Alperen Sengun
"Jonathan Kuminga will be about as good as Stanley Johnson has been.   The Boston Celtics form the next dynasty as they acquire a disgruntled KAT or Lillard. Tatum is on a superstar trajectory and Brown is right there with him. Both guys will be so insanely good and are playing the statistically rarest and most valuable positions in the league.   Sure they might have a few more disappointments in the playoffs, but like Lowry, or more aptly- Giannis players tend to shake that off and just have a godly postseason or two."

Jonathan Kumbuckets Kuminga
"It def shouldn’t be used in a convo lol. It’s a nickname that’s fun to explain because the story behind it being what Chinese nba fans called him is funny, but let’s be real it’s a shit nickname, any nickname you can’t say on network television isn’t a good one (Just like a certain Jonathan Kuminga nickname I won’t mention).  The day Richard Jefferson decides to try and say skylover on a broadcast will be the day I finally mute tv broadcasts forever"
Let's all agree to act like Jonathan kuminga doesn't exist
"&gt; bench = supporting cast  No, bench specifically refers to…the bench.   &gt; And what exactly did the Warriors do this offseason? Get back 38yo Iggy? Sign Otto Porter while losing Oubre?  Drafted Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody. Signed Otto Porter Jr, Nemanja Bjelica, and Andre Iguodala.   &gt;  No one seriously thinks Warriors got better if we don't factor in Klay yet.  They improved significantly. You can’t seriously think Oubre, Bazemore, Paschall, and Wanamaker contribute more to winning than OPJ, Moody, Kuminga, Bjelica, and Iguodala…"
"Underrated Take: Golden State drafts James Wiseman and Jonathan Kuminga on back-to-back years.  I think it would come as a surprise to many that Golden State would get a top 2 high school recruit then a top 3~4 high school recruit in back-to-back drafts because that would mean that they’d have to be really, really bad despite having Steph and Dray. Even Klay was expected to come back last season."

"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
G league ignite it's the development team owned by the NBA. Jalen Green and Jonathan Kuminga.
My short list of most impressive awesome physiques-physicality... Literally just seeing a guy moving without a ball just impressive statures nothing about play on court.  Centers Dwight Robinson Wilt  Wings Giannis Lebron Jordan  Guards Russ Rose  Honorable mention Maggete Zion  The How is that guy 18? list Ben Simmons Jonathan Kuminga Young LeBron
I seriously doubt it  You think there is a Chinese Jonathan Kuminga just hiding in a Chinese village somewhere?  I don’t
"You guys are really managing to have both the present and the future covered with the young players you've got...   Jordan Poole, Moses Moody, Jonathan Kuminga, Jonathan Wiseman"
G League might be good if you’re a Jalen Green or Jonathan Kuminga but ultimately it proved to be not beneficial for prospects like Isaiah Todd or Brandon Boston  I think as time develops there’s gonna be more prospects going to different places to showcase themselves more individually
Jonathan Kuminga is gonna dominate off the bench (when Steph sits) early in the season. During his second unit minutes he is gonna take a lot of teams by surprise. His size and athleticism is gonna overwhelm a lot of second units who won't be prepared for him.
Jonathan Kuminga will be a star.

"[Kris Weems](https://youtu.be/yJRKbkqHwCg?t=1157):   &gt;Yeah, I think when you're gonna draft a kid that size, -- and knowing that long term he's going to be bigger and stronger [and] he may grow a couple inches taller -- his versatility, because of the size gives him a chance to stay on the floor longer. So, we did talk about him playing a little bit of [the] 5. We still want him to play on the wing -- play the 3 and the 4 -- for the most part. Work on his ball handling [and] his passing. But you can be effective as a 5. Draymond Green is a Hall of Famer because he does a lot of the things that Jonathan does. So we'll be very specific about those times and what we can run [and] the packages and plays we want to put in there. But the versatility on defense is really what sets him apart  So:  1. Because they're trying to win games so Kuminga isn't going to see a ton of playing time  2. Because they want to develop him as a forward first."
"MKG was pretty mobile at first. He was considered a plus athlete as a prospect. Yes, Kuminga is more athletic than him. But that doesn't make it an awful take for a floor. Kuminga doesn't have an outside shot yet. MKG never got one.  Butler is a great defender, attacks the basket with physicality, and can playmake. I see a little of that passing from Kuminga. Despite an inconsistent outside shot, Butler is a star who can lead a team very far.  Kawhi is too good of a shooter for me to make that comparison. I mean, Jonathan is yet to approach his sophomore college shooting splits of 44/29/76."
How good would this Wolves team look with Jonathan Kuminga as the power forward? Obviously right now McDaniels is a better player in the 3-D mold but going forward it seems as though a playmaking PF that can potentially be a lockdown defender is exactly what they are missing. What Kuminga can be as a secondary playmaker to DLO would open up their offense and still maintain a high level of defense. Obviously you would go through another year of growing pains but that could potentially land another lottery pick to add to the war chest.

We'll trade them Ed Davis for Jonathan Kuminga.
Jonathan Kuminga
"If you don't move a guy demanding a trade, even if you don't like the return, you will simply lose them for nothing in free agency if they are an UFA.  When KD left the Warriors he was going to walk for nothing as an unrestricted free agent, same as he did in OKC.  He just happened to be going to a team with a young star guard looking to land a max contract, one his biggest suitors, the Wolves, didn't have the cap space to offer that ([remember the Wolves gave D'lo a helicopter ride where it was revealed he had signed w/the Warriors?\)] (https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/D-Angelo-Russell-helicopter-ride-Wolves-los-angele-14899527.php)  So the Warriors were able to offer D'lo that max he wanted, facilitated through a KD sign and trade, as the Warriors didn't have the cap space either. The Nets wanted to do right by D'lo and help him get that max and were open to the sign and trade transaction.   KD actually balked and said he wouldn't agree unless a Warriors 1st was included ([Nets hadn't even asked for that and allowed very good protections, top 20, it converted to a 2nd](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/nba-rumors-kevin-durant-demanded-warriors-give-nets-first-round-pick)).   I won't write an entire article myself here but ultimately we all know what the final result was. Warriors sent out KD, Iguodala, a lightly protected 2024 1st round pick. They then flip D'lo and ultimately end up with Andrew Wiggins, a pick they used to select Jonathan Kuminga, and they were able to get off of Wanamaker, Spellman and Evans to get out of the tax, delaying their repeater penalty by one year.   There was a lot of luck involved in this, if KD picks the Knicks instead of the Nets the Warriors wouldn't have landed any of that, or if the Wolves weren't feeling pressure to keep KAT happy and bring in one of his best friends to play with him while moving off of Wiggins, the Warriors would be left with a big hole at SF and not have a prospect like Kuminga.    It is way, way better to execute a trade when a star is leaving rather than see them walk for zero return."

"Jonathan ""Evan Mobley"" Kuminga"
Jonathan Kuminga passes the eye test. Looks like a blend of Giannis and Kawhi. He is going to be so good once Kerr figures out how to use him.
well since he went 1-3 from the line it obviously saved two points. We all know Jonathan Kuminga has never missed from beyond half-court in his entire NBA career

"You are looking at skill-based bigs as opposed to freak athletes. Giannis and Jonathan Kuminga are much better comps IMO.  Freak athletes succeed by charging headfirst into defenders during HS (where Wiseman has mostly played), so the transition to organized NBA basketball is inevitably rough for them."
Im convinced people aren't watching Jalen Green right now. Maybe he gets better in the future but he stinks right now. He and Jonathan Kuminga are the same level of project player to me. If he's not scoring he does literally nothing else.

"&gt;Ok saying they were surprised Kuminga was available at 7 does not indicate he was above Giddey on their board.   I just explained to you. They said they had to take Kuminga if he fell to 7.

I’ll just tell you they were both clearly in our top 10. We feel like we got really fortunate on Kuminga.

Is this enough proof for you? They wanted Moody at 7 and Kuminga was a pipedream at 7, and Moody AND Kuminga was impossible. Then we got both."
