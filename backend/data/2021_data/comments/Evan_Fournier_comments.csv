"Fred ""Steph Curry"" Vanvleet vs Evan "" Kobe Bryant"" Fournier"
Evan Fournier.
"I think Fournier and AG are highly likely to be traded before Vucevic, Evan is an expiring contract and I don’t think we will re sign him and AG doesn’t really fit with JI"
"I wanted Evan Fournier so bad but like JJ, also expiring.  I think Terrance Ross is a good choice for the TPE for bench scoring."
"Evan Fournier, idk who wants him tho"
Evan Fournier I think would be a good piece for them. Send the magic a first or something for him
"Evan ""DONT GOOGLE!"" Fournier."
Evan Fournier
It's without a doubt Evan Fournier. Some people have been begging our FO to trade him for a second round pick just to get him off the team for years now. If he has a good game it's a fluke and he still sucks and is the reason we aren't winning chips.

"ignoring the 9 missed FTs, the 2 glaring uncalled hacks at the end of the 4th, and relying on Evan Fournier to win you the game"
"Yeah it's tough for us, we played at least 1 game missing every starter except Vooch. Then we got Aaron Gordon back, but he's not an offensive powerhouse. Now that Evan Fournier is back, our offense will come back a bit, but losing Markelle and his ability to drive to the basket took away a major offensive weapon for us."
"&gt;Evan Fournier - I think he gives you 80% of what Jaylen Brown does  Fournier is off to a good start, but this is still an absolutely absurd take. He’s mostly a spot up shooter that plays below average to bad defense. Brown is a top 20 player in the league. They aren’t in the same universe."
Caris LeVert - Highest ceiling out of anyone on here but meh from 3-point land and injury concerns   Evan Fournier - Always been high on him; I think he gives you 80% of what Jaylen Brown does   Bogdan Bogdanovic - Solid as your secondary ballhandler but having a down year and defense isn't great  Hard to rank the last 3 guys: Eric Gordon / Danny Green / Gary Harris. All of them are decent defenders but streaky shooters.
1. Eric Gordon  2. Evan Fournier  3. Danny Green  4. Caris LeVert  5. Gary Harris  6. Bogdan Bogdanovic  Downvote me and tell me I’m wrong. I don’t care
Yeah that’s kind of the issue although I also don’t know if Bledsoe will still be on the team after this year so that might open up a spot. I don’t think you are forced to start Graham and not play him in a 6th man role also if Lewis and NAW were good enough to both warrant starting down the road  He’s an expiring but what about Lonzo ball and JJ Redick for evan Fournier? This one though I’m not sure I would actually do
I wonder when/if teams will start calling about Fournier / AG. Evan is in his last year will most likely be on another roster by next season. AG has one more year left on the extension he signed with us a few years back. We could get decent pieces for both.
Evan Fournier.
"Levert isn’t all that great. There are so many of him in the league. Empty calorie mid-range jump shooters that are just average from three, don’t get to the rim, and don’t play defense. Jeremy Lamb, Rudy Gay, Will Barton, Evan Fournier, Jordan Clarkson, Dillon Brooks, Malik Beasley, etc, etc."
"Three of these players are starters: Markelle Fultz, Evan Fournier, and Jonathan Isaac.  Three of these players are out indefinitely or until next season: Markelle Fultz, Jonathan Isaac, and Al-Farouq Aminu.  Just depressing to watch."
"Here you go:   &gt; Dort is morphing from curiosity to basketball player. He has hit 44% of his ceiling-scraping 3s on decent volume -- about 6.5 attempts per 36 minutes -- even though the shot flies so high, the atmosphere might alter its trajectory. He has a bulldozing pump-and-go game, and a surprising ability to decelerate.   &gt;Dort is averaging about 12 drives per 100 possessions, up from eight last season, per Second Spectrum. A cautionary note: Oklahoma City has scored a paltry 0.714 points per possession when Dort shoots out of a drive or dishes to a teammate who fires -- 178th out of 190 players who have recorded at least 20 drives.  &gt; Dort is wild and turnover prone. He has zero midrange game; he is 1-of-10 on shots from between the restricted area and the 3-point arc. Still: it's encouraging to see him stretch himself.  &gt; He remains a growling brick wall on defense. His motor is incredible, and occasionally a little disconcerting.  &gt; Nine guys are playing basketball there. Dort is playing his own game, scrambling around as if someone has challenged him to guard an entire team at once. He denies Evan Fournier an open 3, rides Fournier's hip into the lane, and slashes outside to fly at Dwayne Bacon. He then drifts right to deter a potential pass to Aaron Gordon in the corner, and finally U-turns out to deflect that kickout to Fournier.  &gt; I'm tired just watching that. It looks like someone is controlling Dort with a remote control.  &gt; In conclusion: MAKE THE DORT MINI-LICENSE PLATES!!"
Pffft well that’s a mistake. Guys a glorified Evan Fournier
Evan Fournier could make this team as he was acquired for Arron Afflalo as an afterthought
"Flexibility is the name of the game. Adding 3 years of Grant is a committal move. For 2021-22 the Celtics already have over 100 million in guys that will for sure be on the team (Kemba, Jaylen, Jayson, Smart) and then adding the probables (Thompson, this year’s rookies, both Williams) you’re already at over 120 million on the roster. Luxury tax is projected at 136 and a Grant guaranteed salary already has them over.   Not saying Grant at 3/60 is the worst move they could make but it locks the Cs into paying a middling 3/D guy when they may want to use that money for other options (Theis, Semi, MLE player). They’ll pay the luxury tax like they did in the past, but I think they’d at least like the opportunity to choose their path after the year instead of being locked into Grant.  My preference is to trade for an expiring contract along the lines of an Evan Fournier, Otto Porter or Oladipo. Then the Celtics can decide whether they want to re-sign with Bird Rights or move on afterwards. With Grant, the decision is already made."
"Protected: Nikola Vucevic, Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Aaron Gordon, Chuma Okeke, Cole Anthony, Jonathan Isaac  Best Available: Evan Fournier, Khem Birch, Michael Carter Williams"
Evan Fournier would be the perfect acquisition for the Jazz. He brings with him a passion for the arts and a love of the game that goes unrivaled. His clammy hands could be cured by funneling ammonium nitrate into his new pad.
People say Aaron Gordon every year and nothing happens lol but the real one we might trade is Evan Fournier since he’s expiring

Evan Fournier
"A lot of people who were low on him didn't seem to appreciate HOW good he was in Euroleague.  Most Euroleague prospects are either young and raw players who get picked for promising skillsets and athletic tools - e.g. Dragan Bender put up 2.1 ppg in 11 mpg for a sub-bar Maccabi Tel Aviv team before being picked #4. Or else they are more established players without much upside when get picked as win-now prospects, like Bogdan Bogdonavac who was drafted at 25.  Meanwhile Luka was the youngest ever Euroleague MVP during his 18 year old season en route to leading Real to a Euroleague title. He also led Slovenia - not exactly a traditional basketball powerhouse - to the Eurobasket title alongside Goran Dragic.  On top of his pedigree, there was no shortage of film of Doncic playing against legit NBA talents. In the Eurobasket tournament alone, he matched up against Porzingis' Latvia team, the French team with Boris Diaw and Evan Fournier and the Spanish team with both Gasol brothers, both Hernanogomez brothers, Ricky Rubio and Sergio Rodriguez.  That's a much more impressive track record than the level of talent that say, DeAndre Ayton, Marvin Bagley, or Trae Young played against in the NCAA, and that's not even considering the fact that Doncic was playing against grown men while the NCAA prospects were playing against other kids their age. For comparison, Ayton's Wildcats got blown tf out by a Buffalo Bulls team with no future NBA players in the first round of the NCAA tournament."
"Big list, but...  &amp;#x200B;  **Victor Oladipo**  HOU  **PJ Tucker**  HOU  **Eric Gordon**  CHA  **Richaun Holmes**  SAS  **Nemanja Bjelica**  SAC  **George Hill**  LAC, if they have enough cap space  **Al Horford**  Stays or is released.  Bad contract  **JJ Redick**  Whoever needs shooting.  MKE or LAL probibly, maybe back to Philly  **Nikola Vucevic**  Hornets?  Maybe Celtics  **Evan Fournier**  Stays in ORL  **Terrence Ross**  Warriors or Hornets  **John Collins**  Depends.  Likely ether traded to WSH for Beal or SAS for DeRozan, maybe HOU for Olidipo  **Larry Nance**  CLE  **Kyle Lowry**  Clippers is a nice fit, but no cap space.  If he is traded, I could see NYK or DAL  **Lamarcus Aldridge**  Terrible contract.  That being said, NYK or buyout"
"Let me guess, Mavs are interested in Evan Fournier?"
"Yup, it’s why Denver has a long list of players leaving for more minutes/bigger roles.   Jusuf Nurkic Evan Fournier Trey Lyles Malik Beasley Jerami Grant Mason Plumlee  Will Barton will definitely be next."
"For the knicks we should look at Lonzo and Gary Trent even though there are RFA  For UFA, Evan Fournier, Norman Powell or Kyle Lowry would be nice"
"It’s garbage.  Evan fournier is realistically a very solid role player in the NBA but he’s our #2 guy.  Fultz, Isaac, and AG are all good players and they’re injured. Terrance Ross is a meh 6th man but bc he goes off occasionally he’s all we have to get excited for. It’s literally just vuc &amp; garbage out there rn. So frustrating. Terrible trades and drafting have gotten us here."
"Overrated: Mo Bamba dude just isn’t very good. We’re yelling for him to get minutes but when he does he doesn’t help much. He does have his moments and I still believe in him and wish he’d get the back up center minutes, but yeah Mo is confusing.   Underrated: Evan Fournier? He’s been having a pretty solid season and we’ve struggled when he was out finding some perimeter scoring."
"Sga, Evan Fournier"
Evan Fournier has the highest career WS out of all the French NBA players with an 8-letter last name starting with F
"Magic are missing their projected starting PF, SF, PG. Vuc's second best teammates this year have been Aaron Gordon and Evan Fournier, who have both missed time. Compare them to Turner and Brogdon. If it means usage is higher, it also means that he is getting much more defensive attention and double teams. Sabonis is shooting a higher percentage and has a couple of more assists per game but Vucecic is better or same at everything else. More points, more 3s, better FT% with equal RPG, SPG, BPG.   Not saying one is definitely better than other. To me they've both been pretty equal in terms of value."
"Trade for Nikola Vucevic.   trade would probably be steven adams, and JJ reddick and a butt ton of picks for Vucevic and Evan Fournier.  Both adams and JJ are expiring deals. magic who are currently 12th in the east would get a ton of cap space and a ton of picks to set up a rebuild. can build through fultz, isaac when he is healthy again, bacon, and get bamba more minutes. if the magic can find a bonifide star in the draft and pick up and sign a really good player (maybe like bringing back oladipo) while lowkey tanking this year.    Vucevic spaces the floor for Zion. plus Fournier can create his own shot and can be a guy who can get buckets off the bench."
"A lot of guys who are forced to shoot under pressure. here's a few  * [Tyler Herro](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629639/shots-dash/) * [Evan Fournier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203095/shots-dash/) * [Brandon Ingram (tho he's more than stationary from 3)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627742/shots-dash/) * [Terry Rozier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1626179/shots-dash/) * [Gary Trent](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629018/shots-dash/) * [Jordan Clarkson](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203903/shots-dash/) * [Tim Hardaway Jr.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203501/shots-dash/)  Each of those guys shows a significantly higher aptitude for shooting with defenders in their vicinity, which I think gives a better idea of their ability as spot up threats. Part of spot up shooting, imo, is actually being a threat that other teams respect. Yeah sure Myles Turner can make like 35% of his open 3s. Who cares? No defense does. (This is the trap of the stretch 5 that a lot of teams fall into. Unless you're KAT, it doesn't affect the defense).   Lonzo's shot profile is much more in line with someone like Jae Crowder, both of whom get ignored by every defense in the league. My big point is that we put way too much stock into one number - overall 3pt % - to tell us who's a good shooter and who isn't, and then are surprised when guys fall off in the playoffs or the bubble. Dig a little deeper and you can really start understanding different levels of shooting ability."
"I love Lowry but Embiid is 26 and Simmons is 24 we could be in contention for the next 6-7 years if we continue to build depth around these guys. To do that though you need to retain and develop our picks.   I just can't give up Shake, Maxey, or Thybulle for a 34 year old Lowry. Like Thybulle could easily replace Danny Green as a starter next year. Maxey's statistical profile ironically mirrors a young Lowry. Maxey isn't quite ready for the rotation yet but I'm projecting him to be a starter in this league and I think like lowry he has the tools to become a good 3 pt shooter and for a guard he doesn't really have any other holes in his game. I think he'd be playing better if we didn't have Dwight packing the paint.   Shake is actually already valuable for us. He's also hit a wall but how many combo guards with 7 foot wingspans and all around skill set are actually out there? Not many. Shake has also been defending at a high level and whereas in the past he's excelled shooting it and struggled getting to the rim, this year he's been excelling getting to the rim and struggling shooting it. So the best version of Shake probably hasn't been seen yet.   I think we should bring in a stretch 5 maybe Demarcus Cousins and trade for Jabari Parker. High end stuff, Otto Porter and Evan Fournier.   The most disappointing part of our roster has been the dead weight we're carrying in Tony Bradley, Poirier, and Terrance Ferguson. Those guys just bring nothing to the table. It makes no sense we're just keeping them when there's no chance of them playing or ever being useful."

Lonzo ball  Zach Lavine   Evan Fournier  Nikola Vucevic   Deaaron fox  Just to name a few
"Unless your first two options are a superstar and another high level all star, you're not getting anywhere with Evan Fournier as your #3 player"
"Evan ""Don't google my last name"" Fournier"
"Like maybe I’m just blackpilled on the Sixers always losing to the Celtics, but I really don’t think this team is that bad. They’ve barely played together due to injury and the only real issue is bench depth, which can be easily solved by using the TPE for Evan Fournier or something"
"I also think Fournier and maybe Gordon should be traded before the deadline. But with Isaac AND Aminu AND Okeke all having injury setbacks, makes some sense why the FO might stick with Gordon.  Evan could be a good 4th or 5th guy for a playoff team probably."
Ill take both a George Hill and and Evan Fournier and then we can all complain how the sixers have too much ball handling now
Evan Fournier
Evan “Don’t Google” Fournier
"The TPE + a 1st should get Evan Fournier imo. That’s a good trade for both sides.  The problem is they can only use ~22m of the TPE this season due to hardcap issues so they can trade for another (unless they send out salary in a separate deal), but someone under it.  Danilo Gallinari is another one if there’s a handshake deal to send Atlanta a player “separately.” Just another scoring wing that can give you rotation minutes."
I would like to see them go after Otto Porter or Evan Fournier.
Evan Fournier
Fournier and Ross seem like the most likely.  One of the 2.  Evan is expiring so probably him.
You're going to use it for Evan Fournier and you'll like it
Omg that’s LaMarcus Aldridge or Evan Fournier music
"Sure, but NBA players sort of campaigning against the WNBA players’ voices is bad, and that’s kind of what he’s doing. I also think “they haven’t outlined the steps! they haven’t thought it out!” is typically very lazy and poor critique of movements.  IIRC, the entire WNBA player base earns less collectively than Evan Fournier. The NBA can easily subsidize the salaries to a higher degree and create a better and more sustainable setting for women playing basketball. I think these things always come down to being like “I think they should do the better and good thing because it is good.” and people rebutting with “but that doesn’t make business sense” as if that’s not part of the original point to do better than that. (Not saying you’re saying that though, just sort of talking lol)"
"Evan Fournier has missed more games for us in Covid protocols than he’s played, and he’s out again tonight."
evan fournier and smart lol???
"I'm with you. I also think about Kawhi's high release when I'm in the midrange. Yeah the guy is so strong idk how he shoots the same way from deep. Looks like the ball is made of cement when he shoots but not in a bad way.  I definitely can't keep the same form for threes. I'll think about Zach Lavine, cause of his strong legs, with a lower release. I think Evan Fournier actually has a very sweet stroke. I can't get my release so high like so many nba guys, so trying to copy Fournier works for me."
"We had a chance of winning this game, then Evan Fournier went on H&amp;S, Rob Williams felt like fouling 3 times in the first quarter, and everyone felt like turning the ball over every other possession (oh, and Thompson is out but I honestly forgot he was on the Celtics)"
"bring on the hate! any good gm should be in the conversation for any move for a star and Danny has made his fair share of moves. kinda funny article, but not super well done. the celtics have been something of a b-tier free agent destination this decade, signing Horford, Hayward, and Kemba. We did also use the TPE (for an expiring Evan Fournier...)"
"He's talking about the playoffs roster.   Hayward didn't play for most of it and wasn't good when he did because he was playing through injury.   Kanter only really got a lot of minutes in the Sixers series because they're like the one team that can't punish him since their PnR sucked. TT can play more playoff minutes than Kanter could anyways.   Theis is a loss, but Timelord is very good, better at a lot of things though idk who's better overall, but it's clear that having three centers was too many.   I don't think anyone would consider Grant Williams regressing a big deal. Wanamaker is honestly a bigger loss, but he sucks now anyways.   Kemba right now is pretty much as good as he was towards the end of those playoffs, if not better.   In the end, roster-wise, a lot of our losses from the playoffs were mitigated, and Evan Fournier and Jaylen's improvement are better than whatever losses haven't been offset. We're obviously not as good as last year's full strength team, but last year's team wasn't at full strength when it mattered."
"Paul would start. You have to realize the modern NBA isn’t just a point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center. It’s just not how it works anymore.   I’m not sure who the best for us would be. Probably someone like Evan Fournier"
Pretty sad that an overpaying small market team can be so much better than your big market Celtics.  But I'm sure Evan Fournier is the answer to your problems..... Bahahaha
"Orlando was nearing a decision on which player to pay/keep out of Oladipo &amp; Fournier. Vic's camp wanted max. Evan was more modest with his asking price, and at the time, had similar production. With that scenario playing out, ownership was also putting lots of pressure on Hennigan to start winning. They couldn't stomach ""the process"" any longer. Also, enter new coach Vogel and the first thing he asks for is a shot-blocking big to put next to Vuc. Vogel's key ingredient to his defense was rim protection and Vuc isn'tthat. With all those factors bubbling up, Rob sought to get Ibaka from his friend Presti. Rob was also the asst GM that convinced Presti to draft Serge while at OKC. Then the draft-night trade happened. Including a pick was the teacher schooling the student. Orl had no intention to draft Sabonis but that's who OKC wanted."
Rob Hennigan was hellbent on Elfrid Payton and Vooch as corner stones at the point guard and center position. Victor and Elfrid couldn't coexist due to spacing issues and they had Evan Fournier who did provide that floor spacing. Serge looked like a guy that could balance Vooch's lack of defense. And last was Alex Martins breathing down Rob Hennigan's neck to make the playoffs.
"He is a lot like Evan Fournier in the sense that they were being asked to do WAY too much because of the rest of our roster's deficiencies.      Now that they can settle into much more complete teams and can really focus and shine on their roles &amp; play in a way that's conducive to their strengths, people will really see how solid of players they actually are.     Even though Chicago has been losing quite a bit I've really enjoyed watching them all excel for their new teams."
"EVAN ""DO GOOGLE"" FOURNIER!"
Lol he's gonna be Evan Fournier. I say this as a Bruins fan.
You’d need like 4 FRPs. You aren’t getting KAT for a glorified Evan Fournier and a bust big man.
"Well his name is Evan Fournier, not Evan Threenier"
4th quarter Evan Fournier though?
Evan Fournier gonna bring some hope back to Celtics fans
Is Evan Fournier the best player to ever wear no. 94?
“Fuck outta here”  -Evan Fournier
"Yeah Danny. It’s the players fault that you replaced Kyrie Irving, Rozier, Hayward and Horford with Evan Fournier, Rob Will, Nesmith, Pritchard and Romeo fucking Langford."
"Everyone is so quick to jump the gun and be worried about losing Tatum and Brown, when they are 23 and 24. Is Miami going to be worried about losing Bam if they lose in the first or second round this year? Is Sacramento worried about losing De'Aaron Fox since he was also just signed to a 5-year max and they can't put help around him? Is Ben Simmons going to demand a trade if they don't make the finals yet again? Same for Donovan Mitchell if the Jazz don't win this year? What about Sabonis or Devin Booker?  All of these guys are the same ages as Tatum/Brown, but I never hear this narrative about them, except maybe Simmons in trade rumors, and they all haven't won a championship yet either.  Everyone said the same thing about Giannis and then he stayed in Milwaukee. I understand where it comes from when it does happen and guys want out, I just don't know what kind of power they have with 3/4 years left on $24M+ deals where any trade to match salary would send them to a bad team or a contender would be losing key pieces to match salary and they'd be in the exact same spot in a different location. Celtics aren't buying them out lol.  They have literally no leverage to demand a trade this offseason and if you make the playoffs 4 years in a row and made it to the ECF in 2/4 of those where you're the main guy(s), why would you want out that bad?  James Harden spent 8 years in Houston. KD spent 9 in OKC. LeBron stuck it out with the Cavs for 7. Paul George in Indiana for 7. AD with the Pelicans for 7. Melo with Denver for 7.5. Lillard has spent his entire career with Portland. Embiid has played 5 season with the Sixers and there's no mention of him jumping ship. Jokic 6 years in Denver and no one is saying he's going to demand a trade. None of these guys won championships with those teams.  Why does everyone act like their window is closed now or very soon after just 4 years when people act like their help (Kemba Walker, 4 time All-Star, coming back from injury/surgery. Marcus Smart, 1st team All Defense, coming back from injury. Evan Fournier, 18 PPG scoring option, 2 games in) is no help at all? This narrative is nonsense."
Bol Bol and Evan Fournier
"Really?  Brad Stevens, ""a top 5 coach in the league"".  Tatum, Brown, two ""All-Stars"".  Marcus ""heart and soul of the team"" Smart.  Kemba Walker, who has been averaging 20/3.5/5 after his first ten games.  Payton Pritchard and Rob Williams, two promising young players.  Evan Fournier, a 19/3/4 guy replaced Daniel Theis, another solid player.  That's seven average to ""elite"" players with an ""elite"" head coach.  Maybe not a contending roster but that's more than enough to get to the Playoffs.  When will people finally wake up and start questioning Tatum, Brown, and Brad Stevens?"
"Evan really popping off over there in Boston. Vooch is carrying the bulls to wins, too.  Magic were so dumb to make those trades, right?   Take your homer for Evan Fournier to the bathroom to get it out of your system. We were never going to leave the first round of the playoffs just like you’re never going to leave your mom’s basement."
"To be honest, yea. With Fultz down, our starting lineup pre trade deadline didn’t really play team ball (Evan Fournier thought he was the best, AG thought he was the best, and Vooch was caught in the middle). This team (outside Bacon) plays very unselfishly and with a lot of heart."

"Evan ""3.6 roentgen"" Fournier"
"Small caveat I'll add to that, Evan Fournier isn't nearly as good as Conley"
Evan Fournier broke the celtics.
TPE &gt; Evan  Fournier
Don't google Evan fournier tonight
Who is Evan Fournier really playing for?
Evan Fournier out with illness due to looking up his last name
"I feel like trade exceptions usually don't result in significant acquisitions.  The Celtics had a huge trade exception that they used (partially to be fair) for Evan Fournier.  Fournier isn't a bad asset, but I don't think that was the ideal acquisition with an exception that large."
"I'm telling you, though, this is a trap. One year Aron Baynes and Al Horford turned super saiyan against you guys. If Evan Fournier breaks the playoff 3 pt record and Tatum averages 35 against the sixers, then the next series they get swept by the Nets, at least you were warned about it."
"I view it as Evan Fournier is on an expiring contract expected to demand a pay raise, versus Powell being a RFA on expiring contract with TPE. (Powell also better defensively) I personally have faith Fournier will continue to get better and is already a great scorer, but Powell is better all around and has a more team friendly contract. Portland didn’t really need Gary Trent being that they have Dame, CJ, and Simons. Would’ve loved to have him but he is an asset worth losing to shore up their front court"
You say that like we didn’t just trade for Evan Fournier and don’t have the most trades in the league over the last 5 years by almost double second place.
"&gt;If Evan Fournier Aaron Gordon Nikola Vucevic were so good why could they not win together?  Because only Vucevic was playing constantly in a high level.   Fournier is a good player, and would be excellent as a leader of the second unit, but only good as a starter.  Gordon, probably due to his injuries, never became the player that everyone expected.  And lastly, because the rest of the team (with some exceptions) was never very good."
"In the M is for Mature version of NBA2K it’s Gorgui Damn, Luol Damn and Evan Fournier."
"Evan Fournier , if Celtics wouldn't come to terms with him. He will be an intriguing Free Agent that can help a contender."
"Congrats on you being triggered, I guess.  Seriously, how mad are you that the Celtics aren’t over .500 and yet only traded for Evan Fournier at the deadline?"
"I dont think it'd be an ""over the top"" move per se, but I'd like to see them shore up the playoff rotation by adding Evan Fournier, especially if he's cheap enough that the Magic are willing to move him for minimal value (rather than let him leave for nothing in the offseason.)  Alternatively, if they are *insistent* on pushing as hard as they can. A deal involving for Vucevic while sending Nurkic back would be a supremely ballsy move."
I'd like them to try to move for Evan Fournier
"Evan Fournier is my tan king, thank you very much 😤"
"team was 6-2 and had one the best record in the league with Fultz. Yes thats not many games but it looked very promising. We dont even have JI who is a premier defender in the league. We HAVE to flip Gordon and Evan together for something substantial.   We are actually in a great spot to get a top 3 pick which is either Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, or Evan Mobley. All 4 I think are gonna be good. Cades 99% going 1st so hypothetically lets say we get Suggs or Green to fill that SG spot our team looks like this  1. Fultz 2. Green/Suggs OR a guy that can be packaged with Gordon and Fournier. Oladipo again? 3. Okeke (Can put your top 3 pick here too if you move those guys for a SG..Either way the SG and SF could be interchangeable) 4. Isaac 5. Vooch  Bench: Cole, Bamba, Ross, Birch, Bacon  Thats a top 5 seed in the East"
"""Legends who played in the 60/70s and even 80's wouldn't be successful in todays in NBA.""  Its fucking basketball. If you can do multiple of these things better (dribble, shoot, defend, rebound and pass) than every single person you go against, I dont care if you played when the hoop was a literal basket, you can hold your own.  Jerry West averaged damn near 30 PPG his entire career without a 3 point line. But people think he would average around 18-20 PPG...You know who averages 18-20 PPG in 2021? Evan Fournier.   C'mon man."
Nobody's doing shit against those three but Thybulle's going to at least make Kyrie/Harden work their ass off to get buckets. Certainly moreso than Evan Fournier or Danny Green.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoMqzDay6N0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoMqzDay6N0)  Kyrie was 6/21 with 14 points this game.
The end of the Vuc/Evan buddyball era may soon be upon us. Lots of Magic fans hate Fournier for doing too much on some plays but when he's out it's super obvious how much we need him.
Evan Fournier doesn't like this post
You think half a season rental of Evan Fournier is worth a first rounder?
If they really wanted to pay homage to us they would've gotten dumpstered by Evan Fournier
FUCK SHIT. I fucking googled Fournier and went to images expecting to see Evan Fournier. Instead I saw pictures of dicks with mother fucking gangrene. Oh my god
Evan “Don’t Google my last name” Fournier
"I think Vuc and Magic org likes each other.   Magic has a lot of injuries, that's why they regressed. They where up and coming IMO when Isaac showed growth. Then they were winning games with Fultz, but he got injured as well... It sucked to see those guys go  down. I like the Cole Anthony pick and I think they're going to be fine, if they get everyone back.   Maybe look for the right deal with Aaron Gordon and/or Evan Fournier? I think it's the right call to be patient and wait for their injured players to get back on the court."
Harrison Barnes or Evan Fournier would be so nice on the team at the 3 if we can negotiate a deal
"&gt; Based on what?  Based on their defensive skill sets.   &gt; Im telling you what Milwaukee did. They clearly thought Fournier was someone worth targeting on defense, they did it and it worked.   And I’m trying to explain to you why using a 5 game bubble sample for a guy coming off covid who played like shit all around relative to his general standards is an absurd way to judge defensive value. Fournier was targeted in both the milwaukee and Toronto series because of our lack forward depth that meant he had to switch onto or even straight up match up with dudes like siakam, Kawhi, and giannis. That is not an issue for the lakers. In a death lineup scenario the lakers would have AD and Lebron on the floor to guard guys who can physically overpower Fournier.   &gt; Fournier guarding the opponents top option frequently is a byproduct of Orlando's roster not his actual defensive capabilities. Who else is going to chase Dame Lillard around a million screens, Aaron Gordon?  In theory it should be markelle fultz, the 6’4” hyper athletic young point guard. But it’s not because Evan is a very good defender and his size bothers guards a lot on the perimeter. Another funny thing to point out is that you’re saying our perimeter personnel is trash defensively and that’s the only reason Fournier gets the best assignment, but we’ve been a top 10 defense each of the last two years, despite our other back court defenders being Fultz, DJ Augustin, terrence ross, so clearly he’s doing something right. If we were just getting torched on the perimeter every night that couldn’t be true."
"Wayne Ellington, PJ Tucker, or Evan Fournier apparently"
Evan fournier had a pretty cool one last year i think but not sure if he still does it.
"Evan ""Don't Google"" Fournier"
"Celtics fan talking shit???   Since drafting Tatum y’all has had 7 first round picks (2.3 per draft) and u guys still couldn’t make a quality nba roster. You basically traded Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, Al Hartford, Marcus Morris for Kemba. You guys passed up on Myles turner for Gordon Hayward and got nothing instead. Despite losing all that talent and having so many young draft picks your team is in #20 in cap space with an Evan Fournier contract coming up. You guys are worse than the Kings, tatum can’t wait to leave your poverty squad and join the Lakers he doesn’t even hide it 😂"
"&gt;- The Celtics have the 6th highest payroll in the NBA next season, not including a new deal for free agent Evan Fournier    So... why does this mean a bleak future?   &gt;- Kemba Walker has one of the worst contracts in the league    There's only 1+1 left and he averaged 19, 4 &amp; 5 this year, after starting really slow from injury.   &gt;- Most of their young players like Grant Williams and Romeo Langford have disappointed    Tatum, Brown, Williams, Pritchard, Nesmith haven't disappointed   &gt;- They own no future first round picks from other teams    So... they don't owe anyone any picks. Why is it bleak to not own other teams picks?   &gt;- Marcus Smart will likely have to be traded this summer or else the Celtics tax bill will be massive. And if they don't trade him, they certainly will not be able to sign him to a big new deal next summer when his contract ends.    Why can't they pay him? Why does he have to be traded?   Also, if he's traded then it won't be for nothing. They will get value in return."

Play happened when Evan Fournier shoved Bam into Kemba.   I gotta feel sorry for Celtics fans. Injury ravaged seasons are fucking terrible and no fanbase deserves that
"Think of it this way:  * Same roster that went to the ECF last year (minus Hayward who was injured or hobbled the entire time anyways) * Both Jays scoring 25 PPG plus, All-Stars * Evan Fournier added at trade deadline for 2 second round picks * Rookies contributing more as the year has gone on  If I told you in December that this is what the Celtics would have this year, would you think they would be likely finishing under .500?"
I thought the dude talking was Evan Fournier lol

"Jimmy Butler was *0-for-15* on his last 3's before he made that one after the Celtics cut the deficit to 6.  Going up 26 at the end of the 1st half was awesome. Seeing the Celtics slowly trickle their way back into the game on a bunch of FTs, Foster not call an obvious clear path foul, having Mark Jones / Hubie Brown root for the C's slow comeback was not as awesome. I also hate that Evan Fournier is on a relevant team for the 1st time his career. Still won tho. Time to do it again on Tuesday."
evan fournier take over
Aight bruh Brad Stevens is overrated but this is going way too far  It’s not his fault the roster was injured and broken this year lol and it’s not his fault that Ainge didn’t do anything to improve the roster and his pinnacle move was getting Evan Fournier
"Danny Ainge, the guy who assembled the roster of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker (who was coming off a starting all-star season when we signed him), Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, Evan Fournier, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Tristan Thompson? one of the most solid and YOUNG 9-man rotations in the league? there are problems with this team, and none of them are Ainge"
Evan Fournier is already a better fit with the starters. Jaylen Brown should never start again but Brad is too scared to bench him.
"&gt;Brad Stevens is a mediocre coach and I'm glad that everybody can see it now   &gt;   &gt;People defend his honor every time anyone criticizes him and its mind boggling. He has 2 all stars and Kemba and he's barely staying afloat trying to keep out of the play in spot? I don't see how anybody can defend him anymore. He should've taken the Indiana job where his inability to coach star players could be masked by his good guy persona leading a bunch of unathletic underdogs  We lead the league with players missing games due to COVID, and Kemba doesn't play b2b's. Not to mention, before we acquired Evan Fournier, we were giving Grant Williams and Semi-Freakin'-Haven't-Recorded-A-Single-Block Ojeleye on our team 20+ MPG before EF trade...  That's not ideal.  Also why the fuck would he want to go back to Indiana?... We re-signed him for 5+ years... Besides Smart, he's our longest tenured HC in a while....  How about you lay off the drugs, and make this post when you've come down? Cocaine is a hell of a drug."
"The problem is our starting 5 is really all we have going for us.  Kemba/Smart/Brown/Tatum/Timelord is a arguably a top 5 starting 5 in the NBA, but our supporting cast stops and ends with Tristan Thompson and Evan Fournier. It's not completely awful, especially with the addition of Fournier, but the rest of our bench players are young and not ready to carry the load off the bench. Pritchard is maybe the closest, but he's still learning.  I'm not a doomer by any means, I think we have one of, if not the, brightest future of any team in the NBA, certainly in the eastern conference, but the fact of the matter is out role-players are a lot weaker than other contenders this year, and it would take all of our best 7 guys staying healthy throughout the entire playoffs, as well as an 8th/9th guy off the bench (one of Grant Williams, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, and Aaron Nesmith) making a big leap *in a playoff push* for us to really and truly contend."
Evan Fournier is a good defensive player.  Vuc was bad sure but we've always had great defensive players putside of DJ Augustin and Vuc.  The offense is a problem sure but right now we only have a couple of good to great defensive players.  Isaac WCJ and Markelle.  Chuma is also pretty good but his on ball is a bit overrated.  His help defense is actually really better but our team scheme needs great guard defense because we drop back so much.  If RJ is going to be a starter he has to be able to get through screens like Cole and Markelle have gone to learn.  I also just can't see RJ being anything more than the 6th man type because ideally every player who starts is a two way player.  Having a weak spot to attack is easily exploited in the playoffs and isn't that the end goal.  Also who is downvoting everything I'm saying that's fucking stupid.
"Feel bad he got hurt but yeah, Boston plays so much better without Jaylen Brown. Evan Fournier is 10 times better alongside Jayson Tatum.  It would be in everyone's best interest to move on. I've said this before but Ainge blew it by not trading Brown for Harden. Now he has to sell Brown at a loss."
That's easier said than done at this point; CJ is a hard contract to trade and those big wings like Gordon (and to a lesser degree someone like Evan Fournier) already got traded.   The more that I think about it the more I think that the Blazers are the true analog in the West to the Pacers; they exist to be a competent basketball team. The difference is that the Blazers have a superstar talent where we don't and unfortunately they don't have the balls or the assets to truly maximize Dame.
&gt;He's not at risk lol  Jayson Tatum and Evan Fournier have entered the chat
"they are certainly high variance, my worry is that everything after the Jays is a question mark.  Will we get good Kemba consistently?  Will we get good Smart for long enough?  Will Time Lord be able to stay on the court?  Will Tristan Thompson ever move his fat ass out of drop coverage on PnR (that might work against Philly but as we saw vs. the Blazers on Sunday that's a recipe for disaster against a team with players that can shoot off the dribble)?  Will Evan Fournier get in a groove?  Will the young kids give the Celtics anything consistently?  Each one of these questions could pan out in the Celtics favor (except for Tristan Thompson giving them anything, fuck that guy), but to get enough of them to break right for Boston collectively seems like a long shot to say the least.    I'll be happy to be wrong here and I don't think that if they come up short it's a referendum on Stevens, Ainge or the Jays.  If anything they're ahead of schedule still and have overachieved recently which has created artificially high expectations.  Progress isn't always linear, hopefully we can see some signs of life from the Celtics down the stretch and figure out a plan to make some tweaks this summer."
"I think the early findings for the newest mRNA vaccines suggest vaccinated people are very unlikely to transmit the disease if exposed.   Even if that were not the case and the vaccine only protects you,  you'd think LeBron would have looked around the league at what covid did to his peers to see the very real consequences of catching the disease. Let's not talk about wanting to protect others, just selfishly consider what it could do to him. Young uber athletic Jayson Tatum was huffing and puffing his way on the court for a good half season before finally getting into full game shape just now. His new teammate Evan Fournier talked about being in a brain fog from the disease. Young Blazer Nassir Little lost like 25 pounds and felt like he was going to die for weeks during the summer and missed the beginning of the season from his own bout.  The severe effects of covid are very much real and even now with one of the best vaccination drives in the world we are still seeing 50k cases a day. Tatum probably has some mild scarring in his lungs given how long it took him to recover. Compared with the theoretical at best risks from the vaccine? Should be a no brainer.   Any reason James has against the vaccine is purely irrational. It's a free country though and he can decline the vaccine. I look forward to the pikachu face avalanche on social media if he gets knocked out for 2 weeks right as the Lakers are scraping for that last playoff spot though!"
there's also no telling how you recover from it. Tatum is on an inhaler and Evan Fournier said that since returning it feels like he has a concussion.
Dr. Evan Fournier claims they’re nothing serious so that’s actually pretty good news.   Realistically have to wait until next day and see how things are going. Tatum was walking but things can tighten up. Jaylen probably just aggravated his already iffy ankle. I’m expecting day to day for both.
You lack reading comprehension apparently if you think anyone was trying to compare anyone on the Celtics to Lebron in terms of importance.  I’ll break it down one more time since you still don’t seem to get it.  - OP said “there’s no reason for the Celtics to suck this year”  - I replied “they’ve had the most games lost to injury/covid in the league”. That was the “reason to suck”  How in any way did you read that and think “no way this guys comparing Evan Fournier to LeBron!!” Like what lmfao
"There is a difference between Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier, hell even Tatum and Brown missing games and LeBron and AD missing games."
Evan Fournier is so weird. He either makes every shot or misses every shot. Theres no in between for him
"Because everyone around Jaylen and Tatum have been injured. It’s literally the same team that sweeped you guys last year +Evan Fournier, +Payton Pritchard, +Aaron Nesmith, with vast improvements from Jaylen. We have not played 100 minutes this season with our 5 best players healthy."
How come you don’t have Evan Fournier on here?
Evan Fournier has been complete ass
Even then was the key to getting over the Nets/6ers/Bucks hump Evan Fournier?
"OKC's combined salary for their entire 10 man lineup tonight: ~$20.5 million. Evan Fournier this season: $17 million. OKC came into this game on a 14 game loss streak, losing each game by an average of 21.4 (!!) points."
"Absolutely it is.     Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Evan Fournier ... we had an all-star, they don't have anybody close to being an all-star."
I will despise Evan Fournier and Marcus Smart till the day I die. At least Baze had a really nice efficent game but I am upset.
Evan Fournier and Marcus Smart combined for 25 points on 31 shots. Also had 6 turnovers and 9 fouls. Fucking hell
Evan Fournier averaging 4.8 assists per game
"Nahhh  KD, LeBron, Evan Fournier, James Harden, Sabonis, Steph Curry  Those guys tend to murder us  There’s a bunch more"
Evan “Gang Green” Fournier
"Doubt you can get a quality young guy + a 1st for him. It’s one or the other.  Norm Powell got the Raps Gary Trent (good younger player) and no pick. Evan Fournier got the Magic 2 seconds. I’d say Barnes is worse than Norm, better than Fournier so the trade package is probably in between this range of quality asset-wise."
“Maxi pad” for Maxi Kleber (not a nave fan but I think it’s pretty weird). As a magic fan maybe “The Fournicator” for Evan Fournier.
Evan Fournier is averaging 20 on 60% true shooting lmfao
"Embiid is good, but the players you have around him in that scenario aren't as good as the Jazz. I just think Luka would feast, although I feel he'd kinda overlap with Mitchell. Luka would probably play the point in that scenario, though.  Each player on that Jazz team is a threat. Kemba Walker, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart aren't threats like Bogdanovic and Gobert are. Gobert's defense alone can win the Jazz games.  Utah is also just far too deep. Evan Fournier doesn't come close to Jordan Clarkson, in my opinion. Clarkson just fits that system they've got going on perfectly."
"Celtics depth is fine now (especially if we running an 8 man like the playoffs with Embiid)  Kemba Walker  Marcus Smart  Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Joel Embiid  Evan Fournier  Robert Williams III  Tristan Thompson  That’s 5 people averaging 20 with one averaging 30, another averaging 25, and another also averaging 25"

"&gt; Also Evan Fournier is the same height as Millsap. 6'7  That's a surprise, always thought of Fournier as 6'4"" or 6'5""."
Wtf no way Jones in 6'5...  Also Evan Fournier is the same height as Millsap. 6'7
Aaron Gordon or maybe Evan Fournier if he didn't get covid
Evan Fournier would start on many contenders. Stop exposing yourself.
"Sorry man, he's still just Evan Fournier. He's a decent depth piece for a team that wants to be beyond like an Eastern Conference 7th seed. That's it."
"&gt; He’s alright? You obviously have zero idea of the year Evan was having. He was having a career year this year. It’s ok man, I get it. You probably said the same thing a year ago.  Umm... we're talking about Evan Fournier right? Don't be a homer. ""Alright"" is exactly the word I'd use to describe him."
"He’s alright? You obviously have zero idea of the year Evan was having. He was having a career year this year. It’s ok man, I get it. You probably said the same thing a year ago.   If you want to talk about last year we can, because we literally had a top 4 defense and the Heat were 11th so I don’t know where you’re getting this defensive identity bullshit from.  Do yourself a favour and check how many minutes we were forced to play Wanamaker last playoffs. Replace his and Grant’s minutes with Evan Fournier and Tristan and it’s a major, major upgrade."
"Last year was a weird year with the huge layoff and then coming back into the bubble and no HCA in Playoff Games. The Heat at least had an identity being a tough defensive team with a lot of shooters and a guy who could drive and get to the line a bunch. What exactly is the Celtics ""thing""? Are they a good offensive team? Not really. Are they a good defensive team? Not really. Do they shoot the three well? They shoot ok, but nothing that really stands out. Tatum and Brown are good, but the bench pretty much sucks. They added Evan Fournier at the deadline which helps a little bit. He's alright, but does he move the needle? Not really."
"&gt;A semi-decent team missing Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart, Evan Fournier, Timelord  That’s 4 of our top 6 players."
And Rob Williams  And Evan Fournier
"Sorry, but George Hill is not remotely in the same conversation as Evan Fournier is when it comes to supporting pieces. Stevens is going to let Embiid feast in any potential series, he won’t see any doubles. Stevens will shut down the rest of the Sixers and force Embiid to single-handedly win games, a tactic that has already beat them twice in the postseason. The Celtics have been dealing with covid and injury issues all season and are just now starting to hit their stride, especially now that Kemba is starting to look himself again. I’m not guaranteeing a Celtic victory or anything, but a Sixers/Celtics playoff series will be much closer to a 50/50 ordeal than Sixers fans are willing to admit"
Kyle Kuzma has 5M followers on IG while Evan Fournier has 236K
That mean Evan Fournier can come out to play soon?
Evan Fournier may not be notable but he has a noticeable drop in efficiency in the playoffs
And when he blew a kiss at Even Fournier  https://www.slamonline.com/nba/cj-mccollum-blows-kiss-altercation-evan-fournier/
Don't worry Evan Fournier will live up to this post next season.
"I realize I don't know the specifics, and I wish nothing but the best and healthy recovery for CP3 but...  You gotta be fucking kidding me. Dude has a legitimate chance to finally win one and he can't even get a fucking shot? ""Personal choice"" my ass...you just let down your team, all Suns fans, and frankly all NBA fans. This is the worst case for everyone, and it was 100% avoidable.   Speaking as a Celtics fan, we're extremely familiar with this - CP3 is done for the season at this point (again assuming he actually has covid). Tatum got it and was largely asymptomatic and it took him nearly a month to get back to ""playing shape"", and he was taking an inhaler for the rest of the season even after that. Evan Fournier was another guy that had started to play really well, went down with COVID, and took weeks of horrid games to get back to being anything close to what he was before. No player that got COVID this year came back and played like themselves. The Suns need to prepare to do this without CP3, even if he has a mild case. He'll come back but he's not going to be what he has been to this point for them. The breathing issues and ""brain fog"" after getting COVID have been almost universal for athletes this year.  Fucking awful."
I googled “Evan Fournier” and was confused until I got to an article about why you shouldn’t Google “Fournier”
evan “not fast fourier transforms” fournier
Evan “Never Google” Fournier
&gt; Fournier is seeking approximately $15 to $20 million per season  Shortly after this was printed the NBA notified Evan Fournier he'd be subject to random offseason drug testing.
That’s not entirely true. Even teams with big TPE’s like Boston had last season can’t always find a great player at that salary in the 1-year they have with the TPE. Would be great if they could stash them for a couple seasons but it’s the timer that makes things tough. Puts pressure on the team to make a move then they end up with someone like Evan Fournier when nothing else materializes.
Evan Fournier isn’t letting it go either
Evan Fournier
Defensively this is 100% true. So many times Evan Fournier of all fucking people would have a wide open 3 because Nets didnt even try to close out. P sure the Nets thought they were going to win so they coasted in some of those quarters. They definitely did not look to have urgency. Blake Griffin ESPECIALLY was a huge change.
"Lol Harden stans, never change. He was good against the Celtics with Evan Fournier guarding him 🤯🤯 crown him."
"Evan Fournier tweeted this the other day:  ""The problem with the Nets is that they force you to play 1vs1 with their switching, and its really hard to beat them at that game with their elite iso player.""  It's evident what the Nets want their opponents to do: have a shootout with their star players. The only loss we got so far is when Tatum went supernova with a 50-piece. The Bucks' stars haven't done that yet."
"Evan Fournier, Jabari Parker, Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart and Semi Ojeleye are the only celtics that have been in the league for more than 2 years. The rest are late 1st and 2nd round picks from the last 2 years. That is the Celtics team without Tatum in the playoffs this year. That team wins 20 games in a season in the East. It is probably a worse version of that Cavs team in 2018-2019 that won 19 games.  Kristaps Porzingas, Tim Hardaway Jr, Dorian Finney-Smith, Boban Marjanović, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, hell, the entire Mavs roster is NBA veterans. A lot of them + veterans. They'd probably win 35 games in the East.   Luka is a fantastic player, but his supporting cast was clearly better than Tatum's this year's playoffs. It's just a fact."
&gt; Evan Fournier  They already have inconsistency
1. Trade Porzingis 2. Resign THJ and Brunson 3. Somehow get Zach Lavine or  Bradley Beal 4. Sign Norman Powell or Evan Fournier 5. Sign more veteran centers
"Frank Ntilikina, Rudy Gobert, Boris Diaw, Evan Fournier, Mickael Pietrus, Rodrigue Beaubois, Nando De Colo, etc"
Evan Fournier?
"There’s a very upvoted post in their sub talking about every playoffs team has at least one better second option than THJ this playoffs and that’s why people should start considering Luka as the best player in the nba if he wins this series.  Some guys they named as better on the Celtics: Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier when only one of them was healthy   Some guys from other teams: Herro, maybe Kendrick Nunn, and “arguably” Kuzma, Drummond, and Harrell"
"So in other words, 5 games against a Celtics team who was starting Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier and Tristan Thompson until they had to start Romeo Langford... yuh"
"KD had Tatum lmao, its not hard to stop Evan Fournier"
Evan Fournier had the makings of a varsity athlete though
"I appreciate the idea with the Pacers but when you look at the Blazers needs in depth it doesn't really work out.  The Blazers desperately need a proper small forward; a 3-guard lineup doesn't work especially when the backcourt duo of Dame and CJ are poor defenders. I know everybody wants to see CJ traded but he's essentially an overpaid point guard. Salary match is a massive issue to the point where it's going to hamper any return they could get on him.  Also it doesn't help that there isn't any big, defensive wings available. They tried for Aaron Gordon and came out short. Jerami Grant went to Detroit. I think Jerami Grant could be available but that would require forking over a ton of assets and probably finding a 3rd team for CJ since Detroit is trying to bottom out. Evan Fournier may be available if you overpay him, but he's not there to play defense. Same with Kelly Oubre.  Going back to an Indiana-Portland trade; neither Brogdon and Lamb are proper small forwards. They're bigger shooting guards and neither are defensive lynchpins. I just don't see what Portland gets out of that."
"If you could go back in time i bet the Orlando front office would have traded Evan Fournier and Aminu for him, before last season started. The fans would have hated it but you would have cap space this summer. Now they already blew it up."
"I thought the same thing about Evan Fournier. For some reason, it feels like they've been in the league for 15 years."
"There's instances where it's true and instances where it isn't. Like Evan Fournier put up big numbers on the Magic, but most people knew he wasn't actually all that good. Depends on the scenario"
"Just [check your team's history](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cba/tax/) and you'll see how rarely the Celtics pay the luxury tax. It's not just me saying this either, check out [this article from yesterday](https://hoopshype.com/lists/whats-next-for-boston-celtics-marcus-smart-trade-evan-fournier-free-agency/) and this quote from an NBA executive:  &gt; “He’s going to look for $15-20 million a year,” an NBA executive estimated when speaking to HoopsHype. “I’m not sure where he gets that from. They’ll have to keep him since they can’t replace him. **It’ll be interesting because they have never been willing to pay the tax**, so getting around that will be hard for them. If they let him walk, there’s no replacement.”  Even Celtics beat writers will tell you that the Celtics ownership is extremely reluctant to pay the tax, saying that they say they'll do it ""for a winner"", but clearly that's not what this team is."
"[There's already talk that Smart is the most likely player the Celtics trade this summer.](https://hoopshype.com/lists/whats-next-for-boston-celtics-marcus-smart-trade-evan-fournier-free-agency/) Smart is up for an extension this summer and it's a good bet he wants more than Boston will be willing to pay him, so they'd probably be better off trading him now rather than waiting till free agency and seeing him just walk like Horford and Hayward did."
The Knicks should have gone for LOU WILLIAMS or EVAN FOURNIER! Or someone who understands offense is a thing!
"Not sure which random players you are referencing too.  Was it me comparing the two best players on the respective teams (Embiid vs Tatum)?  Was it comparing each of their best draft picks over the last two years (Williams and Langford vs Thybulle)? Or most recent veteran trade acquisitions (Danny Green vs. Evan Fournier)?  Not very random.  Roster building does not happen over one season. Some teams need years to build rosters, other teams need a couple seasons.  Boston should be the latter, instead, they have been the former and have not done good enough given the stars they have drafted, the draft capital that they had and their status as a premier organization in the league.  Not sure which random players you are referencing too.  Was it me comparing the two best players on the respective teams (Embiid vs Tatum)?  Was it comparing each of their best draft picks over the last two years (Williams and Langford vs Thybulle)? Or most recent veteran trade acquisitions (Danny Green vs. Evan Fournier)?  Not very random.  Roster building does not happen over one season. Some teams need years to build rosters, other teams need a couple seasons.  Boston should be the latter, instead they have been the former.  You are correct, my KG and Ray Allen were incorrect.  I did not remember that they were traded for.  Did Kemba Walker, Al Horford or Gordon Hayward lead to a championship?  Does Gordon Hayward leaving for absolutely nothing lead to a championship (no one would have given them a 2nd round pick and a bag of basketballs for Gordon Hayward?).  They were smart to let go of Horford when they did.  And if Kemba was that guy maybe they don't get their butts handed to them as bad as they did.    I think Tatum and Brown are great and I have high expectations for Tatum, but there is nothing anyone has seen that leads anyone to believe that they have the organization that would build around. But the good thing is that now they have turned the team over to Brad.  Good thing Brad Stevens has a reputation for being able to work well with superstars like Kyri...oh wait."
Imagine being Evan Fournier and having the audacity to ask for 20 million a year
Lmao forced? Indy would’ve had a chance to match with help from Celts taking on Turner’s cap space but Hayward didn’t even want to fuck with Ainge. Ainge thought he could play hardball instead of working with Pacers and ended up having to get Evan Fournier to make it look like he still was doing his job 😂
Celtics owners: What star did you use our $28M TPE for this week?  Ainge: I got us an expiring Evan Fournier who will demand a $17-$20M salary this coming summer  Celtics owners: Get out
what about evan fournier
"To be fair, we did technically get Evan Fournier out of Hayward leaving. But even that seems like it could potentially be a mistake as well if he leaves."
"Oooooooookay I will also be objective then  Boston lost 94 player days, which includes Tatum. The mavericks lost 93. The 6ers lost 80. And if were talking absence i have two words, Tampa Raptors. So ""by far"" is a stretch but it was a lot and certainly had an impact we all can agree.    https://www.truehoop.com/p/some-nba-players-feel-covid-effects  But all teams have beem seriously impacted by this but i do feel that its not fair that Boston is the only team allowed to use this.  No one is giving the mavericks the same pass with the same issues.  Took a quick peak at basketball reference. Tatum played 64 games this season, Embiid played 51.  The season success wasnt even close.  I know people look highly on guys like the Robert Williams and Langford.  Right now, this is opinion, Boston would take Thybulle in a heartbeat over either.  Would you want Evan Fournier or Danny Green?  (Green is on the downside of his career but hes a champion and an excellent 3&amp;D player, but i can see both sides)  Now you make a good point about the free agents.  Maybe they stay in Boston and maybe they dont.  But maybe the better question is why they don't evem look.  The last time they had success in free agency was with KG and Ray Allen.  Kyrie was great in Cleveland and great in Brooklyn.  Was it Kyries fault he didnt work in Boston? I know he is a little strange (alot strange...). Maybe a young team couldnt be helped or the puzzle pieces just never fit.   Is this team a prime Jaylen Brown and a prime Jason Tatum away from competing? Theyve made it to the east final 3 out of 4 years but in the near future is this team better than either top 3 seeds.    They got a stud in tatum, possible next Kobe. Jaylen is fine, but is he good enough to be a solid #2 guy on a championship team? Im betting on no but id love to be wrong because he is a great person and role model"
Who gets to be the Evan Fournier of this series that Harden will iso to death every tie he gets the switch lol
"You can't be as psyched as having Jabari Parker, Evan Fournier, Tristan Thompson and the ghost of Kemba Walker."
"As a Celtics hater, I can’t wait to upvote the inevitable post, “The Boston Celtics gave up 4 second round picks for 16 games of Evan Fournier”."
TIL you can't beat the Nets in a 7-game series if Evan Fournier is your third-best player
Especially when your key player is Evan freaking Fournier
"Stevens must not have liked how enthusiastically Fournier ran off the court.   ""Get your ass back in there, Evan. We're challenging"" - Stevens probably."
Life is rough when you rely too much on Evan Fournier   Just ask Orlando
Evan Fournier is ready to go to Cancun
Danny Ainge really wasted a 28 million TPE and draft picks for Evan Fournier 😭😭😭
"Considering 2 of our top 3 scorers are out and Tatum has been going nuts the past 2 games, I don’t know who you expect to do that. Evan Fournier, I guess? Or is Tacko Fall going to have a breakout game?"
Bro we have fucking Evan Fournier guarding Kevin durant and a rookie in Kyrie lmao our roster is hurting so bad rn
Evan Fournier as in the guy making the tenth most 3s per game (3.3) on 62.5%?  The only guy making more on a higher percentage is Hardaway Jr. and the only other guy making at least 2 a game on a higher on a higher percentage is Kleber.
Evan Fournier is food.
Evan Fournier has the worst hair in the NBA. I know a lot of dudes are balding but he takes it to the extreme.
Theres a pretty big difference between Ben Simmons and Evan Fournier or Kemba tho
Evan Fournier
"Lmao celtics started Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford that game. Their second highest scorer was Rookie Payton Pritchard. They were missing Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier, AND Robert Williams as well"
"What an outstanding game from Tatum, and let's not forget some great contributions from the likes of Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart, and Evan Fournier."
Shout out to Evan Fournier
Evan Fournier &gt; Kyrie Irving
"Evan ""Clay Thompson"" Fournier"
Tristan Thompson putbacks and Evan Fournier corner threes are okay in my book
evan fournier so frustrating
Evan Fournier is the best rebounder on the court
"While they are at it, they can sign the other European players as well  Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert, Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dennis Schroeder"
"That's not even true. The guy can't score currently, he couldn't get past Harden in an iso. Evan Fournier did better than him on offense..."
"Agreed, comparing r/nba to Evan Fournier is extremely insulting to Evan Fournier"
Evan fournier and some tall dude
Holy shit I love Evan Fournier now
Imagine Evan Fournier trying to insult Kevin Durant lmao.
Evan Fournier looks like one of those guys that hang around airports like in Taken
"Eh, Id like to believe that too but this Celtics team is awful offensively. They only iso but when Tatum is off their second and third best offensive players are an undersized kemba and Evan bald spot Fournier."
Does Evan Fournier do anything well? Dude is a telephone pole on defense and a black hole of indecision on offense.
Get Evan Fournier some help.
Lmao getting 2 firsts for Evan Fournier really a W for the magic.
Evan Fournier needs to come on home
"Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic   Dennis Schroeder, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert  Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Nikola Vucevic (this squad could almost be all big men)  # EURO SQUAD, ASSEMBLE"
Champion Raptors lost game 1 to Evan Fournier. I just keep repeating that in my head 😂
"Celtics employ Evan Fournier and Jabari “we don’t get paid to play defence” Parker, they’re down cataclysmically"
Evan Fournier is not a winning basketball player
Durant living the charmed life being guarded by Jabari Parker and Evan Fournier and he is 5-15 sheeeeesh
Kyrie Irving is a glorified Evan Fournier
Evan Fournier might be one of the worst playoff performers in the league compared to regular season output
Evan Fournier channeling that Game 1 Magic vibes.
"That's it, there's no question anymore. Evan Fournier deserves MVP. Jokic could never do that."
EVAN FOURNIER 60 PIECE TONIGHT
Could you imagine googling Evan Fournier of the Legionnaires?
"you have evan fournier now, you will win game 1. you heard it here first"
What about that Anthony Davis guy?     His team should get the old asterisks treatment.      Or Evan Fournier.      It's inconceivable.
I refuse to believe Russ couldn’t do this to Evan Fournier and Kemba
Evan Fournier
"Evan Fournier, a late addition to my heart &lt;3"
Evan Fournier and Chris Paul flexing on lebron everyday with the fake hairlines
Can somebody who has been following the career of Evan Fournier tell me why he's so bad
"I think they more likely will. Theis getting traded reset the luxury tax, Fournier fit perfectly with the Jays. It not a ideal situation, but I don’t see them using a big chunk of the TPE on Evan only to let him walk. Plus with Tatum extension kicking in we kinda strapped anyway."
"They had the unprotected Kings pick and Grizzlies pick which everyone thought were gonna be high lottery picks and instead ended up both being 14th (Langford and Nesmith, not exactly impact guys), and on top of that they had three max level players just walk away from them in free agency over the course of two summers, in Kyrie, Horford and Hayward. It's really not surprising that they took such a large step back this year.  If I had to pick someone who won't be back with Boston next year, it's not Brad Stevens, it's Evan Fournier. To re-sign him Boston would have to go into the luxury tax, and it's extremely unlikely they're gonna do that after the season they just had.   I'll also be curious to see what happens with contact extension negotiations with Marcus Smart this summer. Given the contract FVV got and what Dennis Schroder thinks he's worth, I'd have to imagine Smart probably believes he's worth somewhere around $22-25 million per year, and I have a feeling Boston won't want to give him that much. If Boston can't negotiate an extension with him, will they try to trade him or just let him go through next year on an expiring deal? That didn't work very well for them with Kyrie, Horford and Hayward."
“Bradley Beal with the three!”  “And they’re now saying it was Evan Fournier with the layup.”
"Imagine Myles Turner on the roster. Oh wait, why not have Evan Fournier instead"
"Tristan Thompson played 54 games, Marcus smart played a few less at 48 and kemba played 43 and you guys acquired players like Evan Fournier who have been healthy for the most part since you’ve got him but won’t show up in that stat at all. Yes you guys missed a few good players for a dozen or two games but most teams can say the same this season. I don’t think it’s fair to say you had as bad or even worse talent, even with the injures than a team tied for the 12th seed in the west. I think it’s fair to say you guys just underperformed, but it’s not the talent."
"Brown is far better than Ingram. Kemba still played 43 games this year, only 12 less than lonzo so that’s not a fair argument, and even hurt he’s far better and than lonzo. Celtics also have Tristan Thompson, Marcus smart, and Evan Fournier. I would argue that each team has comparable first options but the Celtics have a better 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th options. Yeah the Celtics have been injured a decent amount which is unfortunate but they do not have comparable talents whatsoever"
"just because he was a bench player in 2012 doesn't mean he didn't have a big role + play terrible in the road games in the finals.   You're ignoring him choking in elimination games in 2013  &gt;2015 lmao you’re brushing off an entire fucking playoff run because Josh smith and Corey Brewer made a couple threes  they didn't just hit a couple threes lmao the rockets season was over until harden got benched and brewer and smith combined for 29 points in the 4th quarter, and erased the 17 point lead the clippers built because harden was playing like ass (in an elimination game. Color me shocked)  &gt;(2015) I know you didn’t even watch but go back and look at games 1 and 2 at Oracle. Harden is doing everything hitting big shot after big shot... He was good in that series overall and only had 2 bad games  He still continued his trend of being horrific in elimination games. And ""only"" having 2 bad games in a 5 game series is pretty significant. Also, terrible/horrific/awful is a more accurate description of his 2 ""bad"" games.  &gt;(2017) Also, he had a concussion.  Lmao yeah totally man. The way rocket fans cope is pathetic. 0 evidence of this + he was so concussed that [he was caught in the club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJSuJ0B5pzE) (notice the flashing lights lol) the night of his game 6 choke  &gt;2018 Jesus Christ you can’t possibly blame him losing to 4 allstars as the only one?  I certainly put some blame on him for blowing double digit halftime leads in both games 6 and 7 + disappearing in the 4th quarter of G6.  2020 you're ignoring him continuing his trend of choking in elimination games (this time game 7 vs OKC) again. And yeah he was good in the first 3 quarters in games from the lakers series until he disappeared in the 4th.  tyler herro put up 19/6/5 on the celtics on 63% TS in the ecf last year btw, including a 37 point game. Congrats to harden on being able to put up good numbers on walking BBQ chicken known as Evan Fournier and the ghost of Kemba Walker."
"Both statements are right.   ""Walker is owed roughly $73 million over the next two years, while Horford is owed $53 million -- $41 million guaranteed -- over the same two years.  That flexibility will give Boston the potential capability to re-sign guard Evan Fournier, whom they acquired at this year's trade deadline and who will be an unrestricted free agent this summer, while also reuniting the Celtics with Horford, who spent three years with them before signing his current deal with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2019""  Straight from ESPN."
Boston was offering basically the same thing at the deadline lol - instead they had to drop a bunch of assets to resign Evan Fournier.

"We'll take Evan Fournier at 17 mil a year contract. Start him, Cade, Grant, Bey, and Stew"
"Unrelated, but I still can't believe we didn't do Hayward for Turner, a first round pick, and Lamb or McDermott. We basically did Hayward and two seconds for Evan Fournier. Jeremy Lamb alone isn't much worse than what Fournier was for us on offense (and is fairly better on defense). I understand that it was a bet on what the market would be at the deadline (and that technically it's not over, as there's $11M remaining), but man does it look bad."
Congrats to harden on beating up on the hospital celtics with (awful defender) Evan Fournier guarding him.
"&gt;Along with Oubre, only Tim Hardaway Jr., Otto Porter Jr., Evan Fournier and Georges Niang check the same boxes          Please continue snoozing on Powell - all tree y'all ♥♥♥"
They can depend on Evan Fournier for that.
Who on teamu Japan can guard Evan Fournier ?
"They needed an instant scoring option off the bench and Semi isn't that type of player. Ideal role for Semi Ojeleye is PJ Tucker type of role. A low level starter who can have 0/0/0 statline but overall can impact a game with his hustle and defense. He would fantastic next to high usage player like Luka. Just park Semi in the corner as spot-up shooter on offense. He won't ever moan about not getting the ball.  Also with the Celtics, their two stars are wing players, they just invested two lottery picks (Nesmith &amp; Langford) on wing players, and recently traded for Evan Fournier. It's a numbers games, unfortunately Semi is the odd man out."
Evan “Don’t Google My Last Name” Fournier
"marcus smart, evan fournier, jaylen brown, jayson tatum, and al horford."
"Evan Fournier should've been moved long before he actually was. Could've gotten better value since whoever did the deal would be ""renting"" longer than post deadline."
"Horford's deal cuts in half *if they want to cut him*. If they want to keep him he'll get the full amount. So Boston's question is do they want to pay Horford $26.5 million for him to play for the Celtics, or do they want to pay him $14.5 million to play for someone else.   This idea of cap space for the Celtics in the summer of 2022 doesn't factor in whatever Evan Fournier, Marcus Smart and Robert Williams will be getting. Fournier is a free agent, so if they bring him back it'll cost them, and both Smart and Williams are up for extensions this summer. How likely is it that they'll have none of those guys signed next summer while they wait to see whether Beal wants to sign with them or not? I think it's pretty unlikely."
Evan Fournier has a worse career playoff TS% than eric bledsoe... dont think that move is all that exciting
World B Flat for Kyrie is pretty genius  Never Google for Evan Fournier is my personal favorite
they re-sign Evan Fournier to a 4 year 62 mil or so contract
"Look man what do you want? Barnes was an overpay by the Kings, it was the only way for them to sign him. He's played well enough, he's not a negative asset. He's probably on the same level as Evan Fournier... who got traded for 2nd rounders which is what I said to begin with.  Y'all act like some team is backing up the trade truck for an average NBA starter."
How about uhhhh… Evan Fournier
"If you think he’s a “truly awful defensive player overall” you are a fucking bag of lays chips. He had a bad year but he’s still an elite one on one defender. He’s an average team defender. He’s not close to “truly awful”. Truly awful is Isaiah Thomas, Trae Young, Evan Fournier, etc. JB is a two-way superstar."
He will be great if he can get a change of scenario. I could see him as a taller Evan Fournier with better defense
"That's true, compared to other positions, but I mean in general...Spain is regarded as the second force in FIBA basketball, and currently have ZERO Nba All-star talent. Argentina is still relying on 40 yo Luis Scola. France best players is Goubert, second to him there is Evan Fournier. Could you imagine if team USA had to play with someone of Fournier level as their second best player?     Australia has Simmons, then the next in line is Patty Mills. Can you see the disparity I'm talking about?"
You guys are giddy about re signing Evan Fournier lol go back to your racist shit hole of a sub and city.
"I know I’m late to this discussion, but no, the Celtics got Evan Fournier basically for Hayward. Also they have $10 mill left of the TPE, so lets see if they decide to use it"
"There's been at least one sniper taking between 20-30 every year in the draft for a long time now, pretty remarkable:  **2020:** Desmond Bane (30)  **2019:** Jordan Poole (28 - arguable)  **2018:** Grayson Allen (21), Landry Shamet (26)  **2017:** OG Anunoby (23)  **2016:** Furkan Korkmaz (26)  **2015:** Bobby Portis (22)  **2014:** Bogdan Bogdanovic (27)  **2013:** Tim Hardaway Jr (24), Reggie Bullock (25)  **2012:** Evan Fournier (20)  **2011:** Nikola Mirotic (23)  **2010:** Off year - maybe Greivis Vasquez (28)?  **2009:** Darren Collison (21), Omri Casspi (23), Wayne Ellington (28).  **2008:** Ryan Anderson (21)  **2007:** Jared Dudley (22), Aaron Brooks (26), Arron Afflalo (27)."
Huh sorry but you know France is in the same bracket right ? Team USA has no answer to the Frank Ntilikina/Evan Fournier backcourt.
For sure look what they did to poor Evan Fournier in our series.  Imagine having covid brain fog for weeks and coming out of it a couple days before you have to guard James Harden one on one.
Yes but I feel like they could of gotten a better deal and they had a max cap spot this season then they got evan fournier so I don't know what the celtics are really doing.
"it saves the Celtics $$$ and gets them more cap flexibility sooner.  If they blow all that flexibility paying Evan Fournier I'll be disappointed, but if they're able to move Tristan Thompson for a ball handler (or add one otherwise, they still have TPE to use) it'll make a lot more sense.  I liked Kemba and it hurts to give up the 16th pick to move him, but I don't think his knees are going to get better and he'll always be exploitable in the playoffs due to his size.  This move gives the team more options to re-tool around the Jays while both are still under contract for multiple seasons."
true but I don't think it improves their roster at all and also if they wanted to save money then they wouldn't have gone out and gotten Evan Fournier.
"It’s not disingenuous,it’s the main reason.  Al Horford contract is $40 million guaranteed for the next two season compared to Kemba’s $70 million.   In the short term, this gives the Celtics more flexibility to retain players and trying to re-sign Evan Fournier in Free Agency.  In long term (summer 2022), Horford’s contract is easier to move off the books if they wanted to target a Max Free Agent like Bradley Beal."
"Well u could say that Ben Simmons has downgraded as well if u are talking about Horford like that. Brown, Smart, and Tatum have improved tremendously. They also have Evan Fournier, who is a sharp shooter."
I remember last free agency evan fournier said he would like to be traded to the Nuggets (and a couple of other teams) and I felt incredibly happy that someone of Fourniers caliber would want to come and play here.   Basically we have 0 chance to get any free agents worthwhile sign here
"Yeah I mean every team wants wings lol, in and of itself not the end of the world. Issue really is they could use better than Marcus Smart as their best passer. Which the current plan is to try to hope that several decent playmakers cumulatively make up for it and Fournier contributes to that. They have to really like Nesmith to be willing to give up the pick this yr. Is he going to end up becoming a better player than Evan Fournier within the next 2 yrs, idk, probably a bit much too expect.   But I dont disagree with the general idea their hope is internal improvement, and guys on their roster hitting like their &gt;90th percentile possible outcome(TimeLord espec). Just macro level this is a hard team to have extreme takes on in either direction. Tatum/Brown keeps the floor high enough where this yr is close to as bad as itll get. But there also isnt a clear path for them being much more than some 48-52 win type team in coming yrs unless they hit the jackpot somewhere. So how the team is evaluated is all about how you frame the discussion."
"Dallas - The Mavs have this kind of ""European"" culture; their historic team success has been brought by European players, like Dirk back then and Luka today. Their dream lineup would be:  PG - Luka Dončić  SG - Evan Fournier  SF - Giannis Antetokounmpo  PF - Nikola Jokić  C - Rudy Gobert"
No one do Evan Fournier.
Someone do Evan Fournier
make one for Evan Fournier
Evan Fournier
Evan Fournier
Do Evan Fournier.
Coward shit for skipping evan fournier
Be careful with Evan Fournier
Evan Fournier - don’t look it up
Evan Fournier sends his regards
Evan Fournier
"Eh, that Magic squad deserved to be in the playoffs, they played great defense, they were resilient, and they were also [one of the hottest teams in the league post-All-Star Break](https://www.orlandopinstripedpost.com/2019/4/9/18301263/orlando-magic-season-what-changed-evan-fournier-steve-clifford)  Their Game 1 performance against the Raptors personafied their 2nd half of the season run.   Honestly, if Gasol didn't completely neutralize Vucevic, I could've seen that series going to 6."
Evan Fournier level
Teague didn't suck he just was nothing special and we could flip him for Evan Fournier so he was easy to forget. Would be better than some of the players on the roster for sure.
"&gt;Evan Fournier cost the Celtics 6 2nd rounders  [U made this up fam…like outta thin air](https://twitter.com/KDTrey5/status/1416143722820079619)  From the official NBA [website](https://www.nba.com/magic/orlando-magic-acquire-two-future-second-round-draft-picks-boston-celtics-evan-fournier-trade-20210325):  &gt;The Orlando Magic have acquired **two future second round draft picks** from the Boston Celtics in exchange for guard Evan Fournier, President of Basketball Operations Jeff Weltman announced today. The Magic also acquired guard Jeff Teague in the deal, but he will not be reporting to the team. As a result, Orlando has also acquired a $17 million trade exception."
Evan Fournier cost the Celtics 6 2nd rounders for half a season of work. I don’t think teams give a fuck about 2nd rounders.
Evan Fournier boutta buy out the entirety of this
"The sticker price looks big but then considering it doesn’t kick in until next year it isn’t that much more than other solid starting 2 guards like Gary Trent Jr, Evan Fournier, Bogdan Bogdanvich, etc have gotten recently.   Terry was our best clutch shooter (well him and Devonte) so I’m ok with it. We weren’t going to have max cap space next year anyways since we need to sign Miles Bridges to an extension too."
We never feared Evan Fournier...
"Grouped with comparable SG contracts from this season.  | | Pts | Reb | Ast | TS% | Contract AAV | Yrs | |-|----|-----|-----|------|--------------|----| | Will Barton | 15.1 | 6.3 | 3.7 | .538 | 16 | 2 | | Hardaway Jr. | 16.6 | 3.3 | 1.8 | .589 | 18 | 4 | | Evan Fournier | 19.7 | 2.9 | 3.7 | .584 | 18.25 | 4-1 | | Terry Rozier | 20.4 | 4.4 | 4.2 | .575 | 24 | 4 |  So to me it doesn't look great.  One wrinkle, though - this is an extension, so it doesn't kick in until '22-'23. So the real measuring stick for the value of this extension is what shooting guards are getting next off-season, when I believe the cap is 5 million higher, which may change the dynamics a little."
"The Celtics added Horford, Richardson and Schroder, they lost the husk of Kemba and Evan Fournier they got better."
"It's because of low volume guys. Curry was 1st in 2015, 2018, 2019, and 2021 and 2nd in 5 other years.  * In 2011, Curry was 3rd behind Nash and Bibby. * In 2012, Curry was 2nd to Nash * In 2013, Curry was 2nd to Evan Fournier. * In 2014, Curry was 2nd to Pablo Prigioni. * In 2016, Curry was 2nd to Andre Miller (56 total points) * In 2017, Curry was 2nd to Nicolas Laprovittola."
"Boston Sends:  4 second rounders, a first rounder, Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier, Tristan Thompson  Boston Receives:  Al Horford, Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, and 17m TPE that they likely will not even use."
"Morey and those Dwight Magic didn't win a ring though. I remember specifically a lot of commentary around that time that said outside shooting was too unreliable to be counted on for a chip and that more traditional offense would always win titles.   The theory that the 3 opened up greater efficiency was certainly around pre-Steph. You're absolutely right about that. But it was him and Klay that together that changed the discussion from the theoretical to the practical. Guys like Duncan Robinson, Joe Harris and Evan Fournier don't get the nearly $20 million/year they're earning without Curry and Klay winning that first ring with Green, Bogut, Harrison Barnes and Iggy."
You saw Julius randle and rj Barrett shit the bed in the playoffs and think Mitchell Robinson would save you. The series wasn’t even close y’all got blown out a good portion of games and lost in 5. We beat Joel embiid Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons and are supposed to be scared of Evan Fournier and kemba walker. Again I haven’t seen a single hawks fan say we beat the bucks or bkn next year
I believe evan fournier is worth 50% of khris middleton so i do not consider this as an overpay.
John Collins 25  Evan Fournier 19.5  Spender Dinwiddie 18  Gary Trent Jr 17  DeMar DeRozan 28  Kyle Lowry 30  Jarrett Allen 20  Duncan Robinson 18  Tim Hardaway Jr 19  Normal Powell 18  Derrick Rose 14  Doug McDermott 14  I think 20 for Lonzo is fine
"Didn't ""win the offseason"" but we should be better than we were.  We got a grand  total of ~45 productive games out of those two. They were great when they played but:  * Kemba missed the first 15 games and struggled the next 15 games.    Afterwards he was great but he went on to miss another 12-13 games due to rest and a late season flair up.  * Fournier only played 16 games total with a covid infection in the middle.   We spent the entire season waiting to get healthy and then never did.  Schroder + Richardson and Horford will at least play the majority of the season.   Tatum + Brown + Smart + Rotation Players &gt; Tatum + Brown + Smart + deep roster guys filling in for Rotation players.   Semi Ojeleye started more games for us and played twice as many minutes as Evan Fournier. So while I think Fournier is a fantastic player, he didn't play enough games to be considered a big loss."
Evan Fournier is so mid. He should be playing in the Euroleague lmaoooo
"Issue with this i see is who do you poll?  Say you poll team USA, solely comprised of stars (and Keldon Johnson). Then you are only getting the perspective of stars and guys that *usually* get the calls.  Of course they aren't going to like FIBA officiating, they got less calls.    You could also poll guys like Joe Ingles, Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier since they are quite familiar with the FIBA officiating.  But then you have the opposite problem - you're polling guys that very likely benefit from the differing rule set. I don't see those three foul baiting often if at all and their opponents (the stars) suffered from the rules.   I would be surprised if they didn't like it more.    Then you have the fact that less than 80 percent of the NBA (rough guess) would not be included in this poll, and very likely would be unable because they have not experienced or played under a FIBA rule set.    So I dont see a good way to have an accurate poll."
"You guys gave Evan Fournier 20m and Derrick Rose 14.5m.....if you think Marcus is a bad deal at 19m, you must be furious with your front office."
"You are making it seem extremely unlikely but really it just comes down to Beal reaching FA. Once he reaches FA then he's like any other free agent, you give him a pitch, and he picks the team he wants. A lot of teams make plans to sign max FAs, not every team gets them, that's just how it is. Teams still do it and it's still the right plan.   It doesn't matter if Washington trades him or not, because whichever team trades for him has to go through the same thing - they have to see whether or not Beal hits FA. Beal not signing an extension or not committing to his future lowers his price in any trade.  Creating a winning roster around 3 all-stars isn't that hard. You get ring chasers, you get actual vet minimums, etc. Just look at how the Nets constructed their team - they signed a max FA with cap space, they signed and traded for another max in KD, they still managed to keep players like Dinwiddie or Harris. Or look at how Miami got Butler - they sign and traded for him and still managed to keep players like Dragic around.  Again, no one is saying that Beal is guaranteed to do anything with the Celtics. But the point is that you have 2 stars, some role players and then some pieces you can move in a S&amp;T for a max free agent. All you need to know is that max players/stars move in S&amp;Ts - whether it's CP3 to Houston or Butler to Miami or KD to the Nets, once the player reaches FA the team losing the player has very little leverage. Beal not signing an extension is really all that matters. If he doesn't go to Boston, then they see if LaVine wants to come. If LaVine says no, then what did Boston lose? Paying Evan Fournier at market rate? It's really not a big loss."
"That’s cool and all but Evan Fournier was absolutely horrendous in the playoffs and got targeted on every single possession. Not only that but he couldn’t even do the one thing he’s supposed to do, offense. He was a -46 against the Nets. During that series not only did Marcus play elite defense and not get targeted but he averaged 3 more points per game, 5 more assists per game, and was more efficient from the field.  Evan Fournier is in no way better than Marcus Smart, especially not when it matters.  Edit: and by the way, Marcus can shoot, it’s not 2015 anymore. He has gravity and is a 38% shooter when open."
marcus smart is [definitely not](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=smartma01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=fournev01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021) better than evan fournier lol
"I thought you were banned. We get it, you’re a salty Raptors fan, and yes, Marcus Smart is a better player than Evan Fournier in case you were wondering."
"4/78 for Evan Fournier? Terrible contract, overpaid, lolknicks.  4/77 for a career sub-40% shooter with declining defense? Real shit."
"I mean it's not like Evan Fournier entered my consciousness exclusively on March 25th. FWIW I think Fournier leaving the Celtics for the Knicks is a net loss for the Celtics and a net gain for the Knicks. However, I think it's fair to say he hasn't proven himself to be a valuable playoff contributor yet.    When Celtics fans were talking about whether or not we thought the team should re-sign him this came up."
"That's the risk you take, yes, but swinging for the fences is still better than being locked into 3 years of Evan Fournier, destined for nothing better than the 2nd round. We're not talking about some world beater here, Fournier is a marginal upgrade on our roster."
You wrote an entire essay on evan fournier god damn.
"I mean Evan Fournier has a career -22.5 on/off differential in the postseason. His teams have been overmatched, but it's not like he's been a  stellar pillar either. His offense was valuable against the Nets, but he pretty clearly was being hunted relentlessly on switches the entire series.    With that being said Fournier is a good player. I don't think the price the Knicks paid for him was unreasonable. There is a reason why the playoffs separate the elite players from the good players. There are only so many elite players to go around, and there wasn't one available to the Knicks in FA."
&gt; The Mischaracterization of Evan Fournier ~~in the postseason~~ on google images search
"Evan Fournier has consistently had the worst hair in the NBA over the course of his career, and he just needs to shave it all off forever."
"Not really. He got about the same amount of money as Evan Fournier. I honestly expected him to get more, his actual contract is *barely* an overpay at worst."
Evan fournier
That’s the problem. Nobody knows what Fox could do on a winning team. And he hasn’t earned anything. No all nba teams. No defensive teams. Not even all rookie teams.   I mean. Look at Evan Fournier. Dude was averaging 20-4-3 on a bad magic team last year. Does that mean he’s better than Simmons. No. Know why. Because those stats didn’t lead to wins. And fox’s numbers haven’t either.

"Hawks, Julius Randle was way too nervous this year, give him another year or two in the PO’s and he’ll be less streaky. Lmaoooo cardiac Kemba gone go into cardiac arrest after injuring his knees tryna stay on Trae young for 4-7 games.

All the other guys are rookies except Robinson who definitely would be the series changer to me but I’m still taking hawks in 7"
Evan Fournier
"Horford is an upgrade over Thompson in every single facet of the game except offensive rebounding and immediately adds playmaking to the offensive mix, which was by far the team's largest issue last year.    Losing Kemba and Fournier hurts scoring in theory, but in reality they both missed like half of all possible games anyway, and both were heavily restricted (Kemba's knee, or Fournier by COVID) in a major chunk of the games they actually did play.  Neither were significant or consistent contributors last year, so their departures are ultimately a wash.  Richardson and Schroder aren't great players, but should be able to provide reasonable approximations of the actual offensive production we got out of those two even if they don't match what we had originally hoped for out of Kemba/Evan.  Kanter is also a solid third center and change of pace option, significantly better than Kornet/Tacko.  Pritchard/Nesmith had to rush into the season without summer league or much in the way of camps.  This was particularly rough on Nesmith who hadn't seen game action in close to a full calendar year by the time the season started due to sitting out the back half of his sophomore year at Vandy.  He finished off the year orders of magnitude better than he started, and there is no real reason to suspect he won't carry that development into this year.  The team (outside of maybe Schroder) is vaccinated.  We were either the hardest hit or one of the hardest hit teams by COVID last year and, when you only have about 8 actual NBA quality players on the roster, having multiple inactives every single night really fucks with you in a number of ways.  Simply having more consistent availability, along with replacing the flotsam at the end of the roster with a few more NBA level guys, should help the team significantly.  Like you can only do so much when you have to play Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters non-garbage time minutes.  Kris Dunn might not be that good, but it's almost impossible to imagine that he would be worse as at that emergency PG spot than Carsen.  This roster makes a lot more sense than last year's.  There should be better role clarity, better depth, and better continuity between the starting lineup and bench.  Jayson is probably not going to miss half a month or play through lingering COVID deficiencies, and the same for Jaylen with his wrist/knee.  The starting lineup will probably play more than 110 minutes together over the entire season.  There is a ton of recency bias out there because the team was not very active in free agency and people think dramatic flurries of moves to be the only way a team can improve, but tbh last season was so disastrous that simply having players actually playing games should lead to some baseline improvement."
"I certainly think you are more likely to finish 3-5, but we don't know how the roster changes are going to play out.   ____  **Bulls**: Added DeRozan, Lonzo, Caruso, and Bradley  * Biggest wild card, especially when you remember Vuc only played 26 games in Chicago last season. You can't say you're better than this team because we've never seen this team.  **Knicks** Added Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier   * Last year you beat them 3-1, but it's undeniable that Kemba and Evan are a massive upgrade to their stagnant offense. I think you probably are still better, but I'm not going to say 100%.  **Heat**: Added Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker, and Markieff Morris   * The Heat were another team last year that was plagued with injuries and covid protocol. Add onto that some massive wins in free agency and I don't see how anyone could say you are definitely better.  **Celtics**: Added Dennis, Horford, and JRich, Lost Kemba and Fournier  * The biggest reason I included the Celtics is because last year they had very few games where they all played together. Brown was injured late in the season while Smart also missed 25 games due to injury. Kemba was never particularly effective with their units, so I think that the additions they made made them better than they were last year. This is another fringe case, but I don't think you can say you are definitely the better team."
RJ Barrett will have the best career out of anyone from the 2019 draft.   He was the second best payer as a sophomore on a 4th seeded team that this offseason got significantly better by replacing Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock with Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier. RJ himself has shown an incredible amount of progress and commitment to keeping that progress going.   Ja Morant’s Grizzlies will continue to be too good to get another high pick while also not being good enough to compete for a title. The Pelicans failed to make the play-in tournament twice and Zion will ultimately have his talents wasted there like AD and CP3
Yeah I'm REALLY enthused about the idea of paying Evan Fournier for at least 3 years for Dame.
"I know they are different types of guards, but Evan Fournier is literally a guard who hit the market at the same time as Schroder!!"
"I would rather have Schroeder, even at similar contracts. Schroeder's value is at an all time low because of a bad playoff run. Know who is always bad in the playoffs? Evan Fournier.  This was the first time Fournier has had a TS above 50% in the playoffs and he didn't contribute much else. Schroeder has had some bad series but he's also has a great one, and he's a better all around contributor."
"I said Dennis Schroder, and its not even close. Evan Fournier is riding high off of Olympic play right now. And, some people have allowed themselves to think the FIBA Evan = NBA Evan, when it does not work that way for any NBA player. Ever.  Evan Fournier is a nearly-decent offensive scorer in *terms of making the most fundamentals, but  still* ***too unreliable***. His career shows that the more valuable/the more important the games, the less he excels and and the less he transcends his reputation and usual output.  Moreover, Evan's ***defense*** is not effective in a Conf. Finals or NBA Finals type of scenario. *Dennis Schroder is the opposite, on defense, and that alone makes it not even close*.  On offense, I would rank Fournier slightly better than Schroder, by which Schroder has that unique quickness to the basket which Fournier only dreams of.  Schroder's quickness didnt need to be called upon often on offense much, but it always came at key times rrrright when it was needed. That can be big in the playoffs, during the late-rounds when each possession is vital."
I'm feeling pretty good about the re-tooling this summer  - +Al Horford – Tristan Thompson  - +Josh Richardson – Evan Fournier  - +Kris Dunn – Kemba Walker  - +Dennis Schroder
Whoever paid Evan fournier that money is going to regret it
"team-specific subs are the literal worst  the celtics sub rallied around the consensus that fournier signing with the knicks meant the celtics were tanking rather than competing for a deep playoff run  yes, evan fournier, who would apparently turn the celtics into a contender despite him being on the team last year when they were bad  i'm not making this up"
I do agree that the pendulum has swung too far the other way but IMO a decent center will rarely command the premium a good wing player would. Evan Fournier is a competent SG/wing and he got a 4/78M contract. A center with similar production would probably be more like 4/56 by comparison. The best centers are versatile and get paid. But the ones that are a tier below drop off in value.
Yea the top tier free agents like Evan Fournier flocked to the Knicks
Knicks legend Evan Fournier at 4 😳😳
"Still have no fucking idea why Ainge drafted a sub 6' shooting guard with such a high second rounder.   Actually I love telling the story of how they drafted Carsen Edwards because it's such a clusterfuck:  2019 draft night - Boston owns #20 which ends up being Matisse Thybulle. Boston has 3 first rounders that night so they're kind of forced to trade out.  Boston trades #20 for #24 (Ty Jerome) and #33 (Carsen Edwards). #24 ends up getting traded along with Aron Baynes to Phoenix to free up cap space to overpay Kemba Walker. Phoenix has a protected 2020 first from Milwaukee that they give to Boston.  2020 draft night - Boston's first from the previous trade is #30 which ends up being Desmond Bane (all rookie team, mind you). That pick is immediately traded to Memphis for future second rounders.  Those future second rounders are traded for a half a season of Evan Fournier. Boston then traded their 2021 FRP (#16) along with Kemba Walker to OKC for Al Horford and to free up cap space which they were hopefully going to use to re-sign Fournier. Fournier dipped for the bag.  So long story short, Boston squandered those picks (and ended up giving another pick away) for pretty much nothing."
Because the other international teams play together much more.  And the US choked one game.    You literally think a team with Evan Fournier as the second best player would be a quality NBA team.  Tell me why you think that.
Ah.  So you do think a team with Evan Fournier as the second best player would be a quality NBA team.   Yup.  You don’t watch basketball.  I’m done dude.  I can’t help this type of ignorance.
The one where every team except for team USA would be the worst team in the NBA.  Or do you think a team where Evan Fournier is the second best player would be a quality NBA team?   Seriously.  You are an embarrassment.

"While Fournier walks around with his Olympic medal, shoutout to that post on here a few days ago clowning his salary. Evan took it personally."
"Well he was the guy to stop more than Evan Fournier I think. De Colo if you let him play at his tempo, he´s gonna slice your defenses everywhere. Great shooter and creator.

Yeah but Evan Fournier is in the Gold medal game while these dudes are the Gold buffet game
Evan Fournier is a turnstile on defense
"The situations are clearly not comparable.  The Lakers attract all these players because of the prospect of playing with LeBron / AD / Westbrook to go for an NBA title.  The Knicks are not at the same stage of their project. Evan Fournier is not at the same stage of his career either."
And Evan Fournier is significantly better than all of them
"I suppose the rest of the payroll balances out.  Lakers spending $15M on Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Trevor Ariza, Kendrick Nunn, Malik Monk, Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore.  Knicks spending $19.5M on Evan Fournier."
"Players who are better per 100 possessions than Evan Fournier out of the min players on the Lakers roster. Malik Monk, Carmelo Anthony, Kendrick Nunn, Dwight Howard (arguably), and Wayne Ellington. Like his raw stats are better, but he isn't actually more efficient with the possessions he gets than pretty much any of them. He just has a larger role than any of them."
"You’re out of your mind if you think they stand a chance. You don’t stop Evan Fournier, you just hope to contain him."
"Even the Magic were [really hot heading into the playoffs](https://www.orlandopinstripedpost.com/2019/4/9/18301263/orlando-magic-season-what-changed-evan-fournier-steve-clifford) (they went from having 20-31 record on January 29th, to finishing the season with a 42-40 record), they were great defensively (that season, they had the 2nd best defense in the league during the last three months of the regular season), and even took a game off the Raptors as a result.  Honestly, if Gasol hadn't neutralized Vucevic, I could see that series going to 6."
This post misses the point though. Russell Westbrook is worth as much or more than all these players combined. Whereas all the roll players the Lakers signed were easily more valuable than Evan Fournier.
That Evan Fournier contract is one of the worst in the league
Comparing ring chasers to Evan Fournier… This is a hard one.
"That’s not true, tanking teams will part with decent players for pennies on the dollar, just like how Evan Fournier was acquired but they could’ve done better in past seasons"

lool i thought these were from Evan Fournier until i saw the one about Dirk getting himself a sister
"He actually did a great job.  Kawhi just made tough mid range shots over him.  Didn't help that for half the series Evan Fournier was guarding Siakam because we couldn't close with Isaac.  Gordon had to do everything for us that series.  Be the offensive engine (he was the only person who could create and score), be the defensive anchor and play make when they shut down DJ after game 1."
Confirmed: Evan Fournier is the Lidl version of Jerami Grant.
"Why in the world is Evan Fournier on Northern Blvd and 36 st.  Or, to be even more blunt, why in the world is a guy with a $100 million dollars on a train to an industrial neighborhood in Queens.  And I live here, before people get pissy"
"An above-average starter is somewhere in the top 60-ish players in the league, so you're still getting paid very well even if you never make an All-Star team.   I think the better question would be something along the lines of would you rather have the career of someone like Evan Fournier, or Victor Oladipo?"
"&gt; The Knicks didnt,  The Knicks definitely got better. Their roster last season was Payton - Barrett - Bullock - Randle - Mitchell Robinson  Payton was absolute ass cheeks and Kemba *should* be an upgrade (though his injury status is a big question mark), plus they added a decent 3-and-D guard in the draft who could play if Kemba is hurt (assuming Randle goes full point forward). Plus Evan Fournier &gt;&gt; Bullock, they desperately needed another player who can get his own shot.   And of course,  RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley, both of whom are 21, are promising young players who could take step ups in skill."
"Has nobody made an Evan Fournier ? I mean, that would be a NSF one right there"
"Evan Fournier, biggest fan base, expensive contracts and I don't think he'll play much better than last season. Kuzma will also annoy the fuck out of wizards fans"
evan fournier being a top 22 just dont register with me
"I wouldn't make an offer for him. He doesn't fit the Magic's timeline. They traded Aaron Gordon, Vucevic and Evan Fournier because they were determined to tank and trend younger. Plus I don't think he'd take to being in a small franchise."
knicks: evan fournier and kevin knox for ben and a first
Evan Fournier and Marcus Smart
"They were projected as a 7th/8th seed at best. I remember for an extended period they didn't have anyone averaging over 15 points a game, yet they were one of the best offenses in the league. They didn't even get one all-star nod despite being one of the top teams.  Ty Lawson/Andre Miller/Julyan Stone  Andre Iguodala/Evan Fournier  Danilo Gallinari/Corey Brewer/Jordan Hamilton  Kenneth Faried/Wilson Chandler/Anthony Randolph  Kosta Koufos/JaVale McGee/Timofey Mozgov  No eye popping stars, but the roster was pretty deep and well coached."
"**Trade 1:** Warriors get big 3 with Beal  **Details:** Beal and Thomas Bryant to Warriors for Wiggins, one of Kuminga or Moody, Wiseman, and 2/3 FRPs  **Explanation:** Warriors need some more spark given how limited Draymond is offensively now. Beal hopefully finally wants out. Wizards get a young piece in Kuminga/Moody and Wiseman along with 2/3 FRPs and a great starter in Wiggins.   &amp;#x200B;  **Trade 2:** Dame finally asks out  **Details:** Dame and A. Simmons to Celtics for JB, Rob Williams, Josh Richardson, Aaron Nesmith and 2/3 FRPs  **Explanation:** Dame and JT make the Celtics an actual threat for the next 2-3 years while Dame is still good. No way Portland says yes without getting at least JB in return, good starter in Rob Williams, and a good young piece in Nesmith. J. Rich mostly in there for salary matching. And of course, picks.  &amp;#x200B;  **Trade 3:** Luka hopefully gets a more reliable scoring option next to him and some defense  **Details:** KP for Evan Fournier, Nerlens Noel, and Kevin Knox   **Explanation:** KP has been trash for the Mavs and needs a change in scenery. Luka gets a 18 ppg consistent shooter in Fournier, a great defensive big and lob threat in Noel, and Kevin Knox as a ball boy at practice."
"Not watching any twolves games besides when we played them, I just assume Ant is on track to an MVP season next couple of years...    This same logic has me thinking Evan Fournier and T Ross are future HOF'ers"

"I agree with almost everything you said but I slightly disagree with this:  &gt; It's like saying Bird's a garbage shooter because he doesnt shoot the 3 as often as Evan Fournier  I have no problem saying Fournier is a better shooter than Bird was. It's ridiculous to say Bird was a garbage shooter because for his time Bird was a great shooter. But compared to current shooters, no he is not as good.  Fournier shoots the same percentage as Bird on close to triple the attempts. Fournier's attempts are also way more contested than Birds were.  There are obvious reasons for Fournier being better - the 3pt line wasn't even introduced till Bird's rookie year and wasn't nearly as emphasized as it is today. But IMO, weighting comparisons to say Bird is a better shooter than Fournier isn't fair to the players of today because it discounts how much work they put into shooting. To be a decent shooter in today's NBA, you have to put in an insane amount of practice hours into just shooting, which is time they could spend on practicing other areas of their game or lifting or something.  I have no problem saying Bird was a much much better player and scorer than Fournier because IMO era needs to be considered a lot more for that. But shooting is an area where the comparison is a little more straightforward. And Fournier is a better shooter than Bird was."
"Eras matter too.   The league average TS% this year was 57.2  The league average TS% in MJ's most recent playoff run was 52.4. these are widely different eras with different play styles and more..  This is why relative TS% is way better than TS%, and why it's dumb to compare a player today to 30 years ago on raw TS% alone. It's like saying Bird's a garbage shooter because he doesnt shoot the 3 as often as Evan Fournier.  MJ's playoff TS% in 98 was 54.5, it was one of his least efficient, most jump shooting heavy years (dude was older). It was still a +2.1 rTS% year (relative True Shooting %). Meaning it was more efficient than the average offense and a very good number for someone with that high usage and volume..  Ben's TS% this year in the playoffs was 56.2. which is a -1 rTS%. Meaning his scoring efficiency at low volume was worse than the league scoring efficiency.   Which one given their year had more value? It's dumb and lazy to compare shit like this"
"I don't agree that an Olympic carry job could put a player over another player all-time, especially at the tier of rankings where KD sits. If he was beating teams with multiple all-stars (like he has the potential to do in the NBA) it would be one thing, but the gold medal game was against a team whose two best players were Rudy Gobert, the DPOY... and Evan Fournier.  No disrespect to Evan Fournier, but him and Gobert are not a standard by which I'm ready to have an all-timer ready to jump another all-timer.  The Olympics are just too different from the NBA and the talent levels on the teams aren't good enough - they just have insane chemistry under rules that encourage different playstyles.  I'll entertain your premise though - who did KD jump because of his Olympic performance that he had not already surpassed based on his NBA career?"

"---------- ""I can't believe this whole era for them hasn't really worked,"" one league executive said. ""They're stuck in neutral -- and maybe going backwards.""  In the span of three years, the franchise underwent a steep and steady talent drain:  *    Irving, Horford and Morris left via free agency.  * The picks from the Kings and Grizzlies turned into the 14th selection in consecutive seasons, netting Boston a pair of reserve swingmen in Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith.  * Rozier was sent to the Charlotte Hornets in the sign-and-trade deal to land Kemba Walker, who was subsequently sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder along with a first-round pick for Horford.  * The trade exception created when Hayward left became two months of Evan Fournier and then Josh Richardson.  * Coach Brad Stevens left the sidelines to replace Danny Ainge as president of basketball operations.  The result? Boston now is short both on high-end talent and high-end assets to build around its young stars.  ""Ultimately, you can't keep losing -- albeit flawed -- All-Star talent like Kyrie, Gordon, Kemba, Horford,"" an Eastern Conference scout said. ""That adds up.""  -----------"

"Change the substitution points.  Sub in Burks with Rose and take out one of RJ or Evan earlier that way.  Sub in Randle later in Q2 and let OBI play 7-8minutes per half.  If the opponent goes small like the lakers did for stretches with AD + 4 small guys - bring in an extra wing like Grimes. The kid can defend.  To start Q3 bring on Rose and Burks and let them play with the starters.  Then bring back Kemba if necessary or go with IQ at PG while Rose gets a rest.  Sub out Randle faster in half 2. Do not let hin get in his own head.  In Q3 depending on the score start with the bench unit. Do not sub in the starters too late. If the bench struggle then try the starters again. Get DRose and Burks the ball at the end of the game.  Do not go through Randle to close out games.  Do not give Technical FTs to Randle or Fournier if we have better FT shooters on the floor - Burks, IQ, Kemba.  If our Minutes turn out to be  20,26,26,30,24 for the starters (kemba, fournier, RJ, Randle, Mitch) and 26,22,26,18,24 (Rose, IQ, Burks, Obi, Noel/Taj)   And we dictate those depending on their play then we won't see our starters getting outhustled in half 2 everytime."

"Team USA also got cooked by Evan Fournier and Ricky Rubio in the Olympics, and other guards like Nando De Colo, Patty Mills, and Tomas Satorasky played reasonably well against them too. Was Jrue really stopping them?"
"I actually thought Kemba had better defense than Fournier on the Celtics. There was an actual game in the ECF where his defensive intensity sparked our team into fighting back and he started fouling FVV really hard to get in his head, classic New York basketball, in the 2nd round.  Evan just wants to go back to offense as soon as possible."
Yes but we also have Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier lol
"Cardiac Kemba &amp; Evan ""don't google me"" Fournier"
Evan Fournier 👀
Elite defender Evan Fournier disagrees
Fournier was good for us.  We would often have him guard the other teams point guard.  Granted that was because our point guard was DJ Augustin but we had top defenses with Evan.
"They tried to move him at the same time as Aaron Gordon, Evan Fournier, and Vuc but couldn't find any takers. It's more a matter of time than anything else."
Christian Wood got big in Detroit?   How about the Orlando Magic?   Shaq   Dwight   Oladipo    Aaron Gordon   Nikola Vucevic   Evan Fournier
Evan Fournier is much more consistent and efficient than thjr. Has been his entire career  Edit: Fournier makes 19.5 mil a year. Get your facts right
"It doesn’t matter how valuable THJ is as an asset. It matters how valuable he is to the team. If you’re paying 18 mill or so for your tertiary scorer, you’re completely fine. I mean you guys just paid Evan Fournier, who’s better but not that much better, 25 mill per year."
The Kemba Walker - Evan Fournier experience
"Bojan Bogdanovic. Dude has been putting up 17+ PPG on really good percentages for the last 4 years, is a borderline all-star, can create his own shot, is actually really fun to watch, and he barely gets talked about.   I would put Evan Fournier in this category too, but he's been getting some media attention lately."
The guy in the Knicks sub who thinks Quentin Grimes should start over Evan Fournier is really on one.
Low key Evan Fournier is horny with hate for Bam. Imo it’s based solely on resentment and jealousy. But it stands out to me bc every other player in the league legit loves Bam
Evan Fournier

that one is evan fournier
Letting Fournier go can set a franchise back for years? Are we talking about the same Fournier? Evan?
"Evan Fournier is the reason why Orlando was the Sixers cryptonite, not Vuc"

"relying on Kemba, starting point guard of literally the worst team in the last 40 years and Evan Fournier, starting shooting guard on ""barely sniffed playoffs ever"" as your closing front court aint it. Gotta pick 1 and a vet"
Brad Stevens really thought this guy is worth more than Evan Fournier lmao.
Friendly reminder that Brad Stevens thought Josh Richardson and Marcus Smart are worth more money than Evan Fournier lmao.
Didn’t your GM reject a Turner for Hayward sign and trade in favour of signing Tristan Thompson and the chance to not re-sign Evan Fournier? Or was that offer never actually there?
"fear not, evan fournier and taj gibson will combine for 100 against us  you decide how much they each go for"
"Lol you and I have very different ideas of a good offseason  Kemba, Tristan Thompson, and Evan Fournier &gt; al horford, Kanter, and Schroder seems like a lateral move at best to me"
Not really. Choosing Marcus Smart and Josh Richardson over Evan Fournier should be a fireable offense.
If I had Evan Fournier money I'd Doordash food to my house every day.
Evan Fournier is a fucking beast
"Knicks are top 10 in 3 point attempts and makes, broke their franchise record in 3 point makes and Evan Fournier has been playing great. Last year they rarely took any threes and now it’s the exact opposite. How is that not getting better? The truth is u guys pick and choose what teams you care about it has nothing to do with how early the season it is"
Evan Fournier has a small bag of tricks. Either he completely wows you into an open look or he convinces you to google his name.
Doncic couldn't even make it out of the 1st round of the Olympics. Let's add Evan Fournier to the list of players who can take a team further than him.
nice player but he's no evan fournier
Why hasn’t anyone tried to pair Evan Fournier with Ricky Rubio or Patty Mills? FIBA/Olympic goats
This man Evan Fournier has one of the prettiest strokes in the NBA
cody martin looks more like evan fournier than evan fournier
"Evan ""Don't Google"" Fournier"
What did Evan Fournier do tonight?
Prime Evan Fournier or prime Eddie Curry on the knicks?
"Spencer Dinwiddie, Denis Smith Jr, Evan Fournier"
Yea bc Evan Fournier and klay Thompson are comparable...asinine comparison bozo try again. Klay has Fournier’s skillset x10 mentioning Fournier is just missing the point by choice.
"yeah you’re right, I also think Evan fournier is better than draymond, for the reasons you just listed"
Evan Fournier
Brad Stevens chose Marcus Smart over Evan Fournier. Joke of a head coach and now joke of a GM. He has single-handedly set back the organization for years. Wasted Kyrie's prime years and wasted the deepest roster in 2018-19.
Evan Fournier was the best pickup this off season
"Evan ""Don't google my last name"" Fournier going to pop off for the Knicks"
halfway through the season people are gonna be asking if evan fournier is the best value non-rookie contract in the league
evan fournier baby
"he's okay, I mean you can find players around THJ's caliber on the free agent market you don't necessarily need to give up draft picks for them  like we signed evan fournier who is roughly equivalent statistically and makes roughly the same amount of money.   he might be better than THJ at playmaking  is THJ great?  be honest with yourself"
"Screw Evan Fournier. Playing like he had something against the celtics. Never played like that in the green, just brick after brick. What a loser."
Y’all got clowned by Evan Fournier…
"Fournier is a nice player, as a Magic fan he is very underappreciated by the Magic fanbase.  Don't get ahead of yourself though, the problem with Evan is his ceiling is really high, but his floor is low and he isn't consistent enough to count on."
"No way Evan Fournier is at 7.  Career average of.567 ts%, PER 14.0, BPM -1.0, so basically below average replacement.  Last season was not much better either."
Evan Fournier 2021 Salary: $17.1 mil  Combined 2021 Salaries of the 7 mentioned Lakers players: $19.8 mil
Lol. Evan Fournier also costs more than the entire bench combined.
Evan Fournier?
"Evan ""Don't Google"" Fournier"
damn bro we cant even wait like a month to see if he can consistently do this before saying shit like that?? cuz ill tell u right now i do not recognize this man evan fournier he never played like that for us last year
That game was so fucking insane. I feel so sorry for Jaylen Brown but shoutout to Evan Fournier for being the first Knick to score 30+ in their team debut.
"You not convincing me that Evan ""Nasty Dick"" Fournier didn't throw regulation to pad his stats  4D moves only lmaoooo"
Evan Fournier deserves a google search tonight after his performance.
This was such a great game. Evan Fournier was the MVP tonight.
Is Evan Fournier the greatest Knick of all time?
I believe in Evan Fournier supremacy
Are there any better role players you can ask for than jrue holiday and Evan fournier
Evan Fournier owns Tabum
Is it too late to give Evan Fournier more money?
"Evan Fournier n'est pas un tireur de place en place, il ne va pas courir au coin pour tirer comme s'il était un troisième choix, salope ce n'est pas jj redick, c'est un demi-dieu putain, steph curry réincarné mais cette fois il n'est pas une lâche putain, il tire du logo putain et vous battre en même temps"
"Every time I watch a Evan Fournier game, he either does something amazing or looks like he has no idea what he's doing. There's no middle ground with this dude."

Espn having their first game of the season be the Evan Fournier revenge game
The Knicks.  -Randle’s shooting could prove to be a fluke as he was super efficient on super high volume last season -East has improved -i don’t like Evan Fournier or Kemba Walker
"There also haven't been any preseason games since Friday, and there is still one more day before there will be any regular season games.  I don't know what else there would be to talk about.  I mean, from the perspective of my own team, we could talk about how the transition from an Elfrid Payton/Reggie Bullock to Kemba Walker/Evan Fournier backcourt should change the Knicks offense but opens up concerns for what it will do for their defense - but we've already talked about that ad nauseum since Walker agreed to sign in July.  We're focused on the drama right now because that's what is going on and there are literally no Xs and Os to focus on."
Evan Fournier  Do not Google his surname!
Evan Fournier ..ffs
Dennis Schroeder 71 looks weird an  Evan Fournier number 94 is very weird
"Evan Fournier, Nikola Vucivic and Terrance Ross are all certified Heat killers. Not to mention, insert random volume shooter 2 guard, and guarantee they had big games against the Heat"

Easy  PG: Falco Campazzo SG: Kent Bazemore SF: Evan Fournier PF: PJ Tucker C: Bizmack Byambo   Oh you said best?
"Mitchell Robinson played 31 games last year, had a foot injury which are typically bad for big men. His career high is 9 points. He has potential no denying it, but he isn’t nothing but a role player atm, and coming off a a leg injury as well. And if you think 8 points and 8 rebounds in 31 games is more than a role player I would be surprised.  Evan Fournier is a number 2 option on a bad team, but when he got to Celtics I think that shows the exact player he is. A 3rd or 4th option. I can’t see Fournier being a first or second option on championship team, 3rd option at best. I don’t think he can carry your team. Obviously more than a a standard role player, but a Role player doesn’t have to be playing 16 spot minutes a night. Derek Fisher was a role player for the Lakers late 2000s despite being their starting point guard.   Derrick Rose had maybe his best year since his MVP season, but that also backs what I’m saying. He was their second best player. I’m not going to act like a 33 year old playing 25 minutes a night is good for the next 5 years. There’s probably one more season left of that good Rose from last season.  They aren’t your traditional role players (as in playing 15 mins a night) but we got some dude who averaged 14 on a good team once he was traded to the Celtics and went to a 3rd sometimes a 4th option, you got a young promising big man who hasn’t taken the next leap yet and a 33 year old (absolute legend) point guard who can only play off the bench. They aren’t stars either, and most likely wouldn’t be focal points on other teams."
&gt; Is OG even a top 100 player?  Is that a serious question? You could argue that guys like Evan Fournier and  Harrison Barnes are top 100 players and OG is much better than them.
"Lmao this is so incorrect I don’t even know where to begin.  The funniest part was when you called Evan Fournier, Mitchell Robinson, and Derrick Rose “role players” like they are Bobby Portis or Stanley Johnson."
"Reggie Bullock is not an amazing defender, slightly above league average maybe but nothing extraordinary. His lack of an offensive game hurt the Knicks more than his defense could help it. Evan Fournier is much more of an overall better player just because of the pressure he creates on offense. Also defense is a team effort, guys can outplay their abilities on defense with pure effort."
Evan Fournier was pretty shit in his first game for Celtics last year. I think I heard that it was the worst shooting performance of all time for a traded player debuting for their new team
"i said yuou didnt boost it much. bullock is replaced by fournier. in a vacuum fournier is better but bullock was amazing last year and is a better defender than evan. its not as large as an upgrade as it seems.   Kemba is a decent player at this point in his career but theres a reason boston let him go. dudes knees are glass, he'll probably be a bench piece and hes a defensive liability. Those arent huge upgrades."
We were a much better team than you last year. We replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba Walker and Reggie Bullock with Evan Fournier. You replaced Kyle Lowry with Goran Dragic.
"Bruh, if Evan Fournier is your #2 scorer, that team probably ain't going no where."
Evan Fournier is a Democrat hoax!
Did the research. Can confirm it was Evan Fournier.     ^(Citations: James960495 on Twitter; RUssiaBot09 on Facebook)
Yes everyone needs to do their own Google research on Evan Fournier.

"As Evan Fournier would say, it’s on the toilet staring at your phone"
Hypothetically if last year's Knicks team somehow acquired Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier and got Mitchell Robinson back from injury and drafted 3 NBA ready rookies and had everyone buy into the culture and had all of their young players improve again I feel like they could be the first seed in the East  Hypothetically of course
"Always remember, don't google ""Fournier"".   Source: Evan Fournier"

Rent it to whoever he's traded for till said player is situated enough to either buy their own or buy it off Ben. Evan Fournier sold his Orlando home to Courtney Lee after he was traded and Lee got a coaching job with the Magic.

"&gt;  That's only for positive tests geez dude these guys were all over social last year breaking every protocol they wrote NBA didn't do shit.  How can you say that as a Celtics fan? We had a number of people suspended for breaking protocols last year.   &gt; The Celtics far and away led the NBA in player-days missed to COVID protocol with 157.  Fournier had a false positive, and then had to enter protocols anyways.   &gt; Evan Fournier tested positive immediately upon his arrival following a trade with Orlando.

"I mean, yeah….  The fourth and fifth men would be pretty much average starters.  Joe Ingles.  Duncan Robinson.  Lonzo Ball.  Seth Curry.  Clint Capela.  Mikal Bridges.  Evan Fournier.  Nance.  Gary Trent.  An average starter would be somebody who’s serviceable on the court, who won’t win you games singlehandedly but contribute to the overall team.  Do I need to continue?  You need to get off 2k and start actually watching basketball, because your take is braindead."
A team of players like that should not need 3 years practice to beat Evan Fournier

Is Evan Fournier the best player in the world?
"You.just.observed Evan Fournier destroy team USA and that's what you took out of it?  In single games that variance can be huge. Bogdan freaking Bogdanovic can outplay Steph Curry over the course of one game. The distances are not that great when talking of top 50-100 of the NBA.  I dispute that you have watched a single game in your life. Your take is so mind bendingly out of how basketball is that you cannot account how the Warriors superteam lost 3 games to Harden+Paul, that you cannot account the Fiba WC team US catastrophe, you pretty much cannot account for like 1/3rd of all games ever.  Yes! Over the course of (theoretically) infinite games team US *destroys* team Europe, not over the course of a single game or even a few games. Chances are like 70-30 or 80-20 in favour of team USA. That's not ""and it's not even close"", it is far closer than you give credit (to it), literally 1 in 5 games the 20% chances team beats the 80% chances team, it is a semi frequent event."
"No I am trying to tell you how it works on court. Sometimes an Evan Fournier can make Dame his b*tch. The differences are not as great as you make them to be over single games. They are over a whole season or even a series, not over a game. Real basketball is nothing like 2k (where the better player is always better)."
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."
"# Team USA  * STARTERS:     * Curry, Harden, LeBron, Durant &amp; Anthony Davis * BENCH:    * Kyrie, Lilliard, Tatum, Paul George, Devin Booker, Beal &amp; Zion  # Team Euro  * STARTERS:    * Luka Dončić, Bojan Bogdanović, Giannis, Jokić &amp; Gobert    * BENCH:    * Domantas Sabonis, Clint Capela, Evan Fournier, Dennis Schröder, Bogdan Bogdanović &amp; Rubio"
We can't say too much right now the way Evan Fournier flexed on us
Maaan fuck two 2nds for Evan Fournier  lol
"So guys like Luka or Evan Fournier? Because they look even better in the Olympics.  I think you mean, Team USA is playing lazy and thinks they can talent their way to a gold medal."
"Yeah this was a killer draft for the C's. Jaylen Brown, a future 1st that turned into multiple players and picks - I believe the 2nds we got from the eventual trade downs from the LAC 1st from MEM was used to trade for Evan Fournier - and like you said Zizic being drafted to be apart of the Kyrie trade."
The Evan Fournier contract is the panic overpay after missing out on the (finite) big-name FAs.
"if we're going to offer *kyle lowry* 2/60, why do we offer *evan fournier* 3 years guaranteed? it doesn't add up.   but yeah, FA starts next week, I'm looking forward to it too. we'll see what happens. I don't expect to get any big names, but some decent rotation guys at good prices is what i think will happen."
"if it has far more talent why are they shooting 30%?  &gt; You think KD can't score?  watched the game, ya he couldn't really score  &gt; You think Evan Fournier is just better than Lillard and KD?  nope but unironically he wanted it more, evan fournier at 110% over kd and dame at 25%  &gt; You think these guys don't really want to win?   nope i just think they're scared of getting injured so they are playing soft, in a competition that favors more physical play.  &gt; The bottom line is the only reason that makes any sense is it is the leadership, and Popavich is at the top of the pyramid and has been for years now.  sure... but pop also took over team USA at probably their weakest, beforehand the US would send their best players full stop. this included on court leadership which the current team USA is heavily lacking. see; prime lebron and prime kobe. this year despite being able to go 2/3 of the top 3 players (lebron, steph) didn't go, cuz the US just don't care that much about international ball anymore.  &gt; This has to damage his legacy severely.  lmao what a take...  &gt; Messing up team USA is a serious flaw.  no coach can make the US' best players go. Winning breeds complacency, and it's been a long time since manu whopped the US and reminded them that international play only gets better.  if you go out there and play like it's an all star game you're gonna get trashed by NBA players that play like it's a real game.  (also important to note that AD, harden and kawhi are all injured, although i doubt any of them would've gone.)"
"It shouldn't come down to last second three pointers. The USA has **FAAAAAAAAAAR** more talent. This should be easy. But they don't play good defense and they don't effectively use the talent. Ultimately it has to come down to leadership of team USA, not the players. You think KD can't score? You think Evan Fournier is just better than Lillard and KD? You think these guys don't really want to win? They came just days after getting out the the playoffs to be under crazy covid restrictions, voluntarily.  The bottom line is the only reason that makes any sense is it is the leadership, and Popavich is at the top of the pyramid and has been for years now. This has to damage his legacy severely. Messing up team USA is a serious flaw."
I’m just excited for Evan Fournier getting 3/$60M and the ensuing Pikachu face that will accompany the 6-seed and first round exit.
"The issue with TPEs as we saw with Boston is that they require you to be pragmatic and for the most part you're going to have to give up additional assets (whether it be young guys or draft picks) to actually fill it up.  Boston spent a couple of seconds on Evan Fournier, attached a first with Kemba to free up cap space to re-sign Fournier and they still have 10M of an exception left. They may end up having to give up something else to let that 10M go to use."
"Evan Fournier last 2 seasons:   19-20: .595 TS%, .560 eFG%  20-21 .598 TS%, .565 eFG%   Duncan Robinson last 2 seasons:   19-20 .684 TS%, .667 eFG%  20-21 .628 TS%, .614 eFG%"
They both shot around 41.7% on catch and shoot 3s in the reg szn but Duncan shot 29% on catch and shoot wide open 3s in the playoffs while Evan Fournier shot 66% on them.
"Well so is Evan Fournier, he is also an elite 3 point shooter as well if u check his stats."
"If Evan Fournier can become prime Michael Jordan against us, then satoransky and behnam can be prime kobe and mcgrady"
"People *do* say those things about every other coach. It's about time they say them about popavich. His performance with Team USA should forever damage his legacy. The spurs are one thing, but you mess up America's team, and you're on the bad list.  Seriously, how are guys like Patty Mills and Evan Fournier dominating but freaking Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard Can't?"
I'm with you on this.  It's not Pop's fault Evan Fournier got 28 vs them
"Boy this is about as “nephew” as it gets 😂  ""KD you need to WILLLL yourself to victoryyy like Evan Fournier!!!!!""  Take a cold shower my man"
There's a list of players that arent ball dominant that would fit next to almost anyone.  Klay  Pg Khris Middleton  Jae Crowder Joe Harris Evan Fournier Desmond Bayne Robert Covington  Tobias Harris  Luka needs a dominant big and some c&amp;s threats.
Who would've thought that Evan Fournier and freaking Nando de Colo would beat a bunch of all-NBA guys? LOL
NEVER sleep on Evan “Never Google” Fournier
And they're aaalmost saying Evan Fournier and not Evan Fourniyay like the NBA commentators
No. Evan Fournier won't get as much touches in a NBA team as he will with France.
Where’s Evan fournier
throw evan fournier in there too ig
if that's the case players like Evan fournier who had 28 today against USA should average 50 against non usa players right?
so evan fournier should average 50 in the nba then since he just had 28 against USA right?
Clearly Evan Fournier &gt; KD
"I'm not one of these guys saying Pop is a bad coach, but I don't think he's taken this job particularly seriously, maybe he thought it would be easier?    The team isn't engaged defensively, there's no movement off the ball at all, I know it's harder to drive because of the FIBA rules but it seems unnecessarily risky to just chuck a ton of 3's every game and say ""oh well"" if they don't go in at a decent clip.    I don't really expect us to look like the 2014 Spurs but the biggest thing is we just aren't locked in defensively, even the 2008 and 2012 teams weren't running some complex offensive system, they just created a ton of havoc defensively and were obviously unstoppable in transition.    Like Evan Fournier isn't some French wonderkid who came in and took us by complete surprise, we've been watching him for years lol.   Some of these all-nba guards and wings need to take it upon themselves to really get after him."
"Evan ""Dayman"" Fournier"
"Only one of them is actually in Tokyo though lol, idk why people are acting like Embiid, Jokic, and Giannis have anything to do with Team USA or their struggles.  They got torched by Evan Fournier today."
"What we're really saying is that we don't care about the circumstances by which Team USA is failing. They held a 7 point lead with 3 minutes left and they have all the star power and the best closers from 1/3 of the league. This wasn't prime Tony Parker gutting them at the end. It was Evan Fournier  Edit: and I can't speak for the downvoters. You really just have to ignore it here and on most places in Reddit, unless it's a consistent thing."
Crazy to think we could have put together one of the nastiest teams of all time but now we're losing to Evan Fournier and Patty Mills
"I kind of feel like USA players have had it drummed into them for years that mid-range jumpshots are the worst shots in basketball, that when it comes to International play with no defensive 3 seconds, they don't adjust to mid-range now being a very viable option.   Guys like Patty Mills and Evan Fournier take a lot of mid-range shots in International play because driving for lay-ups can be low percentage when you can have guys like Gobert waiting for you all game. They need a Chris Paul in the team who already loves the mid-range, to lead the way."
"At that level...if you've got Lillard, Booker, Durant, Bam, Jrue, Draymond, Khris, etc...  How much ""coaching"" should you need to beat Evan Fournier?"
&gt;we don't have nearly the best Americans on the squad.  No team in the Olympics have the best Americans on the squad...youre out here getting rekt by Evan Fournier and Patty Mills and your excuse is you don't have Lebron or Curry or AD. I cant help but laugh.
"that’s a fair list, but where does a player like Evan Fournier, frank nilitilka, nic batum fall in these tiers? I don’t think talent is the problem"
"Sorry to ask but in my mother tongue Fournier gets you images of Evan Fournier and some kind of ancient oven, what does that search gives you?"
Maybe the players for the US should be grumbling about shooting 36% as a team (and 31% from three) instead of bitching about having to run an offense they aren't used to and blaming a 72-year old dude on the sidelines for their failure.  Maybe they should actually try to play some defense instead of letting Evan Fournier look like a French Michael Jordan.  Maybe that.
"Sure, practicing together makes a big difference, but it has nothing to do with a talent drop off like you mentioned in your last comment.  Talent-wise, the gap between Team USA and Top NBA players is smaller than Team USA and Team France.  I didn't say France was all scrubs, I said they have a few good players. If that roster played an entire NBA schedule, I'd be surprised if they're anything more than a lottery team. Rudy Gobert gives them a solid defense by default but their primary offensive option is Evan Fournier and their second option is an aging Batum. These guys are good NBA players, but they shouldn't be 1st and 2nd options on good teams. The other guys on the team are close to NBA replacement level or probably worse than that. Best left is probably TLC and I wouldn't be shocked if he's out of the league in a few years. He's played five seasons (including a few with the Sixers so I've seen him play a good bit) and he shoots under 40% for his career.  Again, I get your point that playing together is important but talent-wise there's a big gap here."
I just don't think the teams the US has faced this year are better than the teams the USA has faced in previous Olympics. That's just a cop out.   It's not like we just lost to a team with Jokic/Giannis/Emiid/Luka. We lost to Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier...
Aussie legend Evan Fournier
Please explain which team is better than the USA then?  How can you say the rest of the world.has caught up when Evan Fournier is the best player on France and wouldn't even make team USA.
"The US has more talent than other teams, the problem is not talent, it's a lack of chemistry. If anything the US has too much talent because everyone defers to each other. On France there are defined roles, which is how you end up with Evan Fournier having this nice game. On the US guys can't figure out when they should assert themselves.  Also France just has more dominant big men. The US needs AD. But outside the center position the US is not lacking talent."
"Yeah, he only has Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard and a bunch of other All-stars. They're getting outplayed by Rudy Gobert, Evan Fournier and Frank Ntilikina."
When Evan Fournier is lighting us up this doesn’t bode well.  So embarrassing #thisisoursport
This is not a meaningful post. Team USA lost to Evan Fournier and Rudy Gobert not a team a team with Luka/Jokic/Embiid/Giannis.
"Evan Fournier is more than a role player to be fair, he balled out on the Magic and could still be a 20 point scorer in the right situation."
"I think what's being said is that we are sending a team of essentially mostly max and supermax players, who are supposed to be on another level vs the world, but the world has caught up enough to be able to punish ""I'm simply better than you"" basketball strategies (e.g. Scott's secrit plays"") with a system and decent NBA tier players of their own.  It's true USA didn't forcibly send it's best possible team, but when a team co led by Evan Fournier (lmao) is beating out 10 all stars... Yeah, the world kind of caught up."
"“That’s a hell of a team”    Frank Ntilikina, Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot, Thomas Heurtel, Nicolas Batum, Guerschon Yabusele, Evan Fournier, Nando de Colo, Fenerbahçe	, Vincent Poirier, Andrew Albicy, Gran Canaria, Rudy Gobert, Petr Cornelie, Pau-Lacq-Orthez, Moustapha Fall  Edit - grammer"
Everyone is talking about how these other countries have simply caught up to our level like we're not getting roasted by Patty Mills and Evan Fournier in these games.
"Today In particular I think a few things just went right for France   KD got into early foul trouble, once he was back in the game he refused to drive because he would have fouled out with one more AND his shot wasn’t really hitting.  Evan Fournier literally could not miss, dude literally could have been hucking sky hooks from half court and they prolly would have went in, seriously 2 plays in particular one he’s falling away from 3 and drains it… another his team saves a ball from out bounds with a low shot clock dude just gets it throws it up and bam went in hardly looked like a shot.   Dame wasn’t shooting at all, I don’t know if they tried forcing him into a play maker roll but even the commentators were commenting on it… he started throwing up shots late but it was too late, Dame also wasn’t really driving… (sensing a theme yet? The team in general isn’t driving that much)   The entire team was shooting terrible, KD, Lavine Jrue all missed WIDE open 3s late, Jrue should have for sure driven prolly KD and lavine too Bam missed TWO FT lates   Tatum looked like he didn’t belong in the roster and coming from a Celtics it was disappointing to watch cause I KNOW he’s way better than he performed.  Booker was pretty similar but I don’t watch him as much at Tatum so I can’t speak too much on him"
"The world HAS improved and the NBA players don’t get the calls they used to. When you combine those two things, its tough.   On top of that, they are a thin team. I thought Jrue Holiday was our best player today. You know, the guy that got there YESTERDAY??  Also, the team sounds good when you say their names but when you watch em play- Tatum was shit today. Lillard wasnt good. Durant was in foul trouble and wasnt great.   That means youre depending on matchups like Zach LaVine vs Evan Fournier, which isnt THAT lopsided."
"Keep the Copium coming, I'm enjoying drinking it all up.   This B team has supposedly the best player in the league by many peoples metrics in KD. The PG of the NBA Champs, the Wing of the NBA champs. Former NBA Champs, the star player of the Bulls, Blazers and Suns. Booker unironically thinks he's the next Kobe. And they all just got schooled by Evan Fournier. EU &gt; NA"
What? None of that should matter. You guys literally have the best player in the world in Durant and 10 other high level all star caliber players? What more do you need to beat Evan Fournier and France?
Terrible logic. You think Evan Fournier is better than KD or Lillard?
"Holiday is top 3, right behind Patty Mills and Evan Fournier."
"He does, but only for Team France playing against the US.  Evan Fournier is a pretty good basketball player, top 5 in France's history I think. And he kinda feasts on Team USA. He just can't replicate that in the league, I don't know why"
KD definitely talked shit to Evan Fournier in the playoffs this year if I remember correctly so this must feel good for Fournier lol
Evan Fournier gets his revenge on KD
That's unrestricted free agent Evan Fournier. Someone's gonna give him a bag after he pieced up Team USA.
"hey man, Evan Fournier has a career playoff TS% of 49% and has ALWAYS brought the clamps, don't be disrespecting this young French legend lmao"
"you got beat by nic fucking batum and evan fournier? Go fuckin home usa you suck, what happened to usa basketball?"
"2008 and 2012 Spain were much better teams than any international squad in these Olympics.  Talent level is not the issue, this USA team is still far, far more talented than any roster here.  Like we've watched Evan Fournier for years, we know he's not some hidden gem secret superstar lol."
"Of all the people on the court, it’s Evan Fournier hitting the go ahead 3 😂"
Nah they'll sign Evan Fournier instead.
"Good point, but who let Evan Fournier score 28 points?!"
"Bro Ekpe Udoh led Nigeria to a win over a team that has KD, Dame, Tatum, Bam, Lavine and more  Talent still clearly isn't the problem. Its the coaching and lack of team play. Evan Fournier was right when he said that you can beat a far more talented roster with just simple teamwork  These other countries have been training together for years and just want it more than us"
Always loved Evan. For some reason when he left the Nuggets I bought a Fournier Magic jersey
Idk what changed cause Nando de Colo and Evan Fournier aren't exactly defensive studs
Imagine needing 6 all NBA players to beat Evan Fournier and guys that aren't even in the league lol this is embarrassing
Evan Fournier scored more in this game than his entire career in Celtics.
Even our B team should beat a team who’s two best players are Rudy gobert and Evan Fournier
"But it's still not USA vs. the ""rest of the world"" even if the top talent is spread across more continents. It doesn't matter if there's more top players from other countries when most countries best players still wouldn't make team USA.  If Jokic, Giannis, and Luka were on the same team no one would be surprised if they beat team USA. But guys like Evan Fournier and Patty Mills who are leading their countries to victories still wouldn't even make the USA roster"
Nic Batum and Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier just beat us today…  One guy on their team (Gobert) would make team USA
"Keep making excuses for Pop. He’s one of the greats but since taking over coaching Team USA our teams have consistently underperformed. A team of 12 NBA all-stars and for some stupid reason Keldon Johnson (Pop playing favorites) and Javale McGee (I honestly don’t know) shouldn’t be losing games to a team with Evan Fournier and Gobert as their best players. I know teams like France tend to be more cohesive than the US, but Pop deserves a ton of blame here along with his players (especially KD and Dame)."
"Where were you when the great USA loss of 2021 happened? I remember it like it was today. My son had watched Space Jam: A New Legacy prior to the game. During the game, in an excited tone he asked, ""papa, when is Dame Time?"" I replied, ""son, it is not Dame time today. The powerhouse France basketball team, it is their time."" My son looked down in dissapointment. We continued watching the game and Evan Fournier relentlessly dropped bombs on the US team like Japan on Pearl Harbor. My son couldn't take it. He stood up, basketball in hand, and cried in the corner. I regret not consoling him that day. To me, this match was a foregone conclusion. The USA had many struggles in exhibition. But to him, they would come back and win when it mattered. My son, crushed by the game gave up basketball that day. He is now 28 and works in a coal mine, smoking cigs with a man by the name of Blake Bortles. What a weird name. Bless that boy for having hope, but that was the day dreams died in the USA."
We let Evan Fournier score almost 30 …. Evan Fournier
"Some GM is debating right now whether to give Evan ""Don't Google Me"" Fournier the max. Just hope it isn't your GM"
"Evan ""Patty"" Fournier"
"Every other team is getting better, but Evan Fournier isnt at the level of KD, lavine, tatum, lillard or jrue. I could probably keep going. The USA, even with just the talent that decided to play should trounce everyone else.  Problem is they can't play defence and only know how to play iso ball"
"Evan ""google me"" Fournier"
Trae young would’ve put the clamps on Evan Fournier and held him to 48 instead of 28
"Just my thoughts on the game. I think international basketball is a different beast compared to the nba. Hard nosed defense really matters and flopping will not fly with these refs.  I think these 2 factors really impact the way team USA is playing. I mean Evan Fournier is the leading scorer for the game with 28 pts. While usa have Holiday with 18 pts, KD has 10 pts, Dame has 11 pts. You cant win with that, they better wake up quick if they want a podium finish."
"It’s Nic Batum and Evan Fournier on the opposing perimeter lmao, we don’t have an excuse because we “only” have Dame and Lavine and Jrue and Booker and Tatum"
Dame Kd and Lavine combined is one point more than Evan Fournier lol
Get they bum asses back on the plane we don’t wanna see another damn game. Worked by Evan Fournier ☠️☠️
Games with at least 6 three pointers in Celtics history:       - Evan Fournier 3x.  - Larry Bird 2x.
FRNACE IS NOW THE COUNTRY AT BASKETBALL 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷   (And Algeria as well by way of Evan Fournier 🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿)
"Evan ""Google me KD"" Fournier"
Evan Fournier is about to get paid and he deserves it.
"Be real, you just got cooked by Evan Fournier.  I am not sure he even makes the US squad."
"I dunno man, NBA superstars Evan Fournier and Rudy Gobert looking great."
Couldnt stop Evan Fournier lol
"Yeah none of those guys on the Lakers are going to be giving starter-level production, not even close. Evan Fournier will."
Gow does Evan Fournier still have a market? Didn't he completely flub for the Celtics in the playoffs?
That’s definetly not true about the Knicks lol what are you smoking? They have the same roster as last year but replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba Walker and Reggie Bullock with Evan Fournier
I feel like Evan Fournier got a nice value boost
I'd rather have Evan Fournier than those scrubs.  Such a garbage take.
"We replaced Reggie bullock with Evan Fournier and we added kemba walker instead of Elfrid Payton and we didn’t improve? 🤣 you’re too much. Refer to the last line of my previous comment   Also, no one was signing with the Lakers when they were shit in the 2010s. Were they a small market during that time?"
"FIBA’s dream to have that elusive Evan Fournier and Nic Batum versus team USA match has finally been realized, and all it took was the sacrifice of one of the most popular players in basketball."
\*Olympics Finalist Evan Fournier
"This must be retaliation for this post from earlier today  “ The Lakers will spend $15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. The Knicks are gonna pay Evan Fournier $19.5M per yr.”"
Only Knicks haters would find a way to call the Evan Fournier contract bad
Evan Fournier is better than each of them right now
Evan Fournier after the game telling french tv about the upcoming final that they better not change the broadcast from the final to equestrian! Legend
Evan Fournier should NOT be the bar here. Dude got overpaid by the Knicks who were desperate to add talent. No one else was giving him that contract.
Yeah that Evan Fournier deal was a stroke of genius
"The Knicks gave Derrick Rose, Evan Fournier, Noel $43+ million per year. Doesn’t seem great, (RIP my inbox) but I do like the Randle extension and the Kemba snag though."
Knicks Legend Evan Fournier
"New York Knick, Evan Fournier."
"""Faudra pas changer pour mettre de l'équitation, je vous le dis !""  lmao Evan Fournier."
Evan Fournier
"Evan Fournier n'est pas un tireur de place en place, il ne va pas courir au coin pour tirer comme s'il était un troisième choix, salope ce n'est pas jj redick, c'est un demi-dieu putain, steph curry réincarné mais cette fois il n'est pas une lâche putain, il tire du logo putain et vous battre en même temps"
Let’s go Evan Fournier
Evan Fournier? Fuck you bud never heard of you. Big up Luka
I the evan fournier is a better all around player. THJ can be hit or miss for me. If ain’t making shots he’s useless on offense. He does play D pretty well. Evan can run an offense and is way more dynamic on offense. He’s eh on defense but not as bad as people think.
Thx for Desmond Bane   Your username is trash too.   Jayson Tatum might average 20 this szn. Evan Fournier is &gt;
"It’s so weird. I know we talk about roster construction but the honest truth is the Damian lillard, Tatum, etc are being outplayed by guys like patty mills, Ricky Rubio, and Evan Fournier. I have no idea why international players seem to get way better in fiba while USA players seem to play much worse!"
The Knicks just gave Evan Fournier $74m lol
"Yeah 20 mil is solid starter territory now. To put that into context, this season THJ, Jarrett Allen, Duncan Robinson, Evan Fournier, and Norm Powell are making in the ballpark of $20 mil a year now. I would have FVV over all those contracts."
Evan Fournier has got this 💪
"Big achievement for Luka. Unfortunately, one man can’t carry a team forever (as seen with Lebron in the 2007 finals). He still has to beat a French team with Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier. And if they manage to beat them, they’ll be David when they face Goliath (Goliath being the US, though they’re not having a great Olympic run so Slovenia may actually beat them). But that shouldn’t take away from Luka’s dominance"
"Evan fournier is a legit player and would be the 3rd best scoring option in Boston. You are acting like if Celtics signed him for the same deal, they wouldnt be able to trade him. 3 years deal with 1 year team option, plays out 1st year and then there are 2 years left. He is very easily moveable.  Players similar to fournier or worse got similar contracts to him. Celtics gonna be shocked when they see that their team isnt gonna go anywhere with marcus smart being their 3rd best option"
"Not sure how any Knick fan can be disappointed with this offseason. We essentially traded Ntilikina, Elfrid Payon, and Reggie Bullock for Evan Fournier and Kemba Walker.  And didn't give up ANY assets or sign any long term high dollar deals."
"Knicks fan started it bud, and you’re acting like the city of Chicago doesn’t own New York.   Knicks paid Evan fucking Fournier 70+ million and they try to shit talk Demar’s contract 😂😂"
pre-apology for when olshey takes evan fournier mitchell robinson and kemba walker plus picks for dame at the deadline
for now  julius randle and evan fournier can only get you so far  have fun being the pacers for the next 20 years while we dominate in a few years with our two superstars
"Knicks were a top 2-3 defensive team last season and the 4 seed. We took the same roster and traded Elfrid Payton, Frank Ntilikina, and Reggie Bullock for Evan Fournier and Kemba Walker. I'm not sure where your logic is?"
"knicks resigned their guys, signed kemba who just got brought out because no one wanted him enough to give up assets or pay him on that contract, and signed evan fournier lmao. at least lowry and pj tucker have playoff experience, lowry is definitely a better player.  lakers signed vets and potentially nice young players like monk and nunn, but im not bout to defend them  bulls got way better, brought in a real point who plays defense, and demar derozan lmao  knicks are easily below the bulls and heat"
"We replaced Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock with Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier. I think it’s safe to say we have gotten significantly better while keeping our chemistry from last season. Will we finish higher than the 4th seed? I don’t know, but we will be a better team than last year."
"as someone who has watched evan fournier for a very long time, he’s really not great, i wouldn’t want my long term cap space being tied up in him (because they already have two huge contracts). knicks are only paying kemba $8 mil so it’s not a big deal but kemba was legit awful for the celtics last year, the starting lineup will be fine for the celtics but their bench is awful"
Seriously- Knicks fans getting lathered up over Evan Fournier and injured Kemba after a year as a 4 seed is kind of hilarious and on brand.
I’m a Nets fan so my opinion is obviously biased.   I think the Knicks are just as close to being a 9-10 team in the Play In Tournament as they are a 4-5 seed.   Last year the Knicks had the advantage of flying under the radar. So while other teams walked into the games thinking “Same Ole Knicks” the Knicks actually tried hard every game because they had to in order to win.   This offseason so far they basically ran back the same roster except swapped Bullock for Evan Fournier. That’s not a massively improved roster.   Now the rest of the NBA knows they are least have to make an effort when playing New York compared to last year.
Hmm no Evan Fournier and Kemba are worse. Collins is young and this deal is actually a pretty decent contract
"[ [Jeremy Cohen] The Celtics essentially traded a 1st round pick, two 2nd round picks, and took on Al Horford's contract for Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier to walk to the Knicks for cap space](https://twitter.com/TheCohencidence/status/1422922402254700545)"
"The Celtics traded s 1st round pick plus 2 rounders and took on Al Horford’s contract for Kemba and Evan Fournier to walk to the Knicks for cap space (only about $28M per year combined too),  #LMFAOOOOOO"
Knicks just signed Evan Fournier to a $78M and this is top 3 worse lol
"theyre signing evan fournier, thats what they’re doin"
Why you don't Google Evan Fournier without adding NBA to the search bar
They got Evan [Fournier](https://www.google.com/search?q=Fournier&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_enPH859PH859&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03__yK95EJP5-R8U6567_55ImXfyg:1628047380205&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj55ZiOtZbyAhVPzmEKHf7dAncQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1162&amp;bih=571)
Don’t forget Evan Fournier heroically leading the Knicks to the 6th seed.

Evan Fournier has 2/3rds as much negative value in 1/4 the minutes lmao.   Most guys don't have 2k+ playoff minutes played.
"Thats just flat out absurd.  First off, Knicks haven't even extended a player that they've drafted since 1994. They also just paid a New York premium to lure a player in Evan Fournier for $18m/yr and keep Nerlens for $10.7/yr  Second, Miami just signed Duncan Robinson to $90m and lost Kendrick Nunn for nothing.  Finally, Hawks just drafted Jalen Johnson. I hope the highest of hopes that we re-sign JC to $125m/5 and think its beyond fair, especially if we structure it well. But if there were a single guy that I would choose to replace JC someday? Its Jalen Johnson.  Hawks also landed several of the hottest FAs last season in Gallinari, Bogi, and Rondo  Your comment has little to no basis and is grounded entirely in the faulty perception of media's ""big market"" clickfarm bs"
"Oh I see. In that case, yeah I agree. I mean, Fournier is a good TPE acquisition for what it's worth, im surprised they didn't want to match $18M. Having Evan as a third option over smart does a lot for your offense (admittedly much less for your defense, and maybe they wanted to prioritize that)"
That's an overpay. The idea of Evan Fournier is way better than the reality of Evan Fournier.
Fuck Evan Fournier
"The point is losing is a big indicator of his ability as coach, because even a mediocre coach should crush the competition with the talent gap favoring team USA. Moreover, In the nba you don’t get booted after one loss like you do in the knock out stage in these international competitions. So you need to coach like that. For example at FIBA he stuck with small ball despite that Gobert was dominating, with the result being a loss, and eventually a 7th place finish. Here he has not set up schemes that get his guys shots. Against France Evan Fournier had like 25 shots in the game and dominated. I think KD only shot like 12. He needed to get the ball to his best player more and set the defense to shut guys down who are carrying the opponent’s offense. He doesn’t do that stuff which is why they lost."
There is still a substantial gap in talent. There is no excuse for a coach to allow team USA to be dominated by the likes of patty mills and Evan Fournier.
It’s more like :  1. FIBA Patty Mills 2. FIBA Luka Dončić 3. FIBA Evan Fournier 4. This Michael Jordan guy
"Fyi  &gt;Evan Fournier said his first intention was to re-sign with #Celtics: ""That was my priority going into the summer. Because I knew the place. I talked to Brad and we couldn't get a deal done, obviously. I was more inclined to sign there because they traded for me."""
"Evan Fournier n'est pas un tireur de place en place, il ne va pas courir au coin pour tirer comme s'il était un troisième choix, salope ce n'est pas jj redick, c'est un demi-dieu putain, steph curry réincarné mais cette fois il n'est pas une lâche putain, il tire du logo putain et vous battre en même temps"
FIBA Patty Mills FIBA Ricky Rubio FIBA Luka Doncic FIBA Evan Fournier FIBA Luis Scola  I don't think anyone's beating this team smh
"Hi, Evan Fournier was on the Boston Celtics until yesterday, so most evaluations of how much he's worth would also reference Boston's willingness to pay the same amount"
"Evan Fournier 2020-2021  - 17.1 PPG / 3.0 RPG / 3.4 APG / 1.1 SPG - 45.7% FG% / 41.3% 3P% / 78.8% FT% - Scored 20+ in 18 out of 42 games played last season  He's not star material, but by all means, he is *good*. Quit capping"
They’re not cheap idiot. They want cap space for the future so signing Evan Fournier made zero sense.
"Sucks to lose Fournier, but to have kept him, it does pose the question ""Where are we going paying Evan Fournier as your 3rd highest player?"""
"Evan Fournier is not the difference between this team winning or not winning. We are really far out right now, Evan Fournier at 20 mil a year for 4 years does not help enough and probably hurts in the long run when we can't look at top FA the next few years"
Duncan Robinson is Evan Fournier minus like 8 yrs of nba experience
"I would prefer Evan Fournier to THJ. He's a little better playmaker than THJ. Oh well, at least THJ is already comfy with Mavs."
We basically swapped Bullock for Fournier. Remember how we got exposed on offense in the playoffs? Evan will help us more than Bullock who can't score on Trae
Evan Fournier disease?
Boston legend Evan Fournier
I just looked it up in the dictionary and it says Evan Fournier at 20ish million a year to a team that got embarrassed in the first round.
"2019: ""That's too much money to spend on Al Horford! Glad we let him go.""  2020: ""That's too much money to spend on Gordon Hayward! Glad we let him go.""  2021: ""That's too much money to spend on Evan Fournier! Glad we let him go.""  Bonus 2021: ""That's too much money to spend on Kemba Walker!

You know this is for Evan Fournier right?
Evan Fournier to the Knicks. Nope don’t like that.
"Alec Burks, Nerlens Noel, and Evan Fournier.  The $140mil in contracts the Knicks have given so far today"
"&gt; Free agent Evan Fournier has agreed to a four-year deal that could be worth as much as $78M with the New York Knicks, source tells ESPN."
I feel like we saw how good your team is if you're asking Evan Fournier to be a top 3 option.  You're the Magic.
Evan “Google Me” Fournier
Evan Fournier possibly?  I’d like that one
That’s Evan Fournier money
"Respectfully. As a Magic fan who over the years has seen more of Fournier tanking my team than any human should have to stomach, I can confidently say that unless your first two options are AD and Lebron or equivalent, he is not your third option on a contender. If I have to watch Evan make one more haphazard cut to the basket and lazily toss the ball up against stronger players and go ""ARRRNGH?!?"", instantly looking for a foul when there was none, Imma hurl."
They might need a sign and trade if they start signing other players like Evan Fournier.
boy i dont know if quoting playoff shooting figures is a good way to make an argument for evan fournier of all players.
"""I'm hearing the Knicks and Evan Fournier contract talks are starting at $18m""  Not closing in on or anything like that. This is still very speculative, so I'd take with with a heaping pile of salt"
A good 4th option but in no world is Evan Fournier an “elite” 3rd option
Would be tough to spend all of our league leading cap space on Evan Fournier
"If we trade Turner we'd need either a defensive-minded stretch 4 or another wing to keep up with the modern NBA offense. We tried that with the failed Gordon Hayward trade.  I don't particularly agree with trading Myles Turner regardless because our defense would plummet. But, if that's the direction that the FO wants to move with then you need to find pieces that fit the void left behind.   Barnes is a pretty underrated wing that is actually a 2-way player - I'd rather have him over Evan Fournier or whatever."
Gonna die laughing when the knicks blow their cap space on Evan Fournier
Evan Fournier stock rose after last week Sunday
"I’d like to have a literal role player all stars like Afunkydiabetic’s list. Like, obviously it’s a shit accolade, but it’d be nice to see dudes get some shine who don’t typically.   If it’s anything like how Evan Fournier and Patty Mills play in the Olympics then it’d be a lot of fun."
Considering they’ve already lost to a team led by Evan Fournier and Rudy Gobert I’m going to say yes
Oh god we're going to throw way too much money at Evan Fournier aren't we...
"Miami just picked up his option but still likely Dragic gets moved. Tim Hardaway could be on the move. Evan Fournier could be on the move. Norman Powell is out there coming off 2 really really solid seasons. Patty Mills can shoot the shit out of the ball. Dinwiddie is a name but I think he might end up getting paid.   That’s a few, and I know there’s a couple other names that’ll get much less but still be good for a team."
"Jrue Holiday nor Kris Middleton are ""above average role players"". Those are 3 all star caliber players that were also elite defensively, ""elite defensively"" being the key factor. The point is, this Celtics franchise will be no more or less successful relative to a championship with Evan Fournier, and at 4/80 or 3/60, there's a lot better argument that our odds increase if we don't match an offer like that."
Fiba Evan Fournier though
because evan fournier is french so he was trying at least
"Evan Fournier is apparently Michael Jordan in the Olympics, so I'm hoping he plays well next season"
"I think saying ""some year they need to dip into the tax, and the fact that they haven't recently says volumes about ownership"" is pretty revisionist.  First of all, by the end of the 2019-20 offseason, the Celtics had been in the tax for at least two seasons already (can't see past that on Spotrac) and had two playoff runs (including an ECF run) to show for it. You can't say that ownership isn't willing to spend into the tax when that example is right there.  The Hayward move -- as much as it epitomizes lost value -- wasn't motivated by tax reasons as much as it was by the player's own desires. You could say that we should have paid the $24 million+ it would have taken to keep him, but I'm unsure how much we would have needed to outbid Charlotte by. Remember, he wanted to go to Indiana, and after the fact, it turned out that he also had a desire to go to Charlotte after their FA pursuit of him in 2014.  But even if I were to buy that past offseasons were disappointing because of ownership's desire to not spend into the tax, that has exactly zero to do with this offseason. Because every offseason brings a different market and different opportunities. Whatever I feel about the last few offseasons, I don't mind them not spending big this year because I don't think there's a realistic target who vaults this team into contention territory.  If we were to dip into the tax this offseason, who would you say we should get? And how? Does that person substantially increase our chances of getting a chip this upcoming season, especially once you consider who would have to leave to make it possible? If they don't, then there's no reason you should spend into the tax. I just don't think Evan Fournier or Kemba makes the difference, so I'm 100% down to use this as a bridge year and clean up the cap sheet.  TL;DR - 1) Ownership has spent into the tax; 2) Their big recent cap clearing move before this year probably only had the tax as a distal cause rather than proximal; 3) This offseason presents few opportunities to use the tax in a way that helps us win, and running it back isn't worth it when we can clear the sheet."
"Boston will probably end up signing and trading him to whomever makes him the best offer, and then maybe the Celtics will get another TPE they can use to assuage their fanbase that they're not just losing all these guys cause they're too cheap to pay them. That's how they sold them on having Hayward walk, and what did they do with ""the biggest trade exception in history""? They used it on a couple months of Evan Fournier, who now looks like he'll be gone too."
But can he get past Evan Fournier tho ?
Evan Fournier looks like prime Steph while the entire US team cant hit spot up open 3's. Truly bizarre.
*Google me Chuck!*  \- Evan Fournier
Is Evan Fournier the greatest basketball player of all time?
MAESTRO EVAN FOURNIER
Evan Fournier is just a better Devin Booker
"I said this in the game thread but Evan Fournier n'est pas un tireur de place en place, il ne va pas courir au coin pour tirer comme s'il était un troisième choix, salope ce n'est pas jj redick, c'est un demi-dieu putain, steph curry réincarné mais cette fois il n'est pas une lâche putain, il tire du logo putain et vous battre en même temps"
"idk how Zach only had 6 shots. literally everyone but him and bam shot 40% or lower. it's disgusting honestly if no one can score on Evan Fournier. fucking Evan Fournier scored the same as Lillard, Tatum, and Durant combined lmao but yeah it's Pop's fault we shot 37%. Tatum, Lillard, and Durant can put up 50 in the playoffs but can't get 20 on Yabusele and Evan Fournier lol"
Is Evan Fournier the GOAT? 🐐
nando de colo and evan fournier outscored everybody but Jrue holiday.
Ggs France. Well earned.   Evan Fournier was hella dope today and made us pay
**MAX EVAN FOURNIER**
FIBA Evan Fournier is the best basketball player to ever step on a court
Evan Fournier made to look like prime Jordan. Absolute scenes.
Getting rekted by evan fournier lmao
We need a “You just got beat by Evan Fournier”
Supermax incoming for Evan Fournier
"As I have always said. Lillard, Durant and Booker are good and all, but they are no Evan Fournier."
Oof imagine getting out shot by EVAN FOURNIER
Evan Fournier.  Magic legend.
CELTICS NUMBER 1 OPTION EVAN FOURNIER ☘️ ☘️ ☘️
"KD, Dame, Jrue, Lavine all can't go toe to toe with Evan ""don't google his name"" Fournier?  Lmaoooooo 💀"
Evan Fucking Fournier
I didn’t get up at 8 on a Sunday to watch us get wrecked by Evan Fournier but I am also not mad about it
"Evan Fournier  n'est pas un tireur de place en place, il ne va pas courir au coin pour tirer comme s'il était un troisième choix, salope ce n'est pas jj redick, c'est un demi-dieu putain, steph curry réincarné mais cette fois il n'est pas une lâche putain, il tire du logo putain et vous battre en même temps"
Evan “Evan Fournier” Fournier
"Evan ""Patty Mills"" Fournier"
"Evan ""Olympic Patty ""Michael Jordan"" Mills"" Fournier"
Celtics Legend Evan Fournier
Evan Fournier on fire.
"Evan ""French Andrew Gaze"" Fournier"
If Evan Fournier can do this Patty Mills is gonna drop 40 on these clowns
"I don't like to sound negative, but let's be honest. This French team is overrated. Nando de Colo and Evan Fournier are like two of the worst perimeter defenders in the Olympics. Japan was targeting these two defenders in the exhibition game and made Hachimura look like Hakeem."
Evan Fournier saw bam in the opponents team and thinks he's playing the heat
Evan Fournier cooking team USA lol
Why is Evan Fournier not mentioned in GOAT discussion?
Evan Fournier
"The Celtics would actually lose *more* players if they wait to get him in free agency.   If the Celtics trade for Beal right now, they can conceivably re-sign Evan Fournier and keep Al Horford in addition to Beal/Tatum/Brown.    Signing Beal in free agency next year means trading Fournier for no salary back, waiving and stretching Horford, letting Smart walk for nothing etc in order to clear cap space. All they're really saving is some picks.    The best way for the Celtics to build an immediate winner is to trade for Beal right now."
"Beal had a higher usage % than Westbrook this season lol, what are you talking about. When Beal was scoring all those pts like 40, 44, 47, 60, his team was losing and they were headed to the lottery, but Westbrook's triple double explosion at the near end of the season pulled the Wizards to the 8th seed and not saying Beal didn't contribute but Beal only has to share the ball with Westbrook and Beal still had a higher usage rate. Meanwhile Brown had to share the ball with Kemba, Evan Fournier, Tatum, Marcus Smart."
Evan Fournier is only 28.
Thought you were gonna make a joke about testicles and Evan Fournier
"Nuggets would have:  Nikola Jokic  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Jamal Murray   Evan Fournier   With Melo, Michael Porter Jr.,  Monte Morris and Manimal in the rotation"
Kevin Porter Jr.   Devin Booker  Evan Fournier  Kevin Durant  Kevin Love    Love is getting smoked at the 5 otherwise they’re alright   Where were you when I rhymed Kevin with Kevin and Kevin?
"you could join Celtics Nation, we got 17 rings but that's the past and also people get mad when I bring that up since they were won back in the day but anyway  currently we have one of the best young duos in the NBA, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both 25+ PPG scorers with multiple playoff series wins under their belts. As well as these guys, you'll surely love rooting for   Marcus Smart, the heart &amp; Soul of the team who wears his heart on his sleeve and dives for every loose ball.   Al Horford, our steady veteran presence.   Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith, our two terrific sophomore players who can shoot the lights out and make tons of hustle plays    Rob ""Timelord"" Williams, he does cool dunks and blocks and it's awesome  Tacko Fall, he's 7'5 lol(or 228.6 cm)  as well as many other players such as Romeo Langford, Evan Fournier, Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, Jesusemilore ""Semi"" Talibejesu Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Moses Brown, and so many more.   We also have fans who are super passionate about the game and even once cheered ""Let's Go Celtics!"" for 5 minutes even though we were down by 20 in a playoff game, because that is Celtic Pride.   I can fill you in more on the lore of the team if you want, there's a lot though, we're a very historic franchise"

"&gt;If it’s insane, then as previously stated it’s insane to expect that same guy to be able to perform for a team trying to make the playoffs in the western conference.  You’re contradicting yourself.   &gt;There core is Zion and Ingram and they’re still high on Kira, NAW and I’m sure would like to bring back Lonzo. Kispert’s skill set isn’t so unique that you have to grab him. Of course he would be on his rookie deal, but you’re also with the uncertainty that he may not work. It’s not like a shooter on the market is gonna be requesting max money.  Once again there is uncertainty that every single player to ever exist may not work. That is a flawed argument that makes completely 0 sense.   &gt;Of course other rookies have done it, but if you’re New Orleans in the western conference it’s incredibly unrealistic to expect that from Kispert his rookie year.   It’s unrealistic to expect a 4 year college player that was a good shooter to be a good shooter?   &gt;Again guys like Tatum, Mitchell were the exception.  Again when I brought up Tatum I was specifically highlighting his contribution to winning as a rookie. Not his post season play, not his stardom, not even him being a starter and playing 30 minutes a game. I literally put in parentheses “what they can provide to a team” because I knew it would be something you would take out of context like you just have.   &gt;Look at guys like Joe Harris who couldn’t hit a shot when Brooklyn needed him to last year in the playoffs.He’s a vet, a proven player, and was playing next to better players than Kispert would be in New Orleans and it just didn’t happen for him. Guys who’ve been in the league for a while come up short in those spots. Hoping rookie year Kispert won’t is a hell of a bet.  Joe Harris shot 40% from 3 on 7 attempts a game in the 2021 playoffs.    &gt;Bro Lonzo and Bledsoe started over him because they’re vets. He’s 23 years old.  Lonzo ball is 10 months older than Nickeil Alexander-Walker.    &gt;He can round into being an efficient player. NAW is a safer bet than Kispert is in being an effective high level player in the league.  Based on what? There’s a track record in the NBA of shooters sticking more than rotational creators.  &gt;I keep mentioning them because Kispert will never play ahead of Zion and Ingram, you know the wings in New Orleans?  1. For the 4th time, position-less basketball. you can place multiple guys in multiple spots on the floor a different times.   2. Ingram, and Zion aren’t each playing 48 minutes a game.   &gt;Gordon again is just a template. Go get for Fournier, Alec Burks, type guys I don’t care.   You keep saying they can simply just get these guys yet keep brining up terrible examples, which is once again directly proving my point to how hard it is to get shooter and where their value stands in this league. Evan Fournier got paid 17million last season, Alex burks got paid 6 million last year and was on a. 11 million a year contract before that.   &gt;There guys who anyone who regularly watches the sport would count on as quality role players next year Ingram and Zion over Kispert  Well yes, I too would count 2 veteran starters as good role players to put next to Ingram and Zion. The problems are ;  1. They are going to get PAID up to 4x the amount of money kispert will, annually.   2. They are free agents and have no reason whatsoever to go to New Orleans unless they are getting over paid (ie JJ Reddick), when they can get paid their market value and have similar roles on better teams or in better cities.   Your entire argument in this thread against Kispert to New Orleans is illogical, contradictive and baseless. We’re going in circles and I’m responding to the same points over and over. I’m done here, have a good day 👍🏾"
They took a flyer because Lacob’s kid was doing their scouting. It says a lot about their scouting and Lacob’s influence. Wasting 3 2nd round picks is a big deal when they’re over the cap and don’t have a lot of assets. Those 2nd round picks could’ve been Bruce Brown or Landry Shamet or Evan Fournier.
“Valuable.” Evan Fournier is “Valuable?” Laugh out Loud
Ownership has shown they will pay the tax many times. I don’t even really care if they don’t want to pay the tax for Evan Fournier. 4/80 for him would be a contract they are paying to move in two years when the team goes nowhere.
Evan Fournier wants 80 mil/4 years Lonzo looking at 80mil+/ 4 years.  Not sure the gap u think exists between these plays and a 23 year old Allen
Why pay evan fournier when you can pay josh richardson?  big brain moves.
I would take Evan Fournier on the Lakers for 22m even
"If he wants $20M/year I will drive him to wherever he's getting that contract from.  Fournier is a nice player but frankly I am not even that interested in him at $15M/year.  The Celtics seem to be positioned to have some good cap space after this coming season, I am not jeopardizing that for Evan Fournier."
"Evan ""Dennis Schroder"" Fournier"
All this for Evan Fournier
"&gt; That's wrong. The Bucks literally, publicly, committed to offering supermax extension before they were allowed to do so. You can't offer a supermax to someone before their seventh year in the league is over, even if they're on your team.   I think it's disingenuous to use a situation where the Bucks got in trouble for tampering because they discussed, both publicly and behind closed doors with someone who was under contract, and on their team.    &gt; You can talk to people on your team. You just can't offer an official contract until free agency. Fournier is still under contract with the Celtics, so they can discuss rough numbers with his agent. They cannot formally offer him a deal yet, but they can know what he wants, and what he may be planning to do.   I was fairly sure that Evan Fournier was a free agent, which I could be wrong about. In any case, they can't begin formal negotiations until after free agency begins, which was what I was referring to, as the rough numbers you described would get you in trouble with tampering if made public. Obviously it happens, or we wouldn't get guys signing the opening moments of free agency. You can clearly see that this is against the rules because the bucks/kings got in trouble for this last year by prematurely discussing and announcing the Bogdan deal and trade, both of which were against the rules despite the fact that Bogdan was restricted. Though this is a bit different than extending a player who is under contract, those discussions are also not supposed to take place after the extension deadline, and before free agency begins. That's why the stuff you've probably heard is ""there is growing idea that John Collins will make a deal with the hawks"" before the season even ended because the hawks can't actually discuss this, but they clearly had these conversations anyway.   &gt; Edit: And you obviously can't offer sketchy wink-wink deals even if they're on your team e.g. like 'sign a 1+1 for cheap, then decline your second year, and we guarantee we'll max you.'    Yeah just ask the Wolves, they got multiple FRPs taken away due to this, but it also obviously still happens.       To be clear, I'm again speaking about what the rules says is supposed to happen, I can't actually speak to what really happens because I'm not a FO guy or an agent. I'm just a very devoted fan of the nba.     Before I have to go and find the sections of the rules to source my points, here is a high profile NBA reporter saying pretty much the exact same thing as me about Fournier    https://twitter.com/johnhollinger/status/1421263835495813127?s=19"
&gt; We can now realistically create a max slot to go after Beal for example.  I can guarantee you that the Celtics are not even going to attempt to do that. To do that you guys would have to not try to re-sign Evan Fournier and you'd have to not even try to negotiate a contract extension with either Marcus Smart or Robert Williams. There's no chance the Celtics are gonna do that when every report is Beal has no intention of leaving Washington.
"From what I have read, nope just the TPE. Nice move by the Celtics.  Maybe the change of scenery will benefit him and I would say pretty confidently that replacing any minutes of Grant Williams, Edwards, Ojeyele or Waters with Kosh Richardson should make Celtics fans feel good about this move.  Curious what the Fournier situation Play out to be.  The TPE will end up being Kris Dunn, Josh Richardson, Evan Forunier (maybe just a rental?). I think whether or not Forunier re sings goes a long way I’m determining how successful the use of that TPE was"
It's clear Celtics fans just want to see trades happen even if it's a huge loss for Boston.  Almost everyone knows Richardson is cooked but somehow Celtics fans think this is a good move by Brad Stevens even if it means losing Evan Fournier.  People are content with mediocrity here. They don't care about winning anymore.
"&gt; Westbrook is not worth his contract   This is not relevant though, not for the Lakers. They were going to be over the cap either way, even without Westbrook, and even if Trez had opted out and left. Westbrook's dollar amount only matters to the owners who are paying it, but there's no opportunity cost with having him at that price tag. The Lakers are not Boston, they have no problem paying the luxury tax, and will not feel pressured to dump their overpaid PG with a 1st round pick just so they can free up money to offer Evan Fournier something competitive.   Westbrook has two years left on his contract, as does LeBron, and the Lakers are all in right now to try to win. Boston is taking their time because they feel like their championship window is many years in the future, but you need to recognize that the Lakers situation is different than your own team's.   The Lakers just added Westbrook to be their third option, not to be the centerpiece of their team. Westbrook has never been on a team good enough that he would be the third option. I know as a Celtics fan you want to proclaim that it was a mistake, but you really don't know that. The Lakers absolutely might win the championship this year, because that was true even before they added Westbrook. LeBron and AD together are that good. The reality is that right now today the Lakers are a lot closer to that 18th banner than Boston is. Sorry."
&gt; Stop trying to force our hand for your benefit  ??? this is sports and i'm not a team owner. my benefit lmfao.  ok go use that cap space to signnnn Evan Fournier! he's 28. perfect for the raptors.   just look at this fantastic list of players who are totally worth 20mil+ a year and fit the raptors timeline:  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/free-agents/   oooo Lauri Markkanen!!!!
"Not re-signing Fournier would give us a backcourt of Lonzo Ball and Marcus Smart. TD Garden would sink into the earth with the amount of bricks being tossed around. Not only that, but I'll paste in something I wrote the other day about how critical it is for us to bring back Fournier:  * If we don't re-sign Fournier, then we literally wasted 2 2nds on 16 covid-limited games of Evan Fournier for no reason.  * If wasting 2 2nds doesn't bother you, then it also completely wastes the record TPE from Hayward, which we could have just saved for this offseason. We now only have slightly more than the MLE remaining, which will get us basically a MLE level player - Fournier is much better than that.  * Fournier ended the season with 17 PPG, making him the 4th best scorer on the team (3rd with Kemba gone). It can easily be argued that with a full season and increased role, he could replace Kemba's output by himself.  * Fournier is a natural off-ball 2 guard and has all the skills that come with that (cutting, quick decisions without needing to iso, quick shooting motion - all things we desperately need), and he shot 41% on 6.7 attempts from 3 last year which made him the best 3 point shooter on the roster.  * If we let Fournier walk, we will have essentially traded two 20 PPG scorers, capable of catching fire on any given night, for 35 year old Al Horford and...Josh Richardson? Reggie Bullock? Whoever it is, it's too much of an offensive drop off to handle.   Letting Fournier go would be a disastrous misfire and we have no real way to replace him."
