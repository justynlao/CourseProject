"💖 Facts I love about Trae 🥵💖 :   2017: He's way to short he's never gonna be good in the NBA. Just because he plays like Curry doesn't mean he should be a lottery pick. We're watching the next bust of the NBA everyone.  2018 (Trae Young gets drafted): Nice so every small point guard that can shoot 3s is automatically Steph Curry? So glad my team didn't draft him. Don't cry if he's a bust when I told you so.  2018-19 season 1st half: He can't shoot he's just a confident shooter. His efficiency is so bad and he's not a good scorer. 2018-19 season 2nd half: He's a ball hawk he should pass more to his teammates. And he's also playing bad teams right now. He's gonna be out of the league soon, never gonna be an all-star  2019-20 season 1st half: He's putting up empty stats he can't play defense. He's can't carry his team to wins. His defense is gonna be a problem. Hawks should trade him for my team for a few picks and a mediocre player because he can't play defense and his efficiency is garbage. 2019-20 season 2nd half: He shouldn't have been an All-Star with one of the worst records in the East. He hasn't even proven he can win. He's only proven that he can lose.  2020-21 season currently: He needs to stop foul baiting. It's not fun to watch and he is ruining the game with it. He can't win without shooting free throws. Once he's in the playoffs he's gonna average 19 points. He can't score on hard defense. Beal should be an All-Star starter over him because he clearly isn't averaging empty stats and also #FreeBeal even though he chose to be on that bad Wizards team and plays to win not to score.  How many times does Trae have to prove you guys wrong again? It's always been popular to hate on him. People are so mad that he isn't a bust that they find every way to hate on him.  Of Course he's not gonna be able to win in his second season. You're drafted into a rebuilding team. Almost no one can carry their team to winning in his first or second season. The Hawks literally had a g-league roster. John was out for 25 games so Jabari Parker was their second player for 25 games. Cam, Huerter, Hunter were all too young to be impactful. Alex Len isn't a starting caliber center and wouldn't even get minutes on most teams. Of Course he can't win with that team. Even Luka can't.  Also people who used empty stats last year have clearly died or something. I hear absolutely no one calling Beal Mr. Empty stats. Even though he is in his 8th season and still can't win. His usage% is also the highest in the league right now and he doesn't pass a lot. #FreeBeal is stupid and idiotic. He chose to be on a bad team and score a lot. Keep the same energy with Beal as you all did with Lavine, Young, Booker and every young guy. And he just said he want to stay with the wizards. Beal is clearly doing it to break scoring records. He doesn't want to win he just wants to score.   Steve Nash: ""That's not basketball"". Also Steve Nash 2 years ago: We're as similar as players from different eras can be."
Jabari Parker really is a bummer. I was really hyped about him and I thought he was coming around before the injuries
"Dude I'm done with you after you called fucking Jabari Parker a defensive Stalwart. Travis only signed players on EXPIRING CONTRACTS, that wouldn't eat at our cap space or require us to cut any of our young core. You expected him to do something stupid like signing Al Horford to a 4 year extension and letting Reddish walk because he had a rough rookie year? They cannot run a offense with Trae and Collins, you have to be a moron or a manchild laughing to himself over this weak troll attempt. What has Luka accomplished other than losing out of the first round? We're handing out participation trophies, I can gloat how Luka's team is 11th place and most likely gonna miss the playoffs if they don't make a trade soon while Trae's is in 6 and only has the Cavs, Magic, Heat, and Knicks to worry about. Gallo been more productive than a 7'3 big that gets murked by Cousins."
lol are you serious? Last years mavs were *slightly* better? Feel free to hop off luka’s dick. Imagine comparing post injury Jabari Parker to Porzingis lulz
lol how do PPG and APG not matter for a PG? Trae’s second option for 25 games was post injury Jabari Parker that year. It’s hilarious when Luka stans point to the hawks record that year and act like Luka and Trae had identical or even similar supporting casts. Now trae has more weapons and magically the hawks are winning... hmm
Jabari Parker in 16-17. Though you could say it's injuries that prevented him from continuing his progression. That season I remember I thought he should've been an All Star until the ACL injury.
"The worst I have ever seen was Jabari Parker when he was on the Bulls, he just couldn't be arsed at all. Thank fuck we managed to trade him away."
"No chance he would’ve been the first pick if Embiid was healthy. Even with Embiid’s back injury which was known at the time, (and made him miss the Big 12 and NCAA tournaments,) he was the consensus #1 pick. It was only when his foot injury became known right before the draft that he slid.   Wiggins was actually projected to go third bc Milwaukee really liked Jabari Parker"
The Bucks were one pick away from having him and Giannis  They picked Jabari Parker (who to be fair was good before his ACL injuries)
Imagine if the Bucks built a time machine and picked Embiid instead of Jabari Parker
"Pretty much their entire team? Hawks had to run VC at PF for significant minutes lmao. Jabari Parker was our 2nd best player, and Alex Len was our best C over the entire year, and he *just* found a job.   But anyways I’m not gonna argue this point with you anymore cuz your either trolling or you just don’t get it lol"
"Wym bruh everyone knows the refs are biased af in favor of the face of the league, Jabari Parker"
"I mean it can also have a lot of truth. For all the guys you listed there were also guys like Monta Ellis, Andrea Bargnani, Antoine Walker. In the current era you would point to guys like Hassan Whiteside, Enes Kanter, Jabari Parker. The reason we forget about them is that teams eventually see how little they impact winning and they wash out of the league."
Jabari Parker before the injuries with defense?
"Coming into the league, Zion, Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, and Greg Oden all had more hype than Luka."
and then lost to Jabari Parker and OJ Mayo
"Unless Oladipo resigns which is unlikely in my opinion, the rockets are going to end up trading Harden for essentially 4 FRP (3 unprotected) and 4 FRPS. That sounds good on paper but why take the unknown over the known? The pick could turn out to be a Fultz, or Wiggin, or Jabari Parker, or Anthony Bennett, all of whom were top 2 picks. I think this was partially a salary dump, the rockets didn’t want to take back long contracts and they elected to take chances on low cost high picks."
I could swear I was told Wiggins and Jabari Parker would be the next legendary rivalry
"Expectations are different though. At some point, yall gotta throw the #1 pick expectations out.  Will he ever live up to his draft expectations? Probably not. Can he still become a good player? Absolutely. And before you bring up his contract, what would you do if you were Wiggins and were offered that contract? Say no? Lol.   Like, I don't see people shitting on guys like Marvin Williams, Evan Turner, and Jabari Parker anymore. 3 guys all picked #2 who have become okay role players."
"He's not slow-footed at all. He's like Jabari Parker. Big skill, very little team contribution. He just sucks"
"That's what was terrifying about being a fan of the Process.  They could do everything right and just have bad luck in the draft. If the Sixers get Wiggins or even Jabari Parker in that draft instead of Embiid, the process would've pretty much failed and been routinely mocked even though the thinking was, imo, correct."
A long time ago I said Gianis would be a good second option to jabari Parker so I don’t judge people for bad takes lol.
"And all these years later, still outplaying Jabari Parker"
I remember watching him outplay Jabari Parker in the Illinois high school state tournament and thought wow why doesn’t anyone talk about this Sterling Brown kid. Pretty cool that he’s made it in the NBA as a solid rotation player
"Here are some things that were going on in that season just to put into perspective how long he was a rocket  ____ Kobe was somehow willing the Lakers into the playoffs  _____ Melo was a legitimate MVP candidate  _____ KD had just won his 2nd of 4 scoring titles ____ Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett were in the midst of their last season as Celtics before being traded to the nets ____ Kyrie Irving was coming off of a very strong ROTY season _____ Giannis Antetokumpo was averaging 9 points, 5 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 block per game for Filathlitikos in the Greek League. He was a Greek League all star that season _____ Jabari Parker, Aaron Harrison, and Julius Randle were the 3 highest ranked high school recruits (MaxPreps) _____ There's a lot more and if you think of anything else please add it"
"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.   MIL chose BPA Jabari Parker when they already had Giannis at PF, instead of better fit Embiid to replace Zaza Pachulia.   NY picked Jordan Hill when they already had David Lee at PF, instead of better fit Demar Derozan to replace Jared Jeffries.   UTA picked BPA Trey Lyles when they already had Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors at forward, instead of better fit Devin Booker to replace Rodney Hood.   ORL drafted BPA Mo Bamba when they already had Vucevic at C, instead of better fit Collin Sexton to replace DJ Augustin.  You can find examples to support either approach. There's no single correct way."
"That's because we now have an NBA center in Capela and (had) possibly the best backup 4 in the NBA in Gallo. Last year John was getting minutes over the corpse of Vince Carter, Damion Jones, Jabari Parker and Bruno Fernando. He absolutely should be getting less minutes now that we have a better roster to feed."
Ben Simmons is the Jabari Parker of defense... he doesn't get paid to play offense /s
Jabari Parker
Next AD looking more like next Jabari Parker tonight
"""They dont pay players to play defense"" -Jabari Parker"
Jabari Parker was so good until he had that ACL tear. His career went over a cliff along with his knee.
Jabari Parker (Although I think some of that is due to injury)   Tyler Ennis- Loved him at Syracuse and although he didn’t have great shooting mechanics I thought he could become a franchise PG
"Granted some of these guys are still respectable NBA players, but I thought they all had All-Star/All-Defense upside at the very least:  Jabari Parker  Nik Stauskas  Nerlens Noel  Kris Dunn  Frank Ntilikina  Terrence Ross  Evan Turner  Perry Jones III"
"Fox,Hield,Bagley,Barnes,Haliburton,Jabari Parker,Whiteside."
"I really wanna see Randle make an all star appearance. I was a big fan of the very hyped 2014 Draft where the 5 biggest names were Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Embiid, Aaron Gordon, and Julius Randle and outside of Embiid all of those guys have underwhelmed to some extent for what we thought they would be. Randle is playing like the guy I thought the Lakers drafted in 2014 and I hope he keeps it up"
After Jabari Parker came back from his first ACL he honestly looked more explosive than before.
Jabari Parker. Thought he was better than Wiggins and was a great team player... oof
Jabari Parker.....legit thought he could be a great scorer.  Glad I don't evaluate talent for a living
Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker
He's such a hater! Completely ignores the fact that Utah has built their entire defense around Gobert and he's a top 2 or 3 rim-defender since being drafted.  This is why Jabari Parker said points get you paid as a No.2 pick and is currently struggling to get in the rotation in Sacramento. Such a bad example for young players.
"You must have forgot that you have Jabari Parker on your team.  Literally all the issues you just listed, but add two ACL tears and devout adherence to his personal mantra ""They don't pay me to play defense""."
Jabari Parker?
lol if you swap Trae and Luka both teams have the same results. Mavs in playoffs and hawks missing. Luka’s second option was KP. Trae’s second option was post injury Jabari Parker for the first 25 games
"More importantly, look at who they replaced from the course of last season. Evan Turner straight up retired afterwards, Parsons might as well retire too, Dedmon was waived and stretched by the Pistons, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker and many more got big minutes at some point last season."
"&gt;Well Giannis needs numerous shooters around him to be effective  This is like saying ""AD needs to be playing with LeBron to be effective."" Just a totally asinine, reductive statement.  Giannis' career didn't start two years ago. He put up 27/10/5 starting alongside guys like Thon Maker/John Henson/Jabari Parker/Eric Bledsoe, under a coach that literally discouraged shooting 3s.   Even after Bud came aboard, it's not like he's been playing with a murderer's row of elite shooting talent. It's just that they went from literally putting the worst possible team/coaching around him to saying ""hey, maybe we should try to surround him with some shooters"" and they turned into a 60-win team basically overnight with Giannis as the undisputed best player.   AD *HAS* played with ""a playmaker"" before LA. He's also played with ""numerous shooters."" I'll gladly admit that the Bucks supporting cast was better than the Pels' at their peak (although the gap is nowhere near as big as people make it sound) but giving a player the benefit of the doubt for doing less with less is not a compelling argument."
Giannis for sure. He was 19 years old his rookie year and doesn’t have a concerning history with injuries. The only one with an MVP and the only one with a DPOY.  Giannis also doesn’t have a positive correlation to winning his rookie year so you have the option to tank his first season. Just make sure you pick Embiid instead of Jabari Parker then boom. Now you’ve got both of them.  Second pick would be Davis. AD was a 19 year old rookie whereas Joel was 22 and needed severe minute restrictions right from the start. Davis’ career in whole looks better at this point. If I’m able to go full process in this scenario and plan to tank then maybe I go Embiid though.
"I remember watching that team early in the year play Duke who had Jabari Parker, Rodney Hood and Quinn Cook and although it wasn’t a blowout, if you watched the game you could tell how far apart those two were and Duke was considered a title contending team that year but it wasn’t even close"
"Why can’t this logic be used every time a team drafted a player, and a better player was drafted after him? In 2014 the Bucks picked Jabari Parker, are they crazy for not picking Jokic then? He was apart of that draft class. Sometimes when NBA players get drafted, they turn out better or worse than expected. To answer your question, yes, NBA GM’a do understand basketball, but I’m hesitant to say you do."
I thought Jabari Parker would run the league.
The was posted by Jabari Parker
Jabari Parker did
"You said ""at this age"" though. Hunter is impressive for a 2nd year player for sure, he's a damn good player, but 23 isn't super young by NBA standards. Jabari Parker is 2 years older than him."
"The 1-and-done players seem to stay young for an unreasonable amount of time lol. Jabari Parker is 25, etc"
"I can't believe Jabari Parker fell so far, I thought he was gonna be at least diet Melo when he was a rookie."
"For the uninitiated, the Kings roster. (Positions could be debated)  PG: De'Aaron Fox | Tyrese Haliburton | Jahmi'us Ramsey  SG: Buddy Hield | Cory Joseph | Kyle Guy | Justin James  SF: Harrison Barnes | DaQuan Jeffries  PF: Marvin Bagley III | Jabari Parker | Nemanja Bjelica  C: Richaun Holmes | Hassan Whiteside (Out) | Norvel Pelle  Whiteside's out for Health and Safety Protocols. Luke Walton's not a good coach, but how the heck is he supposed to win games with that roster? Fox is good, Hield will get his, Barnes is solid, and Bagley/Holmes are not terrible but they're below-average starters. Somehow though, their bench is even more dire. How many of these guys would even start on a good team? I think it's a bit extreme, but only Fox and Hield/Barnes could start for certain teams. I don't think anyone past Bagley/Holmes/Haliburton would crack a rotation, and some of those (like Bagley) would even be questionable."
There's no universe where I sign Jabari Parker without planning to play him.
Could’ve easily happened too if the bucks just picked him over jabari Parker
I think the Bucks had their heart set on Jabari Parker.  That's what I read at the time.
Not enough Jabari Parker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo2Wl4AChq0&amp;ab_channel=NiTringoNBA  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/201601290MIL.html  pretty sure this is the box score for that play/game  it shows that it's a turnover on Jabari Parker for offensive goaltending
"I love Lowry but Embiid is 26 and Simmons is 24 we could be in contention for the next 6-7 years if we continue to build depth around these guys. To do that though you need to retain and develop our picks.   I just can't give up Shake, Maxey, or Thybulle for a 34 year old Lowry. Like Thybulle could easily replace Danny Green as a starter next year. Maxey's statistical profile ironically mirrors a young Lowry. Maxey isn't quite ready for the rotation yet but I'm projecting him to be a starter in this league and I think like lowry he has the tools to become a good 3 pt shooter and for a guard he doesn't really have any other holes in his game. I think he'd be playing better if we didn't have Dwight packing the paint.   Shake is actually already valuable for us. He's also hit a wall but how many combo guards with 7 foot wingspans and all around skill set are actually out there? Not many. Shake has also been defending at a high level and whereas in the past he's excelled shooting it and struggled getting to the rim, this year he's been excelling getting to the rim and struggling shooting it. So the best version of Shake probably hasn't been seen yet.   I think we should bring in a stretch 5 maybe Demarcus Cousins and trade for Jabari Parker. High end stuff, Otto Porter and Evan Fournier.   The most disappointing part of our roster has been the dead weight we're carrying in Tony Bradley, Poirier, and Terrance Ferguson. Those guys just bring nothing to the table. It makes no sense we're just keeping them when there's no chance of them playing or ever being useful."
The combination of Giannis gravity and jabari Parker decision making in pick and roll defense creates quite the driving lanes
Jabari and Giannis played the same position for the same team which would have stunted Giannis' development. Parker and Wiggins were seen as generational talents heading into the draft
Blows my mind like Jabari Parker is 25.. like wtf?
"How is he a “nobody”? You know who he is, We know who he is. Jabari Parker was and is a known name. The guy isn’t a nobody lol"
Doubtful. I know the bucks liked Jabari but Wiggins would have gone 2nd at the time for sure.  We would have picked Parker or Exum probably. Which is arguably worse
I love MyTeam cause so much of it doesn't make sense. My 85 overall Jabari Parker is the greatest player of all time.
"I'll take your example further! The Warriors make it to NBA Championship!!!  Wiggins turns 2013 POTENTIAL into a REALITY and becomes MAPLE JORDAN  Lakers try and sign Jabari ""Carmelo Anthony"" Parker to stop Wiggins but it's no use. They also sign Noah ""Chris Bosh"" Vonleh but he never leaves the bench."
I read Kareem Abdul Jabbar as Jabari Parker at 1st and I was left speechless until I re read the post 😂
That Jabari Parker trade gotta be up there as well
"Jabari Parker, if he's still in the league"
Jabari Parker.
"Jabari Parker had some highlights. I mean, he was never an impactful player, but he did some fun stuff on the court"
Wiggins and Jabari Parker. I thought they'd be this generations Lebron and Carmelo by now.
"Sacramento please.  Take Cory Joseph, Jabari Parker, and Nemanja Bjelica."
Jabari Parker was my favorite college basketball player ever. I was convinced he was going to at least be a 25 and 8 guy on that Bucks team. I'm also a huge Giannis fan so my expectations for that team fell apart soon after. Nice to see the Bucks having some success but man I feel bad for Jabari
I had so much faith in Jabari Parker becoming the next Melo man :(
"Even crazier, his ACL's never rehealed properly after the injury--- so he basically didnt have any.   Jabari Parker has also torn both of his ACL's, but I think his healed correctly."
"Through 21 games they're 1 win better than the Hawks were last year with their best player being the worst defender in the league, 2nd best player being Jabari Parker, playing 2 rookies who stunk at the time heavy minutes, and a 40-year-old Vince Carter."
"I remember this   &gt; Three years later, Middleton channeled that same competitive rage into a higher-end roster battle: against Antetokounmpo, for alpha status in Milwaukee. In the winter of 2015, Kidd sensed an unspoken tension as Middleton, Antetokounmpo, Monroe, and Jabari Parker felt out a hierarchy. He wanted it in the open. He interrupted a film session and asked every player on the roster, one by one, who was best among them.  ""It was awkward,"" Middleton says. Most nominated Middleton. Antetokounmpo refused to go along. ""He was stubborn,"" Monroe says"
Jabari Parker
"Yeah I’ve been watching basketball for over 15 years the 76ers are in the position they are in because teams incorrectly scouted Wiggins and Jabari Parker as better players than Embiid because of his injuries. They got lucky he fell to them.   What if he didn’t fall to 3 and was correctly evaluated as the best prospect and picked one.  Again it’s all luck.  And even still the 76ers aren’t winning a title with him and Simmons because you need a top 5 player to win a title and he’s not that.  So, yeah I guess I’d killed for Philly success but also the Magic have made it to the finals more recently than Philly and it looks like that’s not changing anytime soon so really splitting hairs."
"For the Bucks, [I’d love this trade.](https://tradenba.com/trades/NOwOcZD90)   Bucks get: Draymond Green  Warriors get: Pat Connaughton, Donte Divencenzo, and PJ Washington  Hornets: get Brook Lopez, 1st round top 5 protected Milwaukee pick (the soonest one MIL can give up after the Jrue deal)  Why do the Bucks say yes?  Draymond Green is the perfect player for this Bucks team. With Draymond, we have a lineup of Jrue/Middleton/MLE Starter(PJ Tucker again maybe?)/Giannis/Draymond, and that’s guaranteed the number one defense even if Jabari Parker is the starter to be named later. Dray fits in perfect defensively, as Giannis can go back to the free safety role and terrorize while Draymond protects the rim and the paint and Jrue and Mids lock up the perimeter.   Offensively, Dray fits in as the main facilitator. Giannis and Jrue are okay to good as facilitators, but adding Draymond gives the offense a whole new dimension where Khris and Jrue play as off ball shooters while Giannis and Dray play a two man game.  Dray is an upgrade over Brook, and it sucks losing Donte and Patty Cakes, but the upgrade is worth it and I believe makes us top tier title contenders, which is something we are not with Brook Lopez starting.  Why do the Warriors do it?  Giving up the heart and soul of your dynasty isn’t ideal, but you’re getting 3 quality players back, 2 of whom still have great upside. We’ve heard all year how the bench is weak, and it’s their downfall, because, well, it is.  Now with Klay coming back you have Steph/Klay/Wigs/PJ/Wiseman with Donte as a perfect 6th man/Klay recovery fill-in, and another solid bench guy in Pat Connaughton. Also, they have MIN’s 1st and their own. It’s possible they have a Steph/Klay/Cade/Kuminga/Wiseman lineup if the lottery falls perfectly for them.   And even if it doesn’t, they’ll still in theory add 2 NBA caliber players in the draft. This year they have 3.5 competent players (Steph, Wigs, Dray, .5Looney), if they did this trade, next year they’d have (Steph, Klay, Wigs, PJ, Pat, Donte, GS pick, MN pick, .5Looney, .5Wiseman). So they go from 3 quality players to 9 (and 10 if Wiseman develops), restoring their depth from the title days. Replacing Dray with a young PJ Washington and adding two high quality bench guys that will mollywop other bench units. All of a sudden their bench goes from the steaming pile of dump it is this year, to a bench lineup of Poole/Donte/Pat/Paschall/Looney, a top bench lineup in the whole league to go along with world class starters.  Why do the Hornets do this?  Well, simple. You’re upgrading at a spot where you need to, and getting a 1st round pick. You’re the benefactor of having PJ Washington as a piece that GS wants over Brook Lopez, all the while Lopez helps you too.  Lopez is a clear upgrade over Zeller, and Melo/Rozier/Bridges/Hayward/Lopez is a playoff lineup for sure. Brook is tailor made to play with Melo, pick and pops would be deadly, and Lopez is great in the post which becomes an enhanced skill with Melo throwing entry passes to him.   PJ is a good young player, but Lopez helps you more now, and you get a 1st as well. No brainer."
"Lol no way. Zion was much more hyped than Jabari. Zion was a sports center/ESPN regular by the time he was senior in high school. His high school, a high school no one heard of prior to Zion was getting national coverage.   Not to mention Parker lost the #1 spot in his class to Wiggins when he got injured in HS. He also had to share the spotlight with what was considered one of the most talented class at the time with Wiggins, Randle, Harrison twins and etc.   Zion is easily the most hyped player since LeBron even without recency bias.  If we are talking about best prospect though, it would probably have been Wiggins"
Jabari Parker and Andrew Wiggins were goated in highschool. The second coming of KD and Jordan.
"Jabari Parker  Feel bad cause he seemed like a good dude and definitely talented, but injuries pretty much have ended his career.  Him and Wiggins lookin real “what if” now"
Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker
Jabari Parker was more hyped than Zion &amp; KD. Maybe Wiggins too. Parker made an SI cover as a HSer.
Jabari Parker
"Would have still been an improvement from last year's bigs lol.  Alex Len Damian Jones Jabari Parker, occasionally"
Bucks could have had twin towers if they drafted embiid instead of jabari Parker. Would’ve been jumpshots only against that team lol
"I’d say so. He’s definitely been more disappointing than guys like Fultz, Sebastian Telfair, Wiggins, OJ Mayo, Greg Oden, Dante Exum, Kwame Brown, Thomas Robinson, Derrick Williams, and Jabari Parker"
COUGH... COUGH... JABARI PARKER... COUGH... COUGH
"He is a ""December baby"", for many things that have a cutoff at Dec 31 these people are going to be among the youngest. For some things it is great (NBA Draft) but for other things it is not so great (school).   Giannis is also a December baby, he is just 2 months older than Andrew Wiggins and 3 months older than Jabari Parker, both selected in the 2014 draft. Only 9 months older than Aaron Gordon who was the youngest in 2014."
"Harden at 7 too, Kobe 13, Kawhi 15, Dame 6, JULIUS RANDLE 7  &amp;#x200B;  Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennet, Jabari Parker  &amp;#x200B;  I think it's hit and miss"
"Bucks gotta be my pick.  - Draft Joel Embiid in 2014 (over Jabari Parker)  - Draft Domantas Sabonis in 2016 (over Thon Maker)  - Draft Norman Powell and OG Anunoby (with the picks they traded for Greivis Vazquez)  - Hold onto Malcolm Brogdon (instead of letting him go to the Pacers)  That's a lineup of: Brogdon / Middleton / Anunoby / Antetokounmpo / Embiid, which Powell &amp; Sabonis off the bench."
Yup and Jabari Parker compared to Melo
Jabari Parker
"And that's why he ain't ever be shit  Until LeBron wins him a ring lmao  Major Jabari ""aint pay me to play defense"" Parker vibes"
"This dude is the definition of a losing player. This reminds me of when Jabari Parker said players don’t get paid to play defense  Some dudes have talent but they don’t apply to to helping their team win. Drummond might change now that he’s in LA, but he’s a fucking loser for his time in Detroit"
Tyreke Evans  Jabari Parker  Otto Porter Jr  Jahlil Okafor  Nerlens Noel
"I was all aboard the jabari Parker hype when the Bucks started to get on the radar years ago. I thought he and giannis were going to do wonders together.  But at this point I would be a little nervous that he might be bad for locker room vibes. He left because he had kind of a bad attitude towards his lack of a lead role, right?"
"I dont know if it's a hot take, but I bought into the Wiggins and Jabari Parker hype"
"I was so so sure that Lamelo would be a bust.  I also thought that Jabari Parker would be the best player from the 2014 draft, I saw him as a cross between Melo and Lebron."
"Cool, I remember seeing this before. It makes sense and could partially explain why Jabari Parker had so many injuries. That clip of him running and planting hard on his heel is likely to over stress his lower body."
Jabari Parker probably. Kevin Love is on a really bad streak right now though. I love Bagley and Isaac but I’m scared that they could turn out like Jabari as well  Edit- can’t believe I forgot Chandler Parsons too
"Giannis is ridiculous lol. I think Jabari Parker has only played like 40 more games than Embiid, even tho they were in the same draft and Embiid sat the first 2 seasons. Kinda crazy."
Are you saying AD has had an injury-prone career as Embiid? I'd go with Jabari Parker.
"this is crazy cause I was literally just playing 2K thinking, ""whatever happened to Jabari Parker, I remember him being hyped as the number two guy next to Giannis"""
The frequency of people asking what happened to Jabari Parker is almost at the same level as the frequency of people asking what happened to Kenneth Faried
"I didnt know about their views about that since they seem to keep those feelings, thoughts more underground. I just can imagine that it would be conflicting to be a poc and raised that way. Jabari Parker comes to mind of how good a player he could have been if he was raised in another faith."
"if the Kings were eyeing like a solid 2 for 3 or 1 for 2 and need a roster space this trade would be great for them. They have players like Bjelica, Holmes, Barnes, Hield, and Jabari Parker and are rumored to be sellers.  An added bonus is the Magic are shaving some salary in general, that part makes me think maybe the Kings demand a second as well due to the salary save, but then again idk how you value that vs the extra roster spot."
"Wiseman, bagley started to play better recently but he is really the reincarnation of Jabari Parker right now. Between F tier defense and the injuries, he is getting close to bust territory."
Jabari Parker still exists?
Jabari Parker
"&gt;Bruh there’s a difference between discounting the rookie year and acting like it didn’t matter by somehow comparing it to college years like you did.   Rookie years don’t change sophomore year stats. If someone had a good rookie year you would expect them to have a good sophomore year and you would expect someone who didn’t have a good rookie year to have worse sophomore comparably.   &gt; No I wouldn’t be over here. You tried to send a shot at a player on my team by acting like RJ Barrett is on track to somehow be above him  yeah you would lmao, can’t have someone making any comparisons to your boy.   &gt;Naw you could make comparisons but again as I just said the way you said it you meant for it to be a shot, don’t get mad when people see it that way. You’re too smart for that  yeah cos every comparison is a shot. funny how your only response has been “waaahh look at the rookie years!!” and “waaahh don’t compare him to my boy compare him to someone else!!”   &gt; And you mention “Age,Draft Pick, College” what about Brandon Ingram then? What about Jabari Parker then? They’re Duke too, what so because they were the #2 pick instead of 3rd you decided to go with Tatum? Knock it off you had Tatum on your mind  Because Tatum is the better player? Why wouldn’t I compare him to Tatum?   &gt; When he wasn’t that though, I didn’t spend my time saying “wow look at how much better Tatum’s numbers are than insert player on a team in which I hate”  yeah, no one ever compared his stats to other superstars when they were younger.  This post is literally the first time anyone has compared anyone’s sophomore stats with someone else’s.    &gt;I made a thread a month ago, saying “who’s gonna make the all star team first him or Herro?”. I knew about Barrett before you did most likely. It’s the fans like you who ruin it  Wow man you knew about him a month ago? Teach us casuals how to stay up to date on young players pls"
Middleton buzzer beater was in the same game where Jabari Parker tore his ACL for the first time
"Jrue just got there.   KG only got whats left of Cassell and Sprewell who were in their mid thirties.  Can you tell me who are the other productive players KG had besides Sczerbiak, Sprewell, Cassell, and Marbury?  Don’t be dumb. Are you really a Bucks fan? Bledsoe and Brogdon were playing well in the 2018 playoffs. Heck even Jabari Parker was coming off the bench. You mentioned Thon Maker who was averaging 5 ppg against the Celtics."
Jabari parker. Teams will keep paying this bum until the end of time
"Also some obvious picks don't pan out as well and aren't actually obvious picks in hindsight, i.e. the Andrew Bogut vs Marvin Williams for #1 pick in 2005, Michael Beasley and Derrick Williams at #2, Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker in 2014, Jahlil Okafor in 2016, etc."
"I’ve watched basketball long enough to be able to tell when someone has a 90% chance of panning out(10% include guys like Tyreke Evans, Michael carter Williams, Jabari Parker, OJ Mayo, etc...), not total busts, but guys that didn’t live up to the hype due to injuries/outside problems... Lonzo is a good dude who puts in the work and truly wants to be great, and he showed many signs of being a big difference for us while he was with the lakers... when lonzo played during his last season with us, we went 25-22, the best record on the team"
Jabari Parker and Bobby Portis too
Jabari Parker - dunking  Ben Gordon - shooting  Boris Diaw - passing
Jabari Parker never gets injured.
Randle is who I thought Jabari Parker would be.
My jabari Parker is a rari parker
"Yeah I remember I was mad when we drafted Embiid, not because I hated Embiid but I thought Jabari Parker was gonna be a superstar"
I've never been so wrong about a player as I was about Jabari Parker. I genuinely thought he was gonna be the next big player. Man he busted out hard.
"Jabari Parker isos, Vince Carter heat checks, Evan Turner spins, Chandler Parsons existing, Miles Plumlee being a worse Alex Len. good times."
"I think his suspension just ran out, but he's been out for so long idk if he comes back. I wouldn't be surprised if he made it back though because Jabari Parker of all people got signed by the Celtics and actually helped their bench a bit."
"Allen Iverson was overrated.  The NBA wanted LeBron to win a championship with the Cavs, and systematically screwed the Warriors(although game 7 was fairly officiated, and the Warriors essentially choked)  Russell Westbrook should not have a MVP.  Mark Price was underrated and his play/teams were never optimized to utilize his talent. He would have been a way bigger deal now.  The Kings would have been better off not drafting DeMarcus Cousins.  Jabari Parker was never used right and could have been a star player if he was drafted by someone else."
No i get the bench is why we almost lost (Lou/Solo fucking suck) but its just like... Trae wasn't doin anybody favors for a stretch there in the 4th lol. Our offense is talented enough now to where its like.. trae you arent playin with evan turner Damian Jones and Jabari parker anymore. there are better options than the 34 foot bomb with 15 seconds left on the shot clock!!  not even to mention the gimme layup he blew with a minute left but like w/e he cant make em all
"To quote Jabari Parker ""They don’t pay players to play defense."""
"He hasn't been an SF for like 5 years, and even then it was because they thought Jabari Parker was the future of the franchise"
"Hasheem Thabeet and Jabari Parker were as well lol. Lonzo and D Lo are average point guards, but they’re overrated if you’re thinking they’re blue chip young stars nowadays."
"Luke Kornet is not a bum, he has been really solid for us but go on.  Doesn’t change the fact that he plays guys like Grant who do literally nothing positive over someone like Jabari Parker who can at least score, or Langford who can at least defend.  Kemba, Smart, Brown, Tatum, Williams  Pritchard, Langford, Nesmith, Parker, Thompson  That’s a really solid, 4 seed type lineup.   Yes, a lot of those guys have been hurt. But they aren’t now. Jaylen is the only one out but some of those other guys still don’t see minutes, and the ones that do do not get them consistently enough.  Sure, this isn’t a championship roster, but even with the injuries a good coach would have this team easily at least 8 games above .500."
I love it and the bucks with number 2 pick ended up with jabari Parker! Could you imagine if they would have selected embiid or jokic instead?
Man Jabari Parker has been horrible so far.
when the hell did jabari parker sign for the celtics...
"We tanked Giannis' rookie year for Jabari Parker, but still not as bad as Philly.  I'm willing to accept not being labeled a tanker seeing as Jabari never worked out anyway."
"Jabari Parker, after his injuries he got overshadowed by Giannas and then he got hurt again. I think he’s a guy that’s gonna get forgotten for how good he could’ve been"
"Brogdon, Jabari Parker, and even Khris Middleton didn't like him. They would do subtle jabs at him all the time during the season.   Giannis was like the only one lol"
"Giannis likes everyone.   But this shouldn't even be an argument considering the terms Kidd left on. The dude fucked up Giannis shot (look at his shooting stats pre Kidd), alienated Jabari Parker and left a bad taste in many fans mouths. Not to mention he's a domestic abuser lol"
Cool  Ast%   Trae 45.5  SGA 31.2  OBPM  Trae 5.4  SGA 3.8  VORP  Trae 2.7  SGA 1.7  Offensive Raptor  Trae 5.8  SGA  3.7  O-Lebron  Trae 4.41  Shai 1.47  ORPM   Trae 2.31  SGA  0.87  Also come on with the better teammates argument. When last year Trae Averaged 30 and 10 when his second best scoring teammate for half of last year was Jabari Parker and he was carrying the corpse of Vince Carter up and down the court.
Wasn’t there also a theory that jabari Parker had no friends?
nah he was named after jabari parker
"wiseman, bagley, lonzo, jabari parker, mkg, derrick williams. thats just in the past decade, not even including the all time busts like darko and sam bowie"
"That's a fun thing to clown in retrospect, but really what I think it shows more than anything is drafting is really really hard, or even maybe really just a crapshoot when you get down to it.  Just look at where Curry, Giannis, Butler, Jokic (and by extension Anthony Bennet, Nerlens Noel, Jabari Parker, etc.) all got drafted, none of which except for Bennet were especially controversial at the time."
Bucks could have had giannis and Embiid if they didn’t select jabari Parker. Imagine trying to score in the paint against that team lol
"I get where you're coming from. I was rooting for the young Brandon Roy and Greg Oden back in the day. I was salivating for them to reach their peak tgt and challenge the west until injuries got the better of them.  There have been way too many young players that dont reach their ceiling either.  How many were optimistic about Tyreke Evans, Jabari Parker and Brandon Jennings. Every player has a rough gauge on their ceiling on how good they can be once they have played a season or 2 in the nba.  Every once in awhile, some players surprise me like how I once viewed Steph as a skinny shooter who would never become the main option in a championship squad. Man was I wrong. Im viewing Trae Young as such and I dont think he can be the main option of a championship team because of his shot selection which Steph didnt have.  I do hope I am wrong and players I once put a ceiling on can prove me wrong."
"Prior to the second acl tear Jabari was a positive for the bucks, 20 ppg 37 % from 3. But if we are comparing 2x acl tear parker to current bagley then yeah."
"Jabari Parker is still in the league and Bagley is much better than Parker lol  Bagley can turn it around, but he has to want it."
"You don't see the problem with that? Plenty of teams find great players late in the draft or through UDFA. The fact they needed to tear everything down to find these players isn't good scouting or player development, it's luck. They struck out on more than they hit. In fact some of those hits ended up developing after they left Philly, so what does that say?  You see a similar issue in the draft. Trading Holiday for Noel was a bad move, drafting Okafor was a bad move (you can say Hinkie wanted Porzingis but he didn't want to go there because surprise, good players don't want to play for a process). He drafted two consensus players (who anyone would have picked) and lucked out that Embiid hurt his foot before the draft, otherwise they would have drafted Jabari Parker.  Luck plays a part in everything, but Hinkie was relying 90% on luck to build this team. OKC could make moves in the off-season to be competitive in 2021-2022. Philly did not have that ability during the process. Comparing OKC to Philly is completely off base. Hinkie would have shipped Paul and Gallo for pennies on the dollar last year. There was a lot value in that playoff run for those young players that will make them better down the road."
"It's not that simple. The Sixers were not a respected franchise outside message boards. Players didn't want to go there. Porzingis and Russell refused to work out for them. I have a hard time believing Jimmy Butler ends up there if the team was being run by Hinkie.   You need good draft picks to build a team (either through those players or through trades). But you're increasing your reliance on luck by doing what Hinkie did while also making the franchise look like some Mickey Mouse operation. Had Embiid not been hurt before the draft, this team drafts Jabari Parker and they are sitting at the bottom of the standings today. You need to have a plan if your picks don't work out. Hinkie's plan was keep losing until one turns into a superstar. That's a bad way to run a team."
"This and ""what happened to Jabari Parker"""
There are a lot of “what if’s”. Like what if the Bucks drafted Embiid at #2 instead of Jabari Parker and letting the Sixers get Embiid at #3.   What if Porzingis had taken any of the Pre Draft meetings with Philly.   Hinkie had been rumored to want Porzingis over Okafor since before the draft but Porzingis refused to meet with them since they were still in the early years of “The Process”.   At the end of the day even with Phil Jackson rumored to want to trade up 1 spot for Okafor (since he was a viewed as a great “Triangle” fit) Hinkie was pressured by ownership to take the more popular homegrown talent instead of taking a risk on a Euro.   I believe the Sixers still had Noel so maybe the front court combo would have made their record too good to get the #1 pick of Ben Simmons.   To be fair Pre Draft there was a lot of worries about Porzingis’ back and overall health because of his size and suffering from Anemia.
"Oh man, the bucks had a guy like this named Gary Woelful who nobody on the team talked to so his writing started getting super negative. He got a scoop on some locker room stuff and suddenly became the worlds biggest Jabari Parker fan so it was pretty obvious Jabari had leaked stuff to him. Jabari left the next season and Woelful wrote this big thing about how the team couldn’t succeed without Jabari, meanwhile the team had the best record in the league. So weird."
Also Jabari Parker
"You started well then injuries derailed your season. I know Nate is doing well with injuries. Still though, this was the first competent roster LP had. I think he was put on the clock unfairly when Chandler Parsons, Evan Turner, Alex Len, Dedmon, Vince Carter and Jabari Parker all played a lot of minutes last season, some of them even playing starter minutes for extended periods. Almost all those guys are effectively retired now (VC and Evan Turner are literally retired). Once you lose the locker room like Lloyd Pierce clearly did there's no turning back no matter the circumstances. He was fired the moment Nate Mcmillan was hired as his assistant."
This game needed more Jabari Parker
True. He's like a poor man's PJ Tucker for me. We literally got Jabari Parker sitting down while Grant Williams was in the floor running around.
Sixers fans are utterly convinced Jokic is a taller version of Jabari Parker on defense. It’s weird.
[He was openly contemptuous of playing defense.](https://www.sbnation.com/2018/7/19/17588208/jabari-parker-defense-interview-bulls-bucks-nba-free-agency)
"Bad game from both sides, until Tatum his free throws with like 3 minutes left in the 4th Kemba was the only Celtic with double digit scoring. Suns missed every jumped.  At least Jabari Parker is awesome, thanks Kings"
Jabari Parker might win a playoff game for the Celtics
Jabari Parker looks like an old man threatening kids on his lawn. There was a rebound chance where he considered it and then realized his hip flexors said No.
"Well obviously, they have notorious defensive stud Jabari Parker now."
&gt; Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker were both highly regarded as being the NBA’s next great wings  At least Parker could claims injuries. Wiggins just didn't give a shit. And I say this as a Warriors fan who appreciates him.
Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker were both highly regarded as being the NBA’s next great wings
Jabari Parker will likely end up being a bigger contributor than Blake and LMA.
"Jabari Parker, even if it's too early to say, holy shit he adds everything we lacked"
"Celtics go to the ECF, no bias  Jayson Tatum averages 40, no bias   Jabari Parker has a 37 point game, no bias  Luke Kornet moves up to number 1 in all time regular season + playoff three for a 7 footer, no bias  Sixers get swept, no bias"
In this parallel universe Embiid goes #1 and we end up with Jabari Parker
"That’s where you’re wrong, bucko. Celtics legend Jabari Parker hadn’t yet graced the roster with his presence"
Facts Luke Kornet and Jabari Parker are the true Embiid stoppers
"**Positives:**  Tatum had arguably his best game of his career in every aspect outside of scoring.  Tremont Waters redemption arc.  Romeo Langford D  Jabari Parker looks solid  Jaylen Brown continues to be hot  Danny Ainge commentary was great.  **Negatives:**  We lost, obviously.  Tatum had his worst scoring game in a while.   Brad continues to play Grant even though he is absolutely terrible.  Brad.  Jaylen only 15 shots and got iced out in the fourth.   All around I’m not too worried about Tatum, I mean, he has been amazing for weeks, just had an off night. Layups he makes every time going halfway down and rolling out, not to mention our best three guards and two best playmakers were out. Losing the win streak and the current seeding (obviously there is still season left) sucks, but it isn’t a loss to freak out about."
Jabari Parker is a good pickup.
"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
"As a Jokic fan I have some bias but I’ve always had a negative attitude Embiid, and I think a big part of that is the Hulu ads and how everyone has just treated him like a god since he’s come into the league. Also bitter that the bucks took freakin jabari Parker over him"
The jabari parker special
Should've gave an honourable mention to Jabari Parker
"I see where you’re coming from, but Idk if stamina is always the issue. Some guys just don’t take pride in playing defense. Jabari Parker legit said “They don’t pay players to play defense.”  I’m sure he’s not the only one to think like that, he’s just dumb enough to come out and say it"
"&gt; Two superstars went head to head pretty much equally and it just came down to which secondary guys delivered down the stretch.  Curry narrowly outmatched Tatum, and Kemba narrowly outmatched Wiggins. I think it came down to the rest of the supporting cast. The biggest difference came down to Marcus Smart vs Kent ""Not Smart"" Bazemore, and Jabari Parker being a pleasant surprise for y'all. Didn't think a Jabari vs. Wiggs duel would take place in this manner."
"Totally ignoring that Philadelphia went out and got shooters (Seth Curry, Danny Green, George Hill).  Thompson is a fine Kanter replacement comparison but Robert Williams and Daniel Theis are 2 totally different players where the offense is run differently and have different defensive styles.  We also don’t have Hayward and we have yet to see what Fournier (and Jabari Parker if you want to include him) can bring to the team at full strength.  This is also ignoring the context that Simmons was injured and didn’t play in the series last year, and Embiid is dominating way more this season than he has in the past. Plus Jaylen Brown has emerged more as a ball handler (with Hayward’s departure).  Both teams are totally different."
"Well he did put Parker in, and it paid off.  Never thought Jabari Parker would be the difference maker in a close game where we had a duel between Tatum &amp; Kemba vs Wiggins &amp; Curry."
I wonder if Tatum thinks about Parker not wearing a mask after being COVID positive   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kings-aware-of-reports-jabari-parker-was-spotted-playing-tennis-without-a-mask-after-positive-covid/
"Isn't it though? You were originally offended by a shitpost reference to the Jokic/Embiid debate. The big post here yesterday about the Windhorst podcast and whatnot.  Being MVP-level efficient day-in, day-out while also carrying an otherwise-mediocre team in a tough conference is a ridiculous feat. Efficiency and stats like that happening over such a long stretch is so much harder than doing it with long rests. Just by the law of averages, Jokic should be regressing *but so far isn't*. Every NBA-level player has it in them to be great over shorter periods.  Again, your question is irrelevant to anything and overly-reductive. Pretending that anyone was comparing Lebron James to Jabari Parker is dishonest and not worth responding to."
"And also guys tend to up their defensive game under Brad. If he can turn Kyrie into a decent defender, a long guy like Jabari should worst case be serviceable in the system. Having proven scorers on the bench (Fournier &amp; Parker) is going to be huge down the stretch."
Jabari Parker was absolutely a factor in the win which Was a pleasant surprise.
 Luke Walton made us believe Jabari Parker wasn’t a NBA caliber player  He’s fat and slow but he still got buckets out there
All abooooooard the irrational Jabari Parker hype train CHOO CHOOOOOOOOOOOO
Glad to see Jabari Parker on the court. Was never a fan of him but sucks when injuries effect careers.   I think hell be a good pick up for the C's.
"He's being paid to defend and playmake, Jabari Parker once said NBA players aren't paid to play defense. Draymond is being paid to play defense not score"
"What an awesome game! I thought tonight may be the best Kemba's movement has looked this season. He just looked different. Huge performance from him. Tatum showed why I think he'll be competing for some MVPs down the road. Fantastic game by him. Jabari Parker was really big offensively. Excited to see him with Timelord, Fournier, and JB back.  Hope Juan is good and didn't suffer a concussion. Fantastic hustle by him. Curry is insane to watch, from the circus shots to those tough 3s like that one from the corner at the end. Hope he avoided any longer term injury on his ankle. Super fun to watch him as always.  Just a great win and it's nice seeing the win streak continue."
"I can’t believe that Jabari Parker has made a positive imapact immediately, but I’m not complaining. This is a candidate for game of the year for sure. Hope JTA is okay."
JABARI PARKER IRRATIONAL HYPE TRAIN NOW BOARDING CHOO CHOOOOOOO
2. Jabari Parker the closer 😈
Didn't Jabari Parker have a ton of hype around him? Like he was supposed to be a superstar. What happened
It's feel good to watch Jabari Parker on a good team. Injuries can rob you of athleticism but he can't take away your game. He's a baller!
Listen man Jabari Parker has a lot of issues but we need bench buckets and he's clearly giving them to us
"I just got out of prison, is Jabari Parker 1st or only 2nd team all-nba?"
beautiful series of fakes by Jabari Parker
Signing Jabari Parker off the scrap heap was the 2nd best move Ainge has made this year (after trading away Jeff Teague of course)
"Your Celtics are in 5th place, with only 2.5 games separating you from the 8th spot and a play in.   And your idea of bringing in help was Jabari Parker, who hasn't been a NBA factor in years.  Good luck, those footsteps are getting louder.    And yes, I'm old enough to have seen the Sixers win their title,  as well as Boston win theirs.  The only guy on your team with the same mentality as your title winning players is Smart.  Tatum is soft and Brown is crazy inconsistent.   Kemba is a black hole and you have no interior defense or presence.   The team is soft as hell.   The Knicks, Heat and Hornets are gaining fast.  Imagine falling behind the damn Knicks in the standings but still being cocky?   LOL"
We will see your LaMarcus Aldridge and raise you a Jabari parker
Would you rather have 60 games of lebron or 82 of Jabari Parker?
oh boy can't wait to see jabari parker
Mo Wagner was cut for Jabari Parker. He was the Celtic’s 5th string center.
Oh god no. Jabari Parker plays worse defense than IT4.
Has Jabari Parker changed his mind?  Will he agree to defend after all? ...
"I just love the development of Julius, at UK I was so high on him and thought he’d be a great pro, no questions asked.   I was watching the draft with my college roommates, and at that point it was pretty damn close to a sure thing that Wiggins was the first pick and the Bucks were taking Jabari.   I wanted Embiid so badly over Jabari. I was so adamant that Jabari was not going to be the player he was billed up to be. He was a great scorer in college because of his size and shooting ability for that size. College players that are 6’9” with any semblance of shooting and handling naturally dominate at that level, but I saw that Jabari was slow(er compared to NBA wings) and didn’t have the strength or defensive chops to play the 4.   They all thought Jabari was going to be the god that saved our franchise, and they basically laughed me out of the room because I said if they pass on Embiid, I’d much rather have Julius Randle than Jabari, because he at least has the strength and post scoring to make an impact, and I saw Jabari as Derrick Williams 2.0 (which, I was extremely wrong on that one and thought Williams was going to be better than Kyrie, so this story isn’t to make it seem like I’m NBA Todd McShay).   But anyways; they basically called me stupid because I thought Embiid and Randle would be better than Jabari.  Randle broke his leg his rookie year, and then averaged 11 ppg on 43% shooting in his 2nd year, while Jabari averaged 14 ppg on 50% shooting, the next year Jabari averaged 20ppg (top option on shit team) near the same splits, while Randle was at 13ppg.  They gave me shit after shit after shit like backed up sewers about how dumb I was that I still thought Randle was better. Admittedly, though I still believed in him, I’m stubborn as fuck and wouldn’t change my view that Parker was better.   Even though he just had his 1st 20 point season in what they thought was one of many, and lowly Julius was better at beyblades than basketball.  However, slowly but surely Randle developed while Jabari got hurt, stagnated, and ultimately regressed.   Who knows how Jabari’s career would’ve gone had he not gotten hurt. I, for one, (maybe due to my irrationality and stubbornness of thinking Julius was always better) don’t think Jabari would’ve even been an all-star. He was okay at mid-range, which has now been phased out, and every other aspect of his game was “meh” at best (his finishing ability) to ultimate dog shit tier (his defense).   He would’ve never been strong or quick enough to be a starting 4, even though offensively he wasn’t horrible in that role, but on defense he was worse than syphillis before antibiotics.  Randle on the other hand, is such a graceful spinner that they show his video to teach washing machines how to operate. The rest of his game did a 180° spin and caught up with his spin cycle.  Anyways long story short, fuck you Chris, Wyatt, and Keane. Julius is now an NBA GOD and Jabari got cut by the fucking Sacramento Kings, which Randle would never.  Also moral of the story 2.0 besides sticking it to my roommates, any player that seems like Derrick Williams 2.0 who scores because he’s 6’9” with good but not elite tier athleticism for his height and not many other skills will probably be NBA bench fodder, because he’s no longer the most athletic player on the court, he’s now 10th in that category. Those players just don’t translate.  I know I’m high and wrote a ton for a draft day anecdote, but it’s worth it because now I can proudly yell in my Captain Holt voice “VINDICATION!!!”"
Is this how far Boston has fallen? They signed Jabari Parker?
"You're very generous putting Romeo and Grant Williams in that first tier. Romeo needs a lot more run until I feel comfortable calling him ""solid"", and Grant needs a very specific defense-only assignment against a bigger player that's not very quick, otherwise he's useless. I think they are overplaying Romeo right now to try to jumpstart him getting re-acclimated and also because Fournier is out. I expect to see some DNP for Romeo over the next few weeks. Not a knock on him but I don't know if he's ready to be a major piece yet.   Nesmith has to go down a tier as well, he's just not making any progress. He has flashes of NBA level play, but really he's just running around out there and hasn't demonstrated the lights out shooting he allegedly can do any more than Carsen.   In any case, Jabari Parker has lost more basketball ability than Wagner ever had, so I'm sure it can't be any worse."
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
"I remember the hype around Wiggins n Jabari Parker as the best draft class since '03. And they were compared to LeBron and Melo respectively. God damn, it sounds blasphemous in hindsight."
I forgot Jabari Parker existed
Jeff Teague for Jabari Parker. Exchanging legends.
Simple: The end of Boston's bench is worse than Jabari Parker.
I feel like I haven’t seen or heard the name Jabari Parker in a long time and the last time was probably in that Gambino song
Jabari Parker couldn't hang in a single lineup on the absolute shittiest of Hawks teams and he publicly whined while doing it I don't comprehend how he is still landing places
TIL: Jabari Parker was a free agent
"What the fuck! I? have a sleep in today (Saturday morning in Aus) and I come online to read this, my Celtics have signed Jabari Parker, DWade has an ownership in fucking Utah!??  Seriously though, I hope Mitchell is alright. Really want them to do well this post season."
Well unfortunately you picked up Jabari Parker instead.
Have you seen Jabari Parker
"It's when they fix your ACL with a surgery then you tear the graft. Jabari Parker had an ACL revision. Basically, anyone who does it twice in the same knee. The first ACL surgery is called ""primary ACL surgery."""
"The first names that come to mind are Jabari Parker, Greg Oden, Brandon Roy, Joel Embiid"
"You undoubtedly have a point. I think the reason it's particularly frustrating with Simmons is he's so incredibly talented in so many ways, and it seems so simple to go from being very terrible at one aspect of his game to being simply passable (rather than going from good to an all time great). It seems so eminently doable with just SOME effort, as opposed to needing to put in Kobe-levels of effort and drive, which is definitely a level that very few operate at (and those that don't probably shouldn't force themselves to that extent either)  We're probably not giving proper credit to how hard it is to succeed in in-game situations in the NBA. I was at a game one time watching some of the pregame warmups, and Jabari Parker was out on the court getting some shots in before other players because he was banged up at the time. Jabari was an average-ish 3-pt shooter and I knew that, but the guy was draining 3 after 3 from a couple feet behind the arc. I don't even remember how many in a row he hit at one point, but I would guess he hit something like 80% of the 3s he was hoisting from several feet behind the line and it looked effortless. It was so jarring I pulled out my phone and looked him up on bb ref and sure enough the guy was shooting something like 33% from 3.   Definitely not fair to expect someone to reinvent themselves, it's just so hard to understand an NBA allstar caliber player not being able to shoot better than 60% from the line, or develop a half assed midrange game when it would do SO much for them."
Jabari parker
Isn't Jabari Parker a mormon?
Yeah but nobody knew how bad they were. Embiid had injury concerns too. That's why he didn't go number 1. Bet those other teams are happy as fuck  they picked Wiggins and Jabari parker over him huh?  You take risks for good players. Sometimes they pan out. Sometimes they don't.
Don’t forget Jabari Parker on the Celts.
"Amazing, guy held 2021 mvp Jabari Parker to 0 points."
"you and every basketball person at that time believed in okafor. before the 2015 draft everyone was saying that kat and okafor was very close to each other and either could be #1 pick but kat was slightly ahead. lakers skipped on him cause they needed a pg more than a center. ofc with hindsight it's easy to say ""lol that guy sucks people were stupid"". everybody believed in potentials of guys like okafor, jabari parker, fultz etc. and none of them were surprise picks."
Depends on what your definition is but Wiggins and Jabari Parker both essentially busted and were surpassed by later picks.  Brandon Ingram might count.
You guys always saying shit like this.   Jabari Parker was getting paid long after most people knew he sucked.  Guys who can get buckets get paid
"Mavs fans loved to say Trae couldn’t play winning basketball when he had Jabari Parker, 2 rookies, and Alex Len as his supporting cast. So I guess it has a little to do with that. Apparently supporting casts only matter for one of them."
"Last year he had two rookies on the floor and Collins was suspended for 20 games in a shortened season.  The other players were Charlie Brown (no I'm not kidding), Jabari Parker, Brembry and Damian Jones.  The reason why he's doing so well is that he's been doing this the entire time."
Jabari Parker would end up being top 10 in the league. LOL
"Evan Fournier, Jabari Parker, Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart and Semi Ojeleye are the only celtics that have been in the league for more than 2 years. The rest are late 1st and 2nd round picks from the last 2 years. That is the Celtics team without Tatum in the playoffs this year. That team wins 20 games in a season in the East. It is probably a worse version of that Cavs team in 2018-2019 that won 19 games.  Kristaps Porzingas, Tim Hardaway Jr, Dorian Finney-Smith, Boban Marjanović, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, hell, the entire Mavs roster is NBA veterans. A lot of them + veterans. They'd probably win 35 games in the East.   Luka is a fantastic player, but his supporting cast was clearly better than Tatum's this year's playoffs. It's just a fact."
You're just wrong:  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DAL/2021.html  Mavs without Luka had 3 players with a VORP above 1 available in their series. 4 players with a positive BPM.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2021.html  Celtics without Tatum had 0 players with a VROP above 1 available in the last several games of their series. 2 with a positive BPM (one of which was Jabari Parker).  Kemba and Rob Williams being available would make Celtics Mavs close. Without them? It's a joke.
"Hawks FO sabotaged the he'll out of the team in Trae's sophomore year to make sure they could get more help on the right timeline. You moved decent players like Tauren Prince for a pick, let go of useful vets like Len and Dedmon who was really good in Trae's first season and rolled out guys like Chandler Parsons, Jabari Parker, Evan Turner, Jeff Teague and the corpse of Vince Carter and that landed you Deandre Hunter who's a perfect fit and on the right timeline. Okwongu was also a result of it this season even if he's a work in progress. Patience and cap space meant you got Clint Capela for pennies, the Trae trade got you Cam Reddish and all those salary dumps absorbed gave you space for the offseason signings. There's intentionality and patience in the Hawks strategy even if there's been one or two misses along the way even if it looks like luck from the outside."
"And Jaylen and Timelord were injured. And THJ ~ Fournier. Also Celtics were playing large minute Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Jabari Parker, Aaron Nesmith. I have hopes for their future but compared to  DFS, KP, Kleber etc they are definitely a tier below."
The guy with Damion Jones and Jabari Parker as his starting frontcourt
"&gt; In the nba today I’m taking the 6ft 8 pg over the center everytime.  This same reasoning was a big reason why Jabari parker and Wiggins were drafted over Embiid. In today's NBA, I am taking who can eventually be the better player regardless of position, and the better player may not become better until after their rookie contract.  &gt;Luka is already a top 5 player in the league arguably.  I just disagree so much. All the criticisms I always had of Luka are still apparent and people give such a pass to him. I have never seen someone who gets credit for carrying a team and with such mediocre [on/off numbers](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4432/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) 3 years in a row. That is just 1 of the many many reasons I can rant about (and I have) on why I think Luka is severely overrated which you probably don't want to hear more about. I think a big reason why Porzingis is underperforming is because he isn't getting the ball in his hands and playing with Luka is a part of that. Everyone talks about Luka's 42 points but much fewer talk about the 37 shots to get those points. I disagree with you that he is a top 5 player in the league. Maybe top 5 offensive player but I would personally have him in the top 20 range for player overall.  &gt;My Luka and lillard comparison also wasn’t comparing them as players now. It was comparing their career trajectory and Luka already beat Dame’s peak form as a 3rd year player  Luka will have a lot closer of a career to Lillard than he will with MJ in terms of wins/losses and helping his team rather than closer to MJ. In terms of all-nba stuff or MVP voting Luka will have more of that than Lillard, but I don't care about those accolades as much as I care about how good the player is."
"Those Bucks teams were pretty garbage. Their third best player was an often injured Jabari Parker. Behind young AF Giannis and Middleton, who didn’t debut until February in Brogdan’s rookie year, Kidds y3 iirc."
Hawks fans have no issue with mavericks fans. Hawks fans have issues with luka stans who have constantly be invading subs and talking shit about trae since the day he was drafted. What luka has done is impressive but he gets no where near the criticisms trae gets. Prior to the knicks series people had trae as the 16th best player under 25 and spouted the foul baiting narrative. Luka Stan’s have been saying for years shit like trae is not a winning player when his roster employed Alex Len Jabari Parker and Evan turner
"He was manipulative with the players, ran a stupid defensive scheme, tried to become gm, and also he didn't let Giannis or Jabari Parker shoot threes in games which is definitely part of the reason for Giannis' shooting struggles"
"""Jabari Parker""  ""Justise Winslow""  ""Jahlil Okafor""  oh man"
Jabari Parker doesn’t believe in Defense but we love him anyway
Jabari Parker was on my team. Blessed to join your bandwagon this series as well.  Deer noises and fuck Mike Dunleavy
"Paul George, Derrick Rose, Robert Covington, Markell Fultz, Tim Hardaway Jr., DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, TJ McConnell, Russell Westbrook, Jabari Parker, Jaylen Brown, Bryn Forbes, Julius Randle, Kelly Oubre, and many others can't name off the top of my head."
"lol marginally worse? Trae’s second option last year post injury Jabari Parker... just stop lol. This year when healthy, sure. The issue is the hawks haven’t been healthy until now. Trae is the first player in nba history to have 145+ points and 45+ assists in his first 5 playoff games. Where’s Luka? The fact you act like Trae would be bad on the mavs is hilarious. Dude averages 25 and 9. Was what? Second or third in ppg last year and top 3 in assists as well. But ya, definitely wouldn’t help the mavs get booted from the bubble lol"
"Luka has had the better team every year. Last year Trae had post injury Jabari Parker as his second option and a bunch of rookies. You’re lying to yourself if you think that team was better than the mavs. I also don’t see Luka included here  In Game 1 of the Hawks’ first-round series against the New York Knicks, Young had 32 points and 10 assists, becoming the fourth player alongside Derrick Rose, Chris Paul and LeBron James to record at least 30 points and 10 assists in their playoff debut. Young and James are the only two players to have at least 30 points, 10 assists and five rebound in their first playoff game."
This is the first year the squads have even been close. Last year the hawks number 2 option was Jabari Parker for the first 25 games. Pretty sure KP has been an allstar. What allstar does Trae have to work with?
Jason Kidd and Jabari Parker reunion!
Id give Jabari Parker and Moe Wagner a shot too they just fit the playtype
well he was being guarded by Jabari Parker
"I mean the same can be said for the Nets and Celtics series. That team is even worse than the Heat, they were playing Jabari Parker legitimate minutes. Can't really say the Nets have the best offense ever when they played a pretty decimated roster. So, the idea that the Nets are going to stomp the Bucks because they stomped the Celtics doesn't hold up either. Both teams have good cases to win the series without looking at round 1."
Best I can do is Jabari Parker
"You can't be as psyched as having Jabari Parker, Evan Fournier, Tristan Thompson and the ghost of Kemba Walker."
"So…   Assuming we keep Tatum and Brown long-term, then we need a ~7’ Center of commensurate talent, and probably a new PG. I love Kemba, but that knee is just a problem.  If Jabari can really integrate himself into the team, maybe he can be a starting PF,   We need to really overhaul our bench, though. I don’t know how we’re going to do that, but that and a true Center are our biggest priorities.  I dunno. I think the problem has been that we’ve blown it up to an extent every other year. IT to Horford to Kyrie to Hayward to Kemba has really wasted precious team/chemistry building.  I think we can still compete when healthy. And **if** Robert Williams pans out, and **if** Parker can find himself on our team, and **if** we can build a decent bench…  I mean, a lot has to go right, but I think it’s doable. I also have full faith that Ainge will screw it up further.  So I guess that’s my early post-mortem on this season."
&gt;Jabari Parker deserves to be on an NBA roster  The only part I disagree with. Well played series however.
"Positive takeaways:  -Romeo Langford playing offense (we knew his defense was great already)  -Jabari Parker deserves to be on an NBA roster  -Grant Williams is actually okay at basketball when he gets to play the 5  -a healthy Robert Williams is gonna get a triple double with blocks at some point  -Consistent Effort! For six straight games!  -Jayson Tatum was getting elbowed in the face, poked in the eye, slapped in the head, bear-hugged, and double/triple teamed for 6 play-in/playoff games and averaged 33.8-6.2-4.5-1.2-1.7  Now we let everyone get healthy and come back next season with one of the best wing duos in the league. Let’s go Bruins!"
"Crazy, I thought Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Jabari Parker, and Tremont Waters would be able to provide offense for the second unit.  Seriously tho. How did ainge manage to fuck this up so badly?"
"When Jabari Parker is your most efficient offensive player in an NBA playoff elimination game, you know you've got some roster issues"
We are all Bucks fans on this blessed day. May Jabari Parker bless you
"I think the fact that you’re even having cause to discuss Jabari Parker right now says it all right there.  Even when we’re not missing 3 starters Tatum has to do too much for this team, the fact that we’re only down 7 right now is kind of amazing."
Is that number 2 draft pick Jabari Parker?
Jabari Parker I guess
When is this franchise gonna get Jabari Parker the help he needs
It seems like Jabari Parker has at least earned a minimum contract this series. Good for him for doing that
Jabari Parker is cooking the nets.   Giannis is going to average 40 a game.
it is a boring ass game youre not wrong.  second quarter sucked where we watched a lineup led by jabari parker and a bunch of foul calls slowing everything to a crawl.  i think we all know the outcome too.
"The Celtics greatest players, Pritchard and Jabari Parker"
"""It's Jabari time!""  - Jabari Parker"
Jabari Parker greatest offensive weapon of this generation
I want to see jabari Parker elbow drop the Brooklyn logo
"He’s had surgery on his left knee twice, the first time was just a scope removal and the second was a repair. I’ve had both as well and they are minor — was back on the mat in under 3 months for both of mine, the removal was under a month. His had some sprains but definitely nothing serious. Compared to guys like Jabari Parker or Kemba Walker, Joel’s knees are fine."
"I thought Lamelo was going to be terrible, and thought that Jabari Parker and Cleanthony Early were going to be all-stars"
Jabari Parker would be an all star
"Jabari Parker, loved him like 2 ACL tears ago"
Miami gets free agents. Gs not a big city they get free agents. Boston a pretty good team. The way fans hate Kyrie players don’t feel like that most actually like him a lot hell he helped recruit Tatum to duke. Like their literally playing bottom of the barrel g leaguers guys like jabari Parker no one wants to be there lol. It’s sad because Stevens good coach with great core. Seems like their only option now is homegrown and hoping Tatum becomes mvp type.
"Our bench scored the third least amount of points per game this year and it’s only that high because they played the 12 most minutes. If you do per 48 or per 36 or per 100 possessions, they rank at the very bottom of the league.  Our bench wasn’t even our normal bench, it was our benches’ bench and they got over ten more points than normal and almost double the points from your team’s bench. Our two rookies and Jabari Parker alone scored above our average and they did it on 13/20 from the field, 5/9 from three, and only 2/2 from the line."
Jabari Parker was our best Kevin Durant defender tonight.  Let that sink in.
"For the talent level on the court, agreed. Somehow Jabari Parker looked good."
Jabari Parker  +3 tonight in 12minutes
"Very true, but we started Alex Len and Jabari Parker last season. Allen Crabbe was our sixth man. It's like night and day."
Jabari Parker is a former #2 pick
Keep putting jabari Parker and grant Williams on Kyrie that’s a really Good matchup that makes a lot of sense seems to be working
Damn Jabari Parker locked up KD
You know you’re down bad when you have to put Jabari Parker on KD lmao
I forgot we even released Jabari Parker
Bro the celtics are playing Jabari Parker
I had no idea Jabari Parker was still in the league.
Jabari Parker has the same body since like 2012
Gee I can’t believe KD just blew past Jabari Parker like that
"Welcome, Bucks bro. May FiServ Forum gods and Jabari Parker bring you tidings of joy and gifts"
Jabari Parker looks like dollar store Kemba
"Not gonna lie I actually like Grayson Allen despite his antics in College. He plays really hard and I was rooting for that Duke team with Jabari Parker. The fact that Grayson made it to the league and has impact is very impressive to me. That being said the Grizzlies are a YOUNG team, their 1ST Playoff run and everyone is mad at them for not hitting Allen more who was 5/8 from 3. Everyone is not Lebron and knows how to make the right play every single possession. As a young team it’s totally understandable."
"The Nets offered him a max contract after he had a really good shooting season, 51%FG% and 43% from 3, but even then he wasn’t worth it in the slightest. 1 year later he was traded for Jabari Parker and Bobby Portis who were both on expiring contracts, it was a strange trade for Chicago since Otto still had 3 years left on his contract"
Jabari Parker
This makes me so confused about Jabari Parker
"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."
I remember when Wiggins and Jabari Parker were proclaimed to be the future of the league. Damn that was 7 years ago. What the fuck.
Jabari Parker still plays? Why?
"I mean, how can you win when ur no.1 bench is Jabari Parker bro."
The Jabari Parker and Robert Williams minutes have been surprisingly good...
Its kinda funny how when Jabari Parker was drafted he was supposed to be the next Carmelo Anthony and now 6 years later he's arguably worth less than 36 year old Carmelo Anthony
Jabari Parker is still alive??
"Yeah it's literally it, teams are so good at picking who gets switched on nowadays. Like every game just look at who's the weakest link and good offense will move towards that players position and switch there. They either switch to get the mismatch and if they don't switch, the player will shoot a 3 in that timeframe that the defender needs to get around the pick. Hell, the nets feasted on jabari parker doing that game 1 of our series."
Isn’t Jabari Parker super awkward
Imagine what we would have to give up to get Jaylen brown. We would probably have to trade second overall pick Jabari Parker to get him.
All my homies hate Jabari Parker
"Yeah, Jabari Parker is my nephew. I care about him and I'm insulted you didn't know when he last dunked.  Dude nobody gives a fuck if you have watched Jabari dunk recently. Nobody gives a fuck if you bought league pass or whatever tf else. Nobody gives a fuck about your cheese jokes on reddit, based on even more stupid stereotypes and assumptions.   I replied to you because even though you said something totally wrong (that he hadn't dunked since college - which was a joke but still, extremely off - he wasn't doing much else other than dunking...) you then had the typical ignorant / casual  fan passive-aggressive attitude ""aH yEs, sOrRy I wAsN'T wAtcHinG tHe wIzArDs, cAsUaL mE..."".  I mean nobody demanded you to know what Jabari did - you just said something dumb and were corrected - what's with the sarcasm afterwards? Stop being a smartass and move on, you said enough stupid shit in this thread already, don't you think? So yeah, the only reason I replied to you is because users like you are the reason r/NBA is becoming Youtube comments section. Immature kids talking shit, laughable takes, ignorance, smartasses all around. I couldn't care less about Jabari.  Yep. Bye."
"Sigh....  Jay Williams, Luol Deng, Chris Duhon, Carlos Boozer, Elton Brand,  Corey Maggette, JJ Redick, Sheldon Williams, Gerald Henderson, Josh McRoberts, Jason Tatum, Austin Rivers, Jabari Parker, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, RJ Barrett, Jahil Okafor, Grayson Allen  Clearly you don't understand what the word TYPICALLY means. Now you have been schooled. Enjoy the L."
"&gt; Not mind blowing but solid.             [Boring Jabari Parker](https://imageproxy.ifunny.co/crop:x-20,resize:320x,crop:x800,quality:90x75/images/2a3224bdf6f5b4be8d122a5e70391df713f2927389c1917640d04b2fade6823a_1.jpg)"
That was a tale of two halves. Nets were cold in the first half then it was the Celtics turn in the second half. Maybe they should get that rim checked out.  The one part about this game that surprised me was Jabari Parker. He wasn’t spectacular but he held his own on rotations and when the Nets where taking their turns going 1 on 1 against him he wasn’t too bad considering they have 3 of the best iso scorers in the game. If he can keep that up I’d be shocked if he’s not on a roster next year.
They need to execute order 66   Unleash Jabari Parker the secret weapon
"Celtics employ Evan Fournier and Jabari “we don’t get paid to play defence” Parker, they’re down cataclysmically"
"doris burke really has the biggest hate boner for jabari parker lol like he hasn’t even been the worst Celtic in the rotation this game, he’s actually been competent at times"
imagine what a dunk contest would like right now between Jabari Parker and Blake Griffin
Imagine thinking you need a healthy Jaylen Brown when you have Jabari Parker.
"Havent watched much Celts this  year, is Jabari Parker a competent NBA player now or what?"
Gosh damn how is Jabari Parker the biggest topic of the commentary tonight???
I feel like people forget that the bucks had a number two pick in Jabari Parker and him and Giannis were looking great together before the 2nd acl tear. I wonder what this team would have been like if Jabari had stayed healthy.
"&gt; You guys   I'm a Celtics fan.   &gt;I thought it wasn’t teammates so much as the head coach?  The Hawks 2nd best player was Jabari Parker through John Collins' suspension lol. Cam Reddish shot 38%, Deandre Hunter 41%, Vince Carter was playing legit minutes for them, etc.   Their team was awful last year, legit contender for worst in the league, and easily worst in the league for the 25 games Collins was suspended."
"Back then we thought the promising talents was Giannis and jabari parker. I wont fact check it tho, im too lazy"
"&gt; These teams should be lauded for creating the structure to capitalize on it  This is exactly right imo. If you are not a traditional power and/or a desirable market, then you simply cannot expect to have a team full of in-their-prime superstars. That simply doesn't happen for 24-25 teams in the league.  What a ""small"" market team (any team not in the list of 5-6 that can count on a regular influx of superstar talent) *can* do, on the other hand, at least in this era of collaborative superstardom, is commit to being very good for a long enough time that eventually things break right and you can steal one.  That's how Dirk's Mavs did it; that's how the Raptors did it. Those teams hung tough every year, making deep playoff runs, developing world-class chemistry, and ignoring the noise about how they were ""oN a tReAdMiLl"" and would never, indeed *could* never, break through.  Ironically enough, that's exactly how great teams had tended to be built for decades before MJ broke everyone's brains: the GP-Kemp Sonics, the Stockton-Malone Jazz, even the Hakeem-centric Rockets: those teams all lurked around the fringes of contention for an extended period of time. It just so happened that when MJ was healthy, he snuffed them all out. That, combined with Shaq's relatively shocking move to LA and the fluke Spurs season that gave them Tim Duncan, put everyone in the NBA into dynasty-building mode and licensed multi-year tank jobs in the eyes of the public. Front offices could ask their fans: ""How can you expect us to beat the Duncan Spurs or the Kobe-Shaq Lakers without multiple superstars of our own? We *need* to be bad for many years to accumulate the necessary assets, which we will then magically develop into contenders down the line . . . Do not ask us how our young guys will suddenly understand how to win and please do not ask us about why we aren't winning and signing good veteran players in the meantime, either!""  Never mind that there was plenty of evidence that this approach to team-building was cynical at best and a complete farce at worst--evidence in the form of the '04 Pistons, or those tough mid-aughts Pacers teams, or the CWebb Kings, or even the Shaq-Wade Heat--it was easy to sell long-suffering fans in non NY or LA markets on the prospect that a dynasty was always around the corner, on the other end of the tanking rainbow.  Combine that with a wised-up Obama-era basketball fandom that had newly welcomed in thousands of professional-managerial class career strivers from homes in the suburbs, a group of (overwhelmingly) white men who had been trained since childhood to conflate efficiency with absolute moral good and uncritically to accept unlimited asset accumulation as the way of the successful, and you had the perfect storm. This group had cut their fandom teeth on immersive video games that offered the opportunity for bored kids to play God with roster construction and rewarded them for signing players at below-market rates on long-term contracts, exchanging expensive veterans for cheap kids, and accumulating draft picks like free lottery tickets. They could play the games and the Game beyond the game; could be the superstar and the manager in the C-suite that their parents and teachers had prepared them to become.   Of course, a video game can't simulate the toxic effects of perpetual losing and of a lack of locker-room leadership; it can't foresee Kevin Durant and James Harden leaving OKC for their own autonomous reasons any more than it can predict that creating a culture of unlimited entitlement for blue-chip prospects will produce a ""star"" player as fundamentally broken as Ben Simmons.  If the Bucks pull this off, then I'll be all the more delighted that they did so despite their own botched tank job, which produced lottery picks like Brandon Jennings and Joe Alexander and Jabari Parker and ""major"" free-agent signings like Greg Monroe. Despite themselves, the Bucks have built a contender the old-fashioned way: through chemistry and determination, through a culture of winning forged out of years of steady, unheralded improvement, and, most of all, through a heaping portion of luck. Luck gets sneered at around here, and in most of the other self-satisfied neoliberal hell-holes that constitute the majority of social media in this country, but no portion of luck can make a bad team NBA champions. It can make a *good* team into champions, and I think that ought to be enough. Imagine if we had thirty teams trying desperately to be good every year, and holding out hope that, one bright day, everything would break right and their steadfast determination to improve and persevere would finally pay off. I think it'd make for a much better league."
"Many people were high on Luka but others were afraid of another Euro bust.  Also predraft, Fultz was considered the next Harden and Ball was considered a better version of Jason Kidd.  Wiggins was considered to be an elite prospect but had question marks after his college year where Embiid outplayed him before getting injured.  Simmons was compared to LeBron.  Towns was considered a defensive beast.  Bamba and Trae were talked about way more than Jackson Jr.  Jabari Parker was compared to Melo and Pierce and could have gone number one."
Imagine if Jabari Parker never got hurt
Giannis and who?   Brogdon literally was favor to his agent. They had no intention of drafting him. They didn't care about the 46 pick so they just used if for a favor for an agent. One reason Brogdon was never really happy with the organization and wanted to leave.  Norman powell not our pick. kevin porter jr. also not our pick.  Thon Maker major miss. Rashad Vaughn miss. D.J. Wilson miss. Jabari Parker major miss.   Donte was a solid pick at 17.  Our contracts in the early Giannis area were more terrible however.
"We’ll Bucks didn’t know that Khris Middleton was gonna ascend this high   And probably didn’t think Giannis would be 2x MVP either   They were probably banking on them being good complimentary pieces to Jabari Parker but the universe had other plans in mind   Now the moves they made adding guys like Jrue, Lopez and co once they saw what they got in Giannis and Middleton - those are 👍"
Wow - remember when Jabari Parker was the second option.  Weren't they going to give him a max at one point
"I will make the list of Bucks players who died for this:  Michael Redd, Thon Maker, John Henson, Brandon Jennings, Jabari Parker, Mo Williams, Monta Ellis, Andrew Bogut, Charlie Bell, Desmond Mason, Whatever Plumlee they gave a big contract to."
2017 it was PG Pacers with no lance hibbert and turner was 20  the D-Wade Bulls  Giannis first real ass year plus Jabari Parker    Cavs could have competed at least
I was downvoted by Bucks fans for saying Giannis was better without Jabari Parker...
I said Jabari Parker was gonna be a top 10 player ever lol
"They both came from nothing, after thoughts on a team where Jabari Parker was the future."
"A few guys like Jahlil Okafor, Jabari Parker, Kidd-Gilchrist come to mind as players who really didn’t match their hype.  Bennett was shit as but even he didn’t expect to go number 1."
Ain't nobody crowding the deer district to see Jabari Parker
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"
That's former Atlanta starting PF Jabari Parker 2 u
What’s your opinion on Jabari Parker?
"Zach Lavine missed a full year, DRose missed more than a full year, Jabari Parker missed 11 months the 1st time, pretty much a full year the 2nd time, KP missed a year and 8 months. It’s an 11+ month injury nearly every time.   Organisation’s aren’t gonna risk their player’s future to rush them back, especially the Nuggets who have invested $170M in Murray."
I feel like a lot of NBA players have that same mindset.  Andre Drummond seems to have that same mind set. Jabari Parker too. Even better players don't think they need to improve like Ben Simmons and Andrew Wiggins.
"Everybody was talking about Jabari Parker, Wiggins had less hype."
I like how the last vid has a typo at the beginning that says jabari parker
JABARI PARKER
"Yeah we gave jabari Parker 2/40 with this format and he proved even less, plus it was 5 years ago. No one's saying it's the right move, just not impossible"
I mean jrue has struggled offensively a lot and Paul has been the better offensive player consistently throughout the playoffs but jrue has had some big offensive games too and gives us a wider championship window. At the end of the day it’s hard to regret a trade when we’re in the finals for the first time since 1974 after flaming out in relatively embarrassing fashion the last two years. Jrue has gotten us over that hump and if we lose this series it’ll be because we can’t figure out how to not let our bigs get exposed not because Chris Paul is better than jrue holiday. As far as the picks go that would be a solid point but we have a tendency to waste draft picks on end of bench guys anyway I mean we lucked into Giannis got brogdan in the second round which was a steal and drafted donte who is solid but we have continuously wasted picks other than those 3 in the last 10 years. Thon at 10 rashad Vaughn at 17 dj wilson at 17 like we just aren’t really good drafters jabari Parker was just unfortunate with injuries but still in hindsight was a bad pick John Henson was a lottery pick who at his best was a role player on a bad team bogut 1st overall like we’re historically just bad at drafting there’s a reason we were dogshit from 2002-2016 we’re best off just trading out picks cause the chance of us drafting someone who will ever have an impact in the high 20s is low and we still have an early 2nd this year and our first next year so it’s not like we have nothing
Jabari Abdul Jabar Parker - what if
"Trae has zero allstars on his supporting cast and his second and third options were hurt. Before Trae’s injury the hawks would’ve been up 2-1 against the Bucks with Giannis. It’s just funny to me Luka stans loved talking about “winning basketball” last year when Trae had 2 rookies, Alex Len, and Jabari Parker as teammates and now all of a sudden team talent is important. Weird how that works. Either way, it looks like the hawks are in a better position after making the trade than the mavs are. Especially given Reddish’s performance game 6."
Really? Even for something so inconsequential as getting a basketball prediction wrong? Then you're gonna *love* this: I thought Trae Young would be a bigger bust than Anthony Bennett. And I thought Giannis would be a worse Buck than Jabari Parker.   I have millions more of those I can make up if that's what people wanna see
and Micael Redd and Jabari Parker
Who in that group was actually supposed to be good outside of Wiggins. Maybe I don’t know cause I’m not Canadian but the only one of those names I remember having real hype was Wiggins with the Maple Jordan talk and the him vs Jabari Parker for the top pick talk.
I always think about how sick the Bucks would be if they draft Embiid instead of Jabari Parker. Big what if.
&gt; Jabari Parker.   Lol what?
Jabari Parker was a Milwaukee Bucks pick
"Every guy that’s in the league now that I played against or saw during high school got called for this travel at least once per game. Jabari Parker comes to mind for a really bad example. If the ref actually enforced the rule, jabari would have been called every time he made. Literally traveled or palmed the ball every play. It’s definitely ignored in lower levels too. Just not fully ignored."
"Aside from the obvious players that were big stars on both stages like Wade, Trae, Zion, KD, AD, Carmelo, etc:  Beasely, Morrison, Oden, Hansbrough, and Jabari Parker off the top of my head"
"With all nba players such as: 42 year old VC, Jeremy Lin, Jeff Teague, Alex Len, Damion Jones, Miles Plumlee, Jabari Parker, Deandre Bembry, etc"
"He lead the NCAA in scoring an assists as a freshman. Hell, he averaged nearly 30 and 10 last year on a team that was giving heavy minutes to Alex Len, DeAndre Bembry, Jabari Parker, and 43 year old VC.   Yes, he would still be a great player wherever he went."
"Yes, Trae’s team of zero allstars. It’s hilarious that Luka fans suddenly care about team talent. Never remember hearing it when Trae had 2 rookies, Jabari Parker, and Alex Len as his supporting cast."
As a Bucks fan I don't have good memories with our best player coming back from an ACL injury(Jabari Parker)
"It went from crazy Wiggins hype, to Wiggins and Jabari Parker hype, to Embiid being the clear number one, and then after the injury back to Wiggins... but there was still a bit of a debate about who would be better between Wiggins and Parker"
*Cries in Jabari Parker*
Hypertension means nothing. Jabari Parker had the same diagnosis and still had a torn ACL. Hope it's not serious
"Jahlil Okafor put up stats as a Top 3 pick and is now out of the league. Same with Jabari Parker, before my Cs picked him up."
Greg Oden and Jabari Parker
And then they got a supposed centerpiece in Jabari Parker
Jabari Parker
"See: Hassan Whiteside, Jabari Parker, Andrew Wiggins until this year, Andre Drummond etc."
The best highschool basketball player since jabari Parker is...
"Don’t forget Jabari Parker, Evan Turner, Derrick Williams and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. If a top lotto pick isn’t at least a good rotation player in year 1 or 2, he’s almost certainly not going to be a star.   Admittedly Wiseman could be an outlier since he hardly played college ball and then started in the NBA during a COVID-shortened offseason training camp with a shortened season, but that’s a pretty big bet for the Warriors to make with no guarantee that it’s actually worth waiting for a center to develop."
"As I’m sure you’re well aware, active players will basically never just come out and say “Hey fuck that guy” regardless of their issues, because that’s a terrible career move. With that in mind…  [Brogdon: It’s important to have a coach where you believe in what they’re saying… I had that in college and I have that with Bud”](https://np.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/9sir6u/brogdon_with_the_notsosubtle_shade_on_kidd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). Doesn’t take a genius to work out the implication there.  [Jabari Parker denied it obviously but basically everybody who stepped foot in a Bucks facility reported they were not fans of each other](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/01/24/rumor-jason-kidd-jabari-parker-werent-speaking-when-bucks-fired-coach/), and he was disciplined for internal matters at least once.   Kidd himself: “Maybe I did lose the locker room. Maybe they lost trust in what I was trying to do, player-wise, or as owners, or as management. But that was never communicated to me”  [Numerous reports of locker room issues at the Nets.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/jason-kidd-losing-support-within-nets--locker-room-223432794.html)  [It’s noted here that Giannis, who did love him, wasn’t happy with his publicising their phone call after he got fired.](http://thehoopdoctors.com/2018/04/jason-kidd-speaks-he-doesnt-think-he-lost-milwaukee-bucks-locker-room-before-being-fired/)  Also worth noting we haven’t even seen reports of locker room discontent in the years since he left, never mind any confirmation.  Maybe the media is out to get him. Maybe the famously eloquent Brogdon misspoke. Maybe Jabari is the one guy who denied widely reported issues and was actually telling the truth. Maybe he’s just actually not that popular among the players he’s coached, rather than guys who have never played for him and just respect his playing career."
Jabari Parker and Malcolm Brogdon hated his guts fwiw
"&gt;In the winter of 2015, Kidd sensed an unspoken tension as Middleton, Antetokounmpo, Monroe, and Jabari Parker felt out a hierarchy. He wanted it in the open. He interrupted a film session and asked every player on the roster, one by one, who was best among them.   &gt;   &gt;""It was awkward,"" Middleton says. Most nominated Middleton. Antetokounmpo refused to go along. ""He was stubborn,"" Monroe says.   &gt;   &gt;""Khris was better then,"" Antetokounmpo admits.   &gt;   &gt;Middleton and Antetokounmpo ratcheted up the physicality defending each other in practice. ""We were fighting for that top spot, and we were almost actually fighting,"" Antetokounmpo says. ""I would come home with bruises and scratches.""  [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/26041744/khris-middleton-rare-kind-second-star](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26041744/khris-middleton-rare-kind-second-star)"
"Mo Wagner and Jabari Parker also wore 20 for the Cs in 2021, lol."
"Not sure if this counts, but Jason Kidd not letting Jabari Parker shoot 3s"
well his parents named him jabari parker not jabari mover. cant expect him to actually put some effort in on the court
"Jabari Parker. He’s inefficient, can’t shoot or pass and is allergic to defense"
"Lopez replaced Henson, who provided no spacing and was way worse, Lopez unlocked their offense, look at his on/off his first season  With him 117ORTG best offense in the league, without him they drop to 17th in the league   Also removing the deadwood like Jabari Parker who played 26 mins per game, Jason Terry 16 minutes per game replaced by a much better George Hill, Brodgon playing more games etc"
Kidd's peak as a head coach was empowering Giannis when he also had Jabari Parker on the team.
dude half that roster hated him. him and jabari Parker weren’t even on speaking terms when he got fired
"Did you read the comment?  It wasn't just one thing, you had terrible players playing massive minutes, Jabari Parker 25mpg, Henson 26mpg, Jason Terry 16mpg  Those get replaced by much better players and spacing yes   Brook Lopez's addition opened the entire offense, previously u had Henson clogging the paint and now u have a superior player in Brook providing spacing a much better 3rd option"
"A comment ignoring context again  Just firing Kidd did not make Bucks a contender, a lot of things happened   You added Brook replacing trash John Henson, got rid of the trash ass Jabari Parker, got rid of Jason Terry's corpse and replacing him with George Hill, Brogdon missed half the season as well and improved the next also Giannis a year older improving as well"
"&gt; He certainly wasn't a great coach but Milwaukee showed vast improvement from his first season there to his last season there.  This is just categorically untrue. Everything was worse by the end. In his 1st season, he employed an aggressive, blitzing defensive scheme that led to us having the second-best defensive efficiency rating in the NBA. But the whole league figured it out by his 2nd year and he never changed it. Our defensive rating went from 2nd to 22nd to 19th to 25th at the time he was fired in his last season.  He never improved schematically as a coach and had zero answers when things went wrong. He would always just blame ""energy and effort"" (get used to that phrase) and took to blaming the team's youth for his shortcomings toward the end of his tenure (the roster overall was fairly young, but the core outside of Giannis really wasn't).  And he continued to make some of his most brain-dead decisions up until the very end. There was a game about a month before he was fired where we were up 3 with 1.4 seconds left against Cleveland. He instructed Khris Middleton to intentionally miss his free throw so we could avoid the possibility of a 4-point play. I'm not kidding, that's 100% real. Not long before that, there was a game where we led by 4 against Detroit with 10 seconds left and intentionally fouled career 86% FT shooter Reggie Jackson, justifying it with this gem:   &gt; They’re trying to play the game of quick twos to save their timeouts, so we’ll just play the free-throw game with them. I believe that my guys will make the free throws. They miss one and it works. It’s a free-throw game no matter what, but we wanted to send them to the line  He was a dreadful in-game coach from start to finish in Milwaukee and he didn't make up for it by being some phenomenal players' coach. He reportedly wasn't even on speaking terms with Jabari Parker by the end and Malcolm Brogdon barely hid his disdain for Kidd. Giannis liked him, but that says much more about Giannis than Kidd.  Maybe he's learned a lot since then (mostly in terms of player relations, it's extremely difficult for me to imagine him achieving close to competency as an in-game coach) and won't be as much of a disaster as he was here. He wasn't Jim Boylen levels of bad in player management, but I honestly do think this is closer to hiring Boylen than it is a ""shades of gray"" situation like you're saying."
Bzzt wrong. He discourages 3’s and has a completely outdated defensive scheme  He banned Pre-2nd ACL tear Jabari Parker from Shooting 3’s!
"I was so relieved when the Bucks drafted Jabari Parker over Joel Embiid. I was sure Embiid would always be limited by injuries, and knew Parker would shine."
"I agree that he meant Tony Parker. it was just a joke because Jabari Parker and Tony Parker have the same last name, except Jabari Parker is tall and Tony Parker is below average height for an NBA player"
Oh thank you. I should’ve realized. Cuz I was definitely outraged at this guy throwing Jabari Parker in with those other names lol
Jabari Parker is 6'8 so that's a little too tall but I'll agree with Steph and Kyrie!
The new Jabari Parker
I mean Jabari Parker wouldve been an MVP level talent if he wasnt injured IMO
Jabari Parker was our second best player available for months!
"Lol this guy kinda reminds me of jabari parker. Insane talent and potential, but made of glass and terrible attitude"
Jabari Parker
"You think he built a team with 2 rookies playing about 30 mpg (Hunter and Reddish), Jabari Parker, DeWayne Dedmon, DeAndre Bembry, Jeff Teague, Allen Crabbe, Alex Len, Vince Carter, and Even Turner....And was seriously attempting to win basketball games? That's what you call tanking buddy."
Off topic - why didn't Jabari Parker pan out? He should be out there having 25/10/5 games to complement Giannis.
Add Jabari Parker you cowards
"We get it across the board as Celtic fans.   2K won't even give us a strong Semi Ojeleye.  [At 20 years old, Grant Williams was in the 96th percentile for strength testing by P3.](https://twitter.com/Sam_Vecenie/status/1139560922647654400)   They don't have to be made into all-stars but both those dudes are stronger than Jabari Parker and Chris Boucher."
"Probably #1 and no way he slips past #2 as he would be better than at least 17/20 (Ja and LMA are toss-ups imo) out of the last 20 years of #2 picks  2020 James Wiseman, Memphis - Golden State Warriors  **2019 Ja Morant, Murray State – Memphis Grizzlies**  2018 Marvin Bagley, Duke – Sacramento Kings  2017 Lonzo Ball, UCLA – Los Angeles Lakers  2016 Brandon Ingram, Duke – Los Angeles Lakers  2015 D’Angelo Russell, Ohio State – Los Angeles Lakers  2014 Jabari Parker, Duke – Milwaukee Bucks  2013 Victor Oladipo, Indiana – Orlando Magic  2012 Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Kentucky – Charlotte Bobcats  2011 Derrick Williams, Arizona – Minnesota Timberwolves  2010 Evan Turner, Ohio State – Philadelphia 76ers  2009 Hasheem Thabeet, Connecticut – Memphis Grizzlies  2008 Michael Beasley, Kansas State – Miami HEAT  **2007 Kevin Durant, Texas – Seattle Supersonics**  **2006 LaMarcus Aldridge, Texas – Chicago Bulls (Draft rights traded to Portland Trail Blazers)**  2005 Marvin Williams, North Carolina – Atlanta Hawks  2004 Emeka Okafor, Connecticut – Charlotte Bobcats  2003 Darko Milicic, Serbia &amp; Montenegro – Detroit Pistons  2002 Jay Williams, Duke – Chicago Bulls  2001 Tyson Chandler, Dominguez HS (Calif.) – L.A. Clippers (Draft rights  traded to Chicago Bulls)"
"You're really fucking hung up on a 1 year 6.5 million dollar deal to Jabari Parker in a tank season as your proof hes not a top GM so I dont know what to tell you, and for hiring Lloyd Pierce who at the time of the hire was considered one of top up and coming young coaches."
"&gt; If Luka was in the East he would have been in the finals **last year**.  This is peak /r/NBA right here.  I'm betting you have absolutely no idea who was on the Hawks roster last year.  Luka would not have made the playoffs in the East with that roster.  &amp;nbsp;  The center rotations were Dedmon, Bruno Fernando, Alex Len, and Damian Jones.  None of those guys can even get minutes today.  We also started 2 rookies, Reddish and Hunter.  Hunter was bad last year, Reddish was bad to mediocre at times.  Heurter was our starting SG, good for about 12 ppg on terrible efficiency.  Our most seasoned player, 3rd year Collins, was suspended for 25 games.  &amp;nbsp;  Round off our rotation with Jabari Parker, Bembry, and Vince Carter chucking his way into retirement and you think that Luka instead of Trae is going to the finals lmfao this sub really never misses"
Pretty sure this happens a lot. Like Josh Jackson refused to work out for the Celtics. Kristaps Porzingis refused to workout or be interviewed by the Sixers. Luka refused to give medical records to the Kings. Mo Bamba told the Grizzlies not to draft him. Jahlil Okafor told the Sixers not to draft him. Jabari Parker allegedly 'tanked' his workout with the Cavs so they wouldn't draft him.  Hell Steph Curry refused to workout for any team except the Knicks. Kobe Bryant was telling every team in the league he would only play for the Lakers all the way back in 1996.   Long story short it happens all the time. Sometimes the player gets what they want. Sometimes they don't.
"Hey, I hear you brother but the draft is a crapshoot. The Bucks got Jabari Parker at 2 and Thon Maker at 10, and lucked into the franchise savior at 15. Hell, even Ben Simmons wasn’t the franchise player he was made out to be at the time."
"It's definitely impressive to get them this far, but it doesn't automatically make Travis Schlenk of the best GMs in the league. Otherwise, GM rankings would be just be a literal list of the teams with the best record in a given season.  What's the purpose of signing Jabari Parker? If it was to be a sixth man, he was one of the most expensive, and yet worst in the league. And team didn't win close to 30 games because of it and not picking up a backup point guard If it was somehow to be bad, you didn't have give someone a two year contract to do it. How is it possibly arguable that signing a bad player to a bad contract is better than using the capspace to get a first round pick or other asset?   It was a bad move. Just like hiring Lloyd Pierce. Just like choosing a backup center over Haliburton. Yes, these are things that his team was able to overcome, meaning he's pretty good GM. But he's not automatically fourth or one of the best because they are in the final four of the NBA.  You are defending to the death the guy who hired Lloyd Pierce and almost fired him too late to salvage this magnificent season. Anyway, enjoy Kris Dunn next year. Another genius Schlenk signing."
"Jabari Parker was supposed to be a sixth man on a projected 30 win team. The goal wasn’t to win games. Why is this difficult for you understand? Schlenk came in at a time where the team got bounced from the first round of the playoffs, and our only true positive assets were basically Taurean Prince and John Collins. That team was obviously going nowhere. He took a team with a lack of assets and got them to the eastern conference finals in three years. That’s objectively very fucking impressive and you know it."
"Three paragraphs rough stuff huh?   AI on Hawks = Hawks not winning more games anyway because...  AI = not showing up anyway and was bad in regular season, thus....  Jabari Parker signing = not good, made no sense, better to have asset   You apparently thinking the Jabari Parker signing was a good move and better than having asset = lolz lmao"
"Oh was there a huge threat of that happening with last year's Hawks team that was apparently trying to be bad? Not having a backup point guard is part of some master plan to be bad but a bad disinterested AI would have won taken the Hawks from 20 wins to what, 22 or 23? The Hawks would still have Okongwu anyway, or maybe even still better had the lottery odds the Bulls and Hornets got.  And he wasn't showing up because he wanted to be on a winner and get an extension. And even if he did, seems like the Hawks would have gotten the guy with a 10.5 PER who scored 4 points a game in the regular season.  Got to hand it to you. Arguing the Jabari Parker signing is a good move is pretty devoted fandom. I'd rather have a first round pick or literally anything else than have wasted cap space for a player with no upside. You could have been bad without him and gotten an asset or taken a shot with the roster spot for someone with upside that you could get for a cost controlled deal. But please keep arguing to the end of time that it made sense or reflects the work of an elite GM."
"I am hung on Jabari Parker because it's an example of the General Manager not maximizing everything at his disposal to make the team as good as possible. When you are arguing someone is the best GM in the league you are putting them in a tier with people who make the possible decision time and time again and maximize assets. They didn't do that last season.  They didn't do that when they hired Lloyd Pierce. He even made mistakes this season, not critical ones but still stuff that people at the time knew was bad.  The Hawks are having a great year and are a fun team with tons of toughness shown. You can enjoy the ride and not lose your head and become state run media.   And Cam Reddish all-nba defense? Oh man, just ludicrous."
"From the very beginning, Schlenk has come out saying that this was going to be a rebuild. He constructed the roster to be in the best position to acquire assets for expiring and overpriced contracts. He did a better job of managing the tank than the Process Sixers.   And let’s just discuss your points here…why are you so hung up on Jabari Parker? He doesn’t play for the team anymore and was supposed to be a sixth man last year anyways. He was just pushed into starting position because of JC’s suspension. And in any case, team construction was bad last year because we were tanking.   lol how do you criticize any of the signings from last offseason when all those guys are a huge reason why we’re in the ECF?  Can Reddish hasn’t been great yet so far in his career, but all it takes is things slowing down for him. He’s only played like 80 games in his career, and he’s already flashed potential as someone who could make an all-nba defense team in the future."
"Wow, definitely great to sign Jabari Parker instead of getting the first round pick the Grizzlies got for taking on Andre Iguodala. 4d chess there.  Great GMs maximize every asset and opportunity. Arguing bad moves were actually good because Hawks got to draft a backup center is really something."
Awful contracts like Jabari Parker that Schlenk made the decision to sign?  The lack of a backup point guard hurt player development and put even more of a load on Trae than was necessary in a growth season.  He's probably in the top half of the league but to say he is one of the best ignores a lot of bad decisions.
"But you said few guys used the midrange and it’s pretty clear that’s not the case. An assortment of guys is relying on the midrange to score more than Booker is.  Guys these playoffs averaging more midrange attempts than restricted area attempts include Embiid, Middleton, Westbrook, Randle, Tatum, CP3, Butler, CJ, Kyrie, Dragic, MPJ, Melo, Bogdan, Ish, Hunter, Marcus Morris, Gallinari and a whole lot of others  More midrange than three include: KD, Embiid, Westbrook, Butler, CP3, Rose, AD, Ish, Lou Williams, Tyler Herro, Tyrese Maxey, and Jabari Parker among others.  It’s just not accurate that Booker is one of the few players with a midrange game."
"I don’t remember any Luka fan talking about team talent last year when Trae had 2 rookies, Jabari Parker, and Alex Len, yet they loved to talk about Trae not making the playoffs and Luka making it."
Wizards Jabari Parker always torched me a few years ago
Oh boy lol nevermind I don't want the bulls to trade for him. This reminds me of Jabari Parker saying he doest get paid to play defense.
And so was Jabari Parker.
"And the Bucks went with Jabari Parker.  Imagine Giannis, Khash, &amp; Embiid."
"&gt;the point  I thought the point wasn't that you need a lot of picks (that would be more of the OKC strategy), but that you need to lose on purpose to get a couple of very top tickets in a short period of time rather than a bunch of so-so tickets. I don't really think that worked out. Embiid is good, but he has injury concerns. If he didn't have injury concerns he was pretty clearly the #1 in that draft and the Sixers would have ended up with Jabari Parker most likely."
Bro you’re crazy. I didn’t see Jabari Parker or Alex Len put up Capela numbers.
Remember when Jabari Parker said he's not paid to play defence? Ben Simmons is the opposite.
Jabari Parker
"Rookie Thon was pretty highly regarded then believe it or not, he came off a coming out party in the playoffs against the Raptors.  Malcolm had just won ROTY.    Khris was always pretty highly valued.   Jabari Parker had a 20 PPG season in which he had all star consideration but him getting that ACL injury screwed him.   Same though, I love Khris and wouldn’t trade him for anything. His progression to what he’s become for us was amazing to watch."
"The Bucks were offering a much better package to the Cavs and yet these guys took the Celtics offer, still pissed about that.  It was basically anyone but Giannis.  Malcolm Brogdon - highly valued at the time.  Khris Middleton - highly valued too.  Thon Maker - highly valued.  Jabari Parker - highly valued.  Picks - highly valued.  These guys really rejected whatever combination of that for what turned out to be Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood &amp; George Hill (top 10 pick too).   Collin Sexton makes it worth but still, why not take the Bucks package."
"Again, listen to yourself. You’re saying adding embiid instead of jabari Parker wouldn’t have worked out for the bucks. Go post this in the bucks sub and see how far to oblivion you get downvoted.  Obviously giannis’s shooting stats were bad and he was shooting terribly from three those early years, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that he was still averaging 22 a game in 2016-17 when embiid played 31 games that season, and averaging 27 a game the season the next year when embiid played 69 games for the first time in his career. You’re telling me the bucks wouldn’t have made it work with 2 shaq esque players on the roster? Who the hell is going to stop that lmao  And if your point is that the 2015-16 bucks had no spacing… no shit? That’s irrelevant because they could have just signed more shooters after seeing how good embiid/giannis/Middleton were (as they did even in the current timeline). Embiid shoots 30+% from 3  You’ve got to stop with this “I watched them, you didn’t” nonsense. Giannis was a star in 2017, most active users on this sub were watching him in games, albeit not every game.  Also I think it’s funny you claim I’m not watching the bucks, but you didn’t even know embiid played less than half the season his third year.   You had a bad take, that’s fine. No need to project"
I thought Jabari Parker was tbh
Jabari Parker  Current John Wall
"Just to name a few:  Oj Mayo — “the next MJ,” Good ol’ Jimmer (I still have faith), Dennis Smith Jr., Jabari “no knees” Parker, Gary Harris (maybe this will be the year)"
"Injury bust is still a bust. Same goes for Jabari Parker in the OP.  It sucks and it’s not fair to the player, but ultimately the draft pick was a bust."

"0 sympathy for Jabari ""I don't get paid to play defense"" Parker"
Maybe [they should have payed him to play defense](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2018/7/19/17588208/jabari-parker-defense-interview-bulls-bucks-nba-free-agency)  It was really the multiple ACL tears that did him in
"Trae had Jabari Parker, Alex Len, and 2 rookies in 2020…"

It does though. Jabari Parker was hyped but not as much as Zion. Zion was nearing LeBron levels of hype.
Hype only has a little to do with it. When Jabari Parker was drafted he had had so much hype but the bucks got maybe 1 game  nationally.
"Mirotic's contract with Barcelona was for 6 years and $79 million and he signed it before Covid. Covid is why he took such a big paycut the following year. Not disagreeing with the rest of your points, but I'd still like to know about which exact players somebody's talking about when they're supposedly better than some NBA players. I think the figure is 90-95%, and not necessarily higher than 95%.  I have trouble believing that Mo Bamba would have a good career with Real Madrid, or that James Wiseman would be a whole lot better with Fenerbahce. Here's a short list of Eastern Conference players currently with contracts for 2021-22 who I don't think should be in the NBA:  1. Udonis Haslem  2. Devin Cannady (Magic)  3. Mo Bamba  4. Cassius Winston (Wizards)  5. Nick Richards (Hornets)  6. Sam Merrill (Bucks)  7. Kelan Martin (Pacers)  8. Sekou Doumbouya  9. Cory Joseph  10. Kevin Knox  11. Jabari Parker  12. Paul Reed (Sixers)  13. Sam Dekker  I'm sure there's a few more in there."
"The issue we are having is you are totally caught up on defense.  You say athleticism is at a all time high but so is endurance in all other sports. With today's training and sports science guys are better physically. But you ignore the better endurance. You ignore the physicality and all the advantages athletes today have.  My argument is players today have lots of advantages and that should allow them to play at least the same amount of time.  Your argument is they run sooo much more today that it erases the huge advantages modern day players have, it erases the much more physical play and its so taxing that not only does it negate those but they still have to play less games and minutes per game.  Problem is less games and minutes is factual. Not only do with both agree but everyone agrees players today are in better condition. But your argument is based on your opinion but have no facts to back it up. Not even facts that there is more running but that it's so much more taxing that even with advantages they still gotta play less.  There are plenty of respectable journalists, broadcasters and dormer players and coaches that watch or work in the game today who say players aren't playing defense. Jabari Parker straight up said he isn't paid to play defense."
"They had Exceeded expectations around that time. Giannis hadn’t arrived arrived yet, they had just drafted Jabari Parker with the 2nd pick but he had gotten hurt and Knight was looking like their best player. Think he averaged like 17-18 and 5 that year so not great but also outside of like Wall,Lowry and Kyrie around that time the east wasn’t that deep at the PG spot. Thought he could’ve easily got that last spot in the ASG"
"I went to the KU-Duke game in Chicago in 2013 and all the hype was for Andrew Wiggins vs Jabari Parker. Joel Embiid came off the bench that game. But as the season went on the hype started shifting from Wiggins to Embiid. Particularly after Joel started flashing some low-post moves. I remember Fran Fraschilla being hyped after Embiid's ""Dream Shake.""   So I think Embiid always had pretty good footwork, probably from playing volleyball and soccer growing up. And that combined with being big and strong and naturally talented led to him quickly developing as a basketball player. The scary thing with Embiid is that he's still making huge strides in his improvement as a player. His mid-range improvement last season was pretty remarkable. He just needs to stay healthy."
"**2020 Final Four:**  Milwaukee- Tanked for Jabari Parker and got lucky with Giannis   Los Angeles- Signed Kawhi Leonard   Atlanta- Missed the playoffs from 2017-20 and picked 3rd, 8th, 10th, 6th  Phoenix- Missed the playoffs from 2010-20 and have a bunch of picks including 1st overall"
"They compared him to Tracy McGrady, and Jabari Parker to Paul Pierce, before the draft."
"First off physicality and complexity  of defense aren't related and are 2 different things and you gave have one, both or neither so im not sure why you are trying to marry them.  The league wasn't just man to man 30 years ago. Just like you see guys carry, travel, hook and guard the ball with their off hand illegal things were tolerated back then too. Teams used zone and doubled.  Also today's defenses aren't perfect. As we see with guys like KD and Harden you can easily clear out one side of the court and go 1v1 or you can manipulate  screens to hey a total mismatch. Plus there is just far less effort today. The reason why JJ Redick can start 500 games and Steve Kerr was only able to start 30 is because you had to at least hold your own on defense back in the day. Now you got guys like Jabari Parker feeling so comfortable not playing defense that he even said he isn't paid for defense.  And in today's game when you clear out one side or get a mismatch off a screen if the defense looks at you hard it's a foul. Back in the 80's and 90's you were definitely  getting touched. Today it's like practice, easy offense"
"Weird answer, but Jabari Parker. I'd been to Bucks games as a kid growing up, loved Glenn Robinson, Michael Redd, etc. but fell off during the years of mediocre late lottery or 7/8 seed finishes.  But I was working a job with a bunch of guys more into the NBA than me in 2014 and the run up to that draft was great. We were finally getting a blue chip prospect, maybe the skinny Greek guy who showed flashes can form a fun front court combo in three or four years. It was very hype, had a draft party with work friends where we all celebrated getting Jabari and that excitement carried me into watching not just Bucks games, but surveying the league as a whole again. And while everything didn't quite work out with Jabari, that momentum and sense of buy-in has only strengthened since."

"Trae averaged 8.2 APG his rookie year with a big rotation of Dewayne Dedmond, Alex Len, 2nd year John Collins, and Omari Spellman. Averaged 9.3 APG his second year with a big rotation of Bruno Fernando, John Collins, Jabari Parker, Damien Jones, and Alex Len. He's a better passer than Luka. Luka is still a better overall player, but passing in particular Trae is better."
"What player could’ve taken a squad of Alex Len, Jabari parker, and two rookies to the playoffs?"
I thought Jabari parker was gonna be the next big thing in the league
"They both started their careers as projects, but Kawhi's project years were with Poppovich, Duncan, Ginobili and TP.  Giannis grew up with Jason Kidd and Jabari Parker.  Kawhi won a title and then moved to an already great team and won a title as the ""undisputed best player."" Kawhi has never been as good as Giannis in the regular season, and Giannis just matched his alpha dog championship with 50 points in the close out game.  Any injury related excuses that apply to Giannis's ring apply just as much to Kawhi's time in Toronoto.   Kawhi has had 2 season ending injuries in the conference finals, Giannis is a freak who dropped 40 points in the Finals a week after hyper-extending his knee  Giannis is better"
"I feel like this could have different brackets.  Self destruction: OJ mayo, Lamar Odom. Injuries. D-Rose, Jabari Parker, Andrew Bynum Good player but still kind of qualifies: John Wall, Cousins, Porzingis Guys who were legit top 5 but got old. Melo, Dwight, Marc Gasol Guys who plateaued early: Trevor Ariza, Al Jefferson, Jahlil Okafor, Malcolm Brogdan."
Jabari Parker
Jabari Parker
"Ben Simmons, Tyreke Evans, OJ Mayo, Demarcus Cousins, Jabari Parker"
I still can't believe Jabari Parker never became an all star.
Michael Beasley had flashes of being a superstar but just never put it together.   Jabari Parker looked like an offensive Dynamo pre injuries.   Derrick Rose same as Parker but at an even higher level.  Rondo was seen as one of the best up and coming point guards and eventually became a role player
Jabari Parker. I was heavily invested in that hyped up draft class and I thought for sure Jabari was going to be the next Melo.
"Because for every underachieving Thon Maker and Jabari Parker, we have an overachieving Giannis and Khris Middleton"
Jabari parker
"Are people really being honest with their answers?  Saying names like Michael Carter Williams/Tyreke Evans/Jabari Parker and whatever is at the top of the page when you Sort By Best?  Like who do people consider as top 5 players right now?  Players like Giannis?  Anthony Davis?  Kawhi Leonard?   The names that people are listing, do people really think were going to reach that level?   Top 5 is Finals MVP level.  You look at a guy like Jimmy Butler, who was the best player in a NBA Finals team, I doubt majority of the people consider him top 5 level.  Or even the Suns teams this past Finals.  Do people consider anybody in Suns a top 5 player?  Top 5 is a ridiculous high level to reach."
Jabari Parker.
"Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr, Tyreke Evans, OJ Mayo, Adam Morrison, Emmanuel Mudiay, Jahlil Okafor, and more lol. There’s a lot of these guys 😭"
"Tyreke Evans, OJ Mayo, Michael Beasley, Jabari Parker, and technically Dwyane Wade is out of the league"
Jabari Parker honestly. The injuries killed his career but he looked so good that rookie year.
Jabari Parker
"The real question is how great Jabari Parker and Andrew Wiggins are. I think they are only a few years away from being a few years away, some brilliant young stars right their poised to make a splash in the league in several years."
"Jabari Parker.  He was on the verge of becoming an all star at 21 years old averaging 21 PPG, 6 RPG, 3 APG on 49/37/74 splits until his injury happened again."
"Trae’s had better assist stats since they got drafted. Even when he was playing with Jabari Parker, Damian Jones, Alex Len and Kent Bazemore."
"- Kyrie Irving without LeBron is nobody.  - Popovich gotta seriously retire.  - Mike D’Antoni is a terrible head coach.  - As a Warriors fan I hated seeing KD in our jersey because everyone discredits our rings during his tenure.  - The Sacramento Kings shouldn’t even exist and I was mad af when the NBA halted their relocation to Seattle.  - We all talk about D-Rose, Brandon Roy, etc. but imho one of the greatest “what if’s” in NBA recent history is Jabari Parker. The hype around him was huge back in the day.  - The “Big 3+1” Boston Celtics were a “superteam” but everyone kinda avoids this conversation.  - The Hall of Fame has become a f*ckin joke.  - The Nuggets are the most overrated team right now."
"Only the NBA channel can rank a Finals clinching dagger shot at #30, right behind a regular season assist to Jabari Parker"
"....what're you talking about?  Jabari Parker without the injuries was absolutely a probable star.  When Chicago signed him, he was already finished."
"&gt;Similarly, Giannis never needed to be #1 because the team had Jabari Parker and Khris Middleton.  Are we seriously going to pretend either of those players compare to Embiid?  &gt;And, yeah, Giannis taking shots affected the spacing on those occasions he hit them. Sometimes, he got hot ;)  Okay  All year long Giannis had 3 games of 3+ makes from 3. None came in the playoffs  You’re telling me that him being hot for 3/82 games was worth the other games he was actively hurting his team bricking 3s?"
"Similarly, Giannis never needed to be #1 because the team had Jabari Parker and Khris Middleton.  And, yeah, Giannis taking shots affected the spacing on those occasions he hit them.  Sometimes, he got hot ;)"
"Fuck no, I wouldn't offer him that.  If you offer him 170/4, you still need a rim protector, someone to run the half court and a shooter, and you can't pay for that under the cap if you're paying Ben Simmons a 170/4.  Ben Simmons is someone you hire if you're desperate to get into the 7th seed and lose.  And if we're going to do that, I'd prefer to hire a Brandon Knight/Jabari Parker all offense-no defense type, as they might get hot four times in a row and get us to the *third* round."
"OK. Major difference is that Giannis was always willing to shoot and, more importantly, was always willing to be the #1 - no, really, check the internal conflict between Jabari Parker, Khris Middleton and Giannis Atentokoumpo as to who was #1.  Ben Simmons has always wanted to get paid. He has never wanted to be #1."
"Dude also pissed off Malcolm Brogdon and Jabari Parker, I didn’t realize this was a shock"
"We were better. We absolutely were not by any stretch of the imagination 19 wins better, and going from Henson to Lopez sure as hell doesn’t take a defence from 19th to best in the league.  What evidence is there that Kidd is actually good? His teams haven’t been good. The Bucks wildly improved as soon as he left and we got a real coach, even some no name assistant did a better job. You can point to *numerous* individual in-game examples of stupidity, like leaving Brogdon on the bench for a whole half for no reason or telling Middleton to miss a FT on purpose while up by 3 with a second left. As much as people harp on Dame and Giannis liking him, he clearly isn’t liked by everybody - Brogdon and Jabari Parker have both thrown shots and Brandon Knight has apparently talked a whole lot of shit in this book, among others (including even assistants). The positives are what? Giannis and Middleton improving while he was there, and continuing to improve after he left?  If this guy wasn’t a HOF point guard you’d be talking just as much shit as Bucks fans do, he’s a half step above Jim Boylen at best."
"I think there's a decent chance Schroeder comes off the bench. He seems to have done better in that role, and he can do more individually with bench units compared to sharing the floor with the Jays.  Grant will probably get playing time since we are thin at the 4. Horford doesn't really play the 4 anymore, and Kanter certainly doesn't. I guess we have Jabari Parker still? Who might be a decent option as a sparkplug 4 off the bench.  Kanter may end up being more of a situational guy. When both Horford and Timelord are healthy, I can see Kanter getting DNPs.   Langford will probably get some minutes too, tbd on if he manages to be a regular rotation guy. I hope so."
"Jabari Parker, Danny Ainge, Keith Van Horn, Jimmer Fredette, Shawn Bradley"
"Jabari Parker, he literally couldn't give less of a shit about defense, i know normally when people say that its exaggerating a little but the man has out right said [""They don’t pay players to play defense""](https://www.sbnation.com/2018/7/19/17588208/jabari-parker-defense-interview-bulls-bucks-nba-free-agency)"
Jabari Parker looked really good in his first summer league game too. Slow your roll
Does Jabari Parker nullify all the defensive additions lol
Jabari Parker?
"I know this guy has been injured a lot, but I want to include Jabari Parker on this list. I thought he would be a HOF, and that he would lead his team to a title instead of Giannis.  I did not expect him to be such a defensive sieve, so much so that I would rather have an empty roster spot over Parker.  To me, even without the injuries, I saw that I was wrong almost right away. I know you said no injuries, but he is one of those rare exceptions for me."
"People are ignoring the Chicago ties him, THT and AD share. THT and him both played for the Chicago powerhouse Simeon (for context, Derrick Rose and Jabari Parker also played for Simeon)."
So I guess you forgot all about Jabari Parker /s
Jabari parker looked significantly more explosive after his first acl tear tho. I'm guessing cos he got in better shape and strengthened other parts of his body.
"Idk really but Jabari Parker, Andre Drummond, Ben Simmons, Tingus Pingus?"
I mean we drafted Jabari Parker.
i know jabari parker and greg monroe did for the bucks in recent past
"Lol, is everyone else saying he doesn’t give a damn about defense? I just thought that was me, and even then I was stretching things too far, it was only a gut feeling that he’d develop into something like Jabari Parker lol"
"Most people are low on Daishen Nix. Man, I love the guy. I like passers. Wish someone took a chance on him, and I was really hoping the Bucks would get him, would be a nice backup playmaker off the bench.  On the other hand, I’m not sold on Jalen Green. Might be reaaaaally unpopular, but in a few years time I could definitely see him adopt a Jabari Parker mentality of “they don’t pay me to play defense.” He’s a score first guy and… well, let’s just hope for the best lol."
"Give their name back to New Orleans, rebrand to the Stormin Mormons and bring in Jabari Parker and Jimmer Fredette. Joseph Smith would see to them three-peating."
"He’s basically jabari Parker, idk if he is worth anything"
"The problem is that ""big market"" hasn't really attracted a lot of free agents because Garpax are that unsavoury. It's been a long ass time since the Bulls have been able to target and get the guy/guys that they wanted and execute their plan. The plan is clear as opposed to garpax where every year we're left thinking ""hmmm maybe this might work?""...  Shit like Jabari Parker at small forward, Rondo and Wade to pair with Butler, letting dinwiddie go to grab MCW etc."
Jabari Parker type beat.
"Again it depends on the guy. See, Klay Thompson and DeMarcus Cousins who both missed a whole season in 2019, and Jabari Parker (injured in Feb 2017 and didn’t return till Feb 2018) and Brandon Knight who got injured in July 2017 and missed the whole next season."
Jabari Parker
"Our roster was certainly embarrassing. Tony Snell, thon maker, Jabari Parker, Jason terry, Eric Bledsoe. I like them all a lot as a bucks fan but none of them were great basketball players. And all of them coached by Joe Prunty."
The Bucks were a bad team that year. it's not embarrassing at all. We gave significant minutes to Thon Maker and Jabari Parker.
I can't believe we went to game 7 in this series with Jabari Parker complaining in the locker room that he is not getting paid to play defense.
"Idk, he hasn't lived up to being #4 but this thing is a crap shoot. 2013 was Anthony Bennett/Victor Oladipo/Otto Porter/Cody Zeller. 2014 was Andrew Wiggins/Jabari Parker/Joel Embiid/Aaron Gordon. Alex Len and Dante Exum were the #5s those years. You obviously hope to get a franchise-altering guy in the top 10 (especially top 4), but really you're praying to avoid a bust. An above average role player historically isn't bad for a Top-10 pick."
He can’t be any worse than Romeo Langford or Semi Ojeleye or Jabari Parker
Jabari Parker was a better prospect at the time than Barnes. I know you're tryna be a wise ass but capping ceilings on players is useless when development is non-linear and often random.  The point is to say Barnes has a superstar ceiling *while also saying* Suggs doesn't is just 100% wishful thinking.
Because his name is Carmelo Anthony   Jabari Parker wouldn’t be given the same treatment
"Andrew Wiggins was the first pick. Jabari Parker went number two.   Anybody can do it yet they didn’t/don’t.  It’s okay if you don’t understand the economics of the NBA, I’m sure you’re here to learn."
"Jabari Parker with the bucks. Was an athletic freak with the ball and was really hoping the bucks would keep him but because of his injuries and him wanting a nice contract and Giannis' development it didn't work out. Still like him in limited minutes as he can still get buckets and offensive rebound but bit of a liability on defense. Also, a real stand up guy that did a lot for the community.  Felt so bad for the bucks and worse for Jabari. Hope he can still have a decent career and latch on with a team rather than bouncing around."
"Like most things, I assume the truth is somewhere in the middle.    There are plenty of Bostonians who couldn’t name one player on the Celtics, or tell you if they’re any good right now (much less any details), and who have absolutely no idea which college or NBA players are from Boston.  Then there are people who could name the starting lineups of every top local high school team and tell you what kind of foot cream Jabari Parker uses.  Between those extremes is a ton of variation.  So it’s probably true that in that great middle area there were more people who had heard of Clarke than who’ve heard of your average high school player from the area — ad these things go he was probably pretty well-known.  But it’s also probably true that if you’d asked any random Bostonian who this guy was… more likely than not they wouldn’t know.  So, the answer here is in the middle somewhere."
"Jabari Parker was a better prospect than Jalen, yet he flopped. Lol. Nobody sees anything during draft."
He should really be compared to Jabari Parker because every franchise would have picked either one of those guys that year.
"Every year, we pretend that we know for sure which players are going to be good and which aren't. Every year there's guys we think are meaningless who turn out to be really solid. Every year, there's guys we thing are going to be really solid at the top of the draft that *totally* blow.   Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker in 2014 were really underwhelming for their hype. Dante Exum and Nik Stauskas straight up were terrible NBA players. They were the 5th and 8th picks.   But that's just one year, you might say...  2015: Jahlil Okafor, pick 3...had a lot of hype as a potential #1 overall guy a few months before the draft. Total bust. Mario Hezonja, pick 5? Worthless. Mudiay and Stanley Johnson, picks 7 and 8? Total crap.  2016: Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn in the top 5. Marquese Chriss and Thon Maker in the top-10.   2017: Fultz was a bust at 1. Josh Jackson was a bust at 4. Guys 8-11 were all crap.   You give each draft a few years, and you see that there are really good players drafted in the 20s each year, and some crap picked in the top-10."
"Must be misremembering how 2014 went because I don’t recall Jabari Parker being talked about as positively as Cade Cunningham is. Also Luka and Ayton should be in the top 10 for sure, they were both considered transcendental prospects. Luka possibly in the top 5."
I would re do 5-9 to be:   .5. Wiggins  .6. Kyrie Irving  .7. Cade Cunningham  .8. Joel Embiid  .9. Jabari Parker  and then maybe raise Mobley a little but other than that I think your list is solid.
Jabari Parker  MKG  Derrick Williams  Evan Turner  Thabeet  Michael Beasley  The list goes on and on for bad 2nd picks.
"While it wasn't as big as Denver, we had our own Big Ball lineup that actually played the most minutes in 2016.  MCW - Khris Middleton - Jabari Parker - Giannis - Greg Monroe.  They logged **538** minutes together, the shortest player was MCW at 6'5"""
Parker and Maker looked like good picks for a while there. Jabari was showing a lot of talent and looked very similar to Melo. Recovered from his acl tear and then it tore again and killed every hope I had. They both had IQ issues though. They never seemed to know where to be on defense but you could blame that on Kidd.
"2009 - Brandon Jennings led a terrible roster to the 6th seed in his rookie year and nearly upset the Hawks (losing in 7). He then got hurt. Despite that he still lead them to the the playoffs 2 out of his 4 seasons and then got traded for Khris Middleton. At #10 this was a good pick.   2009 - Jodie Meeks. A ten year NBA career for a 41st pick is incredible. The average NBA career lasts 4.5 seasons. The average length for a 41st pick would be like 1 year. This was a great pick.   2010 - Larry Saunders at 15 in 2010 was another great pick. In 2012 he was a Gobert-esque rim protector, essentially a walking double double with 3 blocks per game.    2011- Jimmer Fredette. The Kings made this pick. The Bucks had no intention of keeping Jimmer and traded back for the 19th pick, which they used to take eventual borderline All Star Tobias Harris. An incredible pick.    2012 - John Henson at 14. Wasn't awful considering who was drafted after him. Pretty much everyone passed on Draymond who went 35.   2013 - Giannis. One of the best draft picks in NBA history.   2014 - Jabari Parker was considered a sure-fire star and was voted by his draft class as being the most likely to win ROY and to have the best career. Sports Illustrated had him on the cover calling him the ""best High School player since Lebron James'. No one was mad at this pick. He was averaging 20ppg in his 3rd season but had shocking luck with injuries.   2014 - Johnny O'Bryant. 5 years from a 36th pick isn't terrible.   2015 - Rashad Vaughn at 17 wasn't a disaster considering who was left on the board.   2016 - Thon Maker at 10. This is the first one I feel they properly messed up because Sabonis went 11. However they made up for it with their next pick.   2016 - Malcolm Brogdon at 36 is an incredible pick. Rookie of the year, 50-40-90 club, borderline All Star.    2018 - Donte DiVincenzo at 17 was a good pick. Find a new slant."
"I’m not totally sold on Rui.  He didn’t seem to improve much from year one to year two.  He reminds me a bit of Jabari Parker in some ways.  Good scorer, lots of midrange shots, but not the quality of scorer that should be a second option.    Some people think he has all-star talent.  Seems like a good kid.  Hope I’m wrong."
"Giannis, Malcolm Brogdon, Normal Powell...how exactly is this terrible drafting? Even Jabari Parker was looking like a solid pick until his injury"
"Dean demakis, infamous on draft Twitter, called the wiggins bust very very early. Jabari Parker too, he explained the issues in their games and why they’d fail before they were drafted.  Here’s one of his articles on wiggins, I can link more: https://deanondraft.com/2014/02/14/andrew-wiggins-an-ordinary-player-in-an-extraordinary-body/"
"I was thinking about this the entire finals.. Jabari Parker and DJ Wilson, letting Brogdon walk,   trading Tobias Harris before that.. STILL won a ring bc of one stellar draft pick."
"Every leak I read was that Embiid was the pick in Cleveland until he broke his foot and would miss a year. Gilbert wouldn't use the first overall pick on an injured player, and went for Wiggins.   What's more interesting is if Milwaukee took Embiid over Jabari Parker. Imagine how freaking dominant the Bucks would be with Embiid and Giannis. The East would be locked up for at least another 4-5 years. Stars would be migrating west for a chance at a title."
"So sad we got rid of him. Traded him for Otto Porter Jr., the most GarPax move of all time  And I mean don't get me wrong there was a chance that trade could've worked out well in our favor if Otto could stay healthy and also wasn't a huge fucking idiot. I was a fan of the move at the time, and it got Jabari Parker off our books, but still, I miss Bobby"
What religion is he practicing. I would understand if it jabari parker since he is a practicing mormon. But wiggins i never heard of his religious believes until he decided to try to take advantage of no shots.
Went and looked through a few 1 / 2 combos here’s some other options for worst ever:  Michael Olowokandi / Mike Bibby  Andrew Wiggins / Jabari Parker  Pervis Ellison / Danny Ferry
"I'm surprised he was still unsigned, seemed like a decent player last year in the little I saw him.  We have 14 guaranteed deals going into training camp. He'll most likely be competing with Jabari Parker for the final roster slot."
3+1 puts him in 2025 FA which is the new tv deal and he’ll have just turned 30.  The optics are tough for bulls  I also feel like everyone forgets Chicago let him test the market and sign for under market value with the kings (weak market with no cap) while the bulls used their cap space on Jabari Parker. He might be over it but Gordon Hayward stated this as a big reason he left Utah
But there's also a  universe where they get Jabari Parker/Okafor/Bender/Josh Jackson
"They let Jabari Parker where his number, I highly doubt they're retiring it."
"Bucks had Giannis with Jabari Parker, Mayo, and MCW? If only"
"There are NBA players who absolutely don't focus on defense as much as they do offense. As Jabari Parker said ""Look at everybody in the league. They don’t pay players to play defense."" Of course, the idea that that's not also the case in college is pure bullshit.  It's also worth noting that some players focusing on offense rather than defense actually maximizes their team's chance of winning, so that criticism is meaningless when directed at some stars."
"Boucher played a large portion of his minutes last season at center, and if he isn't starting then that's even worse. Achiuwa and Birch are nowhere near starting caliber players, I really don't even like them as bench players for a decent team.  OG is a great 3&amp;D player, he is just overrated by Raps fans as of recent. I'd place him in the lower end of the top guys of that mold: DeAndre Hunter, Mikal Bridges, Dillon Brooks, P.J. Tucker, Matisse Thybulle, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith. In no particular order.  From the summer league games I watched reminded me of Patrick Williams and an early Kawhi, and his draft comp was a combination of Kawhi and Jabari Parker so I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say they are completely different.  But I guess I'm a fool for not thinking Toronto is going to have no issue being in contention for the playoffs."
cam newton was an mvp &amp; he is the all-time leader in rushing td‘s for qb‘s - how is he comparable to jabari parker
"Jabari Parker.  He was avg 20 pts per game before he torn his ACL. He's also reluctant to work on D with all the ""You don't get paid for playing defense""  He's only 25 this year. On hindsight, it was probably  better for the Bucks Championship run."
"Sam Bradford and Jabari Parker  - Was highly regarded coming out of college  - was solid but not amazing when they first came in but suffered big injuries early on  - came back and was still unspectacular as a player and still was getting injured consistently   - original teams eventually gave up on them and they had solid runs with other teams, and started suffering less injuries but they were still just average players   - one poor season basically ended them for good"
Jabari Parker
"yep, currently the only numbers available for new players are: 4, 8, 9 (possibly retired soon for Rondo), 13, 27-30, 37-39, 43, 47+  The only ""normal"" numbers are 4, 8, 9, 13, 30 and 50. If Jabari Parker is released then #20 becomes available.   IMO Richardson will take #20, he wore it in high school. Khris Dunn probably takes 30 as he's been #32 most of his career. Enes Kanter has always worn 11 or 0 so it's a bit tricky but probably takes #13 or maybe 9?"
Jabari Parker in shambles
“They don’t pay players to pay defense” - Jabari Parker :’(
I can make this team out of Bucks front office decisions of the 2000’s  PG: Malcolm Brogdon  SG: John Salmons  SF: Jabari Parker  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Tim Thomas  8 seed potential for sure
Ja Jabari ‘i dont grt paid to play defense’ Parker might have had a few mentality problems.
"Jabari ""I don't get paid to play defense."" Parker."
Jabari Parker  True. Name any 2nd draft pick and likely at some point they didn’t have a good mindset  Stromile Swift  Milicic  Beasley  Thabeet  Derrick Williams  Ingram  Ball  Bagley  Parker  MKG
Jabari Parker
"I was high on DSJ and Markelle Fultz before..you know.   There was Jabari Parker who I predicted would be the next Carmelo Anthony. I also had Kidd Gilchrist, who I personally thought was gonna be a star.   Mario Hezonja is another...the hype was real back then."
"Jabari Parker.  I thought he was better than Giannis :/  When you begin learning the mental framework of these players, it’s completely understandable why they aren’t really successful at the professional level."
The Celtics let Mo Wagner and Jabari Parker wear Ray's number lol. KG isn't the only one holding a grudge
Jabari Parker thought he would be melo/pierce type of player just turned out to be injury prone player who said he doesn’t get paid to play defense
I was convinced Jabari Parker was going to be the best player in his draft.
"Boy I thought Jabari Parker was gonna be the next Melo. But more athletic he had bunnies, it sucks he had the 2 ACL tears… I also thought Thought Stanley Johnson was gonna be a defensive stopper that averaged 20ppg. He came out of college with an NBA Body dude was massive as a rookie"
"Yes what you are saying about me is correct.   You say subjective, I’m not equating the two scenarios but is it subjective to say “Jabari Parker is as good of a basketball player as Lebron”  I’m not trying to argue with you, I’m just saying you’re wrong. There’s a reason it’s widely accepted that KD is a better player at basketball than Dirk"
Jabari Parker
"He refuses to adjust  Jabari Parker on defense: ‘They don’t pay players to play defense’""  https://www.sbnation.com/2018/7/19/17588208/jabari-parker-defense-interview-bulls-bucks-nba-free-agency"
he's following the footstep of Jabari Parker
"Jabari Parker, Josh Jackson, to name a few"
"He’s the opposite of Jabari Parker. Zero offense but great defensive iq, scrappy and good at positioning. Worked a little bit at shooting open 3s.  We were forced to start him in the Nuggets playoff series two years ago and he was actually not a liability. Played well that series. Hasn’t gotten much playing time since. Hope he can stick somewhere in the league, preferably with your team as his “next chance”"
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
The Celtics are not signing Juwan Morgan or Jabari Parker for the same purpose that the Lakers signed Malik Monk.
I just spit out my tea..  This is why the Lakers are a superior franchise.   The Celtics sign players like this guy and jabari Parker while the Lakers get Malik Monk Ellington and Dwight Howard for the minimum
"Kemba Walker is in NY now. Imma be honest though, I only know Jabari Parker and Tacko Fall.  What I meant was that ever since you guys had that great season with Kyrie sidelined we were all expecting the young team to get even better and start contending for best in the East. Tatum and Brown have gotten better but the team got worse. Just can't figure out why that is"
"Bunch of rookies, sophomore and 3rd year player on our bench last season. Now we have a decent bench. Semi Ojeleye, Recovering Langford, Rookie Neismith, Sophomore Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters (both under 6 feet), Jabari Parker, Washed TT, White guy from the bulls and Tacko Fall. Oh I forgot Kemba in and out Walker. Did you even know those guys? Lmfaoo"
"I don't have anyone's back in this. I don't care what the Sixers, Doc Rivers or Ben Simmons decides to do. Its just ridiculous to think a coach should be reprimanded for not adequately dodging a loaded question simply because the player's ego can't handle it.   Plenty of coaches have had harsher public criticisms of their players and they never became larger issues because the players didn't complain about it.   When Jabari Parker was here, he didn't get big minutes because he sucks at defense. Everyone knew it, coaches said as much and if Jabari would've whined about it, the blame would've fallen on his shoulders even more. The same should happen with Ben Simmons."
"Smart - Richardson - Brown - Tatum - Horford  Bench is Schroder, Rob Williams, Pritchard, and then after that it’s really going to depend on matchups. Some nights it could be Nesmith and Hernangomez, other nights could be Kanter and Langford. I assume Grant Williams, Jabari Parker and Bruno Fernando will be getting minutes if we have injuries or need to rest guys during the season.  I only say Rob Williams off the bench because of injury concerns and I assume he will be starting by the playoffs or at least seeing a significant increase in minutes as the year goes on, similar to last year."
"Reddish’s peaks have been really promising, but his consistency is a real issue. I hope that ECF Reddish is the real guy, but I just haven’t seen enough of that sort of play from him. Sometimes he makes Kawhi reads, but more often than not, Cam reminds me of Jabari Parker. He plays downhill with one move and hands of stone."
"Opens up a roster spot for either Jabari Parker, a vet min guy or someone better using Fournier's TPE."
"its either him or grant williams/jabari ""somehow still in the league"" parker. not a lot of options"
and still made it to the finals.       Bucks did the same with Jabari Parker and DJ Wilson
"Sure, I think he's done phenomenally to overcome some pretty enormous holes that were in his game.      I didn't expect him to become one of the best off the dribble shooters in the league, which I think was a pretty fair assumption to make considering...well not many players make that kind of jump lol. Most players don't make the leap to suddenly being able to shoot 40% on 4 or so off the dribble threes a game. The leap in efficiency he made from last season to this season was outstanding considering the volume increase.   Was I wrong about Lavine? Yes, absolutely. Is anyone, ever, going to be 100% correct about every player valuation ever? Of course not. The reason for him surpassing what I thought he would become was, essentially, massive outlier improvement as an off the dribble scorer. Thats awesome for him, but I don't really think there was much evidence to suggest he would suddenly become one of the best scorers in the league. He made great strides in his game, and massive credit to him for doing so. Good on him, Im never upset about being wrong if it means there is another great offensive player to watch. Sometimes you love a player and he proves you right (Mitchell for me would be an example as a draft prospect I loved), sometimes you love what you see from a player and he proves you wrong (I really, really liked Jabari Parker), sometimes you think someone will be terrible and that happens (I was incredibly low on Bagley) and sometimes someone you didnt believe in puts it together (Lavine is one for me). You can't bat 100% on NBA prospects.     I think the biggest thing he still needs to work on is the passing, he still turns it over a ton, though I think with some extra guys around him like Vuc and Derozan he can be much more improved at that since he wont have to create for others so much. I think he has turned himself into a pretty lethal offensive player.   &amp;#x200B;  Defensively I stand by everything still, he is terrible."
"But this isn't great offense.   C: 2021 DeMarcus Cousins was statistically average offensively.   PF: 2021 Carmelo Anthony was a below average scorer and inefficient  SF: Jabari Parker in his prime was a solid 20 ppg guy, but not elite at any one thing  SG: Lou Williams in his prime was a great scorer, that was about it though, not a ton of facilitating. I think Simmons and Thybulle would be able to contain him in the halfcourt.   PG: 2020 Isaiah Thomas was garbage. He's averaged 11 ppg on 39% from the field over the last 3 seasons.   These are just offensive players that are atrocious on defense. Prime Lou and Jabari are really the only good offensive players here and neither were elite."
Best take:mario hezonja and noah vonleh being busts Worst take: jabari parker and josh jackson being stars
"Parker  Smush, Jabari, Anthony, Candace, Tony.  Don’t @ me."
"By the time Wiggans was drafted there were a lot of questions about his effort, and most said that if Embiid was healthy he would be the #1 prospect.    That draft was weird because it was a ton of hype for Jabari Parker and Wiggans and as their college season progressed their scouting reports got progressively worse."
"I only found out yesterday that Jabari Parker was like half Tongan. I think him, Steven Adams and James Johnson are the only polynesians in the nba (all mixed tho)"
Can’t believe I didn’t see this one after the recent success but Jabari Parker and Tony Finau are cousins.   Tony Finau is a pro golfer on the PGA tour.
"May have been true in 2019 when his squad consisted of Alex Len, Jabari Parker, and 2 rookies. He shot considerably less 3’s per game last season when he wasn’t Atlanta’s only offensive threat."
"Honestly - you saw him at the bottom 19/20 because that year he had Jabari Parker, Vince Carter and Alex Len behind him.  Now with Hunter, JC and Capela hes a lot closer to league average than most people think"
Definitely had higher hopes for Jabari Parker
I was thinking of the deal the Bulls (lol) gave to Jabari Parker a few years ago with a team option on the 2nd year
"I've always thought Cleveland intentionally didn't grab a MCW, Oladipo, Zeller (some of the other top guys from that class) becuse they wanted to rebuild for another year and get a top player from the next class.   Such as Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle, Aaron Gordon, Marcus Smart, Dante Exum etc.   I said it back then that the Cavs were trying to play a long game and have LeBron come back and try to coach up Kyrie and one of those guys since many of them are ""LeBron-Type"" players (Wing-fowards who can handle play post and guard multiple positions.)  They just so happened to get Bron back the next year and they drafted Andrew Wiggins, however they traded him away for Love almost immediately. But for a brief moment l felt like l was correct."
"Jabari Parker, Michael Beasley, Carmelo Anthony"
"I agree, but as a Bucks fan - Jabari Parker wasn't a bust, he had back to back ACL tears. I am still hoping at one point he can find the right situation and get back on track."
Jabari Parker and Tony Finau are cousins.
Carmelo Anthony   Rudy Gay  Jabari Parker
"Dion Waiters, Derrick Williams, Derrick Favors, Jabari Parker,"
not the whole team. just roco and nurk. we take the Jabari Parker view on defense
"Of the draft lottery picks only 3 have become All-Stars - 2 for the first time last season.  1. Andrew Wiggins   2. Jabari Parker   3. Joel Embiid   4. Aaron Gordon   5. Dante Exum   6. Marcus Smart   7. Julius Randle   8. Nik Stauskas   9. Noah Vonleh   10. Elfrid Payton   11. Doug McDermott   12. Dario Šarić   13. Zach LaVine   14. T. J. Warren  Of that lottery draft class who do you put above him? Obviously Embiid, LaVine, and Randle but thats pretty much it. Maybe a case could be made for Marcus Smart ... realistically I can't be consider him a bust if he is the 4th most successful player in the lottery."
 My birthday is  on March 15 and the best player born on March 15 is bulls  legend Jabari Parker with Lakers legend Xavier Henry behind him and like 5 other unknown role players end of the bench guys possibly from around the 90s or 80s
Stop it right now. Jabari Parker only got to play 13 games this year because he’s that bad Damian Jones played for three teams this year because he’s that bad and Deandre Bembrey is a worse three point shooter than Russ at 23.1%. I don’t see why you are fighting this so hard it’s ok for Trae to be better than Luka in something stop being so soft lol. Not to mention the two dudes you mentioned played less games then Deandre bembry did and the season was longer.
Barely. Also his starters. That stretch was Jabari Parker and Damian Jones and Deandre Bembry who are all significantly worse then who Luka is currently playing with.
It's the latter. He was extremely convinced guys like Jabari Parker and Malcolm Brogdon would never leave the team. He couldn't fathom it when they wanted out.
"Atlanta is a poor example here. Capela did elevate us from last year and the year before when we had the likes of jabari Parker and Alex Len playing in the middle, but to say that our wing defense was soft is not that accurate. Deandre Hunter, until he got hurt against Philly, was shaping up to be one of the premier wing defenders in the league. He’s a guy you can put on the other team’s best player and forget about it. Same with cam reddish, except he was out the second half of the year and only played ECF last few games. Bogi and K’von both solid team wing defenders. The biggest weak spots on the hawks D are Trae Young against the opposing ball handler, and John Collins against bigger PF and Cs."
"It's best to consider the opinions of Greg Foster and Jason Kidd whom coached both of them at the same time.  Beasley had the best full court sprint times in camp and regarding offensive acumen and talent, the coaching staff by and large saw Parker, Giannis and Beasley as mostly equal (As Jason Kidd put it in an interview anyway).  They just all happened to play essentially the same position then.    It's interesting that Beasley actually had his best offensive efficiency that year in his three year spell after his second spell in China.  That was when the likes of Craig Robinson, Jason Terry and Jabari Parker made great effort to let the world know that Beasley had changed and he was a great team mate and a better player for it.    Beasley's best season as far as his personal growth in basketball acumen comes when he played for the Knicks."
"Ya. Crazy Trae didn’t carry a team of jabari Parker, Alex Len, and 2 rookies to the playoffs. lol what a take.  To be fair, Tatum had brown and Kemba and he carried the Celtics to the bubble lulz"
Had Jabari Parker already been written off by 2015? Him and Wiggins were hyped up to be the future of the league when they were coming out of high school lol
"Yeah I was gonna say that, it's an incredible argument to treat Bucks' successes as somehow related to Jabari Parker when they were just better without him. He literally didn't play at all in the span of the season that made them a playoff team at all, really such a strong proof of his genius play that Buck were a playoff team.  He was a decent player that year, though, offensively. It's just a rather bizarre angle to describe him in terms of ""playing better within the system"", ""contributing to wins"", ""better passer"" etc."
"Except Jabari was doing it for a 42 win playoff team on 53% eFG%, Beasley was doing it for a 17 win team on 46% eFG%.   Parker was way more efficient, a better passer (nearly 3 APG, and in less MPG), and contributed more to winning. He was also turning the ball over less and played better within the Bucks system. Beasley was a chucker and played lazily."
"Aaron Holiday looked solid. I had forgotten that the Wizards ended up with him. Harrell and Dinwiddie were great as well.  Schroeder looked good despite being abused in the paint by Dinwiddie a few times and seemed to be the only Celtic with consistent effort tonight.  Tatum got to the hoop and made it look easy at times. I feel like he should've done that more, especially in the first half.  JB did not look good at all in the first half and started like 1-8. He started hitting a few shots in the second half. Maybe the shoe change at halftime helped a bit lol.  There were some questionable calls on that hurt the Celtics near the end of the game, but those would be non-factors if they they didn't start off so slow and let Harrell feast in the paint.  Would've liked to see Pritchard play or maybe even more Jabari Parker over Richardson."
"This season Marcus Smart is averaging 7 3PA a game and is making them at....(wait for it..) 23.5%  Why in gods name is Smart taking so many threes. Also if Tatum is awful the Celtics suck.   This game was a difference in depth. Tatum and Beal were both trash but the Wiz have too much depth. JB was also really bad this game.   The Celtics last guy on the rotation is a washed Jabari Parker, Grant Williams, Josh Richardson compared to the Wiz who are running the rookie Corey Kispert who actually looks really solid so far on both ends of the court, Deni Avdija who also plays solid D and can ball handle, Aaron Holiday who is looking like a steal of a pick-up for PG depth and Bertans who is still capable of being a good NBA player even though he's been pretty bad at doing what he's paid to do which is shoot the ball. Juancho needs to work his way into the rotation for Boston, he's a solid player."
"Jabari Parker, DeMar DeRozan, Melo, Felicio when he was in the league, Drummond,"
"Bucks could have had Embiid and Giannis. At the time, we needed a center too. Picked Jabari Parker instead.  It all worked out in the end though. No complaints here."
I read it as Jabari Parker and I only realized it wasn’t him after the stat line
"I was all in on Jabari Parker. To be fair, it was injuries more than anything else that derailed him."
"Mike Budenholzer is the epitome of failing upward. Yes the Bucks won, but look at how many fuckups happened on the way there under his watch. Bringing in Eric Bledsoe? Wasting money on a mid Jabari Parker? Anyone remember Malcolm Brogdon? His obsession with bargain players that were once great? This guy either the world’s smartest idiot or dumbest genius."
Jabari Parker could have been one of the best without injuries
Wasn't this fresh off the season where Trae dropped 30 and 10 assists passing to Vince Carter and Jabari Parker 😭
Wiggins had a weak draft class some obvious highs but a lot of lows. In fact a lot of his draft class are barely in the league anymore. Embiid was injured and Wiggins was the clear cut favorite since he was in High School. Obviously he was the wrong choice but it was either him or Jabari Parker and you know how that’s going....
Just wanna say shoutout Jabari Parker. Helped us keep up in the beginning.
"Jabari Parker, at this stage of his career, is easily one of the worst players in the league"
I'm really happy for Jabari Parker having such a good first half. Hopefully he can keep up that sort of production throughout this season!
JABARI PARKER
I don't think it's hyperbole to suggest that Jabari Parker is Karl Malone 2.0.
"Somehow, Jabari Parker is leading all scorers after the first quarter."
Jabari Parker&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Zion Williamson
THIS IS THE BEST JABARI PARKER HAS LOOKED SINCE DUKE
I thought jabari parker got waived huh
ESPN Gamecast said we subbed in Jabari Parker.  Didn't we waive him?
As a bucks fan your saying pick 15 giannas that avg less than 8 points per game his rookie year had more upside than Jabari Parker pick 2 the next year. When he and Wiggins were the most talked about prospects.   If it wasn't for Jabari getting hurt 25 games into his rookie year. You think giannas would of still been the bucks main focus after dropping 8pts per game...  That's kind of cap because nobody saw giannas becoming giannas. He was two inches shorter. Smaller frame and had kd like promises hence why kd is his favorite player.
"The key word is the bucks.   They don't end up with alot of players coming in willing, so they develop what they can. Jason kidd saw giannas and basically told him what his strengths were and the rest is history.   Best of luck moving forward. If it wasn't for Jabari Parker two acl tears. Giannas would of never got the chance to step onto a bigger role. He also grew to add to his frame made him the Greek freak.   If this was the lakers, knicks, pelicans, t wolves  Magic . Guaranteed would of fucked up giannas."
"That was 14 years ago.. after him, the second overall picks were Beasley, Thabeet, Evan Turner, Derrick Williams, MKG, Oladipo and Jabari Parker.  Not inspiring, I know."
"I believe Trae and the hawks also beat the #1 seed sixers, right? The sixers had 3 all nba defensive selections compared to the Clippers 1. Luka stans said roster talent didn’t matter when Trae’s squad was Alex Len, Jabari Parker, and 2 rookies. Weird how it’s the only thing that matters once Trae gets a comparable roster."
He is long and athletic and has the full potential but he’s also disinterested in it and it shows. It’s not jabari Parker level and he can get away with it more now that they have Aaron Gordon but c’mon are you gonna sit there and pretend he isn’t hunted on defense in close games?
Yeah! How is Jabari Parker not in the top 75?
"+- is shorthand for plus minus. it is a stat that is used to measure the point differential when they are on the court. so while Westbrook was on the court the lakers scored 25 less points than the Warriors.  this is generally regarded as a bad stat for measuring individual value except for in very large sample sizes (1+ year) because it can be influenced so much by other players on the court, I.e if the 76ers lose to the Celtics  by 30 and Joel Embiid plays every minute and plays at his usual MVP level he would have a +- of -30. If Jabari Parker also plays all 48 minutes he would have a +- of 30, despite being a much worse player, his +- would be misleadingly inflated by his team playing well. it is useful in large sample sizes as a rough indicator of him much value a player provides to his team, such as Tim duncan having one of the highest career +- ratings ever, because he consistently helped his team be better than the other team."
He will be out of the league in a few years. He’s following the same arc as Jabari Parker. He will sign a few one year deals and teams will realize he isn’t worth it.
Jabari Parker signed with the Celtics again after being released. He cleared waivers before signing of course.
"Jabari Parker: ""SIKE"""
"He was drafted #3, mainly due to injury history. If he didn’t have the injury history and people thinking he might be Greg Oden 2.0, the 76ers would probably have ended up with Wiggins or Jabari Parker. They kind of lucked into Embiid in that sense. While Embiid has battled injuries, it hasn’t been as bad as people thought."
Jabari Parker 2.0
Jabari Parker
"As mentioned in the thread about Boston waiving Jabari Parker, the ""I don't get paid to play defence"" press conference. In retrospect, probably one of the stupidest NBA quotes of all time"
What about the thread questioning if Jabari Parker had any friends?
"Damn I remember seeing Jabari Parker clips on “Ball Is Life” YouTube channel when he was in HS, and everyone was so high on his athleticism."
"Random stat:  Jabari Parker (2.5) has a higher VORP than Wiggins (1.0), despite Wiggins playing over 225 more career games."
"Lavine was a tiny fraction of what he is now in Minnesota. You’re purely speculating that his time there played any role in what he became.  I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt regarding Lavines playmaking but that’s probably the worst aspect of his game outside of his defence so it doesn’t influence how good he is for the most part. His playmaking is also largely just passing out of doubles.  The issue is basically every athletic fringe rotational player is a good defender. Defence is largely based on effort and players who are fighting for minutes will often provide the most effort. What makes defenders stand out is impact and okogie is not an impactful defender. Wings and guards are less impactful as is, so you generally have to be like an all defence guy, or have some offence too.  Fair point with wiggins, I thought I saw him in your list of names.  Your last point however is complete nonsense. For starters i wouldn’t consider him a quality player. I’d consider him a 9th man on most teams. I’d just consider him better than Jabari Parker. Denver traded him along with Malik Beasley, by your logic Malik was nothing resembling a quality player. Minnesota didn’t keep him cause they got Patrick Beverley who is much better and a perfect fit for the team in every way. Memphis traded him cause they have a log jam at his position and got a second or 2 for him. And I have nothing against the Wolves. In fact this year I’m one of the highest on them, and think they have a legit shot at a lower playoff seed. I’ve also been an avid defender of them when people talk about how they should be relocated, or how KAT should demand a trade. It’s just a fact that more often than not their player development is very lacklustre and that a player shouldn’t be completely written off based on how they played in those conditions"
Sure. The chance of getting the good version is more valuable than a player like Jabari Parker
"""Balling like Jabari Parker"" -Childish Gambino"
somehow Juancho Hernangomez of all people managed to survive the last few days of training camp/preseason purge over Jabari Parker X_X
[The legacy of Jabari Parker will be this legendary thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ulxb4/mormon_faith_more_important_to_jabari_parker_than/cejpqf8/?context=4)
Zion Williamson will be a starter throughout his career since his playstyle is very injury-prone and he will suffer the same career as Jabari Parker.
Lol ok If you think smart and AL make no difference. Also Robert Williams who is a massive difference. Plus PP who’s a decent piece.   I’m just sayin lol it was grant Williams and jabari Parker out there lol
Jabari Parker is still on the Celtics wow
"Jabari ""they don't pay players to play defense"" Parker"
Jabari Parker sounds like a forgotten 70s/80s goat
"That draft had the coolest names in the lottery. Dante Exum, Marcus Smart, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Julius Randle, etc etc. Any one of those names could have been a superstar's name. The next LeBron James or Kevin Durant. Hardest draft to pick in imo. Just high potential names all around."
Ayton needs to ask Jabari Parker for his advice on how to get paid
"Pretty much. The can’t miss guys are usually the exception but for the rest of the guys its pretty much true. Andrew Wiggins or Jabari Parker are pretty decent examples of this. It takes a lot of luck, skill and insane work ethic to become a good NBA player."
"In no particular order based on draft class and whatever comes to mind that I remember having a strong opinion on -   High - Zion Williamson, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, Ja Morant, Lonzo Ball, De’Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, TJ Warren, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins  High but missed the mark - Wendell Carter Jr, Ben McLemore, Kevin Knox, Lauri Markkanen, Dennis Smith Jr, Malik Monk, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Anthony Bennet, Dion Waiters, Evan Turner"
OP how tf were you high on Giannis? Nobody knew who he was and he had no film lol.  I was very right about Jamal Murray and Booker. I was very wrong about Ben McLemore and Jabari Parker (partly due to injury).
I was finally right about Randle.  Wrong about Exum and Jabari Parker.
"Cade:  * Ceiling: Luka * Floor: Kyle Anderson  Green:  * Ceiling: Kobe * Floor: Jamal Crawford  Mobley:   * Ceiling: KG / Giannis with a jump shot * Floor: Larry Sanders with better offense  Barnes:  * Ceiling: Ben Simmons / Andre Iguodala / more athletic Draymond * Floor: Having some trouble with this one... He's going to be a solid defender no matter what, and he's got point forward skills. Jabari Parker who I saw mentioned in another comment isn't a terrible comparison.  Suggs:  * Ceiling: Deron Williams / not fat Baron Davis * Floor: Rodney Stuckey"
"Jabari Parker with D is an all star, its not floor lol"
Jabari Parker for Barnes??? How’d u come to that conclusion
Unbiased but  Cade: Luka  Green: MJ without the defense  Mobley: AD  Barnes: Draymond Green with a jumper/handle  Suggs: Jrue Holiday   Floor  Cade: Kyle Anderson  Green: Malik Monk  Mobley: Jabari Parker with D  Barnes:   Suggs: Cory Joseph
"The bucks kinda tanked and got a high pick for Jabari Parker, but they were just bad bad those years. Once they realized what they had in Giannis, they started trying to build competitive teams. This op is a clown tho."
Jabari Parker :/
"in the end we could not withstand the onslaught of *checks notes* Jabari Parker  Great game, though it felt like two separate games: a real NBA game lasting until halfway through the third quarter, and a G-league game with extra hype in the last few minutes."
holy shit is that jabari parker playing garbage time in preseason?? damn
His point is right though… that tank got you guys Jabari Parker so it really didn’t add anything to the eventual title squad.
"Just because some teams hit the powerball later in the draft doesn’t mean they didn’t tank at some point. Tanking Assets: this century       Utah - Deron Williams 3rd, Kanter 3rd, Hayward 9th,  Exum 5th       Denver - Tskitishvili  5th, Carmelo 3rd, Mudiay 7th,  Murray 7th        Bucks - TJ Ford - 8th, Bogut - 1st, Yi - 6th, Joe Alexander - 8th , Brandon Jennings - 10th,  Jabari Parker - 2nd,  Thon Maker - 10th.        Heat - Caron Butler 10th, Dwayne Wade - 5th (Responsible for all their championships) , Michael Beasley - 2nd , Winslow - 10th       Indiana hasn’t had a pick in the single digits since ‘89, (Picked Paul George was picked 10th). Indiana is the only team that I can think of that legitimately “never tanks”."
"You don't have to climb to the top, Bucks drafted Jabari Parker with the #2 pick and got lucky with Giannis. The more picks the better, improves your odds of landing a star. How does it not realistically improve their chances?"
"I’m only using the same metric Luka stans used the year prior. When Trae was surrounded by 2 rookies, Alex Len, and Jabari Parker winning basketball was the only thing that mattered and they propped up Luka’s playoff appearance. Trae then gets a comparable supporting cast and goes to the ECF and now all of a sudden it’s all about team talent."
"It’s hilarious how much Luka stans have flip flopped. Weird how team talent meant nothing when Trae had Alex Len, 2 rookies, and Jabari Parker to meaning everything as soon as trae took a comparable squad to the conference finals."
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"besides from Jabari ""not paid to play defense"" Parker"
"Enes Kanter says hello. He'd just be a sixth man if he's a good scorer and a terrible defender. It's enough to make a career but perhaps not the one everyone expects right now. We're talking about a Jabari Parker with the ability to pass. Or Michael Beasley. Not terrible, not great."
"Nah not the pacers man, he’s going to Boston, BREAKING: Simmons to Boston in exchange for Peyton Pritchard, Jabari Parker, Al Horford’s bath water, and a bowl of spoiled clam chowder"
I see your point but plenty of players get injured and are still considered busts. Jabari Parker is a good example of that. Generally people use the term bust just to refer to a draft pick that doesn’t pan out/
"Here’s a brief rundown of some of the current defending champions’ moves since they drafted their franchise player -   - Traded JJ Redick for two seconds because he was going to leave.   - Traded Ish Smith for Caron Butler. Ish has been a capable backup PG ever since, Butler played half a season off the bench and dipped.   - Drafted Jabari Parker over Embiid.   - Brought in Jason Kidd as coach. Even traded two 2nds for the privilege (fun fact: one of those 2nds later became Pat Connaughton).   - Traded for Caron Butler *again*, this time giving up capable backup Ersan Ilyasova. Immediately waived him.   - Drafted Rashad Vaughn in the first round.   - Same draft, traded a just-drafted Norman Powell and a future first that became OG Anunoby for Greivis Vasquez.   - Paid Greg Monroe $34m to be mediocre for two years.   - Shipped his ass to the Suns with a first rounder attached for HOF choke artist Eric Bledsoe.   - Drafted Thon Maker in the first round.   - Handed out terrible contracts to Delly, Tony Snell, John Henson *and* Miles Plumlee all in the space of two years.   - Got out of jail by managing to shift the Plumlee contract for scraps and sending Delly back to Cleveland along with Henson as salary filler but did have to give up a first to move Snell’s deal. That first became Kevin Porter Jr.   - Drafted DJ Wilson in the first round.   - Let Christian Wood leave for nothing.   - Traded four second rounders and Thon Maker for Nikola Mirotic, who proceeded to make playoff Bledsoe look like prime LeBron then dipped to Spain.   - Traded Malcolm Brogdon for a first and second because they didn’t want to pay him $80m.   - Traded every first round pick they could to the Pelicans to get a playable guard because the one they’d just given $50m to was awful and they traded the other one away.    You’d be surprised how much you can fuck things up and still contend. We only sucked for one year through all of that and we sure as hell weren’t gaining assets for it."
Chris Boucher is 2 years older than Jabari Parker.
"I think that's s disingenuous way of ranking them. First of all, if you are going to shit on teams for bad drafting, Cleveland had the #1 pick 2 years in a row and took Wiggins and Anthony Bennet. THAT is putrid drafting.   I agree that Boston and the Lakers did well in the draft, I think they are probably the two most talented front offices in the league.  So really you are bring rough on the 76ers for drafting Okafor and Fultz when they turned out to be busts. But there are a lot of other busts in the draft as well. Not every pick can be a winner. I think a 50% hit rate is acceptable and as others have said, Hinkie also picked up a lot of other players with lower draft picks who are now recognised as being the sorts of key role players on championship teams that you want to have. Robert Covington etc etc.  &gt; And they have the two worst busts up there.  Anthony Bennet as a #1 pick is criminal. Minnesota took Derrick Williams 2nd in '11. The Bucks took Jabari Parker 2nd in '14."
Jrue Holiday. Giannis is Ari and Jabari Parker is Sang Woo
Jabari Parker
Jabari Parker
"Sounds like we played in the same era lol.  Jabari and cliff we just so much bigger/athletic than everybody. It was crazy.   Now when I played in a tournament against Caleb Swanigan, that dude was skilled and big. Haha.   A couple of guys I played with ended up playing overseas and one of em actually transferred to Simeon and played with Parker. He had a crazy run in March madness too."
From Chicago   Played Vs Max Strus and Jalen Brunson   Saw Jabari Parker/Jahlil Okafor sectional games @ my school every year   Almost Played Cliff Alexander in Playoffs but his team was using Ineligible Players lol  And my brother got Dunked on By Iman Shumpert
"Christian Wood  Jabari Parker, as a 6th Man, but, he's got to keep working on his outside shot"
"Giannis has still proved himself with lacklustre shooting around him. He played like an all nba player with like Jabari Parker and John Henson in the same lineup as him. He played like an mvp with Eric Bledsoe there. Ben has 4 shooters around him, including the most dominant post player since Shaq who’s altered his game for bens benefit to take like 8 jumpers per game"
Dude you’re so right. Jabari Parker could probably do the exact same shit in the Nuggets system. /s
"Milwaukee basically had a one year rebuild after we dealt Monta Ellis and Brandon Jennings. We picked Jabari Parker the next year, who was supposed to be the franchise saviour, but instead we just hit 2 home runs by getting Giannis at 14 and getting Middleton as a throw in asset in the Jennings trade"
"There's a world where Jabari Parker has 5 MVPs and 6 rings, what's your point"
"Brandon Knight, Jabari Parker, Kawhi Leonard (I got one right), Trey Burke, Patrick Young (played college ball in Florida), Thomas Robinson... The list could go on."
"Jabari Parker, McLemore, Okafor"
Jabari Parker and tbf I think he would still be averaging 20+ if he didn't get caught in that injury loop
"And Giannis does both? I think KD's better but it's a 2 way game and by your logic, all the players would have a Jabari Parker mindset when training."
"Jabari Parker, Milwaukee view Giannis &amp; him as the corner stones to win championships until Jabari’s knees went away. Teams talked about those two like if it was gonna be like if Bron &amp; Melo played together."
&gt;Going through the rising stars games…   &gt;Tyreke Evans   &gt;Brandon Jennings   &gt;Bregman Roe     &gt;Andre Drummond   &gt;Andrew Wiggins   &gt;Jabari Parker  I mean it tough to say Drummond and not think of Greg Monroe too. Pistons thought they had some twin towers for a stretch.  Edit: just now realizing Bregman Roe is Greg Monroe.. did you use text-to-speech? Lol
Going through the rising stars games…   Tyreke Evans   Brandon Jennings   Bregman Roe     Andre Drummond   Andrew Wiggins   Jabari Parker
Jabari Parker
"People already went by that logic when Trae was playing with guys like Alex Len, Damian Jones, Kent Bazemore, Jabari Parker etc.   I think Luka will be fine though."
"A good defense is possible with Jabari Parker as your starter too. It's still unlikely they'll be above average overall and when these two play the most minutes on the Blazers, chances are their D will just suck."
"Not to be a downer but Jabari Parker ""sprained"" his knee twice when he was on the Bucks."
I call MPJ turbo Jabari Parker
Jabari Parker 2.0. Duke has a time making these players look good to just suck in nba.
"Their name brand gets players drafted high, but most of the time they don't translate well and are way more bust than boom. For every 1x Tatum there are 5x Jalil Okafor, Jabari Parker, Marvin bagley, Gerald Henderson types. Zion can't stay on the court so he's in danger of busting too."
Wiggins  Randle  Aaron Gordon  Jabari Parker   One of these is not like the other
"Aaron Gordon, Jabari Parker, man that 2013 HS class, and only one that can compete with them is probably that 2016 hs class"
"I'm sure the kings had a random dude at the end of their bench that they could have sent along, or cut that person.  edit: someone like jabari parker."
Khris Middleton is closer to Jabari Parker than Paul Pierce is to Middleton
My man Jabari Parker😪 Use To Go to his games I. High School he was like a grown man hoopin out there. Nd he was the Bucks best player till he got hurt.
Jabari Parker
Supprised no one said Jabari Parker yet. Man had so much hype.
"&gt; Jabari Parker could be real contributors.  What kind of fool would think he would be a real contributor /s  At least you dont have to think about how you could have had Embiid instead, hell a tuna melt has better D"
"We always find something to be positive about. Young players, the draft, that one player who shot well despite the loss.   The rosters that we got ourselves excited about makes me sad in hindsight.   Lauri is Dirk. Kris Dunn vs. Zach Lavine was a real discussion. I thought Wayne Selden Jr. and Jabari Parker could be real contributors.   We're a hopeful bunch."
"Yeah that whole draft was insanely hyped with Wiggins on top. Jabari Parker was supposed to be the next Carmelo, Wiggins the next Kobe. LOL. Most hyped player since Lebron with Zion a close 2nd"
"As opposed to now, where a team could have had a top 5 pick five years straight and ended up with Markelle Fultz, Dragan Bender, Jahlil Okafor, Jabari Parker and Anthony Bennett.  Also assuming of course that in your world absolutely no good prospects ever go to college and national rankings are gospel with no chance of things like workouts and interviews impacting draft order at all.  We already did this for years. There weren’t any more busts 20 years ago than there are now."
"No. I don't think they do cause DPOY Draymond singlehandedly won't carry that terrible Jazz defense to a further extent than Gobert. Defense requires a team to be effective. It isn't like offense where a singular player can carry an entire offense, such as Trae Young with the Hawks in 2019-20. You thinking that simply swapping Gobert for Draymond would solve the issues with the Jazz defense when the issue is not Gobert but his teammates is showing you have no clue what you're talking about.  Also, answer my question. Would you argue that 2017-18 Giannis was not a versatile defender because his team was shit on defense, not because Giannis was bad on D but because his teammates were and the coaching staff employed a scheme that was ineffective and relied on him too heavily? Or do you think that them improving to #1 in DRTG the next season when they got Brook Lopez to man the middle, Coach Bud to do Coach Bud defense things and drop players like Jabari Parker was solely because Giannis went from mortal man to god on defense in a singular off-season."
"&gt; Compare that to a guy like Ben Wallace - when he joined the Bulls, they were among the worst defence in the league. With only his addition they became the #1 defence, and Ben led them to the conference finals with the only good defender next to him being 21 year old Deng (not better than Royce O neal).  You are straight-up **lying** my guy. The Bulls in 2005-06 (the season before they got Ben Wallace) were 7th in DRTG. That is literally an elite defense. They were a trash offensive team (23rd in ORTG) but were an elite defensive team. Getting Big Ben took them from 7th in DRTG (103.4) to 1st in DRTG (99.6). They also only improved 8 wins, going from 41-41 to 49-33. And they didn't make the conference finals, they lost 2-4 to the Pistons in the second round. The season before, they lost 2-4 to the Heat in the first round.  &gt; Shit place any DPOY in the past 7 years - Draymond, Giannis, Kawhi - and they wouldn’t be fazed by shitty teammates. Gobert’s just not a versatile defender and not a great example.  2017-18, the Bucks were 19th in DRTG. Not because Giannis wasn't doing Giannis things on defense. But because he had Jason Kidd as the head coach and a team that didn't have as strong a defensive roster as in 2018-19 where they got Coach Bud as well as acquire Brook Lopez to be the starting centre instead of John Henson. Hmmm, it's almost like even with a DPOY caliber defender on the team, the Bucks were still shit on defense because the coaching staff had a bad system that overly relied on said DPOY caliber defender being a DPOY caliber defender and a roster that played defensive ""anchors"" (as in they sunk your defence) such as Henson (starting centre) and Jabari Parker. Would you argue that in 2017-18 that Giannis was not a versatile defender and not a great example because the team sucked on defense in spite of him being so great on that end?"
"Hey man fancy seeing you here! Hahaha. ACL injury that always makes me sad is Jabari Parker. Guy tore his acl in his rookie season then when he returned looked like he was on track to be a legit scorer, if a shitty defender. Put up 20 ppg on like 50% and 36% from deep. Then he tore it again (or maybe his other leg?) and all that potential was fully lost"
Bro we need jabari parker to save this for us again
"His sister is the crazy one, she blew her knees like 4x or something. She went full Jabari Parker and then some"
"Not trying to sound snarky but Udoka's response in the thread here is exactly why: ""We're switching a lot and doing some things that probably are not as natural for him and that's limited his time to some extent""  I forget where I heard it but I think the Celtics are switching *by far* more than any team in the league. The only bigs we are playing at this point are Robert Williams, Al Horford, Grant Williams. They might not be able to defend quicker guards, but all three of them can at least hang with wings. The *second* we put Kanter (or Jabari Parker) on the court, the entire defensive scheme has to change."
"His fundamentals are very good. Clearly was well coached from a young age to not just rely on his size and athleticism. His brother in college also has very good technique, moves and plays a bit like Jabari Parker, but not as tall, long or athletic as Evan."
Jabari Parker lost this fucking game jfc
Those Jabari Parker minutes were rough
Jabari Parker -17 in 14 minutes =/
eject jabari parker into the sun
Fatigue + Jabari Parker basically having a stroke on the court for 5 minutes creating a 14-0 run
Tatum had to sit for a few minutes and his backup Jabari Parker is -17 in 14 minutes lol
Jabari Parker couldn't make an intramural squad at the Y at this point jfc this dude sucks
Jabari Parker shoots the ball like he touched it and realized there's something slimy on it
jabari parker plays in the funniest way
"Yeppp. Mark Jackson too. Rookies aren't impressive cause they're usually barely 21. Even the year Wiggins won, Jabari Parker had a good case for it. His rookie year did not predict the rest of his career"
Everything after the top is pretty random though. You can’t tell me Wiggins was a huge bust when other top 5 draft picks are Dante Exum and Jabari Parker
"Nah, you got an MVP Jokic out of a draft. To go with another MVP candidate Embiid. Along with All Star Lavine, Randle… it’s not terrible.  It’s just the expectations for the Wiggins and Jabari Parker never came true  There are draft class with zero MVP and even less All Star"
whatever happened to jabari parker
this triggers Jabari Parker
We missed out on that :(  *Cries in drafting Jabari Parker*
I heard this about Malcolm Brogdon and Jabari Parker for years lol
"As a knick fan, I always felt brown was the more exciting prospect because he was advertised as athletic wing defender with mystery offensive upside that could be limitless, Tatum was advertised as Carmelo Anthony but actually this time and not jabari parker 2.0.  So far I feel like that’s held true, but brown is also hella streaky sometimes so I’m not sure which one I’d rather have.  Both obviously need to figure some things out this season"
Oladipo Randle and Giannis  Also Jabari Parker and Jordan Bell would’ve made me go broke
"Wow, TIL,  Jabari Parker’s dad is former Warrior Sonny Parker."
"Team all length : thon maker,jabari Parker,Greg Monroe, giannis,Henson.the PG is 6 11, The shortest player is 6 9 with 6 11 wingspan , and everyone else is 6 11 or above with a 7ft 2 wingspan or more."
"Not really. Other than Ja, and that one great year from Dipo, the last 10 years of second picks have been about 50% bust and 50% good but not great.   2020 James Wiseman  2019 Ja Morant  2018 Marvin Bagley  2017 Lonzo Ball  2016 Brandon Ingram  2015 D’Angelo Russell  2014 Jabari Parker  2013 Victor Oladipo  2012 Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  2011 Derrick Williams  2010 Evan Turner"
Still surprised to find Jabari Parker is still in the league! Wow.
"He was never a defensive specialist, but after 2 ACL tears made him a role player that's just not the type of comment he had any leeway to make. It'd be like if DSJ said now that he's done playing defense. True as that may be it doesn't do a lot for your value _____ I dont think the comments ruined him but they damn sure hurt. If 20 ppg, young, healthy Jabari Parker said fuck defense it would be bad but he'd still have a spot in this league, but injured and decrepit Jabari Parker just needed to say whatever in hopes of sticking around and he didn't"
"No Horford cannot. Jabari parker could, but that's a deal with the devil"
"His draft class kinda sucked. Imagine looking at a top 5 draft that included Dante Exum, Aaron Gordon, and Jabari Parker…  Wiggins was hyped up because he was sooo much better than those dudes (excluding Joel)."
Remember when Jabari Parker was supposed to be LeBron James?
"Yeah we have two all stars, but literally no supporting cast. It’s actually terrible. Jabari Parker is one of our key bench guys. Grant Williams and Romeo Langford are borderline starters. Marcus Smart is our 3rd best player, and we’re starting two big men who can’t shoot, one of whom is 36. You can say covid decimated us, but we also don’t have 3 of our 6 best players from last season, so it doesn’t necessarily translate to a better record. Throw on all that replacing a top 5-10 coach with a rookie, I don’t see how we should expect more than a couple wins better than last season."
Question.. is jabari Parker Celtics best post player?
if this is how they're calling the league then jabari parker might not be done.
Had high hopes for Jabari Parker and exum coming out of college :(
Lmao if that had been a player with worse legs like Kawhi or Jabari Parker it’s a half-season leg injury. Tripping people on hardwood is fucking dangerous whether you want to acknowledge it or not
"Jabari Parker has entered the chat, but he was always terrible on defence and got a 2 yr $40 mill rfa offer (2nd year team option) anyways."
"He's a superstar in the making but that doesn't say much lol, he's competing with  Beasley, thabeet, Evan turner, Derrick Williams, MKG, Oladipo, Jabari Parker, DLO, Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Bagley, Wiseman, Jalen Green  On a serious note, 5 of those players are out of the league which is pretty absurd"
Jabari Parker looks like a better basketball player than Kemba Walker
is Jabari Parker an NBA player again? good for him.
I love Jabari Parker. I hope this man straight up becomes an all star and gets back to his best.
The Jabari Parker semi-redemption game has been pretty interesting. Dude has been punishing mismatches
Imagine being Danny Ainge and having to watch Jabari Parker play meaningful minutes in a playoff game for you.
I wonder how it feels like to be Jabari Parker? Imagine being targeted possession after possession by a steady stream of Harden/KD/Kyrie.
"&gt; Is that the playoff jitters again?  They have moved away from what they were doing the entire year with him. Lots of PnR, lots of off-ball action where Harden can drive and kick.  Now, they are targeting mismatches.  Tatum is on Harden?  KD gets the ball to deal with Jabari Parker.   I personally don't like it and think they are better when Harden is orchestrating offense with the role players, but he's 16/7/7 on 11 shots.  He's doing more than fine.  KD is playing a lot worse than Harden is."
when was the last time Jabari Parker dunked?  During his year at Duke?
Jabari Parker makes me believe that one day I could too play in the NBA.
Simeon legend Jabari Parker
Aladdin 5: Jabari Parker beats the Nets
Jabari Parker is 4 months younger than Giannis
TIL that Jabari Parker is still in the NBA
"our boys playing gritty on D, Tatum looking great on O. Nets missing all the jumpers. Jabari Parker has played a lot more than you might have expected. TimeLord out there wrecking shit. We keep happily switching TT onto Harden and I do not love it"
Durant living the charmed life being guarded by Jabari Parker and Evan Fournier and he is 5-15 sheeeeesh
"Jabari Parker game 7 buzzer beater, book it."
"You mean Jabari ""Six-foot-nine Ray Allen"" Parker and Aaron ""The Young Klay Thompson"" Nesmith?"
He fucking better. He’s being guarded by Jabari “ they don’t pay me to play defense” Parker
I’m here for a Jabari Parker Shaun Livingston-esque career resurgence.
We just played Jabari Parker and Aaron Nesmith significant minutes in a playoff half and are beating the nets. How embarrassing for them
Too bad you can't sign Jabari Parker until the off-season.
Does Jabari Parker have some kind of weird good history defending Durant? Why would Brad leave him out there on that last possession?
Jabari Parker playing crucial minutes. Is he back to being a solid player again?
This is what happens when Jabari Parker gets playing time
Honestly Jabari Parker sometimes looks like he woke up with the ball in his hands and has no idea what’s going on
I wonder what would’ve happened to Giannis in Milwaukee if jabari Parker injury never happened
"Jabari ""they don't pay me to play Defense"" Parker?"
Oh man jabari parker
My Jabari Parker FMVP bet is still in play boys
They really gave Jayson Tatum to a prime Jabari Parker huh
"oh fuck ya!!! I didn't know Jabari Parker was still in the league, glad he's getting quality minutes somewhere"
I swear Brooklyn if you let the motherfucking cock-ass Celtics advance on the back of Jabari Parker...
Jabari Parker dark horse
"Damn KD, Kyrie and Harden, all to lose to Jabari Parker smh"
Jabari Parker currently outscoring all Nets players not named KD
TIL Jabari Parker is still in the NBA
Jabari Parker playing defense is like seeing pigs fly
"So the bench rn is Nesmith, Pritchard, Timelord, and Jabari Parker. Already 9 deep. Celtics in 6."
#Where the hell did Jabari freakin Parker come from!?!?!?#
Dude Jabari Parker is playing good playoff minutes against the Nets. What a world we live in
Lmao Jabari Parker wow
Y’all remember when Jabari Parker was that dude? What if he leads the Celtics to victory lmao
The nets miss TT and Jabari Parker lol
"Jabari parker may be the best player on the team, idk idk"
This is the Jabari Parker game
when the fuck did the celtics get jabari parker
Jabari Parker? I forgot dude existed!
"bro, I thought Jabari Parker was out the league."
Imagine getting torched by Jabari Parker
Jabari Parker?
Wait i didnt know they had jabari parker
Jabari Parker look like that one mfer that’ll give you work at the cookout
&gt;Jabari Parker  God damn I almost forgot about this dude
Lmfao Jabari Parker has a better +/- than all of the nets
Jabari parker defense on Kd Been great. Boston came out swinging
Jabari Parker KD stopper!?!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA IS THAT JABARI PARKER ON KD?
"In an alternate universe, Jabari Parker is Jayson Tatum’s equal."
oh shit thats a jabari parker
I love how there are still people finding out that Jabari Parker is on the Celtics
When did Jabari Parker join the Celtics??
I’m old enough to remember Jabari Parker getting “Next LeBron” hype and believing it.
Forgot the Celtics signed Jabari Parker
"Jabari Parker, wow. Been a minute since I’ve seen this guy on the court."
3 all stars struggling against Jabari Parker and Aaron Nesmith
Jabari Parker is alive?
Jabari Parker is on the Celtics? Lol when did that happen?
"Bagley's career trajectory is looking more like Jabari Parker than Chris Bosh, imo. not great"
"Same with Kobe, klay, Cole Anthony, bol bol, jalen Brunson, nic claxton,Jae crowder, Ed Davis, garland, jeremi grant, Tim Hardaway Jr, al horford, Luke kornet, Wes Mathews, jabari Parker, Kenyon Martin jr, Austen rivers, Sabonis, Gary Trent jr, Wiggins, Winslow etc etc etc etc etc etc etc   LOTS of guys have nba dads, not many are this good. Damn so hateful"
"All the guys I mentioned were top 3 picks. Safe to say they had plenty of hype. Trae technically wasn’t, but Atlanta had the third pick and traded down so I’m still counting that. But yeah I totally forgot Jabari Parker and Fultz were considered franchise changing prospects at one point."
"You're 100% basing that opinion off of hindsight. Players like Wiggins, Jabari Parker, and Fultz to name a few were all looked at as potential game changing talents. Just because they didn't turn out as hyped doesn't mean that those drafts weren't considered to have franchise changers."
Somehow I didn't know the Celtics had Tristan Thompson and Jabari Parker lol
I remember all the hype that him and Jabari Parker generated.  It is nice to see him playing well.
"lol yeah most of bigs pick 2nd ending up bust. bagley(still has chance), jahlil okafor, jabari parker,derick williams, hasheem tabeet, darko milicic name a few."

"2014 was a weird draft class. Wiggins 1st, Jabari Parker 2nd.    Embiid at 3rd, Aaron Gordon 4th and Marcus Smart 6th were the only top ten picks that weren't total busts imo. Remember Dante Exum and Nic Stauskas? Yeah me neither but they sound kind of familiar. Elfrid Payton, to whom I've frequently heard Knicks fans refer as the devil himself, rounds it off at number 10.    Zach Lavine went 13th, and Jokic didnt get taken until the 2nd round. Crazy huh?    CBS sports ranks it as the 5th worst draft class of the last two decades: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-draft-looking-back-and-ranking-the-five-worst-draft-classes-since-2000/"
"Was that Jabari Parker? Wow, forgot about him. How's he doing?"
"When I saw the score-line, I thought the Knicks must've benched their starters for some reason, but no. Romeo Langford and Jabari Parker actually almost took the Knicks the distance, what the fuck happened?"
The Celtics have Jabari Parker???
Jabari Parker????? dude just keeps finding a roster spot doesn’t he
"Jabari Parker had a great year too, only got cut once"
"If they never hit on Tyreke, Boogie, and IT in that two-year span, they probably would have hard tanked in the early 2010's and probably been a much better team in the late 2010's. Though knowing their draft history, they'd probably have taken like Anthony Bennett, Jabari Parker, Jahlil Okafor, and Dragan Bender instead of getting actual good players like KAT/Embiid/BI/Jaylen Brown."
"What's funny is that the process isn't even the reason the sixers were good.   The Sixers lucked into Embiid.   I don't know if y'all remember this, but coming into the draft Embiid was broken goods.   Prior to that College year, all the rave was with Jabari Parker and Andrew Wiggins and Andrew Wiggins even came in late cause he reclassified his high school graduation year.   But prior to that college year Wiggins and parker were the talk of the town but then Embiid came up big during the college year and was hyped as the \#1 Pick. Then a health report came out that Embiid had some knee issue that would be a problem going forward I think it got compared to what Yao Ming had. So his draft stock fell and Sixers went after the opportunity and drafted Embiid \#3.  I don't think Sixers fans were happy at the time due to said Health issue but Embiid was turned out to be the best Player from that draft. So Sixers got lucky with Embiid.   Then they got Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz and we know how that turned out."
Bucks could have had him instead of taking Jabari Parker. He'd be pretty good in an expanded Brook Lopez role
Yes literally yes so many dudes don't fucking care. They show up half ass the regular season and get paid. Fucking Jabari Parker accidently said it out loud.  I hate to tell you this but most dudes in the league aren't basketball junkies they just started playing ball cause they were tall and were told to play.
"&gt;	ACL injuries are nothing these days.  Why do people keep saying this? Can you list the players who had an ACL and came back just as good?    Zach Lavine is the only guy who has had an ACL injury in recent memory that came back just as good (and he was already in the top tier of athleticism). Everyone else I can think of had their career take a turn for the worse — Porzingis, Jabari Parker, Brandon Knight, Rondo, D.Rose, etc. It’s another reason I’m not optimistic about Klay (ACL *and* Achilles? Yikes)."
"&gt;This galaxy brain sub is probably convinced he somehow drastically improved as a coach during this run so they were technically right all along  You see Bill Simmons and a lot of the other NBA ""analyst"" talking heads doing the same thing with Trae Young. All of them talking about him trusting his teammates more and taking less dumb shots when he actually shot the ball a bit worse from the floor this year and managed to be 2nd in the NBA in assists last year playing with 43-year-old Vince Carter and Jabari Parker.  People will literally say anything to not have to admit they were wrong."
I thought Jabari Parker was gonna be insane. He very well could have been tho if the injuries never happened
"&gt; Sounds exactly like Chauncey. I don’t think there’s a better player to relate to them than a player who worked damn hard, was a top glue guy, insanely cool and calm in big situations and was a top player in the league, all while having a super high basketball IQ   Yup, and I think he would be amazing for Marcus Smart. I think he would increase the ratio of how often we get Marcus Smart games as opposed to Marcus Dumb games.   &gt; Tactically I really have no idea how he’d do though  If he's anything like T-Lue, he'll go small a lot and in favor of offense and I'm on board with that.   That would mean a lot of Jabari Parker at the 5 lmao."
"Moses Brown shot 60.2% from shots within the 5 ft from the basket.  To contextualize, here are some other OKC players’ number.  Tony Bradly - 74.4  Kenrich Williams - 65.7  Mike Muscala - 64.4  Jaylen Hoard - 63.3  SGA - 61.2  Svi - 60.6  Isaiah Roby - 60.3  All better than the only 7 footer on the team.  Some Celtics Numbers for more comparison  Jabari Parker - 85  Robert Williams - 78.4  Luke Kornet - 77.8  Tacko Fall - 75  Tatum - 65.9  Brown - 62.9  Semi Ojeleye - 62.9  Romeo Langford - 62.5  Aaron Nesmith - 61.7  Kemba - 61.7  Grant Williams - 61.1"
It’s not even the adams trade imo.   Choosing Hayes over Darius garland is one of the dumbest moves I’ve ever seen come draft night and Ive heard of GMs picking Jabari Parker over embiid.
"Word after 2 years of watching us trot out Jabari Parker, Alex len, Damian Jones 43 year old VC, DeAndre Bemrby, Bruno Fernando and a bunch of rookies I don't want to hear shit about bad supporting casts lol."
"He’s averaged more assists every year. Luka had a better team year 1 and 2 and Trae still averaged more assists. It’s crazy to me team talent suddenly matters for Luka fans. They never mentioned it at all when Trae had 2 rookies, Jabari Parker, and Alex Len as his supporting cast."
"I replied to another person with this but;   Trae Young’s team mates by minutes played with  1.	⁠Hunter - Rookie 2.	⁠Huerter - 21 years old in year 2. Younger than Hunter 3.	⁠Reddish - Rookie 4.	⁠Collins - 22 years old, year 3 5.	⁠Jabari Parker - 24 years old, guy that doesn’t play defence and barley has a role in the league 6.	⁠Damion Jones - 24 years old - 3rd string Center caliber player 7.	⁠DeAndre Bembry - 25 years old, almost no offence. 10th man on most playoff teams 8.	⁠Alex Len - 26 years old. Was cut from the Raptors despite their biggest hole being the 5 9.	⁠Vince Carter - quite literally the oldest player in the history of the NBA this season 10.	⁠Bruno Fernando - Rookie  Trae had probably the worst supporting cast in the league last year."
last year his third scoring option was Jabari Parker..until the trade lol and Atlanta had a 43 year old Vince Carter on the floor with Trae Young sometimes. DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish were rookies and weren't they running DeWayne Dedmon/Alex Len for center? it's almost like..you put a true superstar floor general with a real roster and suddenly things like this start happening. Last years Hawks didn't even play a minute of Clint Capela after the trade
"Trae Young’s team mates by minutes played with  1. Hunter - Rookie  2. Huerter - 21 years old in year 2. Younger than Hunter  3. Reddish - Rookie  4. Collins - 22 years old, year 3  5. Jabari Parker - 24 years old, guy that doesn’t play defence and barley has a role in the league  6. Damion Jones - 24 years old - 3rd string Center caliber player  7. DeAndre Bembry - 25 years old, almost no offence. 10th man on most playoff teams  8. Alex Len - 26 years old. Was cut from the Raptors despite their biggest hole being the 5  9. Vince Carter - quite literally the oldest player in the history of the NBA this season  10. Bruno Fernando - Rookie   It was literally him playing with a bunch of young/inexperienced players and almost no vets. The vets they did have were either guys fighting for roster spots that have been bouncing around teams, and 43 year old Vince Carter."
"Two of the three Mormons in the NBA, Sam Merrill and Elijah Bryant, play for the Bucks, and the third, Jabari Parker, was drafted by the Bucks."
Jabari Parker. But injuries got him.
"Jabari Parker was definitely on the level of those guys in high school (and like early high school too), but it kinda began to fade by the time he entered the draft."
I don’t think any high schooler has ever been hyped up that much. Even other insanely hyped high schoolers like Wiggins and Jabari Parker were nowhere near Lebron level. Guys like Adrian Peterson and Jadeveon Clowney had a ton of hype in high school but still nowhere near Lebron.
"&gt; Zion was the most hyped prospect since LeBron.  &amp; it's not even close really. The only prospects I can think of that were hyped even 25% as much as Zion (since Lebron) are: Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, KD, Michael Beasley, and soon to be Emoni Bates (over hyped imo)"
"Yeah, it struck me how personally hurt he was after Jabari Parker and Malcolm Brogdon left the team in free agency. He viewed those guys as his brothers, even though they probably weren't the missing pieces he needed. He also showed extreme loyalty to Jason Kidd and even Joe Prunty."
"If I was there, I would be doing the exact same thing Jabari Parker was doing"
This was about 5 or 6 games into the season where Giannis went super saiyan and won MIP. Plus Jabari Parker was averaging 20ppg.   Picking the bucks as finalists in 5 years wouldn't have been an unusual pick.
They invited the kitchen sink to the parade. Tony Snell and Jabari Parker even got invitations.
"Jabari Parker was a bust and it really dampened our hopes for a couple years. It also was a bummer how much shade he threw at our city (racists etc) when he never left his million dollar apartment.   To see Giannis embrace our diverse city and get the whole team to love us is just priceless.  Shout out to all the milwaukee greek diners and gyro places!  Gyros east, gyros west, gyro bros, the forum, the stallis palace and so many more!"
Kidd was right about Giannis but jabari parker.
"James harden got injured 40 seconds into your series. Kyrie Irving got injured in game 4. Literally nobody gives a shit if Jabari Parker didn’t get hurt 5 years ago, we’re talking about the present day."
"I appreciate the clarification. But him “leaving money on the table” wasn’t as significant as you make it out to be. He signed for $3.7 Million to play for a championship contender, if he had a $7.4 Million offer on the table from somebody like Sacramento or Minnesota who wouldn’t offer any real team success… *shrugs* well that was a great decision on his end. It paid off. And now it will pay off. But that doesn’t change the fact that he was in this situation in the first place. He was in the same spot Jabari Parker was in when he chose Atlanta. The league didn’t view him as the $20 Million player the Bulls made him. Just like Portis wasn’t viewed as the $15 Million player the Knicks made him. Jabari took the money to showcase his abilities on a bad team. It didn’t work out. Bobby made the right choice, but he is still the same player he was last offseason."
"In this fantasy world where Harden and Kyrie (miraculously because he’s never healthy) are at full strength, do we also get the version of Jabari Parker that didn’t tear his ACL twice? Do we get Brogdon back, seeing as injury issues were half the reason we didn’t want to pay him?"
"I've been a Bucks fan since I was very young and Blue Edwards was considered one of their top players, but I was part of the Bucks drumline since it started in around 2007-2008 up until the last year at the Bradley Center, and I saw and experienced a lot during that time.    The rough years near the bottom of the league, the $100 season tickets, late night rehearsals and playing 21 at the practice facility at the Cousins Center, performing at games and at Summerfest each year, the relative highs and intense underdog hope of ""Fear the Deer"", Jerry Stackhouse singing the national anthem in the playoffs, the awful Bogut elbow injury that derailed an up-and-coming team, Squad 6, Michael Redd doing everything he could to keep Bucks in games, Monta Ellis and the Larry Sanders! experience, the hope of the Jabari Parker draft, Bango doing a moonsault dunk off a giant ladder, performing on the court with Naughty-by-Nature and kicking it with Coolio and Vanilla Ice behind the scenes, the additional hope and curiosity of the Giannis pick, the amazing environment the team and everyone involved contributed to. The funny videos of Giannis eating food at every single media event and marveling, the great videos of Giannis learning how to drive, any everything else.  This feel so great."
"Jabari Parker was drafted by Danny Ferry 2nd in 2014, the year after, but injuries derailed his career.    I guess I'm saying:  The Draft is a crapshoot.  Giannis was picked 99% on potential and fulfilled it, but for every Giannis there's a hundred Bruno Caboclos."
"Congrats Bucks fans.  Since my team currently sucks, it's comforting to know that another non-FA destination team can do it and you've got years of Giannis to maximize.  I'm kind of sad that Coach Bud won't get fired and then end up coaching the Cavs now, but he probably would have had better offers.  On a side note, seems like the new formula for championship success is get close enough, then take a swing.  Raptors traded in their soul for a year of Kawhi, Lakers got Lebron then mortgaged the future for AD.  Bucks draft Giannis, developed Middleton (traded for Brandon Jennings fyi), Mortgaged the future for  Holiday and whatever it had left for PJ Tucker.  Notable for the Bucks is surviving a bust in Jabari Parker as a foundational piece at #2 overall.  Kind of refreshing to have 3 totally different teams in the finals 3 years in a row as well"
Remember Andrew Wiggins vs Jabari Parker?
Jabari Parker crying in the corner
SMH what bout Jabari parker and Larry Sanders smh my head
Real spit tho well done for Milwaukee's scouting department ear marking him as a great. I still can't believe Jabari Parker was meant to be Batman lmao
"Franchise loyalty when the owners and the team does right by its stars. Look at what the Bucks did to get Jrue, discarded Jabari Parker etc... LeBron James was playing with absolute shite by the time he left Cleveland.  Loyalty is commended but only when the team is actually worth being loyal to."
Jabari Parker died for this
I think there are some teams that would've taken Parker. I think Jabari would've been better than Wiggins had he not gotten serious injuries multiple times.
And when you look at that draft it was pretty spotty that high:  1. Wiggins  2. Jabari Parker  3. Embiid  4. Aaron Gordon  5. Exum  6. Marcus Smart  7. Julius Randle  8. Stauskas  9. Vonleh  10. Elfrid Payton  Obviously Embiid is the best choice but I don't fault anybody for not wanting to gamble on him. After that Randle and Smart are the only other two guys really worth a damn and it took Randle awhile. Maybe Gordon with a full training camp and season with Denver. But the rest of it is pretty fucking yikes.  So ending up with Kevin Love and a title was a pretty good return.
"Wagner is expiring and he was 1 of 5 centers on the roster. He's better than Tacko, but at least Tacko has a unique talent of being taller than everyone else on the court. Wagner didn't really have anything special going for him apart from his willingness to draw charges.  I'm sure nobody really expected Kornet to outperform him, but it is still a shame Theis had to die for a player waived a month later. Like yeah it was a salary dump and an opportunity to give more minutes to Rob and TT, but with how well he's playing in Chicago, surely they could've gotten a better return?  Regardless, Jabari Parker isn't what he used to be, but the C's bench absolutely needs someone who can create their own offense."
"Damn   Jabari Parker will try to revitalize his career in Boston.  The 26-year-old forward, who was released by the Sacramento Kings on March 25, has agreed to a two-year deal with the Celtics, according to Shams Charania of Stadium and The Athletic on Friday.  Parker, the No. 2 overall pick by the Milwaukee Bucks in 2014, had a strong start to his career, but things slowed down once he joined the Kings in February 2020. The team utilized his player option to keep him around for 2020-21, but he rarely made it onto the court"
Never thought I'd see Jabari Parker as a Celtic. Hope he can at least bring us some offensive help on the bench.
"jabari ""not moe wagner"" parker"
if you're relying on jabari parker to patch up your bench you might as well start tanking with the rest of us
Jabari “I’m not paid to play d” Parker
Jabari “I’m not paid to play d” Parker
Isaiah Thomas’s career has basically ended. Derrick Rose was in line for a Max then probably a supermax. Amare Staudamire also comes to mind. Then there are high draft picks who got injured like Bynum and Jabari Parker.
"Last decade:  **2020:** James Wiseman (TBC)  **2019:** Ja Morant (potential All Star)  **2018:** Marvin Bagley (bust)  **2017:** Lonzo Ball (solid player but not #2 worthy)  **2016:** Brandon Ingram (All Star)  **2015:** D'Angelo Russell (has been an All Star, injuries have hindered)  **2014:** Jabari Parker (bust)  **2013:** Victor Oladipo (has been an All Star, injuries have hindered)  **2012:** Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (bust)  **2011:** Derrick Williams (bust)"
Jabari Parker
