"McKinley Wright IV, from Colorado. 22 year-old senior point guard, at 6’0” and 196 pounds, he should have the size for the NBA- that’s roughly a Kyle Lowry type build. Wright was a great free throw shooter (84%) on one of the best free-throw shooting teams in the country. He only shot 30% from three, but the good free throw percentage and previous good three point shooting seasons suggest he should be fine in the NBA- even if three point shooting isn’t his bread and butter. He also had an assist to turnover ratio of 6:2, and really cut down on his turnovers this year. For a guy who’s floor seems to be solid backup guard and whose ceiling (IMO) is Grizzlies Mike Conley but slightly worse on defense, he’s getting surprisingly little buzz."
